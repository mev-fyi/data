is your Ledger safe or should you throw it down the toilet ethereum it's got a finality outage is it safe or should you also throw it down the toilet we don't know bankless Nation it is the third Friday in May and it's morning time on Friday or afternoon time or it's not time it is 4 40 p.m all right well it's warning for me David I can't wait to have you on the East Coast but you're still in Montenegro but okay this intro is going long we got something to tell them it's time for the what bank that's Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious and never yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier it's gonna be a long one today so I'm speaking fast all right that's good let's keep let's keep up that pace David topics of the week did we just get rugged by Ledger the hardware wallet or is this just MOB season on Twitter is this Ledger getting canceled that's uh number one what else we covering this week ethereum's non-finality event is non-finality an event did ethereum break or is it working as intended we'll talk about that and more and Gary Gensler continues to be in the hot seat nice uh Bedrock World coin Dogecoin plenty of things to talk about there but bigly most bigly Nike dot swoosh program a program that no one is paying attention to which might be the coolest web 3 metaverse thingy thingy that got released that everyone else is just ignoring because we're busy canceling each other on Twitter that that was it was cancel week for sure maybe some of it Justified though we'll get into uh we'll get into the story definitely the bankless cancel ship was uh was justified a little [ __ ] those guys all right let's uh before we get in let's talk about fuzzing do you want to spend a minute talking about our friends and sponsors over at consensus because they want you to know you should be fuzzing right now if you are not fuzzing David what does this mean what am I talking about uh so consensus has a new diligence tool for all the people who write code so it's an audit grade security tool that serves as an automated way to find code vulnerabilities if you know what fuzzing is then this is for you if you don't know what fuzzing is then this isn't for you uh and so if you are working to write code without having to host your own infrastructure no writing of complex tests blah blah blah blah diligence fuzzing is a system to test your code that is built by consensus so you can layer on additional Security in addition to your regular audit you can also use consensuses diligence fuzzing so this is consensus's message to you go fuzz yourself yourself and your code there's a link in the show notes it's you could fuzz for free too uh it's free fuzzy you can do it by yourself buzzing all by yourself for free can you beat that well let's get to the markets enough with this fuzzing talk David what are the markets telling us this week starting with Bitcoin it's flat 27 300 start of the week end of the week it's flat you did you put the same number twice I'm looking I'm looking at the the agenda here which I print out by the way every week I print out so I can look down on paper 27 300 is the start and you have the current 27 300. those are the same can't be I know those are the same but like really I mean give or take a few dollars but you just rounded it huh you just like it's flat how do you it's that season I don't know I'm just trusting you every week I don't even look at I barely look at this even though the charts are beautiful thank you Kraken Pro for these charts I barely look at this I just hear you tell me numbers each week what is the price 18 20 it was 18 27 days ago it's 18 20 today it's a flat week you know what something suspicious about these numbers you're just copy pasting I think each Bitcoin the ratio uh flat are you serious of course why do we even do markets anymore I don't know okay whatever banquest Nation please open up your price checker apps open up your kraken app on your phone and check the correct price currently because it might not be flat who knows yeah verify this for me don't trust I'm sure this is for most bankless listeners this is the first time they'll be checking prices this week by the way how do they say just wait until we promise people actually listen to the bank list podcasts in order to hear about the crypto prices they don't know the prices until we tell them it's a global source of Truth for that uh we'll tell them the market cap of crypto then while we're at it we're coming in at a whopping 1.18 trillion dollars so I think we are up 60 uh billion dollars from last week marginally up so uh some chick coins got pumped if Bitcoin is done ether and flat but the total game market cap is updated you can't call the rest you can't call everything non-ether and non-bitcoin [ __ ] coins I think I just did I know and I feel like I should cancel you for that foreign flat we're continuing to go up okay what is so this chart is all-time highs how much eat do we have deposited 18 and a half million ether yeah so if you zoom in real close I think this is one of those charts where you can click and drag and it'll automatically zoom in uh and we can get real close 18 18.5 million ether is deposited onto the beacon chain it is going up faster than it has ever gone up before major pretty cool a lot of people were wrong about this they said uh post withdrawals it would be going down and it's not going down it's going well it went down for uh not even two weeks it went on for like 10 days so here's a cool new website I mean actually it's really boring it's actually a very boring website but yeah yeah this is the information yeah there are five boring website I've ever seen yeah so this is ethereum 2.0 validator queue validator hyphen Q hyphen monitoring God I'm not even going to read that there's a link in the show notes it basically tells me it sucks honestly sorry whoever made this website it is basically uh a tug of war between the depositors and the validators and it tells you who is winning that tug of war so pending validators on the entry queue is at 55 000 pending validators 55 000 uh Pentagon if you want to make a new validator it will take you 731 hours to get through that line if you are a validator who would like to exit and stop being a validator it will take you drumroll four minutes four minutes four minutes if I want to leave it only takes four minutes but if I want to get in it's like the the best like uh nightclub ever man yes it's just the line just keeps getting 731 hours to get into the nightclub and four minutes to exit man people really want to be on the beacon chain they totally do wow uh well congrats ethereum for that um all right let's talk about some other market news David I think the big question this week in the markets is where are we in the cycle you just you just kept talking about flat and I feel like that's a pretty good description but um let's start at the highest level what is the Fed doing this week and can the FED actually declare Victory on their interest rate Rises and are we going to stop doing that this is Paul Tudor Jones who is a billionaire investor manages a hedge fund is someone the traditional Finance markets respect on that question here he is on CNBC I want to know what you think about this David here I'm gonna play it I actually want you to react a little bit to this Austin Goolsby uh interviewing some of his comments I'm curious where you think uh interest rates will go should be what do you think I think they've done hiking I'm so glad I don't have his job because listening to these guys try to not say what they really want to say and what they really what do you think he really wants to say he wants to say we're done we've gone too far and enough's enough that's that's what he wants to say he just can't say that because he's knew him he's new on the board and he has to follow the chairman but that's what he wants to say and what do you want to say I think he's right I think they're done you think they are done I'll definitely I think they're done I mean they could probably declare Victory now because if you look at CPI it's been declining 12 straight months 12 straight months that's never happened before in history so there's a strong downward art to inflation at the moment two-year break evens are under two percent clearly they have to be governed by trailing 12-month inflation but if we get to the here and now you can see that inflation to a great extent has been rung out of the market now does that mean that we're getting ready to imminently cut no but you got to think of interest rates a bit like chemo so chemo chemotherapy chemo is poison interest rates with the kind of amount of sector-wide debt that we have between private consumer and the government we're probably at levels where we've typically hit a recession in the past because of the interest tax on the economy so we're at a level right that historically has really slowed the economy and historically has kicked off for a session I think it's just a question of when it goes on David and then he talks about Equity markets and he says this on Equity prices I think they're going to continue to go up this year but I'm not rampantly bullish because I think it'll be a slow grind but he thinks Equity is in the year higher than they began the year so what's your take on all of this is can the FED declare Victory are they done what do you think uh about Paul do Paul Tudor Jones and his takes on this Market well first and foremost Paul Tudor Jones is way smarter than me and way man one so take that take all of my further words with with that um he said CPI is down for 12 months in a row yes and core cpi's not and that is the bigger deal and the more important one and that is such an obvious fact that I'm sure probably Tudor drones has something to say about that response however to say that like oh yeah inflation 12 months in a row it's down like that's not the whole story The the issue also up a lot yeah right and so like the last time I checked uh which was uh not too long ago it was six weeks ago core of CPI has not had not reversed and that is the bigger story that I've thought and so in order to have a more informed take I would need to go back to the course API numbers and compare that to what Paul Tudor Jones is saying but Paul Tudor Jones is like uh smarter than me about this interest to high interest rates as uh as chemo and I I guess that means like debt is like cancer or like uh I don't know stock markets or like melons informed investment poor capitalization is in is cancer yeah that is the cancer you have to cut out of the system anyway the FED is done raising rates now is the message I think you might be right on that corner message but that brings us to the crypto markets and this is uh something we talked about last week David and maybe we want to put more flesh on this because last week a theme was liquidity is dry it's a desert out there because liquidity is drying out in crypto markets um this is ROM who's been a previous guest on the bank list podcast now a couple of times who has some great Insight on this on liquidity and crypto what's he telling us so I believe ROM is actually uh following up with what we were saying last week in the market section uh because in our in our telegram Channel with him he was like hey uh really good points about liquidity which I usually don't hate good take I don't have good takes about Market Natural Markets except that that one I was like okay I think I'm writing my first one and then he comes in and follows up and so here's what he says crypto markets liquidity has dried up significantly these are the consequences of a lack of a crypto bank settlement layer silvergate and signature market makers need a way to settle instantly with counterparties so here's the part that we missed last week uh silvergate and signature had uh s-e-n-sen and Cygnet their interbank instant um settlement layer between banks that market makers would use uh and so in crypto the problem was seemingly solved with sen and Signet a market maker can enjoy instant settlement one benefit is not having to type capital on many exchanges or waiting several days or funds to clear lack of instant settlement hurts Capital efficiency the bank's intermediate these transactions they confirm tractions and validate sufficient funds just like the blockchain and so he's what he's saying is that yes all the reasons that we talked about last week uh are reasons why there's liquidity leaving the market and also the ins this the specific products that these crypto Banks made in order to satisfy crypto market makers called Cygnet and and send and send transfers and so this these specific products are missing now from the market because uh choke point choked them yeah absolutely I mean mean these uh the settlement infrastructure for crypto was operating behind the scenes almost like a private side chain or a private blockchain and it was settling all these transactions yeah um we had ROM on the podcast to talk more about this and uh I would encourage folks to go listen to that if you already haven't about the U.S banking system and the crisis that we've seen recently so this is the part of the market David we've been calling the uh the apathy market we've we've gone from bear Market where that was obvious to bore market right from bear to bore market and this is how Anthony sassano puts it I love how the entire Market has been bleeding non-stop for like a week now and crypto Twitter is pretty much dead silent about it clearest sign I've seen so far that we're now firmly in the time-based capitulation part of the bear Market time-based capitulation that's the part of the bear Market we're in says Anthony what does he mean by that uh he means that now it's boring so uh time-based capitulation so the excitement is over even when like prices are going down and like there's blood on the streets at least it's still exciting uh so what Anthony's saying is like well now like all we've bled all of our blood like we got nothing left to bleed we all the excitement has left the market now now we just have to wait this one out that term capitulation though um he means like people give up in the board Market don't they yeah they capitulate they're like ah it's not moving like it's not going up it's not going it's it's going to go down forever the numbers are the numbers aren't even going down if it was going down it'd be exciting now this is flat they sell and so they sell they capitulate in this type of Market that's the market phase that we're in right now as if On Cue David I just saw this this morning from The Economist here's the headline I read the whole story but it's kind of summarized in the headline the promise of crypto has not lived up to its initial excitement a crypto Finance Revolution looks further off than ever from The Economist these are the types bearish sentiment headline this is the apathy Market headline you're going to see a lot of these in the weeks and the months to come and uh it's up to you if you want to do the time-based capitulation part or you want to hold through this to the other side but I got to tell you man there's nothing new Under the Sun right we've done this a few times now in crypto like I've seen these headlines before so you know what this means to me what the bear Market is half over I I totally agree with you yeah we are now in uh 2019 uh 2018 is over 2019 has started the true convicted people will watch The Innovation happen and learn to be excited about that even if it doesn't mean that prices are going to do anything and they will learn to be excited about that and then the prices will return and then the bear Market or bull market will start and then you actually won't if you were like me you won't know what you're really in for with a full bear Market starting from the low low prices that we're currently at anyways that's how it happened last time happy 2019 everyone happy 2019. it's just 2019 but it's 10x right I remember like uh 2019 Ethan was hanging in the 100 to like 250 one to three hundred over and over and over well what are we right now what is the equivalent right like just you know 10x that a thousand to two thousand that's like a hundred to two like it's so crazy dude it's like it's out of zero the crypto gods are giving us yet another opportunity my friend uh if you're here you probably see it um this is a chart that I do like looking at though total locked value in layer twos this is on Layer Two beat of course this hasn't changed a ton of course we've got arbitrum number one 5.87 billion optimism coming in but look at this activity chart so this is the number of um transactions yo look at that CK think era all right immutable X wow we got that's actually the first time we've seen chains be equivalent to ethereum throughput that's pretty cool yeah immutable X for people who can't see this on screen immutable X number one with a seven day increase of 250 percent and um transaction throughput higher than ethereum mainnet ZK sync up almost 200 as well over the last seven days getting to uh equivalency of ethereum made net transactions per second and if people are like uh I thought layer twos are supposed to be faster than ethereum ethereum layer one is clogged it is as fast as it's ever going to go yeah immutable X ZK sync these are ZK Roll-Ups these are not clogged people's aren't using them enough yeah but we have equivalent amount of usage of these things as ethereum so let's go and then TV if you aggregate it all together which is this red graph in aggregate man we have not been reporting on this like I think the last time we talked about this a scaling factor of combined layer twos was like 2.4 we're up to 3.7 so layer twos are doing 3.7 times as much economic activity it's an all-time high in economic activity on layer twos economic activity in transactions per second not total value nuances but still Yes uh economic activity of transactions yes transaction yeah transaction volume and what was interesting to me is um these are both ZK this is both CK technology not optimistic technology immutable and uh so good news all right we had a lot more to talk about David what's coming up coming up we got to talk about the big news of the week is your Ledger safe or should you throw it down the toilet uh ethereum it's got a finality outage is it safe or should you also throw it down the toilet we don't know Bedrock on optimisms coming to mainnet say hello to drc20s you know what a DRC 20 is right okay I don't know what this is no I don't know yeah well I'm about to tell you so we're gonna get to all of this and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the

up and get access to the stator staking protocol what happened to ethereum last week David after we recorded last week's roll-up there was a hiccup and then there was a second one on the ethereum network what happened to ethereum can you give us the details yeah so ethereum blocks stopped finalizing for about 25 minutes and then the second non-finality event lasted for about an over an hour and so what does finality mean blocks are still processed transactions go into blocks blocks are still sent around but they are not being finalized as in they are not having the last line of security locking those blocks into the chain so blocks are still being added to the chain but they are not being permanently embedded under the full weight of proof of stake yet and so this is um this is an interesting nuance and so we did a show with Preston Van Loon and Terence from Prismatic that will be able to explain this deeper but just at a high level every single validator does out of stations uh and so there was a large amount of attestations due to the increased number of validators because so many new Seekers are coming online there is increased requirements between bandwidth and also computation and so a bunch of attestations are being sent around and that overloaded a number of validators and excuse me a number of clients and so taku and prism release software updates pretty quickly that strengthened and fixed this part and then all of a sudden we were able to return to finality and then we had a unique lesson learned about how ethereum works and a contingency patched and so that's the tldr how would you add to that I think I I think that's a great so it um ethereum didn't go down this wasn't an outage as as we've seen with other networks like Solana which was a straight outage transactions couldn't move forward for like hours at a time in in some cases this was a a temporary halting of finality which is I wouldn't even use the word halting if we wanted to be super precise we did not achieve the finality but nothing was halted right and so um some people were saying that like ethereum broke in this some people including some people can you believe it like because some people even tweeted that out as a headline and then explained it yeah but we're not precise about that um but ethereum didn't break in that sense in fact this is kind of a demonstration of its resilience if you want all the details go to the episode that we just did with with um Preston and Terence but I think this showcases the value of a multi-client architecture for one 100 exactly okay so prism and taku had this problem Lighthouse yes no problems whatsoever so Lighthouse like I don't know of ethereum's working fine for me and I'm doing my thing and so ethereum is going to keep on going because I'm going to put ethereum on my shoulders it's also it also demonstrates kind of the the blend of proof of stake that ethereum is which is kind of the priority of um liveness so ethereum doesn't go it can be delayed but it does not go down in the same way that other chains go down that when they prioritize um safety with proof mistake so David let's take a peek at client diver I didn't know there's an entire page about this but there's not an entire page about everything in ethereum all right so what are we looking at here this looks like uh some charts on distribution of two types of clients consensus clients and execution clients how would you explain this uh yeah okay so two two kinds of clients one is consensus clients AKA Beacon chain clients and then execution which is uh the actual processing of transactions um Nuance there but also really important uh consensus crimes is the beacon chain so we got Lighthouse prism takeu Nimbus lodestar these are what we previously called eth2 clients and so Lighthouse and prism equally have about 38 followed by teku with uh 16 followed by Nimbus and so is prism and taku that had the shared bug and so that's actually one of the unique properties about the a non-finality event when a non-finality event happens you actually know that it is a bug that is shared by multiple clients which is a serious thing and that is why this is an event is because there is one bug that multiple clients had so it showed it showed up in ethereum if this was just one client and if say if it was like Nimbus at 6.5 and Nimbus had a catastrophic client that just broke every single note you wouldn't notice it not only would you not notice it you would still actually get finality because Nimbus is only at 6.5 percent uh at Lighthouse uh if Lighthouse if all Lighthouse clients went down you would not achieve finality because it would get to below 66 uh and so because Lighthouse has 38.2 percent of all nodes in the lighthouse has enough clients that we would get below that 30 uh that two-thirds threshold um and so prism at 37 and taku had this bug but Lighthouse and the other clients held the system up and so this is the importance of client diversity uh and also again why when there's one bug in multiple clients that is when client teams wake up and start fixing the problem immediately which is what Preston and Terence and other people across the client teams did thank you for your service uh and so uh this is just a quick lesson in client diversity and while uh if multiple clients had the bug uh call it a bug uh the rest of the clients kept ethereum up so like think of it like Atlas holding up the world right and every single client is an arm and the strength of the arm is related to the share of nodes that they have how's that for an explanation multiple armed Atlas yeah totally and the cool thing is building a new arm is permissionless so you can always build a new arm because it's you want to build your arm uh no I'd rather talk about people who build arms yeah it seems way harder to actually build arm um this is a take from David Hoffman ethereum in quotes is a composition of diverse and distributed components none of which are individually critical to ethereum components can and will fail but the chain will continue this downtime non-event illustrates this perfectly single client systems are weak and fragile fast systems cannot hold a distributed set of components since more components require slower systems to maintain consensus Fast Change minimize components and therefore maximize fragility I think you are saying here David that this event showcases the design decisions that ethereum has made which is to maximize liveness to maximize resilience to not go down at the sacrifice of some other things right ethereum is not the fastest layer one from the transactions per second perspective it is a slow chain uh tell me more about this yeah so the the slowness of ethereum the decentralized nature of ethereum allows for more components more clients to be a part of the network and the the idea here is that ethereum is designed intentionally designed so that under it components will fail and ethereum will continue because ethereum is not one thing what is ethereum is a question not an answer and so and if you go back to the client the client diversity page like what is ethereum well it's 38 Lighthouse it's 37 prism it's 16 teku and those numbers are in flux and there can be other nodes that come online or other valid uh clients that come online and so ethereum as a system just needs a majority of these things to work and even if a majority of things these things don't work that actually doesn't take down ethereum because it only takes down one component of ethereum which is finality that's only the cherry on top of what makes a blockchain a blockchain and so like these considerations have been deeply considered by the eth researchers out there and so the the actual fact that this happened and ethereum didn't stop and then also naturally recovered quickly along with the help of some Superstar client teams uh it just shows the resiliency of the system at Large this is a question from the bankless Discord from alexrow.eth that I think is relevant here in light of ethereum recently in quotes breaking is this too soon can you explain block reorgs it sounds like a reorg could cause chaos but each block produces susceptible to it for two epochs I believe is this not a huge risk can you explain Block reorgs in the context of this yeah so blockchains are a chain of blocks go one by one by one and sometimes due to the construction of a blockchain we pick a new header and so maybe a two or three blocks are added to the chain and then actually because of the mechanics of the chain it goes backwards like three blocks for whatever reason this happens in Bitcoin every now and then like not too long ago there's like I think like a 10 Bitcoin block reorg if I'm not mistaken maybe not that much but the idea is it's possible and so the joke here is that like everyone was freaking out about ethereum not having finality for like over a little bit over an hour do you know when the last time Bitcoin has had finality Ryan no I don't 13 years ago because Bitcoin doesn't get big Bitcoin doesn't get reality yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't get like deterministic it doesn't get determined it's like economic weight probabilistic personality of course right so like rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain back to these blocks a lot of money is technically possible and within the rules of the Bitcoin system it just costs a lot uh ethereum because of the Innovations of proof of stake achieves finality in six minutes and then if you want to go back words in time more than six minutes it takes you you are probably going to slash two-thirds of all staked ether uh in the event of non-finality this is when there is susceptibility to block reorgs and so that is the risk here that is this is why this is important because we are no longer having our massive wall of capital slashing to protect a reorg event uh and so uh while there are other penalties there's not like the big penalty so it is a risk and this is why like uh when when Preston and others saw that ethereum mainnet wasn't having finality that like they didn't just say oh okay we'll just wait like no they got up and fixed the problem um but that's because ethereum has a culture of Maximum Security uh and so uh yeah the the risk for a reorg doesn't just there's more new and more nuances I think one other thing I would say is sometimes it can sound like without Terence and um Preston waking up or client teams wake up and fixing the problem that ethereum would never have finalized it still would have finalized like that's the point what would have happened is these client this client distribution would have changed a bunch of like client validators were just switched over to Lighthouse right and the network would have rolled on so this is not a case where this was reliant on the client devs to like pop up in the in the middle of their day and like wake up from their like naps the president was literally almost going like for a nap at the time and like fix it it would have resolved itself as well they just restored the resilience back to the network they they did it faster so when Parts in parts of ethereum are not doing their job they get penalized um there's like producing an invalid block and then you get slash and that's the big one but if you're not also doing your job you get penalized in a minor way and the idea is like as soon as and this is actually did start to happen uh when there's and not when there isn't finality for enough amount of time these sources of non-finality start to get penalized marginally and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and then eventually they get penalized so much that the actual the network starts to return to consensus because the people that are producing helping produce finality are not getting penalized and so the system is naturally finding an equilibrium because that is what a good crypto economic system does there's a much better explanation if you just listen to the podcast where it is right here it's right here guys if you want to use this uh apathy Market to level up on your ethereum knowledge it's a good time to do that um David speaking of level UPS Ledger recover all right was this a level up for Ledger or was this a big mistake um the question on people's minds is is ledger safe this week that that is the hardware device that we're talking about and give us the context for this because it all started when Ledger decided to announce a new product called Ledger recover take us there so Ledger introduced a new product called Ledger recover which lets you recover your seed phrase using your ID which for the normies of the world was probably they're like nice great love that that's what I'm used to uh if I'm if my bank account like I can't access it I'll just show them my idea and they let me in that's that's normal for the crypto hardliners out there you understand the risks associated with that that has new risk assumptions that triggered a lot of the crypto and the Shivers up your spine exactly yes right like we don't want nation state IDs to be our recovery process so the way so the way that this works is that you subscribe to this Ledger recover Through The Ledger Live app you go in through the and make an account and then go through the ID verification process on your device after pin verification you will ask what initiates a recover backup process so you ask your own device like that your device has to hey do you want to do this thing and you're like yes um so after you consent to that The Ledger takes your seed phrase that's inside of The Ledger shards it into three encrypts it and then sends it outbound to these three custodians of your sharded private key one is ledger to our uh alternative custodians in different parts of the world and then these are the people that you go show your ID to to in order to get your seed phrase back so it is a way to um if you if you lose your seed phrase use your Ledger your nation state ID can get you your seed phrase back make again make sense to a lot of people uh and so that is kind of this new product that I think will make sense to a lot of people who are not in crypto I think president bankless listeners can understand where uh people started to get concerned the idea here is that people including myself uh were always assumed that your private key cannot leave your Hardware wallet because that's the point uh and so I'll never mind the fact that it's sharded and then encrypted and then sent into three different spots which is probably a very secure way to do this the fact that it can do it at all is new information for a lot of people the idea of software being able to pull out your seed phrase pull out your private keys right it's just like um very concerning because that is the point of a hardware wallet you don't want anyone to be able to pull out those those uh private keys without without you knowing about it and uh so the idea is like okay well if you can do it securely what's stopping you from doing it insecurely uh and so this is like you okay you can chart it encrypt it but you can also just do it in plain text and that is theoretically possible the fact that it's theoretically possible is like the new information so people on Twitter got very upset because this is like a perceived rug by Ledger uh and then also I'm gonna add on that ledger comms was not the most not the greatest about this so here's a tweet that people really didn't like which was technically speaking it is and always has been possible to write firmware that facilitates key extraction you have always trusted Ledger not to deploy firmware whether you knew it or not technically the truth but oof as a PR statement oof well you you say oof but this is the this is the actual truth so so just describing like you have to opt Into The Ledger Recovery Service yeah like of course right right and so um you but and you also have to opt into a new upgrade of The Ledger first firmware right which if you have Ledger a ledger device of any kind you probably have already done not only once but multiple times in the past to get security updates to get new feature unlocks that sort of thing so you have to do that and lastly you actually have to click a button on your Ledger device in person consent anytime a seed phrase or the private keys are actually leaving the hardware wallet so there's kind of like three steps here right and most people will not do the recover service right that's kind of a total trust Ledger thing most people will also want to continue to upgrade their firmware all right but there is this like fallback of unless you physically put in your PIN number in The Ledger interface and click the check mark button it will not send your seed phrase externally from the wallet right I I think that's an important consideration here in this in this this whole kind of mess but and yet still people are uncomfortable with the idea that a firmware upgrade um can maybe put in an errant message or something or could somehow well the idea is that we are now people are now realizing that we are one firmware upgrade away from a key extraction type of firmware that is right in the worst case scenario you just approve any transaction and because it was a malicious firmware upgrade from who knows where that fake transaction the next time you you press the check mark button that you're in your private Keys outbound right so that's that's people thought that that was not possible but it is turns out to be possible and now because we are in MOB season on Twitter uh Ledger has been absolutely mobbed by this and so this is now just talking about like the social drama uh should we go to this tweet David is it this is a video and I actually this this Twitter user has to be blocked so I have to open another which is hilarious hold on oh that is a ledger being hit with a hammer oh oh it's broken wow oh it looks like inside oh oh it's in a fire in a fire pit it's going in a fire pit oh we gotta blow towards oh we got a guy blow toasting a ledger oh that thing is that ledger is uh it's toasty oh that Ledger's dead bye bye seed phrase wow yeah well done on the toast job though yeah okay I get it Ryan we can stop I hope that is are people uh you know doing other things with this this is the only one I saw about it and I actually I saw it LinkedIn Discord or someone like are people like putting it in blenders and running over it with their cars and you know the typical let's go we'll talk about this at the end let's go to the next we have we have to go through the Twitter mob part of this agenda and then we'll go okay all right all right so here's another tweet from uh food bar let's uh let's read this stop using Ledger Hardware wallets migrate away from them immediately they've shown nothing but gross incompetence and wild misunderstanding of their own purpose and now they've publicly admitted intentionally back during their own proprietary Hardware stop using Ledger oh big words intentionally backwards in their proprietary Hardware that's interesting okay okay so these these tweets are in order from most extreme to to more more reasonable so now we're starting to get into the more reasonable side here's Monique Gupta who said leisure has just released a new update for Nano X that allows social recovery of your receipt phrase it encrypts your seat into three charts sends it to different entities and they can reconstruct your seed from your post ID verification it's a horrendous idea do not enable this feature now that is a take that is talking about how you actually have the option to not do this which again I understand is only half the issue but you can you can opt out of this let's go to the last take of this whole series which I think is the most reasonable take which is haseeb which of all the people drawing a big Hub up on Twitter was actually helpful here and so he goes yesterday I freaked out about the Revelation that ledger could spit out your private key with a firmware update yet I noticed the smartest people were not freaking out was I missing something I spent the evening educating myself and now I'm in the never mind it's fine Camp so then he continues and goes my initial mental model is I thought Ledger secure Enclave was like apple secure Enclave a box that has private key lines in which I can only sign things but the keys can never leave the device but it's not firmware can exfiltrate the private key oh God and then he finishes and says this take is actually nonsensical this cannot be how it works because Ledger's upgrade most people's instincts are like wait why even I don't want my Hardware to wallet to ever upgrade but ledgers upgrade to support evolving blockchains ethereum now requires BLS signatures there's Solana near Aptos all this new stuff new signing algorithms new key derivations all these fanciness aside from Bitcoin every single blockchain evolves and so the point here is that these secure Enclave in your Ledger has always actually been software it is a hardware wallet but there is software inside that secure enclave and the point that you said earlier that everything actually doesn't necessarily fall back to The Ledger Hardware wallet but it does fall back to you pressing approve that is the actual remaining part of The Ledger that is the hardware of you hitting that approve button not the secure Enclave itself and so this is the new reality that by the way has always been the reality and if we as an industry were more informed about this there wouldn't be this that's the security posture that's the security posture you've always accepted when you've purchased alleged device to hold your private keys and some people are just now aware of that right yes and so uh is this where we get into our takes okay are we are we ready for uh so this has been like the us doing a trying to do an objective drop of reporting it I'm ready to give it yeah and I will say uh we we talked to you um Charles the chief security officer on bankless um I think uh if you're interested in hearing from at least The Ledger side how this works and what went on you can listen to that uh episode we um tried to be as objective as possible but I think people come to the roll-up for uh for some takes too yeah and I would be interested in hearing your takes what are your takes on this episode David my takes are Ledger did nothing wrong um it was the crypto Industries Collective misunderstanding as to how a hardware wallet works here here's all of the blame that I will place on Ledger there is the narrative and the marketing that your private key cannot leave your Hardware wallet and there's two different ways to interpret that there's it can't leave the hardware wallet because the firmware up to this point has not allowed it and then there's the it can't leave the hardware wallet because the hardware doesn't allow it maybe Ledger benefited by that gray area and meant the software version but but got the benefits of the hardware version maybe that's the risk and that has been their comms mishap for years now of advertising maybe being able to double dip and say like the hardware wallet will not allow your private keys to leave the wallet but not saying that that's because of the software the firmware that we upgrade and so maybe that that is there was that is there it wasn't clear that's the that's their bad but uh Ledger is frustrated because they've been here in crypto helping people go bankless this entire time and now Ledger Ledger is being canceled from what appears for them to be like no good reason like you guys install firmware updates there's the trust model is completely the same as it's always been and y'all are just like learning about this for the first time and so I think that coming to that conclusion has actually not been that hard and so now my final take Ryan is I am actually disappointed in the people of taking the opportunity to jump into mob mentality about this and cancel culture so quickly and make viral videos of them smashing their ledgers with a hammer and a blowtorch just because they know they're going to get a bunch of likes because it is currently in Vogue to cancel ledger so that is my set of takes cheese that take is going to be pretty damn unpopular this week David I think I think we've already had a mob mentality is coming after me next to us come at me that's what I believe Legend did nothing wrong I think that um you say nothing wrong is your summary and yet you also said they did something wrong they could have done something better all right but I understand this is where I come down on things and um I think I largely agree with what you said but I want to put a fine uh point on on what you said so this is this is also from football this is a tweet from Ledger from November 15 2022. hi from Ledger The Ledger account your private Keys Never Leave the secure element chip which has never been hacked the secure element is third party certified and is the same technology as used in passports and credit cards a firmware update cannot extract the private keys from the secure element a firmware update cannot extract the private keys from the secure it okay here's what I'm saying David I think that is technically true from what I understand unless you hit the approve button okay yes so you could read this tweet and be like yes however by not making it emphatically clear that you are still a nefarious firmware firmware update from Ledger away from Ledger you're trusting them to not snatch your private keys I think that there's a little bit of an Omission there or at least a little bit of a communication mishap so that's what I'll say the other thing I'll say David is I actually think this could have happened no matter what they did from the com side of things right it was just the time in the universe where we decided to take a week and completely torch uh Ledger all right it's like I get that now what they can do in terms of moving the industry forward is they can choose to open source their firmware elements of their firmware so let's take this yes the uh the reaction was probably extreme yes there's a lot of people who who didn't know uh yes this was Ledger's misunderstanding in their target market and like well you just pissed off your core like like group through this comms yes all of those things and now what how do we move forward I would be supportive and Colin ledger to open source as much of their firmware as possible or to explain if there's pieces why they can't open source it explain why I think that could be the path forward because that's the best that that we can really do so what do I plan to do here I'm not like going and torching my you know any Ledger device I own I plan to continue to use it but I've also always had redundancy different setups like don't just depend on one provider have Ledger get a treasure if you want grid plus is a fantastic Hardware wallet um we've had them on the podcast before and I think they do a fantastic job on this still even with grid David you're still one firmware update from being screwed by grid plus all right but if we have redundancy here um one thing that grid plus I believe is doing is open sourcing moving to open source more of their firmware in Q3 I think that's a positive step it's good pressure in the industry to do it I also think let's zoom out big picture Okay seed phrases do kind of suck they kind of suck and Ledger was trying to make that less sucky for normies that is a noble effort we want more people on the bankless journey uh we don't just want to be like the crypto gold bugs here and so we got smart contract wallets we have MPC technology that to me is the way for it so I also think that Ledger made some mistakes but I agree with you it's not like I don't know why we're choosing this week to cancel ledger so hard like just learn from it and then use whatever security posture you prefer for your private Keys I've gotta I gotta take for you Ryan and it actually ties these two stories together these two stories being ethereum's clients multi-client design philosophy and nose is safe and so Martin koppelman says whatever wallet you are using that actually holds your keys it's never a bad idea to use at least two different ones and combine them into a safe and so I retweet this and I say this is the same philosophy as ethereum's multi-client design strategy if one client fails you have redundancy with orthogonal Alternatives the overlapping risk space of multiple strategies becomes minuscule okay so so you've got a ledger you got a A lattice a grid plus lattice until you also have a metamask and you do a two of three and if Ledger rugs you it doesn't matter because you need grid plus and metamask to access your gnosis safe say metamask rugs well you got your grid plus like two of three and so this is the same security philosophy that is how ethereum multi-client design works but since we have Smart contracts and multi-cigs which is a completely different realm we actually can completely mitigate any risk whatsoever so once again solved by smart contracts I agree and that's just a very sensible reaction security posture I will say though oh wait I shouldn't burn my my ledgers no you shouldn't but but even in that David like smart contract risk on the safe wall do you know what I mean like but you're not gonna get that address again we're going west and the crypto is risky and then we're on the frontier at this point right come on yep yep uh I think that the moment I'll start to get concerned about this is if I hear of a firmware update that's been pushed and someone gets maliciously hacked right yes so far more updates first I always let other people go first that's a great celebrities do it let others go first yeah let others go first right um all right enough of that so let's get to uh the SEC this week and more grilling of Gary Gensler I guess this is big though absolutely massive this happened late last week um the U.S Chamber of Commerce has just filed a brief in the coinbase versus SEC case calling out the SEC for acting unlawfully in the digital asset space this is the US us Chamber of Commerce not the Chamber of digital Commerce the U.S Chamber of Commerce represents all U.S businesses in the United States they have a massive presence in D.C metal Lawman says this is a big deal he says the U.S Chamber is highly influential and they represent companies across all Industries not just the US and the brief opens with this as it stands today nobody knows for certain which digital assets if any are securities under federal law could not have put it better ourselves on a weekly roll-up I think this is a big vote of confidence for coinbase in what they're asking for from the SEC it continues and makes three big points regulatory uncertainty it's killing innovation in the US the SEC is destabilizing the digital assets regulatory environment and the SEC is violating constitutional due process and fair notice rights basically the chamber is declaring the SEC actions are not just harmful policy they are unlawful they're not just bad they're illegal which is great the court will give these arguments Advanced by the U.S Chamber of common serious attention uh and like Brian said this is the largest most influential business organization in the U.S has just declared that it stands with crypto represents the interest of more than 3 million businesses and organizations throughout the country from small businesses to Global corporations dope I love that these are great if you see so so David this this uh same week the SEC just responded to coinbase's petition and you recall that that petition we were talking about a week or two ago where coinbase was asking the court to require the SEC to respond just yes or no yes yes sir simple yes or no to whether it will undertake rulemaking for our industry that's all they had to do was respond yes or no you know what they responded with David uh oh boy you really tell me 36 pages of legalese I skim this it just amounts to we don't have to if we don't want to that's my non-legal summary of this thing this is what Paul graywall a chief of legal at coinbase said today the sec's responded to coinbase's reticent uh petition asking the court to require sec to respond just yes or no the sec's answer of resounding Maybe uh resounding go [ __ ] yourself basically sorry if that's what they said so David maybe that was why Gary Gensler was so defensive this week when asked at a financial conference whether the SEC has provided sufficient Clarity to crypto here's what he said okay can you comment it all on the dispute with coinbase about rules on crypto and why doesn't the SEC want to publish rules for that market because Tom the rules have already been published and to make it quite uh direct this is a field that is been operating largely non-compliant uh our agency is uh put out rules about what it is to be in exchange what it is means to be a broker dealer what it is means to be an advisor or custody assets and how to register a Securities offering those rules are in existence and there's nothing about the a new technology that makes it non uh he goes on I'm sick of hearing this but basically Gary I've heard this before those are already clear right and again on the back of this he's doubling down on that well the Chamber of Commerce said that he's being illegal by doing that I like that he's in this situation right now David yeah so here's miles Jennings from a16z lawyer lawyer at accz sec come in and register coinbase we'd like to register SEC you're not allowed coinbase why not SEC the rules are clear coinbase the rules don't make sense as you see the rules of the rules can they be adapted yes but we don't like your industry but you've adapted rules before no we haven't you approved our IPO no we didn't yes you did we're going to sue you for what what do you like to know yes too bad you should have registered but we would like to register I bet you do can you tell us how no that is exactly what happened wow that's a really long tweet good for him yeah that's really good though all right David what do we have coming up next meanwhile while crypto's eating itself and Gary gensler's Hot Seat gets even hotter Nike has built the most legit web 3 metaverse platform ever World coins come into optimism Sam Altman testified before Congress and urged with a lot of maker makers to regulate AI Bitcoin or Dogecoin it's the same picture so much to talk about but first I want me to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask who's helping you learn about all the jargon that Ryan and I don't have time to explain on the podcast sorry about it but if you want to go learn all that jargon there's a link in the show now so go check out metamask learn learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web 3. mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 Network built differently from the other layer or twos you may be familiar with mantle is a modular layer tool built on the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80 compared to other layer tubes but it also reduces gas feed volatility mantle has a decentralized sequencer set eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network and because mantle implements multi-party computation nodes layer 1 settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two mantle is the first layer 2 built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest Dow treasuries in the world bit Dao mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of mantle like game 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dao for the world of DSi and buy bit for tvl liquidity and on-ramps check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle Nike's dot swoosh platform is a brand new platform that Nike is rolling out to Consumers not not for us this is not for us so don't judge it because it's not for us and if you are not a Nike Knight if you're not a sneaker head this might not be for you but it's a DOT swoosh platform kind of I think it's I think it's an allusion to dot eth but dot swoosh is the home of Nike virtual creations and Community hub for DOT swoosh members so they are creating like kind of like loot boxes boxes of merch virtual merch so they have their of1 our Force instead of Air Force you know Air Force Ones but our fourth one so of1 collection of Nike virtual Creations inside of an of one box so of1 create collection starts with each of1 box comes in two forms classic remix or New Wave classic remix boxes contains an Air Force One inspired by Air Force One collections from 1982 to 2006. again these are nfts or these are these are nfts these are well I mean these are digital Collectibles actually yes virtual though virtual we're not sending a box with speakers in my house but I think if if you are a sneaker head who's collecting Air Force Ones from 1982 to 2006 you know exactly what they're talking about the new wave box features a brand new Next Generation reaching Air Force One that takes inspiration from 2007 to the present and even into the future scattered across both boxes are co-created Air Force Ones from our year your fourth one winners these are all so this is like a digital scavenger hunt collection for sneaker heads who like to collect and that not only that but they have a swoosh ID which secures your place in the dot swoosh Community where you can meet members collect virtual collections get exclusive access to physical and and virtual Reflections and then you can also co-create with Nike uh and so the what are collections they are sneakers apparel accessories other Collectibles that you can use in games or other immersive experiences some Nike virtual Creations will unlock benefits for you and they physical world such as in real life products and exclusive events wow okay so no mention of an nft though yeah which is kind of cool and so you get a wall you will get a wallet they won't call it a wallet you will have your wallet custody by bitco which is fine for this use case don't cancel Nike Jesus uh and the thing is like you will buy these things with a credit card and you will buy digital assets with a credit card guess on what blockchain Ryan hmm it's not going to be on ethereum I know this prices are too high for this use case tell me polygon on the polygon blockchain where else would it be I mean they're getting the the big ones it could have been slow it could have been flow when I was looking at this I was like oh is this going to be flow well there you go so and the good news about polygon is of course it has a future direction to become an ethereum layer too as well and you can you can take that asset and put it back on ethereum if you want to speaking of layer twos David what's happening in the optimism ecosystem optimism is getting its Bedrock update so Bedrock is coming down on June 6th oh that's D-Day never mind an upgrade that will require two to four hours of downtime for op magnet once upon a time I was a World War II history buff uh okay so uh Bedrock will bring a 50 reduction in protocol fees so uh optimism fees are getting cut in half it's also going to make it easier to contribute to client diversity so the op stack it in an upgrade uh improve the security and resilience of the Omi op mainnet Bridge uh will increase the minimum diff between it op mainna and ethereum that ethereum equivalents that we know and love and also sets the stage for the super chain to enable more and more op chains so that world that super chain that all those OP chains every time you hear the world hey this is an OP chain or built on the op stack it helps that thing become a little bit more composed so this is the first major protocol to optimism to be voted on and approved by optimism's uh token house interestingly this will require two to four hours of downtime for op mainnet which is actually I think I haven't seen that before for Layer Two actually going down to start back up again I'm sure that's going to cause some drama when that day comes and zooming out this is plenty of speaking about I think ethereum's modular scalability strategy a standard chain one like ethereum that's 1X a fast chain I would assume that's a monolithic chain like a Solana 10x fractal scaling 10 000 X this is why fast chains have only offered variations on the apps described nine years ago in ethereum white paper to explore the next Frontier at scale on-chain games we need fractal scaling with thousands of chains this is kind of alluding to what optimism is doing with with bedrock and the idea of a layer 3 types of chains yeah yeah I think the whole idea of like Hey we're going to scale by juicing up our monolithic chain in the future that will just be an anachronism as in it'll just be like hey remember when like the crypto industry tried to scale with layer one change that reduced like eventually we're watching layer twos get faster we're watch watching the super chain gets composed and so the super chain fractal scaling hyper scaling these are all the same terms all the same thing yeah and so like we're gonna watch and it's just gonna blow people's minds about how fast these things can actually get it's just gonna take some more time to get there David how come we've never talked about this I didn't know you were a World War II buff man oh yeah oh yeah yeah so am I yeah oh I know I have read so many freaking books what's your favorite World War II book uh there's a book uh called D-Day um yeah I remember that one it's been a while it's it's been like 10 years since I've been sort of like deep into it um uh mine is history History Podcast you down if you like a World War II history you do a History Podcast I'll do I'll do a food podcast really great all right uh tell me about world coin what are they doing uh it's coming with optimism main net so actually not an OP stack although I think they have uh Express plans to make an OP sack in the future for now what do you mean by that they're using optimism uh optimism code World coin yes uh and so they will use the op mainnet for World coin the coin uh I think there also might use it for World ID uh eventually uh I did a we did a podcast I did a podcast actually you weren't there with um Sam Altman and Alex blania from worldcoin about the world coin Vision um I'm seeing a lot of world coin shatter start to heat up so I think this is going to be um a reoccurring conversation throughout the Twitter sphere uh eventually they will have their own op stack chain for now they are putting their infrastructure on op mainnet more Sam Altman in this agenda too um before we get there though Lido they just released withdrawals I believe that's right Lido V2 enabled withdrawals a bunch of other upgrades as well along with a router I couldn't find very many stats I think there were some big withdrawals from Lido but that's what you would expect and they were very temporary and very short-lived the tug of war in the side of the meta cause the smaller microcosm of Lido is TBD um I think lotto's gonna be doing just fine you know what's really cool too is uh the increasing amount of PayPal and venmo support at least in the US for uh crypto this is integration of PayPal and metamask where you can just buy in metamask in your metamask wallet you can just buy crypto using PayPal so you select PayPal you choose the amounts you tap it and you've just purchased some eth and this is also cool you can also buy and send crypto from PayPal so you buy your crypto and PayPal and then send it to metamask this is very big this goes into the D5 mullet thesis that we've been talking about so long which is like man uh Millions hundreds of millions of users of venmo and PayPal across the world and all of them now have a way to onboard directly to a bankless wallet in something like metamask I just think that is absolutely massive and worth celebrating by the way I think we're in touch with their team yeah we're talking PayPal Venom today about a future podcast episode yeah we want to see what they're up to the podcast episode is going to be so so easy like hey what's your guys's defy mullet look like yeah do you think they're gonna understand that question well that'll be the screener they don't come on the podcast unless they understand okay so here's something that happened pretty cool this is a tweet from Zack xbt uh he tweeted out wow both pump and dump mean coins nian meme coin and grumping Cat coin were sentences and desist letters on chain so I sit a cease and desist letter was turned into a JPEG an nft and sent them to the to the uh to the deployer address for these pump and dump coins from law firms uh does that work does that work can does that count as a cease and desist letter I don't know have you received that letter if it's on chain and posted I I don't it's on it's on the blockchain bro they do call it a wallet I mean I send it to your wallet I send it to your like address I send it is this legally valid it's in your custody if well yeah everything I get spam tokens sent to me all the all the time doesn't mean I look at those there's a difference between like no one tweets at me about my spam tokens they definitely got tweeted about this because this is what the street is if I put assistance assist in your mailbox and I leave it in your mailbox but you never open your mailbox have you received it or not um that's a big I think it's equivalent so this the season to Sister starts with May 17 2023 Kia Carmen attorney at law to the persons with wallet addresses listed below and all collectors attention zero xdae 2d95 blah blah blah blah so like attention wallet owner say hello to DRC 20s tokens on Dogecoin so Dogecoin daily transaction volume climbed to a lifetime Peak after the launch of drc20 token standard a new mechanism that allows the issuance of tokens on the Dogecoin blockchain 650 000 transactions on Dogecoin on Sunday briefly Crossing both Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions um before following back down uh and so Ryan this is hilarious because the next part of this story is a bunch of Doge fundamentalists not being happy no yes there are Doge max ballists out there yeah so so not despite this increased uh uses of Dogecoin people in the Dogecoin Community have said that this has led to network congestion that moves away dogecoin's aim of being youth is an everyday currency the drc20 Dogecoin Community should stop this Shameless hype Rogue one Dogecoin Community member on Twitter everyone should probably focus on the transactional currency use case at another high fees and network congestion are valid concerns for any blockchain and that may lead the network to becoming expensive slow and for everyday users damping adoption plans does this sound familiar Ryan oh my God that's amazing are these people serious though I thought I thought Dutch coin was always a parody is this actually a serious crypto tribe I don't know how to answer that question and why DRC 20s I mean maybe the better question is why not of course there were going to be DRC 20s so we have an ordinals on top of Doge and now we have two camps inside of Doge who's like get your stupid pumping them tokens out of my extremely serious and legitimate Global occurrence let's see the Will Smith slap to the face right there um we saw this coming right yep uh my summary of This Is We did an episode on it with a bunch of panelists who know a lot more about it than than you and I do it's a B minus they say and here's the take from one of the panelists that I'll quote the EU never knows when to stop this is the big butt part it's like we got some good b-minus legislation that's good but the EU never knows when to stop Micah may be a B minus but the amlr and data act and DACA is with the council all are bad for crypto and there's even more coming after that so any before anyone throws up we're moving to Europe party they need to consider that things never get better in the EU the regulation only gets heavier so that is the fear on the back of this and before you start celebrating let's all move to Europe um because it's better than the US it is right now the US doesn't have any Clarity on crypto uh just look in the pipeline of other things that might be coming down because I don't think the EU is done that's the uh what's the opposite of a silver lining it's the opposite of a silver lining all right lead lining yeah lead lining um speaking of lead Linings do Quan is set to be released after Montenegro Court accepts a 436k bale in local press dokwan's getting out David yeah you guys gonna hang yeah so I'm not too far away uh from from Montana so the capital of uh Montenegro pod goriza God that's taking me forever to learn how to pronounce uh is where he is that is about an hour away from where I am so under conditions of Bale Quan and Terra executive Han John will be under surveillance and prohibited from leaving their apartment um he's setting up the interview would you interview him would you talk to him all right I tried to interview him just be like why'd you do this like how is it better is that the question that would lead with characters like I think my first question is do you feel guilt do you feel guilt yeah are you sorry um yeah you're sorry but maybe that's maybe that's too moralistic maybe she's just like in order to get him to open up you have to like have the question of like reflect on the last year and just leave it so open-ended right yeah what do you want people to peek Inside the Mind what do you want people to hear yeah because you yeah you can't Corner him he's already cornered um yeah anyway that's not gonna happen but let's talk about uh regulation of a different type that we don't usually talk about but while they're talking about crypto regulation in the U.S really AI regulation is heating up so what happened this week so Sam Altman had to testify before Congress and so we've seen this before we've seen web 2 employees we've seen Zuckerberg we've seen the SPF testify for congress uh Sam Altman's turn uh and so uh he actually urged lawmakers to regulate AI in specific ways so he testified before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy technology and the law the hearing touch on the risks that generative AI could pose to society how it could affect the jobs markets and why regulations from governments might be needed there was a useful clip I think that we should play and last I don't know if I'm allowed to do this but I will note that Sam's worst fear I do not think is employment and he never told us what his worst fear actually is and I think it's germane to find out my worst fear are that we cause significant we the field the technology the industry caused significant harm to the world uh I think that could happen in a lot of different ways it's why we started the company it's big part of why I'm here today and why we've been here in the past and we've been able to spend some time with you I think if this technology goes wrong it can go quite wrong and we want to be vocal about that we want to work with the government to prevent that from happening but we we try to be very clear-eyed about what the downside case is and the work that we have to do to mitigate that interesting response Sam Altman of course he is the CEO of open aai that the creators of chat gbt what's your take on that response so I did a podcast with him on last Sunday so six days ago about world coin so different subject um prior to this I really I think I had an internal bias I'm I'm very aware of my biases I like to say um I had an internal bias if I really wanted to not like Sam Altman um why just um like kind of reptile Tech bro reptiles a little bit of that a little bit of uh we came out of the Eleazar uh podcast being like oh man this is going to take us over over the world and then it's irresponsible for other CEOs of AI companies who are falling victim to the moloch Trap who are who are accelerating this thing so they are being irresponsible um and so and then like I listened to him answer Lex Friedman's question about AI alignment and I thought that he just man he just deflected the hell out of that one uh he asked he asked uh questions in return it was like well what do you think yeah it's like until I'm like man Sam uh bro look what's about to happen here and that and lately I have seen him um in addition to the podcast and kind of seeing the human there uh I think I've seen him to tackle this alignment problem head on and I think the CEO leaders of these AI companies are also going to be the very likely solvers of AI alignment if anyone and so I think I'm cautiously optimistic that Sam Altman is not just a good guy but a potential God I hate to say this word hero in the fight of AI alignment I'm that is my optimistic Rosy colored glasses scenario plenty of other scenarios can play out but I am hoping the best in Sam Altman and I'm starting to be okay with depositing um some trust there I think his name will be um front and center will become a household name if it if it hasn't already that's how important this is I uh it always makes me uncomfortable David to be put in the situation of having to trust Heroes and having to trust people I will say that and I think it's probably the case that we may never know what Sam Altman's uh intentions actually are yeah we'll have to judge it by his actions I mean there is a more nefarious like case you could make which is just um yeah I'm going to put on this face in front of Congress and Regulators say come in and regulate me in order to like establish and entrench my own sort of power so I can help shape the regulations like um there's like remember SBF was doing a little bit of this do you know what I mean you just don't really know is the thing and I and he could be an incredible person I have no idea he could also be an SPF we also have no idea and it's just that we have to trust but I don't think we do I think we need need to find ways to sort of verify and find other ways rather than relying on human beings in this ecosystem kind of put AI in the right direction but interesting nonetheless more to come I'm sure on that David what do we got coming up next coming up next we've got questions from the nation we got three of them this week I think there's some great questions uh and then some pictures we're going to look at some pictures because that is going to be some both some takes of the weeks and uh what Ryan and I are excited about and there is also a Moment of Zen for the YouTube people it is a video only moment then it is the most impressive of AI artificial generation of image video oh my God it's so cool you gotta go watch it because it's actually really related to what Sam Owen was testifying about anyways all of that's coming up and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible hiring people worldwide paying them in crypto providing them access to benefits it all so complex

builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to Arbitron Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free questions from the nation this week this one from thebig salad dot Eve man I love that ens handle uh would it be possible for ethereum to use Mev as partial gas refund to users would that be possible David so not only is that possible but that is an explicit strategy that a number of startups are going after right now uh actually this is one of the benefits that I think the bank loose interest has because uh we actually get to learn more about what's going on in the frontier and be educated about the frontier and be able to relay that information here on the podcast there is a very decently saturated Market of people that are trying to connect the circuit between transaction origination and Mev back to transaction origination so like transaction from the wallet if you do a defy thing it gets picks up by an Mev Searcher bot which makes another transaction which goes into a bundler bot which goes into a block Builder which goes into a block proposer AKA eth validator who ultimately connects the Mev but then there's a possible way where wallets who ultimately are The Originators of transactions aka the source of Mev can be paid for their deal deal order flow which we generally think of as toxic but if that deal order payment for deal order flow goes back to the transactors for transacting in the wallet there is a way where we can connect Mev to people who are making transactions as yes a gas free fund so if your transaction produces Mev your wallet might pay for that in some particular way and so that is a thing that is being built by a handful of startups in this world uh you know how when you use a credit card you get like Points Hotel points or discounts back it's same same except this could be even better yeah also it could be eth but they're yes there could be all sorts of different uh models on top of this that while it's built and uh the the cool thing is crypto can pay you to spend and to transfer to use crypto transactions I think that's definitely coming all right here's a second question here about Bitcoin Bitcoin has a history of legitimate and illegitimate hard Forks most important being Bitcoin cash well we remember that whose Central Point was the Network's block size Bitcoin won that fight versus Bitcoin cash based on choosing decentralizations the North Star keeping one megabyte block size the question is if a hard Fork is on the menu and thinking that bitcoin's North Star is decentralization which option is objectively more decentralized a chain with or without ordinals so I guess this is the idea David a questioning of whether Bitcoin might Fork into two different options one chain with ordinals and one chain without ordinals and the questioner is asking which is objectively more decentralized can you imagine this feature and help us make sense of this question from Abram CR yeah so my air podcast with Eric Wall who actually is coming out next week with nicario actually so we're actually going to talk about some of these things Eric will on the card next week I'm excited about that one uh he made a very strong argument which I'm on board with that the originals blockchain is the more decentralized blockchain um but I kind of want to ask answer a slightly different question um which is is Bitcoin going to Fork because there is going there's a growing Civil War happening a growing division in the tribes of Bitcoin there's you have the non-ordinals and ordinolers and then the ordinolers uh and so uh that is a new tribe the new internal tribes of Bitcoin and now they are fighting for power and the last time this happened was the Bitcoin cash first Bitcoin camp and so does this create a division strong enough to fight over a fork of Bitcoin my answer to that is I don't think so I think this this is fighting over Social Power who is at the helm of this ship can't really steal the ship because it's Bitcoin but it's who who is the bigger bitcoiner and who who are the bigger bitcoiners who are the bigger better bitcoiners and right now like um Bitcoin media which runs the Bitcoin 2023 conference which is going on right now that that company that's actually it's actually more or less the bank list of of or yeah the blank list of Bitcoin they are similar in Vibe uh very very thesis driven perhaps very biased I would call them very biased they are the Bitcoin fundamentalists of the Bitcoin Camp uh and they are starting to make ordinals content uh in the same way that you and I enjoy smart contracts and tokens because they are interesting and they're good to make content about and therefore benefits the bankless business model because our business model's content Bitcoin media is also finding ordinals as a way to produce content because it's interesting and gets reads and clicks and likes and all that kind of stuff and also all of the people that I know and trust like ericwell and Nick Carter are also like Originals good and so I think that's gonna win David that's going to win in the social air is my prediction 100 it's more like people like ponzis we saw this in Bitcoin last week and so I think the power the pendulum power has shifted towards the ordinal people yeah but you know what they're gonna want David they're really going to want those ponzies to um prop up their bags because anything bitcoiners like is like number go up for Bitcoin that's funny is because that's a mechanism that ethereum has that Bitcoin just doesn't which is like okay you have a Ponzi that's sort of annoying because it's making my transaction fees high but then we go and we look at ultrasound.money and we're like oh look at all the youth that was burnt and then etholders are happy again well Bitcoin ordinals maybe call them rather than small blockers maybe they're just useful blocks his smart blockers there we got his small blockers versus smart blockers the smart blockers of the the Bitcoin Community don't get that benefit like sorry it's just not as fulfilling I guess if you want number to go up on things but it does pay for security which is I mean marginally but non-zero the public good yeah okay yeah all right let's get to some takes David here's the first one from you this looks like a picture and I think you're wearing the T-shirt tell me about this yeah oh I haven't talked about this yet I'm gonna look at the T-shirt I got a t-shirt David shirt tornado cash symbol I helped violate International sanctions and all I got was this lousy t-shirt okay so this this t-shirt is nothing new Under the Sun for the people that are inside of the conference circuit uh but I haven't gotten one yet and I would like to say not only have I violated International sanctions by receiving point one ether from the dusting attack I also sued the Department of Treasury over it and so this this t-shirt fits it fits well yeah um it's gonna be wearing that to the Congressional hearing or I guess that's the Supreme Court case yeah um and so like Amin solimani who like made this t-shirt uh gave me this t-shirt and so I thought I thought like oh of course I'm going to take a picture with amine but then I was reflecting on this picture and um some people have probably mentioned me mentioned I mean so money I mentioned him on a handful of podcasts but I wrote this longer tweet which I think I kind of solidifies what this picture means to me and so I say this might look like a picture but to me it's so much more uh amine has been a personal hero and mentor to me throughout my ethereum journey without a mean ethereum would be all rainbows and unicorns but no claws or teeth Amin taught me the importance of thinking adversarially what's at stake and what's at stake if we do not think that way he was also my first big guest on my podcast before Bank list POV crypto back when I was absolutely no one and I follow up and say I would not have the balls to sue the Department of Treasury without the knowledge and Leadership that I mean has shown this in this industry so thank you I mean for the lousy t-shirt yeah that's really cool David yeah it's uh heroes in real life here um here's here's a take from Xerox designer onboarding the next billion users with words how the term wallet is psychologically limiting web 3's growth potential the case for abandoning it killing the idea of wallet David rather than connect wallet just connect uh I don't know if I totally agree with it but Xerox designer bringing up some interesting points that maybe the thing we should be calling this thing the mental model we should be using is like more like an account um because sure it's a wallet in some cases but usually when we're talking about Finance right sometimes if you go to the social case it's a profile or it's an identity if you go on the art case not really stuffing an art piece in your wallet are you it's more like adding it to your collection if you're in the gaming world this account is actually like inventory if you're music it's library and so maybe we should start reframing this away from wallets and making it more generic calling this connect calling this an account instead an interesting point I think at least yeah I think I think that makes sense because we always talk about like oh the future of the internet is like sign in with ethereum so like Facebook account Spotify account all of these things that there's a sign in button it's just an account uh and the idea is that web3 just replaces web 2. so that makes sense to me David uh what do you bullish on this week my friend I got another picture right it's us this is a picture of us at permissionless do you know when this is uh the night we had our party right yeah yeah permissionless also one year ago as of today no way that was a year ago as it was a year ago wow the first time we met was at this conference and the only time I haven't seen you since it's been a year since I've seen that like when uh when we did that were you like oh I I might not like this guy in real life he's just like what if I don't know he smells bad what if the Vibes are off it sounds like this and so uh there so we you came up to when we met for the first time at the Airbnb uh it was like five minutes until we had our company meeting and then we opened up the door gave you a hug and then I was like uh now what now what do we continue the podcast yeah and I was like oh thank God we had the meeting to like kind of get the ball rolling I think our first meeting too we had I had like the laptop in front of me too and I feel like I was like talking to you through the laptop as well you were also like right next to me as well yeah you couldn't look away from the laptop uh so I guess I'm bullish on another year yes I'll See You in September I'll see you since ever man September but the other thing I'm both sure I'm slightly related uh is we're actually going to have this Twitter space uh with uh the blockworks guys uh the other dads by the way for the Bank closed listeners out there who don't know internally to bank list the employees call uh me and Ryan dads and so the block Works Founders Jason and Mike are also called dads apparently uh and so we're having a dads and Dad's chat uh ahead of permissionless just uh company media company web3 to Media company in web3 that is a Twitter space that's happening on May 31st I think uh when is that 12 p.m eastern time uh and so if you want to see just two uh groups of Founders talk about media companies and web3 we are bringing questions for Jason and Mike and they are bringing in questions for us so no way I didn't know we were doing that yeah we're doing that yeah yeah yeah so it's gonna be a fun time it's gonna be an hour of just like banter and stuff like that so I like the blockworks team yeah Ryan where do you blush on so before I answer that question uh let me just say this week felt really exhausting like um I guess maybe emotionally draining so um bankless HQ our Twitter account put out a tweet headline saying ethereum broke again and then went through a thread and the thread actually had some really good content like I think it was largely accurate the headline was off the headline was a bit of hyperbole I think I think um when our editors published it they were thinking like oh yes maybe it's satirical maybe it's just kind of capturing attention so people will read the rest of the the thread um an innocent mistake in my mind right and this happened on a Friday afternoon and I was kind of logged off um I was enjoying Mother's Day my parents were in town that sort of thing and David when I logged back on on like Sunday my God it felt like the entire like we're used to getting attacked in all sorts of ways this was a little bit different because it felt like in tribe right a lot of um people we thought were like part of the you know the bankless community that we've contributed a lot to we're just lighting us up and torching bankless for doing this um saying that we've transformed into like click clickbait media and uh yeah it just got really negative and I've been through these negative things before as I know you have but I don't know why this one just hit me maybe it's kind of like apathy Market board Market kind of hit me at the wrong time like last straw type of thing I don't know what it was um we tried to apologize but when you're being like sort of mob attacked like this um you know sometimes there's nothing you can do there's nothing you can do anyway so so I posted this and I said maybe it's the Bird app talking but I'm feeling sad right now um I describe this as a low Point um dad's just feeling that way when I posted this and this is a totally self-indulgent like vendor type of tweet you're allowed these are valid the take the takeaway was like is that a valid use of Twitter um the takeaway for me was like why I was sad was because a bear Market needs to be time where the crypto Community bands together and fights common enemies like we got them Gary Gensler and crew like we got all these common enemies we build up we support each other so why are we so determined to eat our own and I said guys I don't know how we can expect to solve this coordination thing if our friend and enemy barometer still stays max style to Mercurial and unforgiving this isn't about bankless this is about all the good ones who've been burnt out by the negativity and pitchforking in crypto anyway I tweeted this a total event tweet and David the reaction from I think like the silent majority community of bankless listeners was just so powerful like okay so I know the reason you do this because it's the same reason I do this um the way my kind of energy gets filled up is when I hear from the community like when when I know that we put out a piece of content that really helps someone learn something that means something to them that kind of like educates them that that benefits the world that's that's why I do this right if it starts to feel like the content we put out is just not doing that it's totally energy depleting or if it starts to feel like that the content that we put out is like harming people or like causing negative value to people that's when I'm just like why am I doing this in the first place anyway the reaction on the back of this was just stuff like this this is uh dartinian.eath you guys changed my life life thank you don't listen to haters you gents have been inspiring me since November 2020 to be bankless I've been traveling the world for over a year because of y'all the world needs you and your channel you guys represent passion honesty intellect and honor with the web 3 space you're the Cornerstone to this foundation and we need you all to know it and then you post this picture of himself in Machu Picchu right English shirt this is so awesome anyway it's just like um I feel like even the segment is somewhat self-indulgent but let me just say as a as a content creator like this is the type of stuff that gets me excited about creating more content and doing more you know like this this kind of stuff and it wasn't just this response it was ton of responses my DMs tweets all sorts of things and I guess maybe more broadly I want people to know um if you're in crypto you're probably engaging in social media right like it maximizes for toxicity sometimes it maximizes for outrage and they say this all the time but like Twitter's not real life right and um yeah and I guess I just felt that this week and it's so easy to get caught in these these bubbles of social media kind of silos where you lose sight of that but um yeah Twitter's not real life so what am I bullish on I'm bullish on the bankless community I'm bullish that um people continue to listen uh to this episode I think we're doing an okay job and um I you know appreciate everyone who's who's tuned in to this point I think um this last line that he wrote um dartanian you've inspired me to be a builder and I humbly have been grinding in the background as a Pioneer like golf helping to create the foundation of our new digital economy I think the main reason why I do this Ryan um is that ethereum the idea of ethereum the idea of permissionless Technology sovereign individual technology uh came to me in a time where I kind of needed it most in my life um I found ethereum when I was in a dark spot and it allowed me to distract myself and then it allowed me to build a platform for myself and then it allowed me to see the world of self-actualization and agency and I think the subtext of Bank list has always been something like this and when I see this silent majority of Builders out there who listen to bank lists and follow us along on this journey who have used Bank lists to see an ethereum the thing that that I saw and that we see in ethereum as scaffolding for self-actualization in the world I this this is like oh yeah I'll I'll take the hates why are you here I'll take the hate every single day that's worth it yeah it's worth ten percent 100 that's cool I think you said it even better than me guys so we appreciate you thank you all thankless listeners uh the silent ones we appreciate you guys David meme of the week what are we looking at this week so this is the uh I prefer the real blank meme format uh and it's the first one Doge and then the guy says I prefer the real [ __ ] coin and then it's Pepe and then he goes I prefer the real [ __ ] coin and then it's the dollar and then the guy goes Perfection but I've had it manually added one more layer which is the real actual [ __ ] coin is this one trillion dollar coin so if the Dollar's a [ __ ] coin the one trillion dollar coin is a trillion times more shitty and it hasn't been minted yet but the moment it is yeah wait for it yeah wow all right Kristen disclaimers of course as weird as the internet is crypto is always weirder and it's more risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
