hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 all right danica let's do the macro update that's always where we start just like give us where we are in the market i think last week when you came on the market had just tanked another whatever percent eth was down where are we now as we record this thursday june 2nd it's almost like history is repeating itself so during the week had bounced back it was sitting you know close to 2k again i think it might have flirted with it just whenever it just went down and then today it's back down to 1800 it's down like eight to ten percent in the last 24 36 hours uh aside from that i think things are going fairly well um they're relatively stable the nfc market is just absurd we're in this it's my it's both my most favorite and least favorite meta ever it's this whole free derivative goblin zombie just chaos and it's fun and it's me but it's also so stupid and it's like we deserve to go to zero when you look at like the top five top ten top fifteen projects um by volume like i'm looking at right now number one goblin town number two goblin girls number three ill puppet nft number five zombie town number ten elf town number twelve baby goblins like and and spat what are you looking at what's that what's the sight that you're looking at volume on uh open c just top 24. um oh wait hang on maybe i hadn't okay no yeah i just refresh and it's basically the same oh god now it's even worse actually there's goblin piss wtf there's gt burgers.wtf um the theme from the last week in this week is just we deserve to go to zero it also we are in the season of free mints uh and i i i think i heard ferocious saying this somebody was giving this advice and i think it's strong advice if you are participating in free mints do not do it on like the wallet where you keep all of your nfts like use a i don't know what the phrase is it a hot wallet you use it booze a burner wallet to mint these free mints because it's it's very easy for them to insert something nefarious and wipe you out um yeah man it it's crazy well i think it's interesting too right i mean this speaks to a broader a broader trend we're seeing which makes some sense of folks not really wanting to dabble on the higher end you know the higher price point projects something that i think maybe illustrates this or is just interesting is clonex there was a clonex nft auctioned at christie's i believe it was last week sometime in the not too distant past and it basically i think it had a couple bidders but they didn't come close to bit to the minimum bid on it so it just didn't sell uh i don't know were you have you been tracking this story at all i have not been tracking this particular one but i think you're right that in general blue chips have not been getting the attention that they used to yeah and look they're you know none of them have like fallen to zero which i think there were like fears that maybe these things would be worth nothing and i think you're not seeing that um but you're certainly not seeing the activity on them that you're used to seeing and i think that's also what that top 10 volume list that you're showing is also because there aren't blue chips there to kind of take the place because you're not seeing that high-end volume going on i think it is interesting that you had this this auction was held at christie's hong kong and there were a number of pieces like traditional artworks that were going you know sort of above the minimum and had a lot of activity around them but the nft the only nft i believe was clonex just like didn't even hit its minimum didn't sell i think people are just a little bit nervous about these these new newer asset classes and paying a lot of money for them right now so it'll bounce back of course as a market but that felt indicative of where we are in the space right now for sure i also think that people are becoming anti these big traditional um auction houses christies and sotheby's there's this whole uh almost scandal that was you know came out a month or so ago where an artist said hey i i sold work at christie's i actually i don't remember christie's or sotheby's they're interchangeable in my mind i still work there and it's been six months they haven't paid me i haven't chased them up i had to you know begin a lawsuit and and then like lots of other artists came out and said the exact same thing and so it's it's almost like the nft space is like you know we don't need you we don't if you're not gonna treat us well we're not gonna you know care about you anymore and when last year it was like a huge big deal and it still is a big deal for a lot of artists you know be featured in other beasts or christie's but this i think has really put a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths and maybe there's some you know flow-on effect where people are like i'm not going to bid on a clonex thing at this auction house because of how they treat pnft space yeah wow that's fascinating i was not tracking that i mean it of course where my head goes is it's just such a argument for smart contracts like why you know like this should just be an automated process transaction that goes through run algorithmically no no hold up like what what's the problem you know like pay the pay the artist it shouldn't it shouldn't take the other things they they take like an egregious fee i think it's like 25 30 percent of the the sales as just two sotheby's or christie's so yeah it's like we don't why we don't need them down with down with the middlemen very interesting uh i don't know if this ties to the macro environment or not i i it feels like it does which is the nate chastain story that i i think broke really recently maybe even this morning for those who don't remember nate was an employee at openc he was head of product i believe he was in charge of determining what nft projects got featured on the openc homepage and he basically got found out it was found out that he was buying works that were then featured on the openc homepage and like making money flipping them after they were featured on the homepage the announcement this morning was that the the fbi or he's basically being charged with like wire fraud uh you know around insider trading and um that's really interesting that there's this crackdown happening and this feels like it's tied to the macro environment a little bit to me because people are cynical and pessimistic and kind of hate i think nfts all the more and the government is is you know trying to get their hands around all of this and so i think they're looking to make an example out of nate it does seem that way that they're trying to make an example out of him but i i think they're saying he he's up to 20 years um he's on the line for 20 years in prison which is you know it's quite excessive for i don't know the exact amount of money he made but i think it was seven eighth 10th 15th it wasn't like hundreds or thousands like a lot of these scams and rug pools getting off hundreds of thousands of eats like millions and millions of dollars uh it was a you know quote unquote relatively insignificant amount obviously what he did was wrong obviously it was terrible and he should be punished but i don't think the punishment fits the crime if he does get charged for 20 years yeah i mean that's the maximum sentence i i highly doubt he'll get that i think what he's being charged with carries a maximum sentence of up to 20 years and i think i would be shocked if he actually got that much you know it's interesting i met him in new york and you know i feel a little bad you know the way the way he frames it is not like he was buying these um works after he found out that they were going to be featured on the homepage it was more like there were artists that he really liked and because he liked them he was buying their works and then because he liked them he was putting them on the home page which is definitely a different framing of the narrative as opposed to like oh i found out they were going to be featured on the homepage so i had this insider info i was then buying them up with that being said it that's also a generous interpretation because he was then selling them after he was using secretive wallets to do this like he clearly on some level knew there was something a little bit dicey about this because he wasn't just like using his standard wallet and being super super public about it as far as i know uh so but but i'd believe him on that like i do think that this for him was a little bit more case like oh i love this artist like we should totally feature them i have some of their works and there was a little bit more of that at play than than maybe the the coverage is suggesting um yeah i i mean my impression and interpretation is i guess more forgiving and favorable as well i think it was more a case of ignorance ignorance and negligence rather than malice and and like willfully trying to just yeah just just exploit the entire community i think it was yeah whatever um he and like he said he used burner wallets and not his main wallet but he didn't do a great job of hiding it he just sent money from his main wallet to another wallet and bought from there it's like that's so easy to track which again might suggest that he really his his thing and what he he said this to me you know is sort of like he didn't he didn't really realize you know like he didn't occur to him that he was doing something really nefarious and so you know he certainly could have hit it better if he if he was in in some way so yeah it'll be really interesting to see how it plays out and you know i think we it'll be interesting to see if there are any follow-on effects around folks who have gotten insider information around say the yuga acquisition of me bits clearly there were people who knew that earlier like we see this all the time clearly there are people who get advanced warning about things that are upcoming and that are able to profit off of it and you know where does that fall in the fbi's view yeah it opens up a massive kind of worms but yeah i mean i think about it even like i would say this podcast but i've done the opposite like i've played so poorly i've typically failed to buy into like the pumps that have come after i featured a project so which not even because i'm trying to be moral just because i'm an idiot um but it is interesting you know like if you you know if you're kevin rose you certainly have the the power to move the price of a project and oftentimes he has projects on that he owns and he owns them because he likes them and then he features them because he likes them and it's you know it's yeah it's a fine line okay let's get into the hot projects we you obviously are listing the high volume projects there i i feel very little need to talk about all of the ones you mentioned um maybe we just do do the goblin town update i think when we were talking about goblin town last week it was at like i don't know two and a half eight three what was it at i think it was two two two and a bit two point four five or something like that and you were selling yes then oh did you keep selling or did you did you hold a bunch i sort of kept selling i still have 19 or something like that so i started with 60. wait you bought 60 how many did you buy again 60 or 62 63 and i sold 10 at 0.4 10.5 and the rest i've been slowly selling but what did you buy them at 0.03 to 0.05 so we talked about this last week you're like i'm a sucker for like no road map cco freeman projects so you bought it for that but was there like did you think it would do this like did did you just adequately predict this you just thought they were fun and you wanted to hold them i thought that there was a chance that they would take off and you know the mean narrative would run with it but obviously i saw 10 at 0.410.5 i thought that you know that we were in a bear market i didn't necessarily expect it to come anywhere near where it is right now but there was something to it it wasn't just the cc zero no road map and freeman that's great the art and website was well made uh it was it's a meme just the narrative of goblin town almost have been all over twitter all year and there's a cat looking in front of my screen right now um and uh what was i saying yeah and just like people were in this bearish down phase and this just fun random project comes up meaning by goblin town and like talking in this weird language and making fun of just every other project and just yeah power and memes so i didn't expect it to get anywhere near to where it is but i i thought there was something there and and there's i could name half a dozen other projects that i bought 50 to 100 to 150 of the basically worthless right now but um this one happened to work out nicely and they've continued to do these twitter spaces where they just talk in goblin voices and do absurd things yeah it's it's crazy although i that there was probably one of the most the most heartwarming things happened in twitter space the other day um it was a goblin town space and uh i can't remember the exact situation but like the exact details of the of the the story but you know they were talking in the real goblin town annoying thing in the background music and then someone uh came on up and you know he tried to talk normally and initially they were like you know continuing in their voice but you could tell that he was like he was on the verge of tears and you know he was just in a really bad way and uh he was talking about how he had goblins and sold them or he i think he might have got scammed out of his one goblin and it was just like you know in tears and one of the team members or one of the people in the call ended up sending him a goblin and it was just this really warm thing but then um it went on for like half an hour more where this person was just sort of um pouring his heart and soul i was like this was the straw that broke the cannons back i've been in this space for so long things haven't been going well for me life is bad um and and he was getting this outpouring of support you know they turned off the goblin music they started talking with real human voices and it was just this really heartwarming moment and there must been thousands or tens of thousands of people that ended up listening to it and it was just like a reminder that you know we can be dreams we can be memeing and just like doing stupid but at the end of the day we're all humans and we care for each other at least in this space it didn't i i just i thought that was really really special that's beautiful where do you think this goes i mean i love that it does seem like there's a strong community people have been making the board ape comparison saying in the early days of of board apes people would make like ape noises in clubhouse and do you have predictions at this point like the team i think probably didn't anticipate this and now must be looking at this going well should we do something here i i it's it it's basically impossible to predict it's who knows no one could have predicted yugo and the board apes there are a lot of similarities like an eerie number which doesn't to me think make me think that it's you you go behind it a lot of people have this speculation i don't think it's hugo oh i don't at all but yeah but it is an anonymous team and and bought apes was by an anonymous team at the time um we just knew some twitter profiles with some avatars um it did sort of come at a time like broad apes launched when people were kind of getting fed up with the market there were all these fomo ramps and bonding curves and it was just like not a fun state for quote unquote regular folk or like people who didn't have a lot of money it was like the crypto punks which it was very elite and then me bits and like it was just seemed like the rich kept getting richer and then they came out and sort of like flattened the playing field and all of these new people who didn't have access to these premium nfts now just banded together and formed a community of just this this new cohort in the space having fun and just you know djing and having means and creating derivatives and being all over twitter like all you could hear about on twitter for weeks and weeks were apes back then a lot of similarities now it's like the the goblins launched at a time when the market was down people were fed up of the rich getting richer and yoga just you know if you had an ape you got a mutant and you got a dog and and you got other side and you know a lot of people tried to mint other side and they couldn't they failed they lost money eight coin went down people just sort of fed up of the these sta projects and then all of a sudden this this free project comes out um stealth mint it doesn't really seem like yeah it just seems organic like no one really knows who's behind it or other than just their personas on twitter and and the characters that they're playing and people are having fun more than anything i think that's like the the key thing to the success of the goblin town uh project is that people are having fun with it and i think for a lot a lot of time a long time people had forgotten how to have fun or they just didn't even realize you could have fun with nfts because it was all about making money and then now people are having fun so who knows where we go from here the team hasn't given any indication in their goblin speak that they're doing anything is that true um i heard there's some talk about burkas like there's a mcdonald hat nfts and there's some burgers like genuine burger derivative i saw like one art piece of artwork of like a well-drawn burger i don't i don't know what they're doing with it um but yeah i haven't heard like a road map or anything i mean yeah there's nothing like that that i've heard of medved tweeted out matt medved we tweeted out do goblins have boarded vibes or loot vibes i have a perspective on this but i'm curious if you have a perspective before i give mine bought eight fives for sure is my my perspective i think i would go loose interesting let's battle it out give me your give me your rationale loot to me was um you know it was a stealth launch it was a free mint et cetera et cetera but the people who sort of gravitated towards loot and fell in love with it and formed the core community to me were like more sophisticated trade it was people who understand solidity they were like coding things forming a little mini dowels and creating trying to create like products and build out this universe from the ground up this derivative project whereas board apes was sort of more casual retail investors who are just having fun and meaning on twitter rather than writing code and interacting with smart contracts which is what lou was um absolutely interesting what your thing is yeah you took it from the community side and i'm thinking about it from the team side so i'll tell you where where my head goes is board apes and i could be wrong about this because i and you can correct me but there was a level of intentionality it felt like around board apes while yes there was an organic the community went and ran with it and you're talking apes speaking the thing like they had a discord they they quickly had a uh graffiti thing you know they had the yacht club where you could go and write your name where they were like we're gonna test the bounds of utility with this they clearly cultivated and continued to cultivate community saying hey we're going to throw eight fest which came much later obviously but like they were very involved and felt to me like a team that yes not docs all these things but like was trying to build something loot felt like you know it's it's dom hoffman and others but like hey look we're kind of screwing around it's it's a free mint don't expect anything from us like we're throwing this out there y'all with the community can run to it run through it cco whatever whatever you make of it you make of it we don't necessarily want the responsibility to to build anything here and and goblin town feels a little bit more that way to me which i'm wondering if there's a shift now that it's had all the success but the team i think freeman's in general often come from a place of like i want to play around and i don't want to anybody to come yell at me if nothing comes of it and that says to me a team that maybe doesn't want to have to uh which is i totally respect if you're going to make it a free mint then i think it's okay to not want to whatever um and so it feels like it's this hypey thing right now that we all need it's a way to blow off steam we can all laugh about it it's getting people to think just like loot did but ultimately i don't unless members of the community really step up and decide it's gonna be their full-time jobs to like make something out of this or the team shifts its perspective i think you need a central governing body to push a thing forward and i i don't see what that is for for uh goblins yet which makes it feel more like glue to me yeah no i actually totally agree with that perspective as well um yeah i mean it can be both there's elements of both i think the i fully agree that like the lack of a team vision or central entity is going to hinder herded at some point clearly it's running on vibes at the moment running on memes people are loving it it's all over the space but uh i'm i'm certainly of the mindset that i don't think you can quote unquote keep going until the team reveals themselves or like they don't have to like docs we don't need to know their identities necessarily i think maybe we do because of azuki and and just that um whole can of worms but reveals their intentions reveals their experience reveals something and and and reveals an intention to do more than what they've done so far because everything about the project up to this point has said we don't have an intention to do more right like you love the cco no road map free mint thing which i think is really cool too but all of that to me says hey we as a team like don't want to be on the hook to do anything which again i think is totally cool let it be what it is but um it's not to me and i just don't know how the price action remains what it's been with that being the case and as as the mood eventually someday shifts in in the space to something else i wonder yeah i mean what if it's the same team what if it's vagabond what if it's what if it's someone who's robbed projects and scam people like that's just going to destroy it right so maybe they don't want to come out because of that um although i don't know what's suzuki at it's not like 12 these days right yeah the community sort of yeah this whole space is crazy this whole time and which again i get it i actually think vagabond is talented um and i think whoever is doing goblin town is talented they've created like a very clear vibe let's move to wrecked guy if you're if you're a game i can speak a little bit about this because i think it it's the same theme freeman uh different in in other ways and we'll get to that but um freeman playing on this theme of like we're all wrecked playing on the bear market feelings yeah um have you been following this do you do you have any wrecked guys yes uh i have some i have 13 i think i bought them at 0.3 or 0.4 so after reveal i but yeah you know what this is actually it was a really funny moment in the zen academy alpha discord people were talking about it and i i i mean i like the art i like osf so you know i had bought one at this point and then i looked at the website i hadn't actually gone to the website and i saw cc0 and no room i was like all right yeah they got me they got me they got you well let me give the context here so osf zenika you just said that he's the artist behind it he's been in the space for for a while i think he's gotten a lot of respect i know i respect him he's big in like ferocious universe he did a long post a while back about um rug radio and why he was bullish on rug radio he's done i know threads i've seen in the past about board apes and and analyses there i feel like he's really done a great job as an artist of like also being a community or builder and really ingratiating himself in the space i hear him on spaces um not infrequently and i didn't really know but i i was it sounds like he had done some projects in the past he'd done one that was regens he did like a djen's regens project you could burn to get regens yeah okay yeah that's what it was and it sort of tanked price wise for a little while and then they really just kept working at it resuscitated it like it seems like he and his team have really just been grinding in the space um and you know and then released this as a free mint really didn't have expectations i was hearing osf give this story like you know wasn't wasn't expecting anything was just trying to reward holders and whatever and then he was off at like a bachelor party i guess he's uk based and um and then somebody texted him to say that snoop dogg had bought one of the wrecked guys and he like was like in dr drinking and like gets this text and then the next thing he knows snoop dogg's like profile picture i think was a wrecked guy and then it sort of went crazy from there and it um it makes me happy because i think it's uh it's a deserved success from somebody who's been in the space for a while been putting out work in the space for a while has had ups and downs and is now both himself and then also his collectors and holders are are um really getting rewarded with the with the project pumping a bit i think it's about like point six now i think it's come down a little bit from maybe where it's high was but um but still and i like the art it's very you know x-copy inspired glitch art yeah um no i agree completely i'm really happy for him uh just a a builder in the space someone who's been around an artist who creates one-on-one art editions um a lot of just prolific i would say that prolific artist prolific builder really smart investor went really big and heavy on board apes and yuga um you know really early on or relatively early on um and yeah just he's a person who has like uh compassion and foresight and intention and intelligence he he's written a uh a really good i don't know if he's written multiple threads or i'm just remembering him like referencing the same thread but sort of about during a bear market um reallocating your portfolio into things that you have high conviction in and you know it's it's about to paraphrase the thread uh from what i can remember but he's like step away from your computer go for a walk come back get a stack of paper um and and pen and write down your portfolio don't use open so you don't scroll just from what you can remember and then you have to check check and then go through and mark everything in your portfolio or every collection that you have between you have high conviction in this project medium conviction and low conviction and just start selling off and consolidating the things you have low conviction in um and even if you have to sell at a loss even if you know the market's bad if you don't have much conviction they're just going to cause you anguish and agony and this is something i've spoken about as well it's like if you have high conviction in a project you can hold through a bear market you can hold for long term it's when you have you when you're invested and overextended into projects that you don't really have conviction and you yolo it in and now too much of your portfolio is on on the line that's when you start to panic and feel that sinking heart and and yeah i mean he's just really clever really hard working in building um as for the mint being a free mint it was free but it was um very heavily allocated to those who had bought his previous project so he's really rewarding his supporters and i think there might have been like a thousand or hundred raffled off to the public but um yeah it was d jen's regens his one of ones his additions um creating value and just doing everything right web three i think yeah absolutely it's a great web three story and and i'm sure this is not the end of it because he'll be building in the space for years to come i think so very cool uh admit one have you been following admit one the the g money uh drop a little bit um another free one tis the season yeah like you said um yeah i i followed a little bit i saw that it was a thing that was coming out um i think gmoney released the website and the the mint list like a day or two before people could start minting there's a manifesto uh it's it's very proof-esque a lot of people are comparing it's a thousand person private discord uh except freeman so not proof raise a lot of money first and the idea again was largely rewarding early supporters and and people that had followed him and like he's been running events and giving out pull apps for i don't know a year plus maybe uh and to people who like turn up to his twitter spaces people to meet him to to turn up to i think i don't it was like a treasure hunt or something he did in person that you know he rewarded people if you went to all three events stuff like that um yeah and just gave back to his community and created this uh private discord obviously he's been very successful in the space in other areas as well was part of the adidas into the metaverse a whole drop situation and has done many other things but um yeah so by nature of his reputation and the people that he put together for this private group the floor price pretty quickly went up to like 18 or something i mean like four and then nine and then 18 now it's backed a little bit but yeah his journey is really interesting too i've i've been on a call with him one time where he really just talked about like his background growing up in new york and then like you know i think he's he just he's like a degen at heart right he started as a trader in you know web two markets and then got into crypto and now nfts and uh something that struck me i think 59 percent he really curated the list of this thousand member community to your point like people who had been with him from the early days people that he you know admires whatever and i think 59 of the holders are women and he was like very intentional about curating a community that would like have a lot of you know women and diversity in it and i know it's something that he just like genuinely feels which is great coming from somebody who like is such a leader in the space and and it reminds me of you like i think people who just coming by this uh belief in that very genuinely so i actually think he's i'm interviewing him on monday so in like a few days so we'll hopefully release that quickly so you all can can learn more because i think he's got a marketplace tied in to to this and and he's got like a whole ecosystem he's building out your point about proof i think is is on point so we will hopefully have more information about it coming out here on overpriced jpegs in very short order i also i went to puerto rico as folks know and and very soon i'm going to be having some special content coming out about my trip to puerto rico and the ecosystem there and g is currently based in puerto rico and he had organized a conference called mediverso there which was really a charity event but it was also helping to onboard a lot of puerto rican artists into nfts and show them like how it works and and auction their uh their work off as nfts and when i was there and speaking to the nft crypto community in puerto rico that event came up a number of times from artists who were like you know this was so life-changing because that was really where i got started in nfts and now i've had the success in it or whatever so he does a lot of like giving back and i i i really admire him i think he's a good guy okay let's see gosh so many things always oh something i'm excited about apecoin announced they'd be moving to imx i think there was a lot of did you see this i'm seeing your face i saw it on your list and i i've not i've been in i'm in dubai i'm filming a course and i'm just like living under a rock so i'm it's i see goblins and goblin derivatives and that's like that's my experience tell me yeah i mean i think i think more to be revealed but you know after the other side you know land debacle and that went sort of sideways the dao the ape dao committee and and i think yuga itself and you know whatever we're kind of putting out messaging being like well ethereum can't handle us you know and kind of trying to blame ethereum for their auction going poorly and that was annoying to people but the underlying theme that like games and if you if you need something that needs like a high level of scale and like a lot of transactions like a game will inevitably need that that doesn't work well on ethereum layer one like that's a valid point and that's clearly true and so there's a lot of speculation they had said they'd imply or i think straight up said like maybe we need a chain seem to imply they were maybe gonna set up their own chain which i really didn't like that idea i think you know we we've seen ronin and flo i don't know i just think that whatever and then and then people were saying maybe they're gonna go to avalanche well anyway it finally came out they put out a statement um and i think imx put out a statement saying that they'll be building on basically immutable x um i really like this i'm very bullish on layer twos it's something i'm digging more into um i've now i met i spent a good portion of time with robbie ferguson as one of the co-founders of imx at vcon just a big fan of his and and no people on the team there whom i'm really big fans of so i'm very bullish on imx as like a plot as the the place to go if you're a game and you need just a highly scaled operation or the ability to scale your operation and um yeah i mean they had to go through the dow so that you know they went through it i think buy apecoin and to be able to submit a proposal and like go through a whole process with the dow to get their approval that they would move to um to imx so i'm sure more details to come out on that but uh pretty big news yeah no i love that i mean as a part of the dow i guess i have some apecoin i think it's a good decision i'm like you i'm bullish on layer 2's i'm bullish on imx i think that they've done a lot right they've been around for a long time and uh have proven themselves and you know it's not it's not easy to run away into that there's been issues and friction um with every layer too and every basically every blockchain um except ethereum ethereum is great it runs smoothly it might be expensive but it runs well um but yeah no they've done better than most i would say and uh are just getting better and better and better and have some big brains and they're really good about taking care of the early supporters i think on imx which is very uh crypto native part of the ethos and it's yeah it's good to hear and yeah i'm excited you know good for apecoin yeah well another is interesting for imax you know it it came out of robbie and his brother james i believe building god's unchanged like they were building a crypto game and realized it wasn't going to work well on ethereum layer one and so then decided to build a mutable act so

there's a a hotel in dubai that has now announced they will take they will accept crypto if you stay there we'll link to the the article about it i wanted to get your thoughts on this because there was this narrative shift i feel like starting with nfts within the ethereum community of like okay ethereum is money or maybe it wasn't a shift within the ethereum community but it was like you suddenly had people who would acknowledge ethereum as money because people were willing to spend ethereum on nfts but i don't know that that translates to people being being willing to spend ethereum on a stay in a hotel they'll buy an nft with ethereum because they think the price might go up and it might even go fast up faster than the price of ethereum will go up but buying something like a hotel where the price you're just sinking money into that you're not gonna make a return on that and using an asset that could go up in price i'm not convinced people will use i think you can use bitcoin ethereum or binance um coin at this hotel and i'm not convinced people will do it what do you think i would i would spend so much money there if every hotel that you would you spend i would spend either i mean i just i was been sitting at a hotel for the last four nights i had this long preamble and it was completely unnecessary that i preamble at all well no everyone everyone has different views but uh i mean i paid with my credit card and paid dollars and it's annoying because all right i've got to get the eth i mean i earn an ether for the most part i gotta get eth sell eth withdraw to fiat there's fees involved at the end of the day it's the same money it's just there's extra extra transaction fees involved to actually spend the money and so if i could just pay an eth that's amazing um i had a call with an accountant this morning another accountant and he was like you can pay me in crypto and i was like this is amazing wow holy hell so you're like bankless you're truly like one of the bankless people i mean you're not actually because you quite literally have to have a bank and still transact in fiat but right wait that this is blowing my mind because also you're like oh you're like it's my it's the same money no it's not right like i eat goes up in price dollars go down in price uh you know so i mean and obviously that's eth is going down now and you know whatever i i understand the nuance but i'm super bullish on each so like to me spending my eat on something that isn't itself garnering me a return i'm like i'm too much of an eath hoarder but i don't i don't live the same life as you like i don't i get paid in in fiat and um whatever my life is much more spent in fiat it's it's just great as an option i would say it's just great to have that option you don't have to it's not like they're only taking crypto i assume because that would be great if they were imagine the buy pressure on imagine if every hotel in the world yeah yeah eath is money this is i i'm like this is actually blowing my mind and and i don't want to bore people but i in 2010 2010 2011 something a long time ago there was a planet money episode i love planet money the podcast it's like i've been listening to it for like a decade and a half now and they did an episode about bitcoin and they made this bet about like would anybody spend bitcoin in the future because why would you spend money on an asset that like is scarce and actually going up in value um and i've always sort of held that view since listening to that episode that like fundamentally people don't want to spend crypto on real world worlds items and that doesn't to me negate the value of it in all sorts of other ways and you can will transact in stable coins and whatever but that these underlying assets themselves you know bitcoin that are i sort of see more like gold anyway love to hear this very cool you would spend your eath on this hotel in dubai next trip yeah i mean you mentioned spending in stable coins i would prefer to spend stable coins if they accepted bitcoin eth and usdc i would probably pay in uscc probably but you know between eth and using my credit card or well maybe i use the credit card to get points but you know no i wouldn't because then after there's transaction fees it's annoying it's it's yeah it's if ether is amazing like i would pay i would i already think of things you need you know you buy something and you know you're gonna buy a new laptop and it's like a thousand dollars that's so expensive it's i was gonna say it's point two five eight thousand dollars it's 0.58 it's still like it's 0.5 is so much less than a thousand so new world yeah okay one of the topics we didn't get to last week but wanted to talk about is openc launching their new marketplace protocol called seaport uh big one of the big kind of changes here it allows you to trade nfts in new ways you can now like bundle assets to create a trade so you can say hey i want to give you a doodle and x amount of eth in exchange for your board ape and um so it just allows for more dynamic trading is this do you trade like that is that something you i feel like you probably do those kinds of trades right you're you're truly d jenny um i don't really i might have done it once or twice in specific circumstances actually i have done it once or twice in specific circumstances but for the most part i don't i know a lot of people do and a lot of people would like to and there are sites like pseudoswap and nft trader that are basically exactly this um and and there's clearly demand for it i think that this is really an excellent thing though because a lot of people get scammed trying to do trades like this and either they go to a fake pseudostop or a fake nft trader or they go to a site that is like that but it's just complete scam site the um the really unfortunate um person who had 29 moon birds scanned fished drained a couple of weeks ago basically used a site that they thought was legitimate to trade uh i can't remember what the exact trade was but you know social engineering plus this malicious contract on a phishing website um masquerading as a trading website so i think if a platform like open c can just establish a standard and a safe space where everyone knows oh you can use seaport to trade each plus nfts for an item and something like that then it's great it's a good thing for the space yeah yeah i agree i am i'm thinking about more i've been thinking about marketplaces lately and i had jake brockman from coinfund on the podcast recently coin fund being an investment fund of the space that's been around for seven years plus and bet on as was led one of the early rounds for rarible has bet on metaplex which is a solana based i don't even know what you'd call a platform but it allows for you to make like bespoke marketplaces on solana for different kinds of nfts and he's really making a big bet on like a fractured marketplace system right where there's marketplaces for all different industries and that it's it'll be a very commoditized thing and and it's more about like building the tooling that allows people to build whatever marketplaces they want rather than sort of like one behemoth like openc which we have now and um i just think it'll be i don't have a strong opinion actually on this yet i i think i i think he's probably right that we'll see more bespoke marketplaces spring up but what that means for openc and its future and like can its network effects it doesn't really play on its network effects that much like it doesn't have the social component so it really is just a habit thing that keeps it around i don't know if you have a perspective on this but i i just think it's an interesting question sort of how the marketplace space plays out over the next decade yeah no i definitely think that we end up in a future with fractured marketplaces lots of different marketplaces um marketplaces for niches basically um so we will have individual projects we'll have their own marketplaces so g-money is a great example of that he has his own marketplace for the admit one for the brick breaker game and and i think the adidas into the metaverse might be on there maybe not uh but uh just a place where you can transact with zero percent marketplace fees because the project who owns those nfts that allow you to translate there they don't take or maybe it's 0.1 it's a fraction of a percent um more and more projects are going to be doing this in addition to that we're going to have marketplaces i believe spring up that cater to certain types of nfts which are just better viewed and better experienced in a different environment like openc is not a fantastic place to look at art for example it's not a fantastic place to look at 3d gaming assets it's you know you have this little window and you can rotate sometimes you can make it full screen sometimes you can't necessarily enter a mediva space and walk around it maybe maybe for certain assets like a 3d sculpture it would be nice to do that maybe there's an ar marketplace for nfts and so on and so on so i think we're going to see a lot of different niche marketplaces maybe one for gaming one for music one for art et cetera and then we're gonna have aggregators and then where people will go for the most part is either the niche marketplace to to buy sell transact or to view the nft but i think like expert traders and pro traders and people who are more active they'll probably just use these aggregators and we see them there's gem there's genie there's blur coming out soon um there's probably a lot more in the pipeline it's it's to me the the clear future and yeah so what does that mean for openc you're like opens he's not good for this what's not good for that i'm like what's it good for well yeah very interesting okay a couple other topics to to kind of add-ons from last week well some of these are continuations of of like updates i gave a big update on the seth green situation and and the seth green board ape situation his board ap stolen and then but he has like a whole tv show built around this board ape that got stolen and so then it was a whole saga of like trying to get the ape back and then saying he was going to sue and and what are his rights to still use the ape well last week i'd said and this was a john rogers idea was like well he should have licensed the ape to himself or to his production company as soon as he had the concept for the film so then even if it had gotten stolen or anything had happened he would still have the rights to use it in his film because that that licensing agreement would hold even if you sell an nft or whatever and that concept just being an interesting one to me because there's all sorts of ramifications for that in the future of like if you've gotten your nft into some sort of agreement and you've licensed it in some way and then you're trying to sell it how will that affect things like rarity and it's whatever okay but there was an attorney who who came out and i guess was interviewed by the defiant that said the way the board ape like commercial licensing agreements are actually written is they're very non-specific so they don't actually specify that you lose the rights to use it in something once you've sold it so they're sort of making this argument that like if you've ever owned it you actually have these rights in perpetuity because the contract doesn't specify that those rights terminate at any point upon the sale of it so i don't know if this is like an up for interpretation thing or if this is like definitely legally true but this is one lawyer's uh statement saying that seth green should still be able to use it because he once owned the sport ape that's fascinating to me as well i don't know how i don't know what i think about that i need more time to digest it but uh i don't know any thoughts on your end no it is fascinating i'm i agree that the broad ape um licensing like terms and conditions of really bare bones it's just like you have full commercial rights and you can you can see that you know they had the idea to begin with and maybe they didn't run it by a dozen lawyers because you look at the licensing agreement for mutants and it's much more extensive and specific and then obviously other side and stuff it gets even worse or like more restrictive because that's yuga and less bought a specifically but um yeah so clearly there's gonna be issues and you know these cases will probably eventually go to court and it'll be some really interesting outcomes um there's an interesting situation going on sort of so the the podcast i host with my friend jamie to bought apes we started we both bought apes he sold his eight this week so the logo has me with my ape and him with his old ape and now we're like well what do we do do we change our logo can you so we have no idea but do we should we rename to one board eight it's um it's really interesting because you know there's no one on board eight talking nfts d5 and some random stuff i was trying to get that's the theme song for two boys and a goblin yeah um yeah one board ape and a goblin town talking nfts yeah um it is fascinating that is interesting i mean i you know my instinct and i think i'm so much more of a traditionalist than you are like i'm not i like cco but i'm not nearly the kind of like pro cco person that you are for these brands sort of is like i i feel like if i'm a holder i don't want to think that anybody who ever held the ape could do anything i gave this example last time but like in theory you could sabotage an existing ape holder by like creating then a licensing agreement for the ape to go like star in a porn film or something right and you could argue you have that right because you once held the right like i don't know how that can you enter into licensing agreements with an ape that you no longer hold like all of these i think this is so interesting by the way like i just as a thought experiment and seeing how it plays out and the whole concept of having these nfts now that can actually be like actors or assets or what like it's um it's it's it's fascinating but i tend to be a little bit more on the side of being restrictive for the sake of the brand and for the sake of these things being able to hold their value um awesome well we are at time in the sense that quite literally you have other things to get to as do i but i will close with kanye west has apparently submitted trademarks for nfts pertaining to yeezus and the jesus line or whatever the heck so i don't know maybe the world is ending or or we're about to get a million new people into nfts but uh but that's happened yeah it's the tidal wave is coming um it's jim carrey brought in his first nfc uh and it was a friend of mine uh alex waxle really awesome artist um amazing i mean we're not close friends but she came to my house during nft nyc last year and we and she's lovely so i'm uh super excited for her yeah tidal wave is going tidal wave is coming
