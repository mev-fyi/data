did you you likely didn't realize that it was going to be such an important moment at the moment of taking the photo right it was like a fun moment but every time i think about that moment it was like it set a whole course for my entire rest of my life welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations of the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with justin aversano the now famous photographer of the twin flames project and before that the birthday project and justin is a strapping young lad clocking in at 28 years old or maybe 29 and it's really just been all about art his entire life was uh is one of those guys that wakes up in the morning and just thinks about creating art first and foremost and then also when he create and also when he goes to bed it's creating art through and through and through and while i tend to recap stories in these intros i'm gonna try my best to not do that and just give you guys some themes justin has a very unique story a relationship with his mother a twin lost in the womb uh and has used photography to tell stories and then accidentally tell a story about himself and then very much begin to do that on purpose and he's used art and photography to connect so many different components about his life uh in in a way that was healing to him as an individual uh and then ultimately arrives at the world of nfts in january of 2021 and we talk about how nfts represent just a great um climax to the story at large so what to the the project that he has uh twin flames uh which which is now wrapped and he has now moved on to his new projects but has really put a fantastic just bow on top of two fantastic stories of creating these very deep projects with photography and has now completely just redefined what it means for him to be an artist and so him and i unpack the significance of nfts as a means for creating meaning is it just some code uh and is it just a bunch of crypto people like me saying that nfts are the most magical thing on the universe uh or is it actually what we say it is as nfcs do allow for human culture and human art to be manifested in ways that could not have been done before justin has his own opinions on that and so i will let him speak now before i go on for too long but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of safe systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access staking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my

this is about the uh coders the cryptographers the system designers you are a big artist a big user uh you one of the big users of these platforms i'm really excited to unpack the how you've gotten into the world of crypto to bring your creative artistic expression into our world so welcome thanks for having me so justin a lot of people will know you as the the artist behind the twin flames nft project but i want to start way way back all the way back uh when did you get into photography and was it was it your first love of like creative expression man we're going back yeah so you know i've always been a photographer practically most of my life i'm 29 years old i started photography around the same time i started skateboarding so for me those two things went hand in hand and i was around 12 or 13 really coming out of being a gamer um basically since i was two years old i was a gamer from nintendo super nintendo on to every console you could imagine and then falling in love with the outside worlds um with skateboarding and photography but through the time um growing up i was always drawing and i was always creating scenes and you know making different theatrical stuff with my toys and and also drawing and and visio vision vision visualizing and being a visionary through my ideas um and really activating it through photography um when i started um middle school and then like how did a camera actually like come into your hands you know i was i was inspired on myspace by all the older guys who were skateboarders and i fell in love with what photography they were shooting um and i just wanted to be a photographer too and i was inspired by you know a melon photo that was a macro of the ridges and you know things like that were like inspiring to me and they were my favorite skateboarders at the time growing up in the neighborhood so you know you it's kind of like monkey see monkey do you you you're inspired by people um in your community who are older and you want to be like them you want to do what they're doing because it's cool and for me skateboarding and photography were those things that really got me out of the house made me a healthier person more social so in a way it really like allowed me to come out of my shell i do remember having a decent number of skateboarding friends like growing up in in middle school and high school and uh it's funny it seems like the longer that they went on in the world of skateboarding more and more of them got into like photography and videography because they all wanted to take like sick videos and take photos of them of them skateboarding so there seems to be like this interesting pairing between skateboarders and like either film or photography exactly and that's that's what i was experiencing and then you know always being a skater and skating with my camera very dangerously with my camera around my chest but i just was it was a natural i never really fell on it only like a couple times but it was a strong camera um and you know you go around and you know you shoot the photography of the skateboarders but more importantly like i just photographed what i loved and i was a street photographer from the beginning um and in an art school i was i was really actively doing street portraiture street photography and then by the end of art school i i moved into like closer on in on the subject and actually started taking really dynamic portraits yeah the you're really giving me some some throwbacks uh i actually like photography was how i had like you know um basically how i had my own like budget in in college like uh i always had my my nikon around my neck and like all photographers know that there's this inevitable like tug of war behind like having your camera around you at all times and inevitably like breaking it somehow uh because like the more that you have it around you like the more likely you're is you're just gonna like bump into something and then like it's just it's it's always this like liability uh what kind of camera did you like first get really really good at um i'll tell you a little funny story so my first camera i ordered um i was a bus boy at my dad's restaurant when i was 13 and i wanted to buy a camera and i was on amazon and i bought a canon xti around christmas time black friday-ish and i had bought it and in the description it said oh it comes with the lens it comes with the camera and i got the camera in the mail and i'd spent like 500 bucks on this thing and it had no lens so i was like where the [ __ ] is the lens so i emailed the amazon thing customer support and i was like hey guys you guys advertised that this comes with a lens and it didn't come with a lens can you please send me a lens and then and then they responded and for me i was like wow i'm a 13 year old and i and i'm like coming at them with some legal jargon and you know i was like i need a lens man and then they were like oh we weren't supposed to you know have a lens with this camera but you know since we advertised it that way we'll send you one for free and i'm like great so i basically got a free lens and i got it and for those that don't know lenses can be even more expensive than the actual body of the camera oftentimes so having a free lens it's it's not like a tip like it's sometimes it's the whole entire thing so yeah i got the the lens in the mail and then i was excited i finally put the two pieces together because i've been sitting with this camera mirrorless for like a [ __ ] week and then i get the lens and then the first photo i ever took really was of my mom and that was to me like one of the most important moments of my life do you still have that photo yeah yeah well uh did you you likely didn't realize that it was going to be such an important moment at the moment of taking the photo right you know it was like a fun moment but every time i think about that moment it was like it set a whole course for my entire rest of my life and when i look at that photo and i look at her looking at me and she passed away a few years ago um it's really like a powerful image of how she's looking at me because for me it was you know the really time really the first time as a young adult i actually like looked into my mom's eyes or like had that connection with her through something other than just being around at the house and and what not going around town but really like engaging in a way that i haven't with my mom before it was so powerful and it really like it inspired the rest of my life and career and gave me strength to be an artist because i don't know just that gesture and look she gave me was like all i ever needed to get the hit the ground running and be who i am today were you having these reflections like relatively around the moment of you taking the photograph are you saying oh no no th this has been current con like every time i think of that photo it really strikes me i think maybe in hindsight and retroactively thinking of when i took that photo and and how beautiful the light and like my mom's look at me and her being you know fighting cancer and like all these different things in that moment it was just pure joy and fun and i'm testing out the camera but when i look at that photo it's like more meaningful than a test shot it's like this is like a memory of my mom that like literally was like the first picture i've ever taken in my life was she posing or was it candid it was like a candid acceptance look like fine fine you can take a photo of me type of look just like gentle and like you know a guard is down and really like opening herself up you know accepting this photo shoot and not being insecure you know because it's easy to be insecure when you're you know going through cancer and you know it's it's tough but for me it was like it was strength for both of us it was it was a moment that really connected us as mother and son like like never before was it do you think it has anything to do with the fact that when you take a photograph you're taking you're taking a snapshot in time and you're given the ability to reflect upon that one specific snapshot in greater detail because you actually have something to look at right like you well no i'm not looking at my mom i'm looking at a photograph of my mom and i can pause and you know zoom in and analyze and parse apart and look at a picture of my mom that you know kind of like you were saying uh you had never looked at your mom in that way before and it was probably you know i think a lot of us go around our our loved ones uh that you know they're about you know they're you know putting the dishes away they're just living their life in your apartment and you you kind of forget to really look at them and is that kind of what you're saying with 100 like it's not a look it's being seen in the most honorable respectful like intimate way you can be present with someone it really was being present with someone in the most ultimate way and this was a digital photographer right not a film yeah when i started photography i bought a digital camera and then when i went into art school in 2010 so i was shooting from let's say 2005 till uh and i until 2010 is when i got into college and that's when i started shooting film um because that was the first you know the first assignment was should go in the dark room and print and and develop your negatives and coming from digital i've honestly fell in love with being in the dark room and seeing the magic of the paper come to life when you're shaking the negative chemistry and that's when i was like i am never shooting digital ever again uh yeah i remember taking photography class in high school which was a film class with a dark room and this wasn't really much of a problem back then but everyone uh you know even i think even high schoolers were like constantly on their phones those days and the dark room's such like an oasis because it's dark like you can't bring your phone in there it messes up the photographs and not only that but like you you when you're in the dark room you are only have one thing to focus on which is a deep connection to the creative process there's nothing else to think about like not it's kind of like a sensory deprivation tank except the only sense that you have is the creation of the of the of the film photograph and i think a lot of people in in society these days have it's a little bit of a surreal experience these days because like you're totally cut off from the beeps and the sounds and the lcd screens and you only have this one deep creative thing to think about is is am i kind of tapping into one of the under the energy that you really like yeah i mean it's like it is a sensory deprivation room and the only light that you see is the 10 seconds when you're exposing the paper and then you're like fumbling around in the dark trying to make sure that paper is in the paper safe and you don't [ __ ] expose it because you forgot to put it in there uh justin what was your relationship with the internet at this time because the average like crypto coder that i i talked to on these later zeros they they all kind of tell me a similar story of like oh yeah i got a computer really relatively early in my life what was your relationship with with the internet so my my first uh experience with the computer was really to play like legoland as a kid and having fun with roller coaster tycoon and like i'm a huge i was a huge gamer i have love for it and i think the gaming really led me into computers um world of warcraft and you know all those you know games online on those websites that existed early 2000s um that we all probably went on ebalm's world and all those weird fun games and so that was my you know experience with the internet and then aim and just messaging then it went to myspace um a lot of computer gaming like battlefield 2042 as a young youngling and there's always being a gamer and knowing how to navigate just the computer for that and and hitting up my friends to go hang out but nothing about uh uploading your digital photographs into some photo editor or anything like that oh i mean yeah photoshop yeah yeah using photoshop on the computer right but then you went into the into the dark room and like oh this is way better yeah but i still use photoshop just to put my stuff online uh when did it ever was there ever a moment where you're like oh yeah i want to make money doing this uh doing this this passion this photography and then how did you actually go about achieving that you know it's funny like when i was in school i never really thought about making money i only thought about making art and learning and being educated and using my uh time at sva school of visual arts to just keep learning and having fun and it it never really was about money um and even like seeing everyone else in school like shooting for vogue shooting for gucci whatever brands i was like i never wanted to be a commercial photographer anyway i was pretty much more so trained to want to be a museum photographer or you know some sort of serious artist like a warhol of our generation someone who really made an impact and created works that people can't forget and i think you know that was always my drive it wasn't ever about money it was always about you know the work and the creation and and what makes it relevant and what makes people care and you know i think to be a good artist you really got to just you know have the drive to want to be seen and create everlasting things that are timeless and you know have a place in history that that makes you different so when you're making these uh the your photographs in the dark room that's not the last step of course in the creative process the last step is actually displaying these things in a way that also have an impact so what what's the uh if if you're creating this art for the sake of creating art how do you actually uh what was your plan for actually expressing this art to the rest of the world because again if you're not you know if you're not money driven you are art driven what is the performance uh if you will about how to display display your photographs i think a lot of it comes from you know there's a lot of practice involved and to create a project like twin flames or even every day is a gift the birthday project um it just comes from pure inspiration in in a divine moment at any point in time that really sets the tone for a whole project but prior to those major projects i was just in creation mode i was in i was finding what i like to shoot i was finding my style i was building consistency in the way i shoot learning the craft learning everything about the printing processes all sorts of them alternative process silk screen process like really finding out what i really love to do and what i really didn't like to do and filtering through through using school and learning philosophy and attributing philosophy to the concepts of the work you know it was really just a huge filtering process of where i want to take this and what is my communication through the medium that i want to create and so honestly the only major project i did during art school was the birthday project and it was my first taste in like wow this is a serious project that people can stand by and understand when they see it and that's just a project where i photograph someone every day of the year with a polaroid camera on their birthday without missing a day and i did that every single day in 2020 in 2012 to 2013 as a senior thesis project and then from there on out i really stopped taking random type of photos and i started really thinking heavily in projects and themes and i think learning about other photographers works in the history of photography or in contemporary art you see that they all work in different themes that tell a bigger story than just the one photograph and i think that's where i started that's when my aha moment was oh i need to make a serious project and it was the birthday project and then and then it took me time to to find twin flames and really activate that and start making that work so there's a lot of famous photographers out there and the classic example is ansel adams and he has these great images that you can look at and you can you can just look at them and just be astounded by by how they look as an individual photograph but you're talking about the art itself isn't the single photograph or not even the whole entire project at large but it's also the process of creating the project that is also the art so it seems to me that you're making a hybrid of what the art actually is is a hybrid of good fantastically composed photography of a bunch of common themes but also really the art is the story of how it was created is that true yeah you need the story it's the mythology we're creating mythology as as we're shooting and and and in time you know we look at the greeks and the sculptures and the marble and you know the renaissance jesus paintings and you know where are we in that time stamp of history in 20 in the 2000s 2010 and for me you know using classic portraiture and film cameras and a theme that's where i made my mark i would say and it is it is a balance between the subject and and the and the story because the subject conveys the story that's being told in the greater narrative of the cohesive project that that goes together and then when you see it exhibited together or in a book you get the story without even have to reading the [Music] the artist statement right so when you your first project was the the birthday project we'll go i think we'll go into more detail in just a second but when was there the aha moment of that this piece of art that you're about to create is not just the photographs uh before you got it started on the project or did you realize that maybe the art was going to be something more than just some of the photographs maybe towards like after you finished taking all the photographs when did you realize it was going to become more than just the photographs individually or was that the whole purpose going into it well i'll just give you some insight in uh where that project came from and my thought process sure um because there's like three stages i would say the first stage was i was in a self-portrait class in my sophomore year of college and one of the projects was take a photo of yourself as as as the other gender and for me i was like i want to take a polaroid of myself on the street corner with my best friend and be prostitutes and so like that was the fun little idea and do a whole like polaroid narrative of that and then i had the polaroid camera sitting at my house and i had had a house party i was living in like a five-bedroom house in bushwick bed-stuy and it was just non-stop parties all the time i don't even like to party i just like to make art and chill but like the roommates i had were partiers drinkers and so we would always have parties because that would what would pay the rent and you know we had a party the night before and then it's like two in the morning and i'm on mushrooms and i get a knock at the door and i'm like who the [ __ ] is here like what's going on and it's my friend brian with two of his girlfriends and one of which he said oh could we come in is it is the party still happening i'm like bro the party was yesterday but you could come in and smoke some joints like let's hang out yeah you're here and then we sat on the couch and he he's like hey it's my friend's birthday today and i'm like oh [ __ ] happy birthday and i looked at her and then i looked at the polaroid and in that moment i like stood up like and like i had a lightning bolt pierced through my crown chakra into my body in my heart and like electrified me and it was like oh my god and i held the polaroid in my hand i'm like i grabbed it i'm like i looked at her i'm like oh my god i'm going to start a birthday project and every day of the year i'm going to photograph someone on their birthday did you say that out loud or was that in your head man i think [Laughter] i don't think i said that out loud okay okay it just came to me and i don't even remember the rest of the night because that was the only thing i remembered but you did take her photograph i did not take her photos oh you didn't take her photograph oh no no because because it was close to my birthday and i i think that that was around september 12th and then my birthday september 23rd so there was another party on september 22nd and i was going to start the project on my birthday and be the first self-portrait of the day and then the party on the 22nd one of my friends it was their her birthday so i was like you know what [ __ ] it i'm gonna start a day early like what's the what what's the harm here and i photographed her and then the next day i drove upstate and went to bear mountain and i had a photograph of my my dog t uh tortilla um in my hand arms like a big ass husky and then wearing my like hippie [ __ ] hoodie um that you could find on any boardwalk um and and like the project started and then you know every day i would you know like hit up all my friends hey do you know anyone whose birthday it is i would check facebook see whose birthday it is i would go to school and you know so it was very very very difficult the first three months because i it was very stressful and then after three months it got to the point where i had calendars marked i had people ready who were excited to be in it like who would text me if they knew whose birthday was and i would actually go around with the sign that says is it your birthday today on the streets of new york so the first time i did that really broke me out of my shell this is why i feel like i'm a social person now is because i literally endured a whole year of [ __ ] going out there looking everyone in the face in new york city with a sign that says is it your birthday today and i literally say is it your birthday today is it your birthday today is it your birthday today is it until i found someone and there are so many liars like it's my birthday i'm like really they're like nah i'm like what the [ __ ] it happens get out of my way it happened so many times i would even check their ids yeah it's legit do you feel how many photographs were there 365 yes yeah so do you feel like every single one actually was their birthday every single 100 hit rate i mean i'm i i'm 100 positive although i have a suspicion that one of them was a lie okay okay because he was a younger kid because he was like 13. he didn't have an id and my friend was like trying to hook me up but i feel like he kind of [ __ ] me over but you know what i it it wouldn't be a project if there wasn't one liar sure yeah yeah absolutely well i'm sure there were a number of times where maybe i don't know it's like 9 00 p.m 10 p.m and you haven't taken your photograph yet and you're like that only happened once only one time it was 11 o'clock at night so i mean i was losing my mind in your head you're like dude if the clock strikes midnight i'm out or is it kind of like uh before i go to bed i'm like i'm overwhelmed my rule was midnight midnight i'm dead i told myself i'll kill myself if i don't [ __ ] shoot that someone okay so the the day there was life or death well when you would put it like that so what was the day that you had the biggest buzzer beater what was that like i always say in november or was it february and i had someone whose birthday was i was just driving from city to long island and the kid was in long island and it was 11 30 and like i pulled up the kid wasn't there yet and then i see and then i forgot my camera that's what happened what that's what happened i got there my friend had to drive from the city with my polaroid he he was pulling up and then the kid whose birthday was pulling up and they both stopped and then the kid got out bro my friend got out i grabbed the camera i ran i grabbed the kid and i photographed him and then i was like oh another 24 hours to go and then i think i found someone that same night so i could just chill for the rest of the day i photographed a lot of people at midnight just so i could have have the day to like jax right that's crazy very stressful yeah uh the did you know that you wanted to do it every single day for a year on day one yeah yeah yeah right okay damn that's pretty neat and then just to see if i could do it mm-hmm and if i if i said to myself if i could get past november from september november then i could definitely finish this you said it was your senior thesis did you graduate college by the time it was over so i started in the 2012 september and then i finished it 2012 in september and then 2013. september 2014 may was when i graduated okay so i started it around uh wasn't my sophomore year [ __ ] out man i don't even remember um talk a little bit about how you used it to to come out of your shell because again i i have a pretty similar experience i was the uh the kind of the resident photographer for my fraternity in college and i was also kind of an introvert and so i kind of used like the camera to kind of hide behind but also as an excuse to like introduce myself to people it's like a great conversation starters like hey i've got a camera who wants their photo taken and everyone in college wants their photo taken talk a little bit about how you like you know form formulated your identity using it so when i was in high school i was the same way i was like the photographer i always had my camera all the kids at school knew me from different reasons whether i'm a skateboarder or pothead or artist um and i just was friends with everyone every friend group i was never like in any clique i was always walking between you know the gangster kids or the preppy kids or the skater kids you know i was i was hanging out with everybody just because it's who i am and you know i was always friendly um but when it comes to strangers and like people on the street i really became fearless and just let go of any insecurity just by literally like putting yourself out there in the world being a performer in a way where i was like literally carrying a sign where to the point where people are handing me dollars and i'm like i'm not [ __ ] homeless like i just want to shoot people on their birthday i don't know how else i could communicate that to the world visually without like right so i would just go do that and i really over time it really [ __ ] tears you down to not give a [ __ ] and just enable you to literally talk to anyone in the world and i think that endurance that practice of literally putting yourself out there to the point where people can make fun of you but you take yourself so you take yourself so seriously where i don't even give a [ __ ] what anyone thinks of me because i have a goal and i'm driven and i always meet my goal and i'm and i and i could talk to anyone in the world if i if i wanted to and that's just how who i wanted to be and and that pr and that project through the practice of being out being putting yourself out there it's like there's nothing left after that right do you think that this was a fortunate byproduct of creating these art series or do you think perhaps maybe it's actually one of the main reasons why you had the motivation to stick with it like maybe it was actually kind of the reason perhaps you know i think it's both because i enjoy meeting people i enjoy meeting new people and i think for me it's like i would love to know everyone on earth just because i feel like it would create a better earth by people being connected and not being strangers and everyone being friendly and like a place where literally you could walk down the street and know everyone and like maybe that's my utopian desire um but you know there are like eight billion people in the world and i don't think anyone could be friendly with everyone but there's eight million people in new york city and i probably said it is your birthday to like at least a million of them mm-hmm uh so this project took you a year um and it's not like you were charging the birthday people to get their photos taken how were you like sustaining yourself financially during this time [Music] i bought all the film up front and it's just a polaroid so literally it's just one expense of like 5 000 bucks okay to buy 52 packs because there's eight photos in each pack and each pack was like 20 bucks so that's around like a thousand bucks or so i don't even know and i would just i would only shoot one photo per person right but yeah but what about like rent and gas and food and you know all like the the you know the perils of being alive what about all that so in new york um i don't have a car i i eat like rice and beans or pita and hummus so i like ate for like five dollars a day um i'm not extravagant i don't go out drinking i don't spend money the only thing i would buy was weed and had a budget for a weed every month and be be smart with that so you know i never really liked spending money on stuff just unless it was art supplies so right you know i work i worked and did photo jobs that paid like a thousand bucks and you know rent was only like 600 bucks so i was living under my means and selling and selling art when i could you know doing everything i could mostly photo gigs and art sales i recently watched a movie about rock climbers and the the more hardcore of a rock climber you are the more like minimalist lifestyle you tend to be that is what i've gathered because these guys these people don't care about like you know making money or is like you know having this this like long-term career projection blah blah blah they just want to do the thing that they care about right they are optimized for the rock climbers like optimized to climb the rocks so it kind of sounds like what your lifestyle is but you're instead of climbing rocks you are taking photographs yeah i mean you know as you say that i think of like a simple life that i dream to have is living by a [ __ ] you know ocean line in malibu in like a mobile van life with a surfboard and just surfing every day and then whenever i need to work i just work from the car right yeah yeah that's like that's like a dream a silly little dream well hopefully uh towards the end of this conversation we'll talk about the nfcs um we definitely will um and then we can talk about how that might come become a reality later but let's keep on going after the birthday project uh so you had your first big uh project did it like blow up so like what was the uh result of this product or or project or is it just so funny you say that because it's definitely something that's worthy of being viral because if you look at the video on my website it's pretty [ __ ] compelling like no one in the world has ever done what i did about birthdays with people like made a calendar of people on their birthdays with a polaroid like the camera itself lends itself to the concept and i always think about that when i'm making the art is how does the the tool relate itself to the medium like when you look at twin flames i shot with a twin lens reflex camera it has two lenses so i think very deeply when it comes to the project the theme the paper i used for the theme you know with my new project smoke and mirrors it's tarot project and so with the tarot in mind i'm using papyrus paper because the esoteric terrorist girls remind me of the mrs ancient mysticism in egypt and you know my heritage is from there being jewish it's like it's it's the core of my being to like honor the ancestors and the paper lends itself to the to the project and i think in these terms and how was the birthday project like you know broadcasted if you will like how how did you get eyeballs on the project so but this was before instagram really like took off and i wanted to make it a book i was trying to get book publishers no one really cared you know i wasn't established enough for them to care but it was such a it's such a great project and i think when i really said as an nft next year people will actually want to make a book of it or whatever um it will really 10 years later have a whole new foundation to stand on but then in art school i just exhibited in the hallway of the school and you could tell everyone in that school really like took it in and was like holy [ __ ] like this is the project this kid did and here it is you know and i had velcro tape and i velcroed all them to the wall and it's just like stood there like a presence and you know i always wanted to make a book i always wanted to exhibit at the moma like these are my goals um you know and now with nfts it could really change the change that and actually be be where i wanted to be 10 years ago how when it was displayed at school you said it was on on velcro how how was it actually like configured was it just like 365 in a line 100 grid one one big ass grid i like making grids when i make projects you'll see in every project i do there's always a grid because i feel like it creates this awe sublime feeling being like envision envisioned in front of this big ass project that took a year to do and you see the whole year in one moment it's like pretty powerful so i did it by like seven rows 52 images per row um because seven days a week and just 52 days in the year um it was pretty you know it was pretty powerful to have up there and they were all were they sequential oh yeah everything i do and everything i exhibit is always in chronological order cool just so you could see the progression of me as an artist and how i shoot right nice love it yeah could you tell differences but behind like the photographs that you took at the start of the year versus the end of the year yeah you could see the color temperature on the photos because the the film itself is is affected by the temperature so when it was really [ __ ] cold during a blizzard you would see it like really blue you know if it was extremely hot you would see orange or red or yellow and it was like it really embodied the temperature outside that's amazing you know you could see my thought process in it like seeing there's a person who's buried and it's the gravestone on their birthday it's a baby being born on that day it's people having sex on their birthday it's like you could see all the birthday stuff in ideas throughout the project and you could see my eye sh wanting to find different ways like you would there's one photo where this girl is like in the mid like far far far out and i'm shooting from afar like just because of scale and there's one photo i'm like super close just playing around and like doing everything imagine it imagine like all forms did you actually take photos of someone having sex on their birthday is that a real fun yeah january 26th no way yeah go to my website you'll see it oh i think i will wow a lot of nudes too really just because people decided to get in their birthday suit on their birthday suit yeah birthday suit i'm sure somebody thought of that and thought that was a great idea and i'm sure somebody next thought of that as well and then you were like somebody else thought of that first well i had like one naked guy and one naked girl and they were actually the people who were dating each other oh nice nice whose idea was it to get naked the guys are the girls it was mine i was like guys we're gonna need to get you in your birthday suit for the project like strictly because it's the birthday suit concept i mean were tho they the only people that you prompted with that proposition or my one best friend at the time got naked because he wanted to be naked that's absolutely hilarious oh my gosh i'm sure there are just absolutely the project itself i mean is that why you really like the projects it's because they have like the density of these stories like i i i want to go on to the next project but there are so many different like micro stories inside of this project maybe is that why you like like these things so much yes yeah because they take a life of them their own and there are stories within the project there's narratives within and it just it's forever his life and we could talk about this one project right for a long time but we should move on to twin flames yeah okay so it sounds like after you finish this project you're like oh yeah this whole like project style of art i am totally down for this is what i want to do is that about right 100 and that's all i think of and then how did when did twin flames idea come about and how did that uh idea get incepted there was like different stages of that so in 2016 i visited shamans in peru um going through addiction stuff and loss of my mom and grief and not handling that well and always being on mushrooms and what did your mom die 2014 2014 she died a year after i took her birthday photo to the day literally almost to the day like i photographed her january 16th 2013 and then i photo i photographed her that day and then she passed away january 18 2014. four days after her birthday two days excuse me two days yeah bad math um wow okay um and that was the last time i ever photographed her right interesting and well uh it's cool that she her last photograph was in the project yeah i mean that photo project was actually for her to honor her life and for the teaching she gave me to celebrate people celebrate life cherish memories and you know like it was actually in honor of her of my mom what about the specific like project was right to give your mom is there something about birthdays or or it's just the fact that you wanted to honor her because she was the first person you photographed why was it like why was it the right thing to give to her you know it's all those reasons it's it's both you know she was dying of cancer so i wanted to show her who i was in the world and what i'm capable of and you know celebrating life and the teachings and and the first photograph and it her it being her last is kind of symbolic too the the cool thing i really like about just artists and the concept of art is that i think society progresses um at large we progress as a society but it's the artists that are first artists are are the people spearheading this thing so maybe when when you're giving your mom this project you're kind of letting her get a glimpse into your own future even though you don't even know what that future is like it's like hey mom here's what i'm going to do here's like what i'm what i'm up to and like you know you you imagine the trajectory mom but here's here's the material to do so i mean it's more of her in her honor okay because she'd passed away while i was like after i finished it so it's just it's like one of those things when you're writing a book like in the memory of my father my you know it's for her okay and you'll see the same thing in my twin flames book in memory of my twin right right okay so yeah let's let's get into into twin flames when did the twin flames idea become incepted so like i was saying i was working with shamans in peru and i had taken san pedro guatuma and i had communicated with my mom in that this is a psychoactive drug it's a it's a sacred medicine that you drink it's like cactus smoothie it's pretty gross kind of like peyote yeah peyote's gentle cousin okay okay um and so you know i was i was on it and then i was in communication with my mom in the spirit world and she was telling me it's okay everything's okay like proud of you and like just things that built my esteem my self-esteem and really helped me let go of any addiction or insecurities i was having and the funny thing is you know it really set a tone for my healing and there were twin shamans who were conducting the ceremonies so you know they were really they became really good friends and i feel like it was that moment of stepping into a healing phase that they came into my life and they were there and then the next year in 2017 when i was at an exhibition that i was curating on valentine's day a set of twins ali and jilly glatt were like the art world twins were always at gallery shows in the lower east side and they came in and in the similar experience i had with the birthday project i was holding my polaroid because at that time i was always shooting people at events and being like a warhol dash snow person having fun at gallery shows and meeting people through my polaroid and you know that's who i always was and i took their picture and i held their picture in my hand and i was like and i looked at it and i had that [ __ ] same feeling that i was like oh my god like i gotta do a twin project like it's just gonna happen and i went up to them later that day and like said to them look i'm going to start doing a twin project let me get my gear and i'll and i'll and i'll contact you and we'll we'll start and so this project was i call it the healing journey and it does come from losing my twin in my mom's womb before i was born because my mom had three miscarriages one before during and after me and i was like a twin survivor and i kind of absorbed my twin um and so and so that it was it i i started uncovering like the healing and actually as i was shooting the project it kept it like the the messages came from the project of why i was even doing this you know i was you know i was i was seeking something in my heart that i was trying to put my thumb on but and by the end of it by the second san pedro ceremony it totally made sense what i was doing it was all unconscious and i'm excavating the subconscious and bring it to the surface of trauma and it was all prenatal trauma which is very difficult to put to to activate unless you you do that deep dive in healing and so i went to peru again to photograph the twins shamans and by that time i was almost done with the project so i flew to peru just to photograph them did another san pedro ceremony and this time i was talking to my twin and her name is alessia and her nickname was butterfly and there was a psychic medium there and she was channeling her and there was this like exorcism that had happened as well um there was a lot of crazy [ __ ] going on during that uh week in peru but it was in that moment in that ceremony i realized like oh [ __ ] this is in honor of my twin like this is to heal from my loss of my sister like and and and let go of the guilt and shame of surviving and her not and and also realizing that that those three miscarriages actually were a signifier for my mom getting ovarian cancer and leading to her death so it's like all these things are connected and it's all in hindsight that you realize what the [ __ ] actually going on but when you're creating the art you're just following intuition blindly and creating and then the the photos tell a bigger story personally that actually help you discover who you are prior to starting this uh twin project how much uh how conscious were you of like the the trauma that you had from from uh your twin like is this something that you were able to articulate before starting the project or was it the project that really allowed you to introspect and see it see it for how it really was so my mom told me i lost my twin when i was like two or three years old in the car when we were moving from almond to holbrook and then she like never brought it up again until she was on her deathbed and then we talked about it again and then you know i always felt like i had like a spiritual guardian with me and it had it had protected me like at least 10 times growing up from death like near near near-death experiences or something that like protected me in some magical way and i didn't know what it was or who it was and then i started realizing that it was actually my twin in the spirit world keeping havoc watching my back and i think as i progressed through the project i would learn more about myself i would feel better about myself and i call it the healing journey because every photo i took really enabled me to connect with the twins and reconnect the prenatal disconnection that happened to me in the womb and being born in the world and not feeling connected to anything and then which is why i was taking a lot of shrooms and weed and finding like i was actually masking my trauma with this psychedelic mind state um thinking i needed that to be an artist but really there was just a delusion in many different ways and so you know at some point i didn't need any of this stuff and just was sober and just started just creating and feeling good about that and feeling good about being sober and not needing psychedelics to make me feel happy or good or creative and for me it was like a really healing journey because every photo i took it made me feel more whole because i was connecting with these people and by the end of it i had connected with so many twins it kind of made up for all the disconnection i had with my twin and by the time i had my book it felt complete and the project felt complete in three ways it took me a year to photograph twin flames from may 31st to july 18 2018 so 2017 to 2018 and i always work in these yearly projects because it's just something to do um but it's for a greater cause uh after the fact so once i finished the project shooting that was like the first stage of completion and then the second stage was printing the whole project and and making a book and having the exhibition and then at the exhibition i was crying so much and i felt relief and i felt support and i felt loved and i felt complete and then the third stage of completion was when the started selling and then being at christie's and seeing the full complete collection sold to not only pay off all the debt i've accrued making this stuff that put me in the hole 100 000 but it actually created abundance and actually builds up my career so it's like it needed the digital twin in order to be a successful project whereas with with the physicals in 2019 no one really cared it was kind of like the birthday project all over again like it wasn't connecting to people in the art world and i feel like it needed to be reinforced by the digital community and the nft twin the digital physical balance which made it complete in a way where people could truly understand it and have a whole audience like yourself and everyone who's listening to back to back it and [ __ ] care and and rally and to create a whole community and a whole force of where we're at now with nfcs and photography there's a lot of themes that i think i um i want to connect here uh we talked to justin blau about his royal platform uh which is tokenized music but the we talked about how uh the act of creating a token actually elevates the fans in an equal and opposite creative process as the artist and so where it used to be an artist on stage projecting out to fans and the fans were consuming the creation of the token allowed the fans to reverberate back towards the artists and so like there's where in like the traditional music world it's from from one to many but now in the the potential of this tokenized music world it's a it's a it's an appropriate match it's got its other half where the artist and the token can reverberate between each other and the token is emblematic of just like the the artist's fans uh and so i'm seeing similar parallels to what you're saying where we have uh this digital complement to the real world uh creation process that allows the true um true expression to actually be manifested is that is that what you're saying yeah i mean he's doing a great job with with royal and paying it forward back to the people and i think that's what the web 3 is all about is how do you include the community that's helping just to also um be part of the success so if if there hadn't been nfts and there had just been this physical side what would that have looked like uh you said a book a book of uh is it again 365 twins no 100 twins 100 twins 100 twins okay so you didn't put a yearly timer on this one did you no but it took a year sure okay and so uh uh well like one twin per page would that be the deal yeah well like the name of the twin and the location and the date and then the photo and then you flip it's and then there's chapters every 10 twins was an interview and like statistics science paranormal community spirituality all these different elements of astrology all these different elements of what twins can be in these different genres and interviewing a select of each um of each ten and there's only there's this is a like a one of one right like a one of one in real life copy of this book is that right no there was 500 editions of the first and then 200 editions of the second so what what actually went off to christie's what got austin actually nothing christie's the full physical 101 set okay the the okay uh and one nft of the book cover image okay and then so you didn't take these with your polaroid you took these with a different camera so i actually did shoot polaroids and i did shoot with the tlr camera with the two lens that looked like this and then a large format so when i started after the birthday project i i started shooting like 4x5 large format medium format polaroid and with my new project smoke and mirrors i'm still shooting polaroid i'm still shooting 4x5 and i'm now i'm shooting with a 35 millimeter instead of a square camera so there's not one single format right no and the reason is because i learned the hard way a few times that sometimes your camera [ __ ] up and the light gets exposed or there's a hole in the bellows or someone misdevelops the film and you know you can't let people ruin the shoot if you only have one camera so i've learned to shoot with multiple cameras and you know there was multiple times in the project where you know the 4x5 didn't come out or the the medium format didn't come out and luckily i had the other one to like make up for it so the the 500 books that were sold these individual photographs were like like scanned and then printed onto the actual book pages it's just like a normal book it's you get it printed at a print shop and they make it into a book okay so they're they're taking the negatives i'm just trying to figure out i scan the negatives okay and i put them in a digital file and then i place the digital file on indesign and you design the book and then you get the book printed through the indesign file okay so you're not taking the negative and uh having the photo paper go through like the washing process oh no that's that's crazy okay i'm a little bit disconnected from from the photography world these days okay so you take the negative and the negative is directly scanned so i got the negative scanned it got the file edit the file make it color corrected and whatnot and then and then you put it in you know the indesign and you you format the book and then the uh the one of the what was auctioned off at christie's again what was that format in that's the physical 16 by 20 prints i made in the dark room and okay there were one-on-ones that i made in the color dark room and framed and there's a hundred of them and one nft of the book cover image okay and so that that you actually did take the negative and go through the the dark room creative process and that's that's why it has that outside price tag because well a the uniqueness but also be the human labor of the artist himself going into it uh and okay cool it took me three months i did like i believe i did like three to five a day so i had six hours at the spot i did five a day i think it was five a day or three to five a day and it took me three months and um how long would each print take to produce like an hour to an hour and a half and like that you're just trying to perfect the exposure twinkle with the composition make sure the colors are right oh yeah yeah and then uh if if i remember my my darkroom days there's a lot of just like paper like expensive photography paper thrown out in the trash because i didn't get it right was there a lot oh yeah yeah oh yeah by the end of it i was i had a i had a flow [Music] and it was pretty much always the same exposure f11 at 10 to 30 seconds with like a two filter or whatever okay okay cool so yeah right you got the hang of it and then okay so then the nfts uh a hundred a hundred one of ones uh and then you're just taking the the scanning the negative going into some digital format adobe illustrator maybe again and then i already had the file so all i had to do is upload okay okay and then uh what platform did you use to upload them to openc openc direct not not foundation or super rare just straight to opencv no i'm straight up openc 1159 [ __ ] shared contract and breaking that whole um taboo of oh open c shared contracts not worth anything well the the most expensive photography project is on that uh-huh so it's kind of funny because at the end of the day the arguments like does it really need to be an erc 721 i say moving forward yes because i'm educated now and it's like painting with acrylic and moving into painting with oil right but being a noob and and using what you have at the time and and trusting your leaders to show you what's up you know i did it and i think at the end of the day people respect the artist and the reputation more so than a [ __ ] smart contract hey guys i hope you're enjoying justin's stories thus far i think one of the most interesting things about this to show with him is that we didn't talk about crypto or nfts or bitcoin really for the first entire half of the show but the second half of the show uh we will actually start to talk about these things but before we get there some of these fantastic a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans unit swap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dals have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com did you hear about ethereum at all before nfts or was it through this project when did you talk about ethereum i was interested in bitcoin in 2012 and as i was shooting my birthday project my roommate was ordering acid from germany with bitcoin and he's like oh look at bitcoin look at this and i'm like bro this is so above my [ __ ] head like i'm just i gotta go find someone whose birthday it is today [Laughter] so i was always enveloped in like the creative process where i couldn't even like entertain that but i always knew about it and i was interested but i didn't know how to do it and then in 2017 i bought like 20k a bitcoin and i got wrecked and then welcome to the club yep class of 2017. and then it felt good to get wrecked because i got wrecked with tesla too and i was like all right well i guess i suck at this [ __ ] gotta stick to making art and then you know i saw ethereum at the time i bought like a little bit and i'm like what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] i don't even know what ethereum is like what is this you know bitcoins the real store of value here but ethereum like i don't get it like i actually was like more about litecoin than i was about ethereum because i was like oh bitcoins digital gold then like coins digital silver i get it and ethereum i don't even know what the hell this [ __ ] is until nfts i really truly understood why it's important and valuable and like okay now i see like litecoin's a scam and actually ethereum is is almighty and even better than bitcoin because of how it can be used in so many different ways and in coding and and also like because i made money with ethereum it kind of like won me over i was getting paid in ethereum uh how are you getting paid in ethereum through selling nfcs ah okay so when did nfts first come on your radar in january when i was doing clubhouse stuff and like everyone on clubhouse who was an artist was either in an artist's room or an nft room and you know everyone was talking about nfts everyone was minting everyone's talking about it everyone's talking about digital art and i was like you know what i'm gonna [ __ ] my photography i'm gonna make twin flames and you know g money was the person who really inspired me to do the individuals wait so did you like discover ethereum and really like ethereum before you discovered nfts or because you discovered nfts i discovered nfts um just through clubhouse right okay so you was when did you like you know uh fall in love with ethereum like you said that you did when i started when i sold my first nft okay okay so you were you were into bitcoin throughout throughout the bear market bought it at the top of this said 2017 didn't care about aetherium during the bear market i was buying a lot of bitcoin during the pandemic okay okay and i was buying some ethereum and i had a little bit of money in each but you didn't really know what ethereum was all about at that time yeah okay and so so you were exposed to ethereum but weren't like uh privy to ethereum i wasn't sold on it i was just making sure i had each thing okay so you're into crypto before you were into nfts but not like a deep crypto person right right and then and then you may sold your first entities and your first uh nfts were where it's not twin flames was something private that was trying to it was twin flames was the first thing okay and then okay and then uh it was clubhouse that you got familiarized with nfts yeah okay and then how did you meet g-money i met him through instagram like i saw that someone a kenny schechter posted about a crypto punk sale and i'm like who the [ __ ] spends 150 000 on this [ __ ] thing like is a jpeg like i'm gonna talk to this guy and see if he wants to buy my twin flames for a hundred thousand dollars because it's a hundred pieces for a thousand each like why wouldn't they want that if they're buying this so i got on the phone with him and he really like schooled me on nfts and why they're important and why they're valuable and i was like oh okay and he's like i don't want to buy the physicals for 100k i want i want to buy the nfts like make nfts and then hit me up and then i did and i hit him up like a day later and he bought a few and then two days later the whole project sold out and then i was like well i love this royalty idea let's see how that works and you know started making secondary sales and then kept it going to the point where it's like almost 200 youth again so when you were first in some sort of clubhouse room and you heard about nfts did it instantly click with you is like oh i can mint i can make my twin flames photos as nfts no no i was like what are these people talking about i don't even get it and then i tried minting something on variables and then wearables like robbed me and i was like i had 250 bucks in my bank account at the time and i lost 60 bucks and i'm like this is [ __ ] stupid and i hated nfts and then alex mesmash kept nudging me like dude try again like try again like you're one of the greatest artists i've met like try it how did you help you do clubhouse clubhouse okay interesting and you were on clubhouse because artists were on clubhouse yeah yeah i was finding community there and just talking to new people and we're all banding together and supporting each other and and alex mazman just like saw i saw you and somehow decided to look at your twin flames and it's like wow this is super dope this guy should nft it yeah i mean he hit me up he's like dude i love your art i love your i want you to be part of try showtime i want to teach you how to mint nfts like he helped me get a metamask wallet he helped me uh use openc you know he had the openc team verify me and the project and everything it was like pretty easy i think at this time g money is a pretty big nft uh individual these days i think this uh at this time he this was when he was really like starting to come up in the in the nft world literally like i dm'd him after that post and he had probably just made that instagram like 10 minutes before i dm'd him oh really and then he had like five people following and like and i was his first follower i think how did you find him on instagram then if he only had he was tagged interesting and so i was like is this a scam account or i'm just gonna hit him up and see what's going on and then he responded and we were talking i'm like whoa this is real i think he's just making this as a branding project so it's like all right perfect best way to connect with someone is when they're first starting out so this is probably less true obviously at the time that you did it but i would imagine if some artist hit up g-money now and was like yo g-money check out my art you want to buy it he probably wouldn't even answer that dm um well do you know why why he paid attention to you i think because he acknowledged that i was reaching out to him early and i think he respected that and he respects my hustle um and also you know when you when when you're starting out you're you're not fully confident in what you're doing until other people kind of like validate you and for me like all i was helping him do is validate him and who he was as a collector and who what he means to me as an artist and i feel like that mutual respect of artist to collector collected artists really pushed each other forward you know with all the projects we've done and also like inviting him to conversations with the art world people because what i was pretty much known for in clubhouse was holding space for art world people to talk to crypto people and like mediate it and like try to find a middle ground because a lot of art world people were skeptics and a lot of crypto people were trying to show these people what the [ __ ] going on all right so uh masminch was like nudging you into nfts and then uh you talked to g money and said hey will you want to buy all of my physicals and he was like no no no i want nfts and that was when you become more warm to nfts yeah yeah and you're like okay i will and then also the user experience with open c really like won me back wearables like sorry guys that [ __ ] really like put a bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't good it wasn't a good experience it made me not want to do it and then luckily i had alex mesmash like literally like hitting me up all the time and i was kind of like sidelining him until i was like you know what i'm gonna give this kid a time of day we got on zoom he [ __ ] i'm glad i did that and i'm glad he was persistent because i don't think he needs to be doing that anymore he's running a really successful business and i think that's the beauty about being early with everyone around you is being early too as builders they have time for you you know i imagine hitting him up now he'd be like who the [ __ ] are you or you know g money the same like who the [ __ ] are you bro like i'm busy i'm working with adidas and i'm lucky i i reached out and like that's my skill is knowing how to talk to people and you know the birthday project set me up to know how to talk to people and connect with people even if you know they don't have any people that look up to them yet huge i have that foresight and connecting right right how did you determine the prices of your individuals a lot of a lot of uh the meme about artists is they don't know how to price their work how did you come up with a thousand dollars per piece simple yeah simple it's like what is my fair market value now what am i selling pictures at galleries now it was a thousand dollars a one-on-one i i just listed it a thousand bucks point five five eight so you were already selling physical art in art galleries for a thousand dollars a print yeah at 16 by 20. yeah the couch 22 i've heard about artists is that like a lot of like you know galleries or this yeah they won't let artists in because they haven't proved themselves but then there's that questioning tool you're not letting i can't prove myself because you're not letting me in so like where where did you get like the the genesis to actually like say that oh i actually get to sell myself for a thousand dollars so i'm you know i like to push the boundaries and also work with the team around me and there are galleries that give artists a shot if they never had a shot before you know the living gallery or the storefront project super chief all these different places petite gallery you know and also renting it yourself and making a name for yourself i think is the ultimate move you know i built a name with for myself with save art space and that also built me a huge credibility in the art world and you know now i have a lot of credibility in the art world because it's hard not to respect million dollar sales but prior to that no one give a [ __ ] about me or my work or my emails until the numbers really justify why they should care which is [ __ ] stupid it should be about the integrity of the work or the work ethic or the people the connections but you know once once they see numbers they really start to change their mind and for me it was really about building my brand building my community outside of you know the walls that kept me out and actually just you know what i'll i'll rent my own spot have my own gallery and bring people in and that's how i always been and you know it's how it is and that's what web 3 is was it a twin flame picture that that was the first thing that you sold for a thousand dollars or was it some other photographs from your other efforts or endeavors my first solo show was um i've actually sold other stuff right i've been selling arts for a while like i would say since 2012 drawings ink drawings paintings okay mixed media pieces um so outside projects yeah yeah i had my first solo show in 2019 um called the cactus diaries and those are cyanotypes 101s and there was 12 of them and i sold that that whole show and i made like 20 000 and you know i only got kept half because the gallery takes half but it was it was really rewarding my first solo show everything sold out all the little pins books candles to the big ass prints to everything like there's literally nothing left that's cool that's cool um so when you saw the potential of minting your work as nfts you didn't raise your price you kept the prices the same so it was the advantage of nfts as as in just another form of the same art to distribute or was the advantage of the nfts that there were potential buyers from all over the world well what did you see in the potential of nfts for you know expressing um twin flames so for me it was it was coming from a place of like if people are buying digital assets with ownership on the blockchain i was working with this project for years putting it on instagram putting on my website putting in a book putting in exhibitions the only natural state in my mind was okay i'm gonna mint it on the blockchain and i minted it in chronological order and i listed at my fair market price and promoted it on twitter and discord and clubhouse and you know two three days later it's completely sold out and people were like holy [ __ ] like photography people were like scared to admit photography because everyone thought nfts were about digital art or moving images but for me it was always like this is the art i make i'm not changing it for anybody and i think that's the attitude to have is you know you don't change your art for the audience you you stick by and you know show people why it is important and it doesn't need to move because it acts on its own so um this is this is really really cool uh there was no like you know debut or production there was just your metamask connected to your open c with your nfts that you had for sale and just through word of mouth of people that knew you that was enough uh that was enough to to sell a hundred pieces at a thousand dollars each well i'll say this i started before i minted everything i was connecting with collectors in the space i was talking to a lot of people and like preparing like g-money or william savas or masmash or you know people and i had like set set buyers and ironically enough like i i hadn't had any twitter presence at all so i was like starting my twitter from xero um and my and i deleted everything i had like 200 followers at the time and i always had problems with twitter i was never able to figure out how to use it like like like on instagram i'm good at it whatever that means but like twitter was always like why doesn't anyone follow me or like my [ __ ] like i don't get this and then when the nfts came around i literally found my community of and support where i literally like left instagram to [ __ ] focus on twitter and i love it so much more because i feel like twitter is like the original blockchain looks like people's posts are over each other you know it's time stamps right spot authentic a chain of tweets yeah right and so my plan was to at my first tweet was like all the press i've ever got for twin flames and like as the ground foundation to show people like this is a serious project and then what my plan was gonna be every day i was gonna post like twin one twin two like this one's for sale or this one but ironically the funniest thing happened you know i made my first sale and then i posted twin flames sold and then you know other people started buying it flamingo dao was talking about buying it and like a few of those members just brought up like a third of the project and then the punks brought up another third and then another third was bought literally by peers and people like myself who are photographers who just wanted to buy it and it was it went quick and and i didn't have to post oh this one's for sale i literally just posted sold sold sold sold to this person this person builds a community with the collector and then people retweeting it and that's when i built the following and then you know i'm like almost 50 000 followers later you know it took me [ __ ] seven years to get twelve thousand followers on instagram and in like four months five months i have like 50 000 followers on twitter and it's like what i've never been good at twitter so i was always like what is going on i finally found my way here right did uh did g money get was able to get his hands on one of the nfts he got five of them okay cool he bought the book cover oh nice and then someone else my friend pasha bought his book the book cover from him for five eth and then i ended up needing the book cover back for the christie's auction so i ended up buying that back for like six eighth and an x copy oh wow actually no sorry i traded him a twin flames i bought for 5b and an x copy for the book cover back and i actually bought the piece of my girlfriend nicole who i met in twin flames the first time i shot her i bought that back from william savas my first collector that i met in that grouping for 60th and like i'm glad because like i never want to sell this and it's my soul mate was the hundred thousand dollars that you made from selling twin flames was that like just was that how massive was that as a windfall for you at the time i was like i paid off all my debt and i was back at zero how how much debt did you have hundred thousand dollars oh my god and how did you rack up a hundred thousand dollars of debt uh i mean not working traveling all my food putting on my credit card all my plane tickets all my rental cars my lodging um my film my scans my paper my uh development uh new cameras because my camera broke you know all these little expenses add up and you know exhibition costs book book costs all these things like it costs money before nfts framing like every the prints right before nfcs what was your plan for paying that off i was gonna sell the project for a hundred thousand dollars to an institution or a wealthy tech fund okay okay so you just took the risk of i'm gonna i'm gonna make this art and then i'm gonna sell this art and i'm just gonna be cool on the other side well i was like i'm gonna make this god is guiding me to make this art i'm driven by spirituality and divine intuition and so i trusted it i took my leap of faith i went through my doubt and i stayed strong like even during the pandemic you know from 2019 after i didn't sell out the project to the world trade center whoever else i was selling trying to sell to i was like oh no like you know i'm getting mail from like american express trying to sue me because i'm not paying this debt and then the pandemic hit and like i'm like emailing every [ __ ] museum to try and collect it and trying to find a home for it because it's a physical artifact and it needed to be completed and then by the time of 2021 with the nfts like i really found a safe haven and and a place to sell it and and you know it became i became a lifesaver in a way that is an absolutely amazing story uh what's next is that is that story over is that is that wrapped no what's left in the twin flame story oh the twin flame story is complete okay that's that story is complete because of christie's was the last thing on the list like having the physicals you know sitting in storage for two years and then it going to christie's and finally landing itself into a museum is pretty much like it's completely out of my hands right the prints are out of my hands the nfts are out of my hands it's like complete it's off it's into the ether and now i could focus on smoke and mirror as my new project right we'll we'll get there we'll get there in a hot second how how much did your how much did the uh the the um the rp said chrissy sell for um the hammer price was 1.1 million dollars and then how much oh is that the hammer price is that the price that it sold for it sells for yeah do you know who bought it oh yeah yeah he's my friend uh cl7 who's a french art collector and he's putting it in his french chateau in 2023 and in the interim we're putting it in museums in new york and hopefully london and germany before it lands in france cool and do you get all that one or did you get all that 1.1 million no i got 900 000 half of which i donated to save art space and 200 000 i paid to all the twins wow what made you decide to pay 200 000 to all the twins it just felt right so they each got two thousand dollars yeah cool well no they each got one thousand dollars and it's for like the ethos of the web 3 spirit of royalties and if i'm collecting royalties i wanted to give 10 of what i made to these people because that's what i believe and i want to share that abundance with everybody because that's what art is for and if i could you know help someone in their time in need and they might not even know what's going on and i contact them saying hey i have money to give you for the project you're in four years ago they're like oh my god you just helped me pay my rent or i needed money to pay for the dentist like you're this is amazing wow over-the-counter royalties that's really really cool um yeah i had a paypal and like venmo and like it's a lot of work so the next the next email is going to be give me your ether oh you love to hear it uh okay so well so now you have the foundat the financial foundation to move forward and uh move into your next project so let's go into smoke and mirrors what's smoking mirrors oh smoking mirrors so how twin flames was the healing project the healing journey i called smoke and mirrors the hero's journey stepping into your power after healing from twin flames and literally like i started this project august 4th 2018 and i just finished it with with the winklevoss twins and the nifty gateway twins the griffin [ __ ] and duncan cockfoster on october 4th 2021 at my christie's auction in front of twin flames so it's kind of like i always wanted to photograph the winklevoss four twin flames but i never got to connect with them i sent them a book on christmas in 2019 and i finally was able to connect with them this year through my success in nfts and crypto and obviously them being twins and me being friends with griff griff and duncan and connecting with them and you know showing them like what i'm capable of as an artist and also this huge exhibition at christie's like a high caliber sp art space for a magnificent twin project like what twin in the world wouldn't want to be part of that right right so it was my take in seeing them you know wanting to have them in twin flames but actually finishing smoking mirrors because there's 78 people in smoke and mirrors because it's a tarot deck and they're the 10 of cups and if you look at the card it's like 10 trophies stacked up and two twin guardians standing like guard for the for the trophy and it was like this is the wiggle boss twins i gotta like and right the [ __ ] fosters i gotta shoot them i gotta finish smoking mirrors with two sets of twins in front of the twin flames wall and that is like the maestro like move to complete a double twin completion for both twin flames and smoke and mirrors the photographic process and like the complete exhibition process of the both projects at once and it was like the ultimate synchronicity of completion how how much of a happy accident was that and how much was that intentional i mean you know what i didn't know i was gonna shoot them until like a day before wow so it was really like on the wire and a lot of trust and faith and just knowing in my heart that this is what it must be because this is the dream this is the artist's vision and it's so [ __ ] powerful that you know people like them took time out of their day to come see me and create with me and actually like shatter any expectations of who they think i was and actually built a bond through the twin hood and brotherhood of through art and and and connecting through that sibling-ness and i think that was the ultimate like gain from that meeting was building a true friendship through the art and honoring them because i look up to them because they're the twins the best twins in the world right like the most notable twins in the world and like having them take notice of twin flames is kind of like a huge respect and acknowledgement that i've always wanted from them and seeing that come through through my success and seeing them respect my success you know it kind of felt really [ __ ] gratifying and and now having a friendship with them where i could literally text them if i wanted to right right and that's cool to have because it took it was so hard to get in touch with them in the first place right and that was so easy well justin you're the who you are as a character is it deserved deserve it oh my gosh deserve it of all the success that you had so congratulations for for getting to that point and finding a vehicle for to have all of your art as well respected as it is um thank you man and i think at the end of the day like my ultimate goal as a photographer is to meet world leaders and somehow create a peace among men through the portraits and if i could be that character in the world where there literally like stops wars through the authentic relations of of art and connection and showing humility through the portrait and the people i think that's the ultimate goal of an artist you know artists kind of like hippies like they want world peace they want you know everyone to get together and be friends but like you know like the only way to do that is to create create those experiences for everyone how have nfts um to you as an artist and you are a very uh surreal thinker um you know you're you're into the divine you're into the mythology you're into this to the spirit world coming from that angle what are nfts nfts nfts to me are the digital twin of the physical reality the digital twin of the physical reality um do they communicate the same thing but in a different i think i think they're interwoven by context of of the materiality of the subject you know like you look at twin flames the picture and the physical print you look at twin flames the nft there is no difference because the context of the image is the same except the materiality of the physical object and the digitality of the digital object in the metaverse space and i think everything you know everything in the world is literally an nft um it's just a digital receipt or a twin i like to call these things the twin because it literally is it's like what can exist in this world it can't exist in the metaverse and it reflects and is woven together through through our idea of the object do you think um a lot of people and i'm definitely guilty of this are really hype up nfts as this brand new paradigm shift in what it means to express culture um but sometimes i'm kind of worried that that's just a bunch of crypto people shilling their crypto things um but for for you as an artist what do you think nfts are going to do for the world of cultural human expression i just think they make things easier to access and also you know they're assets that are mobile that are you know transportable you don't have to take care of them in a physical space you know because we conceived these things we gave these things value through our consciousness of our beliefs of why we deem something like bitcoin for example why is that worth sixty thousand dollars because it's an idea why is money worth anything if it's a piece of paper it's literally an idea we share in the mythology around money and the idea of of currency or assets that actually make us think these things are valuable and i think as long as that's going on these things will stay relevant and even grow like why is a stock valuable if they're just numbers on a page it's our idea of these things that make it go up or down so you know some people pump and dump like wolf game and all those ponzi's and whatever but like for a true artist it's a means of connecting with a collector or sustaining their life through the work and the crypto collectors are the people who don't want physical things much and they like carrying you know their art collection on their phone just like they have their whole crypto portfolio on their phone or ledger so it's like for me it's just a minimalist view in the future and how we um maintain our assets so so much of your story you can't really appreciate if you go onto openc and just type in twin flames you'll see a very well composed photograph of two twins but the photograph by again by itself doesn't justify the like the 17 eth price tag that that you might see might you see on one of them uh and so 170. excuse me 170 east price tag for a single twin flame photograph without knowing the story that you're telling me here today like that that price tag will seem ridiculous uh but and so much of your story is about drawing deep connections from very far reaches different you know uh phases of your life where dr you know connecting the photograph of your mom uh which was your first picture ever that you ever took connecting that to your twin connecting that to you know um going through uh the trials of being a social human through photography and then connecting that all the way to the winklevoss is is that um obviously that's justin's story but do you think nfts as like these emotional vehicles of meaning also play a role in that or again am i just trying to ascribe too much meaning to nfts no i mean i like i said this project couldn't exist without the digital twin and i think plain and simple because it had the digital twin it gave it a whole new life in a way where people can understand it and access it and support it like never before um through crypto and i think it's important you know for all crypto people and and collectors to actually take serious in the art they're collecting because they're changing lives and they're supporting artists who don't make more than twenty thousand dollars a year when people you know in crypto are spending twenty thousand dollars in for on a [ __ ] gas fee you know not like not really but like you know what i'm saying sometimes sometimes it really puts into context like artists don't need a lot to survive but you know when they have that support and they have abundance and are making 80 000 off their photos or paintings or digital art it really it makes the world a better place because the artists are less stressed and they can actually create more out of not being worried about paying rent and working their day job when they could actually that's why we're seeing a lot of people quit their jobs because their true job is being an artist and there's so much wealth in crypto that's literally generated out of nothing that can people are okay with spending twenty thousand dollars on an artist's life justin what do you want your legacy to be [ __ ] man i just want to keep making art and let the legacy tell its own story yeah you don't want to direct it you want it to unfold it's that's how it's always been it's literally been an unfolding constant unfolding unveiling like you know it's somewhere between the alchemist story and you know siddhartha i would say so with this uh uh smoke and mirrors project coming to an end where can people go look at it what's the is there like an announcement roadmap where should people tune in if you're in my discord you'll get all the alpha um but mostly like i'm in my editing phase if you go to my website you'll see the smoke and mirrors and there's like 18 photos i need to add that i need to edit so you know twin flames took a lot of my year and luckily i was able to finish shooting this year after having a year break from the pandemic and um you know a lot now this year really allowing me to get back in the flow and having a new studio with a gaba gallery to make silk screens because because smoke and mirrors is a two-part project where i have 78 silk screens one of five different variants of how i'm like printing them they're all there's five of the same image but they're all different compositions of the paint and structure of each of those so they're all one-on-ones basically and then the one of one black and white similar to twin flames of the 78 so they exist side by side and these in fact come with the physical so with twin flames you only got the nft digital because the physical was going to the museum and now with smoke and mirrors you get the physical print with the nft just for me as an artist to experiment because at this time in nfts it's so much freedom and experimentation i want to always experiment and change it up and see what what we can you know do any introduce people to the physical stuff because at the end of the day we don't want to go fully immersed into the metaverse and lose our humanity we want to create some sort of balance that reflects and reacts to digital physical worlds and never really going too far into the metaverse where we're gone or too far into nature where we stop caring about tech there's a balance that i'm trying to at least in my legacy i want to fulfill the balance of both these two worlds so we don't lose our humanity that's just another that's beautiful uh i'd ask you what project you're going to work on next but oh i'm already working on it oh you already have the idea i was i was afraid i got a [ __ ] 10-year plan bro yeah okay can you tease us on the details of the next project or is that under wraps yeah it's going to be a super 8 project um cinema ahaha yeah so if you look at my art in a trajectory of where i started the birthday project was polaroids cognition was paintings twin flames was classic color portraits smoke and mirrors black and white and silk screens my new project is gonna be super eight so i'm moving into cinema and then after that i'm gonna be making short films and hopefully feature films and creating a legacy and filmmaking as a director similar to kubrick and tarantino and and lynch and like creating surrealist metaphors for the psyche that actually have a original authentic story that you know withstand you know our social consciousness in in in in the memorable culture yeah you think of the shining twins you see you see that burn into your imagination so it's like i want to create things like the matrix avatar you know pulp fiction shot the shining like very groundbreaking original things how long do you imagine these uh films are are they like gift lengths where they're they're five to ten seconds are they minutes or are they full length features they're like two hour movies two hours you know you're going for the full movie i'm going i'm making seven great films before i die hopefully oh my god you're gonna make movies are you like how far into this are you gonna go are you gonna actually like recruit actors and generate scripts it's going that direction oh my gosh that is absolutely insane dude i'm not gonna write scripts i'm gonna hire screenplays writers to to do it and i'm just gonna direct because you know i have i i'm actually writing a tv show that i've been writing for years so you know you know this is just where i'm at now this could change well i think something that i've definitely picked up on is especially in the 2020s those that are good at many many things are outpacing those that are only very very good in one specific thing and justin you seem like a guy who's into all forms of artistic expression not just one one form uh and definitely a storytelling as well so i'm really excited to see what you cook up with for the rest of your life sir me too to improv like my whole life improv improv that's great i love that i love that justin i think i think to be a good artist you got to be good at improvisation 100 and adapt in every moment 100 um justin what what do you want listeners to know what you want them to do how can they help you i think if everyone recognizes that they too have an artistic ability and they execute it in their life or do what they love the world will be filled with more love justin thank you for coming on lair zero hell yeah dude cheers hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and
