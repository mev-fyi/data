[Music] hello everyone today is article day and we are going to read together the metaverse emerges which is all about a possible proposed theory as to how the metaverse will actually emerge and what it will look like so let's go ahead and dive in the metaverse emerges as the nft mania grows in energy so has the conversation around the metaverse we all talk about the metaverse but no one has meaningfully attempted to actually define it this article offers an actionable proposition about what the metaverse actually is the metaverse will be an orchestration of many different layers and technologies but it will ultimately collapse upon a single shared source of truth that all components of the metaverse will abide by the metaverse will be made up of objects and all those objects must know that all the other objects exist from this foundation we can create a ledger of all objects in the known metaverse as well as their shared history of interactions and stories understanding the metaverse requires stripping into its component parts and then recomposing it into a single narrative of what it is let's dive in but first article legos like the money legos of ethereum my our my previous articles stack upon each other and are important to read in order to carry the stream of consciousness onto the next article this piece is built upon three others that i've written while this article article can be read on its own further investigation can be complemented by reading these preceding articles a bankless nation cryptoeconomic systems like ethereum are the next evolution in mass human coordination from hunter-gatherers to religions to nation-states to digital protocols humans have found increasingly better technologies to operate at larger scales of group coordination ethereum hosts a digital nation in the cloud which operates on bottom-up incentives rather than top-down coercion digital leviathans continuing from a bankless nation the ethereum protocol is an extension of thomas hobbes leviathan but instead of an absolute monarchy or executive leadership control over the the leviathan is shattered and shared amongst the people that compose the body of the leviathan this gives new energy to the idea of a nation by the people for the people and lastly the digital culture revolution the crypto revolution is a revolution in money and technology but the legacy of crypto will instead be a renaissance in human culture ethereum facilitates the creation of infinite different digital cultures as these cultures finally have an economic foundation to stand on this renaissance will unfold by more closely aligning the market value of our assets with our human values building in the metaverse bottom up the metaverse is a new organizing body for the digital age we've but we've seen this before before we define the metaverse we need to define the iterations that have come before it seeing like a nation-state i've recently read the book seeing like a state which illustrates what it's like to take the perspective of a nation-state a nation-state is a unified body of incentives and desires and using people inside of it to achieve those desires the nation state is one single central of registry of everything inside its domain that is worth registering nation states like order and thus employ systems of order to account for all the things of which it has power over we have many ordering phenomena that define our lives by the desires of a nation state so social security numbers your physical address telephone numbers your business ein number the serialization of the people and entities inside of a nation state helps a state become aware of what composes it once a nation state accounts for everything it controls it can also begin to tax everything it goes much further than just serializing people and their businesses according to seeing like a state the current orderly nation-state structure we have is built upon previous attempts to account for the value of the land that tax collectors manage traditionally land would be evaluated and measured upon its ability to produce yield on its crops and nation states would employ surveyors to properly assess the value of the land based on the value of the crops and the land and the land could yield gerd fertile land would be taxed more than arid land because the essential accounting body wants its fair share early systems of agricultural accounting would go so far to map out the land and the types of crops that grew on it aspen trees planted every six feet with six feet wide rows would be used for lumber farming and would be taxed according to the state by tax code number number number number potatoes would be planted every six inches meaning that one acre could host exactly 12 120 000 potatoes and would net the state exactly 50 000 in taxes on an annual basis the nation state would go through strenuous effort to ensure it was accounting for all the value that it had dominion over as knowing this would lead to higher tax revenue for the state this is how wild diverse force would be turned into homogenous crops of one specific type of tree forest turned forest turns into grids of trees suitable for farming for lumber wild plains would be turned into orderly pastures with only one type of crop chaotic unsettled lands would be turned into grids of streets all with numbers nation states need things ordered and numbered and accounted for in order to optimize their ability to coordinate resources the central registry of a nation state needs to be aware of all the valuable resources in inside of what it has control over so it can properly extract taxes and grow the state insight the crypto industry has recently bumped up against the nation state desire to label and subsequently tax everything the tax collecting ability of the u.s treasury has been hampered by the its lack of oversight of property and ownership inside of an economic system that it doesn't control this is why they don't like crypto the nation-state desire to account for everything is good for the health of the system as defined but it comes at the cost of individual freedom the nation state reduces all humans and their property down to serialized numbers for tax collection purposes and that is inhumane and restrictive of individual freedoms which is why there's always pushback against government overreach that's because if the nation-state gets its way the long-term conclusion of nation-states desires might look something like this and this is a scene from neo which is an allusion to how all the robots all the autonomous robots were just farming humans for their electricity the nation state is built upon essential intelligence about the state of itself as well as the world around it it is looking to know the world around it and extract its resources this concept explains the frequent oppression of indigenous cultures by nation states nomads are difficult to tax because you can't find them at one specific location the resources they produce and consume are nebulous and difficult to trace because they are produced in a disorderly fashion nation states don't know how to measure the value of the goods they are produced or consumed in the wild the aka the unaccounted for parts of the world indigenous cultures inherently do not mix well with nation states indigenous people operate closer in harmony with nature whereas nation states want to consume nature's disordered chaos and output ordered civilization we have seen nation states confined and restrict indigenous cultures into smaller and smaller areas of land as the desires of the nation state begin to capture and order the world around the non-nation-state cultures this has become a significant blemish upon the current social structure of the world and one of the greatest sources of stress and inequality across global society if larger and more just human organizational structures are to ever emerge they must be rid of cultural bias over the legitimacy of identities or objects under their domain seeing like a protocol cryptoeconomic systems are capable of managing significant amounts of responsibility previously held by nation states while preserving the rights of the individual to maximally express their desires upon the world around them ethereum is a neo-nation a nation in the clouds with bottom-up opt-in participation rather than an imposed top-down coercion while the mechanisms for participation are different we see similar functions of nation states that are also facilitated by ethereum ethereum also likes things ordered and serialized in fact if you want anything to exist on ethereum you must comply with the laws of the evm want to establish a settlement on ethereum you'll need an ethereum address want an identity on ethereum you'll need an ens name want to deploy a token you'll need a contract address for that you want to buy an nft well your specific ethereum address will need to interact with a specific contract address so ethereum can know what part of the ledger to update ethereum is a protocol for serializing objects into the metaverse you initialize the state of an nft by deploying smart contract information to ethereum ethereum doesn't need to employ land surveyors or have treasury departments it doesn't need labor to understand the value of the resources inside its inside its domain ethereum knows so here is a screenshot of just a typical ethereum address it's got a balance of 1076 ether it understands that value to be roughly 3.2 million dollars it also has 38 tokens objects 38 objects that are housed that are owned operated by this one specific ethereum address and the value of those objects are roughly 1.7 million dollars ethereum knows all of these things since ethereum is an internet protocol it won't ever come knocking in order to collect taxes one of the significant improvements of ethereum as an organizational system is the cost efficiencies in maintaining liveness about the ledger by removing its own material desires of maximal tax extraction ethereum collects only the minimum amount of tax revenue transaction fees needed to maintain the system taxes are paid by those who actually incur public costs to the members of the ethereum neo nation those who those who secure and make state updates to the global ledger object permanence in the metaverse whatever the metaverse is it will require object permanence the items found in the metaverse must behave like the items in the real verse objects in the metaverse must collide with other objects in the metaverse if they don't are they even objects at all metaversal objects must be aware of each other's existence in the digital world this can only be achieved if all objects are known to a single source of truth to all other known items in the metaverse the while nation states assign numbers to objects it discovers inside of its domain individuals assign numbers to the objects that they create on ethereum the process of tokenization manifests the object into the metaverse and makes that object known to all the other objects in the same plane of existence a universe is born this is ethereum's role as a neonation register all the objects and make them interact in defy we call these money legos but in nfts we call this the metaverse writing was invented when humans needed to make records of object ownership in the real world and this invention began the process of recorded history the metaverse will arrive via a similar process first we document the items that exist inside of it upon a universal ledger and then we go and build a digital civilization around that single source of truth which we call the metaverse universal ledger is the underlying skeleton of a metaverse identities are objects like all organizational systems that came before it religion nation states ethereum is composed of people but so far ethereum has had difficulty in actually knowing who the individuals who compose it actually are our human souls and human identity are not something that can be serialized and added to the blockchain that is something exclusively in the meat space layer of the world and it always will be nation states don't care about the human spirit they give you an eight-digit social security number and they move on your identity is bestowed upon you by nation states also it expires every six years so if you don't go to your nearest licensing department there will be consequences in the metaverse you choose your own identity ethereum addresses are free for everyone and aren't individually capable of linking an address to a person i've personally used over 50 ethereum addresses over the course of my time in ethereum and many of those are shared with other humans while my personal activity is largely confined to just a handful of addresses all of the fungible erc20 tokens that pass through these addresses do nothing to actually link a specific identity to that address currency and other fungible assets are designed to remove associations between the owner and the unit currency is supposed to be a faceless apolitical public utility that holds no bias and accepts no information about the entities that use it erc 20 tokens come and go fluidly out of wallets since they're fundable once they are commingled with other tokens they lose any sort of traceability my ethereum address holds a balance of eth uni ave mkr and any other erc20 token just like thousands of other ethereum addresses non-differentiated non-unique indeed i can sell any tokens from one wallet and re-buy them from a wall another wallet without any link between those two wallets as privacy tools like aztec come online i could even send erc20 tokens from address a to address b without associating those two addresses making addresses useless for establishing identity the inherent neutrality of erc20 tokens is a fantastic property that is required to produce a fair and open global financial system but falls short of what is required to host a digital nation in the cloud and this is where the power of the non-fungible token comes in and for the listeners i have a person uh human wearing a shirt that says non-fungible human because we are non-fungible i am me you are you my ethereum address holds cryptopunk 1118 of which there is only one i cannot privately send cryptopunk 1118 to another wallet since there is only one cryptopunk1118 the nft functions as an on-chain object and establishes a chain of identity across all the ethereum addresses it touches rather than the address itself it's the object that the address holds that ethereum is concerned with erc20s do nothing for associating an identity to an ethereum address but erc721s do everything for it as a real metaphysical being people can traverse the metasphere and interact with the objects that they come across in their travels nfts are specific and thus ownership over an nft illustrates specific taste here is my nft wallet on openc you can see all the nfts that i've purchased penguins are cute there are many wallets but there but this one is mine no other wallet hosts this specific collection of human generated objects nfts begin to form a shadow of an identity behind the private keys that control them the nft profile pic avatar movement it becomes trivially easy to understand the human behind an address when people add nfts to their social media profile pictures ens names do the same trick in fact ens is actually making great strides with adding an identity layer to the ens name itself above and beyond just a human readable name appended to an ethereum address i expect ens to play a significant role in aligning human identity with ethereum moving forward ens addresses are nfts too and they contribute their own unique layer of identity to on ethereum serializing humans on identity ethereum doesn't bestow your identity upon you the way a nation say assigns you a number at birth you choose who you are on ethereum ethereum doesn't know that you're a specific human nor does it care but when you purchase an nft especially one that you put as your web 2 avatar you are selecting one specific nft from the millions that exist to become a digital representation of your digital self i've chosen cryptopunk 1118 from contract address 0x b473 blah blah blah as a representation of my human taste and human spirit as i've chosen to bestow the properties of cryptopunk 1118 to a random ethereum address i've chosen my ethereum address and i've determined what is my identity in turn ethereum becomes aware of this presence of a specific identity that exists which is molding ethereum by instantiating instantiating specific identity properties inside of one ethereum address with the association of specific objects in the ethereum metaverse that ethereum address stands apart from the rest it has come in contact with a specific set of unique nfts and these non-fungible interactions distinguish it from all other addresses that exist inside the metaverse it has its own traceable path with its own unique story to tell only it has taken its path and that has made all the difference nfts are how humans become an identifiable object to the state of ethereum not the nation-state of ethereum but the state of memory of the ethereum virtual machine weird how they use the same words a renaissance of identity ethereum identity flips a script on how we know it under the nation-state model on ethereum we choose our identity rather than have our identity bestowed upon us in the form of an eight-digit number ethereum asks us what defines you in the renaissance and time marked by the rise of the individual out of the tyranny of oppressive top down religion we saw a transformation of art from 2d profile to and primitive perspectives towards 3d representations and photorealistic styles i believe the metaverse offers a similar paradigm shift upon the properties of identity we are on the cusp of a 2d to 3d transformation of identity in the physical world our identity is largely tied to our physical form so much in fact that nation states use skin color eye color hair color sex and height to register your properties to its central database so it can keep track of you check your identification it's all on there the physical properties of your human form simply aren't relevant to ethereum ethereum has no way of knowing your skin color nor does it care there's nothing stopping some humans with some specific physical properties from selecting a digital representation that is entirely different from the dna that they were bestowed by birth this pr the practice of mindfulness teaches individuals how to separate their mind from their body and to be more aware of their internal processes as an independent as independent from their the processes of their physical body your human form is an overlay upon your human spirit while these things interact they are also distinct given the opportunity your human spirit could in theory choose to embody a different vessel your face is just what you see in the mirror you are you here's a quote from suzu that says we bought punks and other nfts because they are undeniably part of the broader story of digital scarcity meme economy collective capitalism metaverse and mind-body dissociation mind-body dissociation is interesting digital metaverse representation representation i fo mode into my crypto punk after people pleasers fortune magazine cover debuted and let's blow it up here it is so you can see a lot of different characters in there right a lot of different characters doing some different things and let's read about those guys the cover is full of references references to crypto twitter personalities there's crypto dog loom dart band tag tetra node santiago santos kobe and others as a crypto twitter personality i was super bummed that i wasn't included in the cover every crypto person had an opportunity to be a part of crypto history but it became immediately obvious that i was never going to be included in this piece of art at the time my twitter and or social media avatars was a picture of my human form there were no humans in people-pleasers images there were only digital representations that was the point criteria for inclusion in this historic piece of art required a digital non-human representation of identity people people pleasers art was a slice of the metaverse and the human form does not compute inside of this plane of reality rest of the metaverse identity is the first thing that arrives in the metaverse but as soon as we establish ourselves next comes our things as soon as humans evolved from nomadic hunter-gatherers to agricultural settlers we started collecting things similarly as soon as we're capable of settling settling in the metaverse it's time to collect things metaverse loot just this week in ethereum we have seen something brand new capture an insane amount of attention and energy loot for adventurers was dropped on the 28th where 8 000 bags were minted each with eight different items each with their own scale of rarity on openc the items look like this a a image which looks like just a list of things it's just a bunch it's just a list and that's what the nft was previously nfcs have been about a specific jpeg the nft generative art or nft profile picture movement has been centered around a purchasing a specific jpeg that have come to be associated with ethereum culture the jpeg standard is just a specific cosmetic layer upon an object that doesn't actually hold any cosmetic information about itself so when you buy a loot bag this list up here are you buying a jpeg that is a list of items no the jpeg on openc is just an illustration of the token not the token itself these loop bags these loopback tokens have properties that create a set of objects and bestow these objects with unique properties openc hasn't updated to render the properties of these objects but more specific websites like 0xinventory.com are capable of expressing the relevant properties of loop bags so if you take a token uh like you see up here and you put it into this new website the one that is more capable of expressing the properties of the token you see more properties of the token you know there are different rarities and the items that are actually in this token are colored that's because like i said the token isn't a jpeg the jpeg just shows what the token is and different parts of the internet can show what it is differently xerox inventory app website is rendered is rendering a higher resolution version of the metaverse as it relates to the loot tokens it uses the properties embedded inside the tokens to make cosmetic changes to its front end these changes are primitive and simple the text that identifies the object has changed color based on rarity the changes that 0x inventory.app brings to the world are just surface layer changes that are simply illustrating the properties of the tokens themselves whether they're rare epic legendary or just common but this is the first step that tokens must take in expressing their properties into the metaverse that's rendered around them today your token changes the color of its own text on a website tomorrow the metaverse manifests specific digital objects into your hands and changes options that are available to you loot forks what did the loop project unlock potentially nothing it's brand new and no one knows anything that is four days old at the time of writing has an unmeasurable amount of risk to it but ever since the genesis of loot project derivative projects have been spun up to attach or append value upon the loot corner of the metaverse while this corner of the metaverse is completely unstable this model for establishing how the metaverse grows has gained precedent this new model has pushed expression to the surface while value and utility are embedded deeper into the ethereum protocol a few people have noticed the potential behind this model by embedding tokenized properties into a deeper layer of the technological stack you optimize for maximal cosmetic choice while establishing a single source of truth of objects of object properties inside the metaverse this helps reduce complexity and development costs related for developers while giving freedom and creativity and expression to users so here are some forks that have been spun up ability scores someone has spun up ability scores contract and created stats that can be bestowed upon the bearer of these loot objects they're basically rpg stats that are common throughout legacy games after all ethereum is a money game landscape so strength 9 dexterity 7 constitution 13 intelligence 12 wisdom 12 charisma 12. characters another another spin-off contract was spun up to establish the first manifestation of a character that weighs way that wears all of the loot that is held inside of a loop bag there was no relationship between this and the original loot team it was just spun up by like-minded participants who wanted to append additions to the loot ecosystem troll priest luck faith etc realms realms were able to be minted by loot bag holders and there's some kind of generative map out of of an imagined universe that could theoretically surround the loot it's not yet known how it will interact with the above objects new section a generative metaverse the metaverse will be rendered at the periphery ethereum cannot dictate what the metaverse will look like it can only host valuable objects that it holds the metaverse cannot be determined by a single source of truth that is fundamentally unscalable rather the metaverse will be rendered locally based upon a local set of rules and properties while but while the metaverse will be rendered locally the valuable objects inside of that metaverse will be common and interoperable composing the metaverse whatever the metaverse is it will compose itself as an emergent structure there will not be a specific genesis moment or location but rather the metaverse will slowly manifest all around us the metaverse will be a composable unit universe whose objects are shared and interactive in order to become more immersive the metaverse will have to manifest it cosmetically the computation to produce a cosmetic layer upon the metaverse will not come from a blockchain that's technologically unfeasible it's much more realistic that the metaverse will be rendered by parameters that are determined by the local rules of that relevant metaverse the fortnight metaverse will manifest the fortnight rules will be manifested by the fortnite rules and the axi metaverse will be rendered by axes rules and decentralans metaverse will be rendered by decentralance but what makes all of these separate parts part of the metaverse is the shared registry of metaversal objects just like the sms and tcip protocols the metaverse will be built upon a protocol for identifying objects if it matters in the real world it can be represented by a serialized object in the metaverse the metaverse may begin with many distinct and incompatible silos these separate silos will only acknowledge certain spec specified objects that are relevant to that corner of the of the metaverse and the only connections to the rest of the metaverse will be via deep connective structures like uniswap or openc many items will only be relevant to a specific locale of the metaverse but they will be connected by underlying liquidity layers of ether unisop and openc just but just as defy slowly migrated from separate applications into a single universal financial structure the metaverse will stitch itself together via similar money lego mechanisms the metaverse will grow by appending larger and more seamless components of a metaverse universe upon a central foundation of assets and object identification it will slowly manifest into one composed alternative dimension of digital existence specifics on how the metaverse actually manifests will be determined by the unique rules of that particular corner or niche yet one thing is certain the metaverse requires a central asset registry a layer of financial applications and an economic engine this is what ethereum is ethereum is a registry of tokens a composition of defy applications and a native money and economic system composed together these are the underlying foundations of an economic system for the metaverse ethereal desires we began this article illustrating the desires of a nation state and alluded to its physical nature and alluded to how its physical nature establishes material desires upon the land over which it controls cryptoeconomic systems like ethereum are a step function improvement between the relationship between the individual and the social organizational structure that ethereum offers rather than to evolve humanity into a yield farm that it harvests ethereum is a public good system that optimizes for minimal value extraction rather than telling it how it is the people of ethereum tell ethereum what it is rather than optimizing for rent seeking ethereum charges based on the size of the object in data terms and the complexity of the its interactions with the objects around it state level taxes all economic systems we have seen in history have had some sort of tax collection system all systems need to maintain self-protection and the stronger the economy can finance its own protection the better the civilization does i wrote about this in ultrasound money eip1559 collects taxes proportional to one's use of ethereum the more data you put on chain the more you pay rather than taxing wealth or income ethereum taxes you based on your consumption of a public good which is block space as the metaverse expands more and more objects will arrive inside of ethereum's block space and some portion of these objects will have continued on-chain interactions with other objects which will require state updates on ethereum in order to update the state of the surrounding metaverse the vast majority of objects interactions in the metaverse will either be executed via rollups in a hostile environment or like the wilde for the runescape fans or on a trusted database inside of friendly environments but even as layer 1 transactions become cheaper and more efficient this will largely be offset by a cambrian explosion of metaversal objects and object-to-object interactions the metaverse will be no friend to cheap gas prices which thanks to ethereum monetary policy generates a flywheel of security around the ecosystem as the metaverse grows larger ethereum becomes more secure making the metaverse itself more secure with it eth is metaverse money the meme artist price and eath was created during the winter 2020 nft boom as everyone noticed that nfts were valued on each terms crypto art is just the beginning of course naturally the metaverse will start with the highest valued speculative art pieces before it matures into a more functional intertwined ecosystem while the metaverse is in its early phases it will be siloed and separated the only unifying thing about the metaverse will be the underlying financialization layer aka d5 that establishes a common economic base between all the sub-zones of the metaverse the first commonly shared aspect of the metaverse will be eth eth is a common money that unites all separated silos of the metaverse upon a single liquid asset while objects inside of axiomfinity cannot yet interact with objects inside of gods unchained they can both be bought or sold for ease allowing value from axiomfinity to be passed towards gods unchained or any other part of the metaverse money will be the first thing that ties the metaverse together and eth is that money conclusion this image was recently shared with me on twitter on the surface it illustrates an overhyped nature of the use of the word metaverse and how it is so non-descriptive that it doesn't actually illustrate anything it's simply a hyped word that everyone wants to align with and the image is a graph of titled technology terms used in startup descriptions and tech articles 2020 multiplayer game virtual reality experience augmented reality filter 5g connection ar cloud digital avatar digital events e-commerce blockchain internet social media but in 2021 it's metaverse metaverse metaverse everything is described as a metaverse i said in the here's here's my take on this i think this meme i think this is a meme on the surface but it's actually much more profound than what let's on all technology is progressing towards a unified body the metaverse will build itself and beckons towards those closest to help helping it achieve this a metaverse is an object that calls towards its surroundings it wants to be built it just needs the humans to do the building for it like the protocol sink the metaverse is an object that attracts it rewards those who contribute to it and the more scalable structures find themselves embedded deeper within this holistic structure the nft mania has begun with jpegs but there are so many more file formats we must get through before the metaverse is established when it comes when it comes to how this will all unfold your guess is as good as mine i can only leave you with the same lessons that we have learned over and over again throughout crypto fair launches work leaders matter and we're going to ape into something until we figure it out i'm looking forward to exploring the metaverse with you all it seems we've just recently discovered massive untouched new fields so let's build something cool thank you everyone for taking the time out of your day to listen to this and let me know your
