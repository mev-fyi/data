ethereum price prediction we've got the base 2030 case 11 849 we've got the bear case but 343 dollars for the price of eth and we've got the bull case of 51k all the dates there by 2030. what are the dials in this model and take us from 300 eth to like 50k eth the biggest principal components to this is the understanding of what the underlying markets will do in terms of adopting crypto so with the first level just be what's the adoption of those underlying businesses the next is what kind of Revenue will ethereum get from those places and the next level down is what percent of the crypto Market is is ethereum then so if reach the ball bearing base cases we tweak ethereum's market share to reflect that outcome so that's kind of like the idea for how it works
