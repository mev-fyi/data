these crypto assets are these magical coconuts when they're going up they grow brighter and brighter green the more they go up we really identify with them we tell everyone about them so the more they go up the more they're these magical green coconuts that we just can't possibly part with if you don't set a plan to part with them then you're so emotionally attached that you can't possibly sell them to the downside they become these red decaying coconuts and you're like oh my God I had so many beautiful green coconuts and now they're all withered that pain then causes you to act irrationally and people to capitulate sell the bottom I think this is the first time the word coconut has ever been uttered on the bank
