[Music] welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david this is the part of the show where i usually introduce our guests but our guests are going to be ourselves on this show so how are you doing today man oh good i am in colorado uh so a weird show in a weird place but it's gonna be a really fun topic today you know uh you say it's a weird show but we used to do a lot of these types of shows in the early days of bankless um so for context guys we're going to dig deep on a theme that theme is the metaverse david wrote this fantastic article i think it's the best article i've ever read on the metaverse it's called the metaverse emerges and we're going to discuss that in depth but we see this in the old days a whole lot david where would just be like before we had guests before anyone wanted to come on the bankless podcast and say hello it was just you and i digging through a topic together something we'd given a lot of thought to and i know you've given a lot of thought to the metaverse so this is almost like a throwback to our roots in the episodes we used to do where we would deep dive on a given thesis like the protocol sync thesis came out of this um digital nation ethereum as a digital nation ethan's money came out of this even the bankless meme came out of some of these early conversations so i feel like this is a throwback to our old days yeah absolutely like we say uh behind behind the the scenes of bankless that bankless is a thesis driven media company and when we stumble upon a thesis that i think we think is valid and deserves to be like shared and propagated uh it's time to make a show about that so uh it's been a while since we've come up with a new a new thesis around just listed i listed a bunch of them off um but every now and then uh i think we have some good ideas and so we are going to explore this thesis and see how it can predict how the metaverse emerges hence the title of the episode or the yeah the episode actually i think this is like so um this is also another lens through which you can see crypto right the the lens of of seeing uh it through like a metaverse essentially um i tweeted this out recently it's like just super simple right so one if you believe everything is going digital right most people believe that you know two people like to own things right they like to own their own property everything going digital people like to own their own property well number three they're definitely going to want to own their own digital property right so like two plus two is four that's the entire thesis of crypto right right humanity is going digital people like to own things people are going to want to own digital things that's crypto in a nutshell and if you believe that's true then like crypto's got to have a bright future and i think that the metaverse sort of fits into that because what we're doing in crypto is so like i guess the metaverse is hard to define maybe we'll get into some definition of it but what we're doing in crypto is we're layering kind of this object permanence on top of it this digital property right system raoul paul when we had him on the episode last time david he defined the the metaverse as digital fluidity and i really like that concept too but what are we going to be diving into today what's the the high level here yeah exactly extrapolating on what you said once we have digital objects and objects that exist only on the internet then it's up to the internet and the things that we do on it to build a world around those objects because we're not going to build a physical world around those objects we already have a physical world with physical objects now that now we have digital objects but what we are missing is a digital world but i think this whole digital world of which people have started to call the metaverse begins with a base of digital objects uh and so the the fundamental thesis about this whole idea is that the metaverse emerges out of a shared registry a shared state of truth a single source of truth of all known objects in the digital universe which or the metaverse so that's that's like kind of the skeleton for the whole entire thesis and then um the the other concept is that like the metaverse is rendered at the periphery but the objects are stored locally right it's stored centrally and we've seen historical anecdotes for this historical references uh and that's also kind of why i think this thesis has a decent uh amount of like foundation to stand on is that we can look back into history and see a similar pattern emerge with regards to and this is where we were talking about with the emergence of like the whole bankless nation digital leviathans crypto bitcoin ethereum these are digital nations in the clouds but they are just extensions out of like these same social scaffoldings that we've seen come before them hence the nation state and what does the nation state do really really well it provides like numbers and serial numbers and like business tax ids it like it also likes to serialize and account for things that are inside of its domain inside of its borders and once the nation-state knows what's inside of it and it serializes all valuable objects inside of it then it actually starts to build a civilization around that and that is kind of how the nation state has in you know there's many different ways to describe how the nation state emerged but that is one in my mind uh how nation states were born is like they discovered that they have valuable things inside of them and they started to account for those things uh and build a world around that all right so if that sounds interesting guys that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today how the metaverse emerges how crypto is playing a key pivotal role in the emergence of the metaverse david i feel like uh since the beginning when we started bankless it's really been a quest of us trying to figure out what crypto is trying to figure out what bitcoin is trying to figure out what ether the asset is and what ethereum is and we've used many different analogies and many different mental models and this is yet another but i think it's going to aid the listener in sort of understanding this space and also understanding a where to spend their time because that's a valuable resource but we b where to invest their money as well right so like um i recall kind of early definitions of of ether even 2017 some people weren't saying it's money but um they're saying well maybe it's money in a limited use case for icos like ethan's ico money then defy came about and it was eth is d5 money then nfts made a big splash and it's nft money and we talked about eath's supply scarcity in the future with eip 1559 ethan's ultrasound money and now maybe ethan's turning into metaverse money that is kind of a tantalizing conclusion that i hope we get to at the end but david let's um let's zoom back out to the 20 000 foot view here and talk about some of these bankless concepts that we've talked about before you kind of hinted at them um a little bit but i think for people who aren't familiar with some of our previous episodes some of the stuff maybe bears some recap but you talked about crypto economic systems as a nation state and we put out a bankless podcast called the bankless nation all about this um can you talk about that mental model for things why do we refer to things like the bankless nation why do we talk about ethereum being sort of the successor uh to the nation state what's uh what's the concept there right so um bitcoin ethereum crypto economic systems they take a lot of responsibilities that nation states have and they take them and say hey we can do this better not all of them uh you know if your house is on fire or if you are have a robber in your house you are calling your nation state services right ethereum's not going to save you but many many other things uh largely uh to do with property rights management is something that we can actually outsource to ethereum to a a digital ledger that exists on the internet and especially for our digital goods uh and so certain roles and responsibilities we can actually take away from the physical nation state and add it to the digital nation state which is you know a ledger in the cloud which is a theory and the best thing about you know these digital protocols bitcoin ethereum crypto is that they don't have borders right they are on the internet uh and so we have seen this trend over time of society going in from to larger and larger and larger social scaffolding structures nick sabo calls this social scalability started with hunter-gatherers move towards like feudalism we'd start then move towards religion then towards nation states and now we have these crypto economic states um and so we see humans adopting more and more scalable social structures that have less and less restrictions less and less censorship resistance more and more credible neutrality and operate at larger and larger scales and so the whole concept of the bankless nation is that well nation states used to make the money but now the crypto economic protocols can make the money nation states used to account and uh uh have a property rights system and now we can give that role and responsibility to the digital nation states um you know uh physical nation states have a court of law and uh metaverse nation states have smart contracts right and so some some of the almost most significant parts of what a nation state does uh in my mind ethereum does better and the more and more that we can allow ethereum to do that uh the better the the larger of a global civilization we can become that's just it too it's like i i think a big realization for me was after i read the book sapiens i know we've talked about that a number of times on bank list by uh yuval harari and he talked about the the major distinction between sort of you know animals and humanity is humans have the ability to share stories and coordinate right that's what all of our technology allows us to do is to scale coordination that's human beings superpower we're smarter than animals but like not by a lot right it's really when human beings kind of combine and form groups and create these shared narratives the legal system as a shared narrative an llc a corporation these are shared narratives um money fiat all shared narratives that allows us to scale essentially are our civilization and our coordination endeavors and that's what blockchain that's what crypto is allowing us to do too it's a new social scalability technology that we've unlocked um maybe we could spend some more time contrasting this with the nation state so there's a book i know you've told me about that i haven't read yet but um i want to read it but maybe maybe uh if i don't get to there's a lot of books on my list give us the tl dr of this book so it's called seeing like the state and what's what's this book about what's what's it saying what were the takeaways for you after reading this thing yeah the book is about trying to illustrate a perspective of what it is like to see like a state as in take the perspective of a nation state if the and this also alludes to uh one of the articles i wrote called um the digital leviathans or straight up leviathan by thomas hobbs thomas hobbs illustrates the nation state as a composed body a single body like a like a gargantuan titan like walking the earth like that is a the concept of the leviathan and the leviathan it's made up of all the people of a nation-state and that gives power and control to like the executive branch which is like the head of the leviathan and so what is the the book seeing like a state is like okay what if you were actually the eyes of this leviathan like what if you were were the brain uh and he talks by the way before you go on before you go on david what's so interesting i think people don't think um a lot about this but the nation state is totally a human invention right right so like when did thomas hobbes live is this like 1700s yeah i think he wrote this in 1781 i hope that's right and this was kind of like the um at the the conclusion of sort of feudalism and aristocratic type powers and the beginning of the nation-state era right 1700s then 16 1651 i was a little bit uh yeah really early okay 1651 right so like he was an early uh i guess philosopher yeah philosopher on the nation state but before that like nation states didn't really exist at least not in their their present form right uh and so he was using this metaphor the leviathan metaphor to talk about what the citizens the body kind of giving uh giving up some of their individual sovereignty in exchange for some basic services from the nation state like military industry for coordination property rights these basic services that the nation state could give it but there's a sacrifice involved too right we have to as individuals we have to give up some of our self-sovereignty to this levias to this leviathan so uh it can like kind of conquer our enemies and help solve some some major problems for us right right yeah and it also has its own aligned incentives with itself which isn't necessarily aligned with the people that compose the nation state there's a friction there like you have to give up some of your rights and the the leviathan has its own desires right and so that has what i called in the article nation-state desires and the nation state desires are to extract as much value out of the land that it holds as possible and so this is where it's like some of the things that we all abide by on our daily lives have come from and as a res and nation states if they want to extract the value out of their domain their dominion they need to understand what's actually in it so they can actually figure out how to extract it uh and that's where some of the like these registries uh and accounting systems that nation states have come up with uh have been bestowed upon us as individuals uh if you live in the united states you have a social security number uh you have a telephone number you the the government knows where your physical address is if you have a business you have a business tax id number so you know to where like where your taxes are are going to come from uh and these numbers are like the more modern versions of these these things but they started even earlier according to the book where like uh nation state like land assessors would go out and evaluate the land of land owners and say like hey this land is really fertile and it can grow this much crops um six by six rows of uh aspen trees for lumber uh and that this land will net this amount of yield on a yearly basis therefore we can tax this land this much uh and it's kind of uh uh if you extrapolate that out you see like you know nation states form maybe on like a little settlement on some land somewhere and it grows and grows and grows and it grows into nature and it homogenizes nature it orders nature nature is chaos and nation states are order and nation states need everything ordered perfectly so they can account for everything and that's why we want to give all the trees all the livestock all the animals a serial number and enter it into its centralized industry right exactly it's ledger if you will and the more effectively you can do that the more it can tax the land and the more contacts the land the more can fund the military the more can fund the military the more powerful the nation state is and if it's the most powerful nation state then you get to order the whole world right like this is an empire like a quest to be like a an empire right like maximum growth that's what you mean by seeing through the eyes of the leviathan that's that's what the leviathan sees if you're watching the body of the nation state what's the kind of grow colonize things it wants to you know register things so that it can tax those things right so that it can continue to grow right yeah and that's where i put in my article this uh clip out of the uh the the matrix uh movie where neo is like pulling the stem out of the back of his head as he's birthed out of the matrix and then he looks around and he sees fields and fields and fields of humans as they are just being like sucked dry of their energy from like these robotic overlords like that is like th that art that piece of art is illustrating the same point all of these humans have serial numbers i'm sure right yeah like column number like 13 like row 34 like unit seven like oh there's wait doesn't doesn't neo and it's been a while since i've seen the matrix but i got a like review because the new matrix movie is coming out i definitely want to see that but like doesn't neo have some sort of bar code on his arm as well like in his real body i think he does i think i think that's right yep mm-hmm right okay so i don't think that was on purpose by the uh by the actual uh director of the matrix but like it's a one way like artists know what's up okay so that's what the book is saying if you're seeing like a state you're trying to serialize everything enter it into your registry tax everything so you can grow is that sort of the theme of the book what were the takeaways of that book is it like is this a good thing is this a bad thing or is it just a thing that nation states do it's just a thing that nation states do my biggest takeaway was that like nation states and nature cannot live harmoniously right like nation states need to impose order upon nature and nature is inherently chaotic right and this is why indigenous cultures of the world have have witnessed oppression from whatever nation state like they encounter nation states don't like indigenous people because they're nomadic they don't like use the local fiat currency the value they produce is like undefined and nebulous uh and so like especially inside the united states the united the united states of america have confined its native americas into smaller and smaller and smaller plots of land because like we can't figure out how to account for them uh and so uh we just like give them their reservations uh and then we just order everything around them uh and this has caused a lot of strife in the world the desires of the nation's day are fundamentally misaligned with the desires of the human um and the one of the core theses of the metaverse emerges is that ethereum as a digital rights management system a nation state in the clouds fundamentally improves upon that misalignment between protocol and individual and allows the individual to live more harmoniously with nature because it doesn't impose nation state desires because it's a protocol we have algorithmically removed the misaligned incentives out of a nation state by putting everything into code and saying hey you can't be evil anymore well let's get into that in a second because i think you've uh maybe unlocked uh an interesting um like uh interesting quest there but like i want to ask the question do you think that is is is there some level of this this is sort of a faustian bargain that humanity has made right like we are seeking greater order to improve our technology to to grow further therefore we have to create order out of nature and there are some detrimental effects in in like doing that i mean we could have stayed as a species back in sort of agrarian societies or even prior to that like hunter-gatherer societies would we be any happier i don't know that's a very difficult question to answer it's an existential question but like that definitely has not been the trajectory we have moved in the trajectory of more society more civilization more order out of nature and on the back of that have developed some you know prettiest astounding things some wonderful technology also invented some terrible technologies but um quality of life wise right um you know ask yourself would you rather live today having this conversation talking about the metaverse with all of the benefits of technology or in a hunter-gatherer society i mean for me like i would not last uh i would not last a week in an ancient society i think but yeah what are your thoughts there is this just not a trade-off that that we've had to make as a speech as a species in order to achieve these advances in these unlocks yeah absolutely united united states people humans have been making trade-offs as technology is a trade-off right like we moved from hunter-gatherers to like the agricultural world uh and we moved from being like upright athletic like you know hunters to bending over back-breaking like farmers and now we all have back problems like our backs aren't meant to like bend over and pick stuff up uh and that's and and also like grain is is as a fundamental like part of the human diet not actually the best thing that's aligned with us yet it gave us the calories that we needed to make civilization to do things like learn how to like have hospitals and like like you know mend broken bones and cure cancer and like make vaccines so there's always trade-offs but also technology new technologies can impose better trade-offs than old technologies uh and so while we do are capable of making trade-offs that like do kind of suck we over time can iterate on improved technologies that allow us to make better and better trade-offs hey guys that was all about seeing like a state and now we are going to get into the seeing like a protocol side of this conversation which is of course the beginnings of what a metaverse is before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use d5 if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing v5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitram is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrary can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to labs dot developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitram if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarium so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord okay so now let's look through the eyes of a protocol right so we saw through the eyes of the leviathan and what that looks like and you're starting to get into it but um what does a what does it look like to be organized by a protocol how does the protocol see things isn't the protocol sort of trying to do the same thing at some level we've talked previously david about um the analogy of ethereum being sort of like a black hole and it's just sucking all of this capital into it um ethereum itself wants to organize the world as well it wants to serialize everything right the whole idea in the early days when we talked about ethereum is everything will be tokenized this is nice yeah tokenize the world this is ethereum as sort of a different digital leviathan if you will uh but it is pulling all of this economic activity into its ranks it is trying to serialize everything give everything a like an ether address a contract id a serial number on ethereum uh it wants to take your bank account and serialize that as well uh what's different between the nation state and a protocol like ethereum right it go back it goes back to what i said is that like uh it's all these digital items and now because they're digital now we can start to talk about having sort of nation state in the clouds but also it's a lack of desire for growth right where the nation state the physical nation say is a top-down empire the the ethereum nation state or the ethereum neo-nation whatever you want to call these things um is actually an opt-in nation as in we grow it rather than it's growing itself right so we choose to make ethereum larger by taking our capital and putting it into ethereum we choose to make ethereum larger by figuring out how to tokenize maybe real-world assets or just like create new on-chain assets right so because ethereum is inherently an opt-in system like you are not born with your ethereum address you are not born with like your favorite nfts but when you are born in the nation state you are given your social security number you are all already right no choice what your citizenship was what your social security number is you have no choice uh about kind of the geographic limitations of your physical presence that's just assigned to you at birth right and so like while ethereum is on the same trajectory in the sense that it wants to like envelop the world it's because we choose it to do that we only will allow it to envelop us of what we want to be enveloped by because that is our choice because we are the people that are actually shaping ethereum rather than like the physical nation say actually shaping us and so it's it's it's where the cart and the horse are in related to each other and uh in my mind uh when we uh have these protocols working for us rather than dictating to us how we work um we are more aligned with the world around us what's nice you know that portrait of the leviathan um uh i think it was in your article but it actually has like a weapon in its hand is it like a saber or something a sword yeah i can't remember a sword okay so it's got a sword in its hand um that really symbolizes a primary weapon that the nation state uses which is violence the character right right like this he's the stick uh eric voorhees has been on you know talks about all the times like um you know the ability to throw people in cages the ability to kill an individual the ability to take violence on an individual that is a right that we've only given to the state it's illegal for a citizen to do any of these things to imprison another citizen for example but the state has this ability has this um license over violence the nice thing about something like ethereum these digital nation states is no violence they don't even have the power to instantiate violence the worst they can do is like slash you for like uh breaking a protocol uh rule right and those which you opted into by the way you opted into and they're fairly enforced it's completely 100 transparent you know exactly what you're getting into and it's um the collection of of capital so it's not actual physical violence so the protocol leviathan the digital nation leviathan has kind of a different he has no sword in his hand um he has what he has maybe his code and algorithms he has tokens he has incentives right right and so yeah exactly take out your sword it's all carrots no sticks exactly take out take out the stick replace it with a carrot uh when i made the i made this image for the bankless dao and i photoshopped out the sword and i replaced it with a bankless token and daos are there only like mini leviathans and they have the the one power that daos have is the ability to mint their own token and that's the one thing that they get to do and they get to use that token as incentives right and so like it's incentives only and that's why like there's in my mind going to be a lot less oppression under a metaverse world that uses opt-in incentives versus nation states which you know control and coerce you okay so we've gotten to the state where we've i think established what a digital nation is and how a protocol sees things in a different way still wants to coordinate still wants to serialize it doesn't use violence to do that only uses incentives only uses carrots no sticks um so far we haven't really talked about the concept of of the metaverse right and um the metaverse is something that's very hard to define right a lot of people might define it as kind of like the entire you know human digital experience like the internet is part of the metaverse but in your article you talk about objects object permanence being a key attribute that's that's required to manifest the um the metaverse maybe a ledger of object permanence can you talk about what what you mean by that and how crypto fits into that so we created digital scarcity with crypto that's what that's what bitcoin created um and it that's not actually enough to create the metaverse because btc and eth and and fungible currencies are the fungibility doesn't allow for unique objects to form because these because they're fungible like if you have two two dollars well or two single dollar bills we actually have two dollars right that's the one thing that you have um and so like the fungible nature of currencies can't allow for digital objects and when we talk about the metaverse we're talking about a version of a universe that behaves like our physical world and so we need non-fungible assets and there's no like no surprise that like this whole metaverse phenomenon is coming out on the heels of like the two nft manias that we've seen over the last year or so nfts or non whatever non-functional tokens can represent digital objects that can actually interact with each other and that's really really important in the same way that like i have these two objects here i've got a coffee mug and my phone and in the physical world they collide right if they were fungible the atoms and these objects would just like mesh they would just come and form like a blob they would just come together but since they're separate each one is like you know unique each item i have is non-fungible now that we have non-fungible objects in quote-unquote the metaverse on the ethereum ledger we can have objects that collide and so like i have a handful of erc 721 items in my wallet they're in the same place right and my wallet is like on my ethereum all it is like my ethereum address like my but in the same way that like my nation say address my home address is my address my ethereum address is like oh these objects are in the same spot they're owned by the same individual at the same address at the same location and uh so these objects are allowed to collide right and so these objects in on ethereum these erc721 tokens are going from address to address direct address interacting with each other and that is kind of the the very bare bones of what creates a metaverse that goes from just just having internet currencies and uh and an internet ledger into having an actual metaverse that is what unlocks the metaverse is having digital objects with digital properties that are able to interact and collide with other digital pro objects and their digital properties so you you may you had this line i think in the the article the metaverse you said is the shared registry of metaversal objects which is kind of a def a different definition than i've than i've heard before right so most definitions of the metaverse are somewhat like vague right like we don't really know what exactly they mean but you think this shared registry is really important and this idea of object permanence with like registered items is very important can you get like talk about that a bit more and uh can you get a bit more concrete in terms of like what you actually mean so when people i think the clearest um representation of maybe the metaverse is like the ready player one movie where we all put on our vr goggles and we're in some completely digital world surrounded by digital objects and you know digital avatars and all of these things um is that what you mean when you're talking about the the metaverse is just having something like ethereum be the the registry the property rights layer of all of those digital things or uh help us understand this sure yeah it is really important that there is a single shared state of truth uh and this alludes to like um kind of uh they're kind of needing to be one one single shared state of truth right like we have a lot of conversations about like all these different blockchains out there each blockchain offers its own metaverse but the objects in one blockchain one l1 can't go on to a second l1 because they operate on different codes they are on different protocols and those objects can't interact and so objects on ethereum because they're all on ethereum they can interact and ethereum having the most like you know diverse and rich landscape of non-functional tokens is kind of where why we're talking about ethereum it is where all the tokens uh lie uh and now you talked about like the ready player one now imagine and we just came out of this whole like loot phenomenon thing right where loot tokens are these tokens with eight properties in them and now people are making like websites that you can load up your loot bag with all of the eight items inside of it and then a character emerges on that website holding like your scimitar and your chest plate and your boots and your robes or whatever and so like now that these tokens actually have properties uh they can be bestowed upon a character on a website and then that character can go and interact in like whatever world is created on this website based on the properties that they have right and so like say there's this website that has this game and like in order to get to like level two you need to be an owner of a a scimitar like that's what unlocks level two and this portion of the metaverse can understand and acknowledge the existence of an object that is inside of your ethereum address and then change the state of the of the world based on the objects that you have and that is kind of the early primitive of the metaverse and so like if we're talking about like a ready player one say so we have like this massively successful ecosystem and like you can have like maybe you have a digital car and it's inside of your digital house and like you have your digital crypto punk as your avatar so you have your crypto punk in your car in your house and all these objects are assigned to you because you own them because you own the private keys that owns the address at which they are at which they lay and so now now that all of these objects exist inside the same plane of existence which is the same shared state of truth all of these objects can relate to each other and we can actually recreate the properties of the physical world in the digital world which is what the metaverse is okay so a question there right so what we're talking about is really a digital registry of objects okay um but you can have that in two forms so you can have that in the form of a centralized database registry of objects or you can have that in the form of something like ethereum which tries to preserve um decentralization censorship resistance you know immutability no one can arbitrarily change the rules on you do you think that there is going to be a place for a centralized registry of objects that exist alongside of something like ethereum which is sort of a decentralized um registry of of these metaverse objects will they will they kind of co-exist are there some cases where decentralized is is needed or there's other cases where centralized is needed yeah and this gets into like people's loosely defined ideas of what the metaverse is when people say the metaverse like just think of this ready player one thing um but like i think what's what people are coming to understand is the metaverse is going to be uh it's not going to be one central place uh and so while there can be like central databases that have um you know a central registry of objects if that if that database is siloed from ethereum then we just have like the world of warcraft database or the fortnite database and that's what we already have or the us government database or you know the china digital property management database totally for example totally right as soon as these centralized databases become more interoperable with ethereum and honestly that's what roll-ups are for because what is a roll-up if like arbitrarily i'm pretty sure this is right has a centralized sequencer right and so you know fortnite can spin up their fork of arbitrum have a centralized database of which they control then you can play your shooty shooty fortnite game come out winning an item and then you can take that item back to ethereum and that's what creates it the metaverse your ability to take that item away from one part of the metaverse and then take it to another part of the metaverse and so there are like two um domains in ethereum right now that that i'll bring up one is axio infinity the other one is god's unchained the tokens in these parts of the metaverse and the reason why they're part of the metaverse is because they're on ethereum do not interact with each other but they can value can flow from one to the other right so you can play your axe infinity games make a bunch of money take it over through ethereum through the liquidity layer of defy and then take that over to gauze unchained and then you can the state of the games that you played on axiomfinity can actually allow you to buy other cards on god's unchained we can take this even a step further where like maybe for some whatever reason actually infinity and gauze and chain decide to collaborate and they actually acknowledge the same tokens and so like you have a token that works in action infinity that gives your axi character some item some gift and then you can take that same token over to like god's unchained and it also impacts the way that you play that game over there and so now this is where that shared state that shared registry of items becomes really really important because it allows any ecosystem which wants to freely and openly plug into ethereum to answer to the same registry of objects and so we can all acknowledge these objects that we all share together and have the metaverse acknowledge them rather than like having a central metaverse we have the metaverse just opt into acknowledging all of these digital assets i get i guess um blending a couple of other thoughts that we've talked about on on bankless into this a little bit like maybe there's there's two concepts that that kind of come to mind right because so my take on this david is that we will have like centralized registries of property as well as like these decentralized registers of property settlement layers of property but the decentralized ones will essentially accrue the highest amount of economic value because these are the most you know trustless layers for us so if you get to a situation where let's say china had a digital property management system and the us had a digital property management system right and those two countries for whatever reason no longer trusted one another you know broke some treaties something bad happened right then how do you arbitrate those disputes well you've got this intranational thing that's outside of the purview of the nation-state called ethereum where you can settle higher stakes disputes it's more credibly neutral either china or the us can use the same system and be treated in a fair way because neither of those two countries own the system right so one concept we've talked about before is the protocol sync thesis where basically the most credibly neutral legitimate most decentralized settlement layers property settlement layers kind of start to sink to the bottom and form the basis they are they are the most dense material and other more centralized i guess property management systems rest on top of these things and so then you also get if to the extent that becomes true then you also get another like concept that comes in here which is like the concept of economic density right where one trade-off for decentralization is um like lower throughput um fewer transactions per second right you know things like ethereum are scaling but they're never going to scale at the rate something like amazon web services does in a centralized way right so like it'll always be a fraction of the scalability of a centralized service but like what you can do when you preserve you know the trust uh trustless nature of something like ethereum the trust guarantees is you can settle very high high-stakes economic transactions and so what we'll probably see is for every single transaction on something like ethereum or even even a roll-up more and more value will be like compressed into that transaction space so if the average transaction like today on ethereum is you know ten dollars uh in an ethereum transaction right like maybe 10 years from now maybe you know 30 years from now maybe that'll be like millions of dollars maybe billions of dollars maybe it'll be the entire economic activity of roll-up which is com like entire nation-state gdp rolled up into economic transactions on ethereum so do these two ideas fit into what you're talking about as we as we think about like decentralization versus centralization the idea of protocol sync the idea of economic density and you know collapsing toward the most trustless layer yeah and we can see that play out in the current nft markets uh right now but i'll start with credible neutrality uh and that's why ethereum has had such a strong emphasis on credible neutrality and the crypto space as a whole and why um projects in the space that um sacrifice credible neutrality don't see the adoption that they do and i think people have in the back of my of their minds that like when you sacrifice credible neutrality you sacrifice like almost the entire metaverse right because it has to be an open source software that open that is the metaverse is built on because we no one wants the metaverse by facebook right i'm sure it'll be like really fun and easy to use but like it'll also be just like a complete dystopia and top-down control we have to have fair rules right fair we have to have the um i mean decentralization to me is like an anti-corruption technology right and facebook is very corruptable all you have to do is know one person right majority uh majority share holder rule over over facebook and you can corrupt that entire system right so anti-corruption technology has to be at the root of these things right and that's why bitcoiners are all like very very strong about like don't change the rules of the system you can't change the rules uh and if you change the rules then then like the whole idea about bitcoin is that it offers very very strong foundations ethereum has those same principles like we need to figure out the best way to make the long-term sustainable foundations and once we do we make those foundations rock solid and free opens the ethos of free open source software on ethereum is i think one of the reasons why the metaverse will emerge on ethereum a because it adheres to the credible neutrality of the whole entire system is also turing complete which you have to have turned completeness in order to build the metaverse um and like the combination of those two things like foundations that don't shift permissionless building upon a shared state of truth uh and uh and inherent credible neutrality in the whole entire system those are the ingredients for what creates a metaverse and that goes back to what i was saying where like the metaverse won't actually be one thing it'll be rendered at the periphery as in like the metal verse will look different based off what part of the metaverse you're on are you in the fortnite metaverse are you in the axia infinity metaverse maybe you're in the the zoom chat metaverse but so long as like the and it can be built as as needed by like by local servers local centralized server servers so long as the valuable things that are in the metaverse are adhering to the concept of what you were saying economic density and with a valuable thing so long as the valuable things adhere to credible neutrality the periphery of the metaverse can be rendered however it doesn't doesn't matter like if a gpu crashes it doesn't like you know mess up your objects so let's say you have like uh you know fifty thousand dollar loop robes i have no idea how much these will cost in the future of course um you you have no problem bringing those into a a virtual universe like a world of warcraft or something to that effect um because you still own that object but it's fine if the universe you visit world of warcraft like everything else is centralized so long as your you know items your 50 000 item does not rest on blizzard entertainment and and their shareholders and kind of that as its property settlement layer that's what you're saying right that's exactly right that's exactly right so david like all of this transformation uh maybe we're in the metaverse like right now or we're on our way toward the metaverse maybe um crypto is kind of the like the opening shot of um the metaverse and how we'll describe it in future generations but like everything you're talking about how long is this going to take before we're fully inside these virtual you know worlds do you think in like five years time in 10 years time we're going to be inside of these or do you think it's going to be so gradual that we just like won't even notice right so in the article one of the things i wrote is that um there will not be a specific genesis moment or location but rather the metaverse will slowly manifest all around us the metaverse will be a composable universe whose objects are shared and interactive uh and so like the genesis moment of the metaverse was that like the internet the internet itself was that the first moment of the metaverse or like but like when did the internet actually even come about was it when two computers connected was that the first moment of the internet or like was it when like bitcoin was was the first bitcoin block was mine was that the genesis moment of the internet was it when the first nft on ethereum was minted like when does it actually begin uh and so like to answer your question the metaverse exists already uh no one knows when or how it started uh i think we can all agree that like it's in its very very nascent form um but like it's becoming more and more real uh as more marrow technology is answer to a single shared source of truth of objects it becomes more and more real and i think your question implies like when is the metaverse can be here i think like everyone in their minds go back to that ready player one like when can i put on my vr goggles yeah yeah yeah exists in alternative universe yeah i mean people mean when they ask that right so like i mean at that point we have to go talk to vr experts and say like hey when is this going to be ready when are when is there's going to be an mmorpg inside of er that also answers to objects that i have on my ethereum address and like i'm on kathy wood's side of things in the sense that like the future is coming way faster than people think it is and the best thing about the metaverse is it has an inherent financial incentive to build it uh everyone there's financial rewards to building it and that's why this nft mania has happened so quickly uh and and so like the financial compensation for helping this come about is absolutely massive uh and there are definitely teams who are working on video games that are digitally asset powered uh and i i think i don't know i'm going to go ahead and say like there's going to be asset powered vr games within five years but maybe like maybe to your point the whole vr thing is a distraction right we're all looking towards like eventually it's gonna be ready player one and then that's the metaverse and that's when the whole thing starts but like if you just measure as a proxy the amount of time um over your lifetime that you have transitioned from spending it on like analog things real world things versus like digital things um i bet you'd notice some just a massive increase right like the time you spent in front of a screen for instance is one measure has that gone up or down right like throughout your life right is you to the point where like people don't even go to the bathroom without like having a screen like really close to them you know what i mean like it's just we're always on screens and so that's one measure and how about like your economic activity what are you actually producing well like we've gone from a society that has actually like produced real concrete things and spending our time doing that sort of labor to like all of my output is is completely digital right um you know we talk about communication how that's transitioned i mean when's the last time you wrote a letter to somebody right like but all of our communication i communicate more than i ever have um and to to more people than i ever have but like the proportion of that that's turned digital it's like 99 now what about what about your financial portfolio is that nation state bound or how much of that is non-nation state bound and actually on ethereum instead well that's another flipping right and it's like um nation state bound versus like not nation state bound is one dimension but like if we just talk about digital right man it's already digitized right i i just like i keep a 20 bill on me in in like in my pocket just in case somebody needs cash for something right like every once in a while but um actual like physical dollars fiat currency i almost never use anymore and i haven't for a long time right so like this is the trajectory everything is becoming more and more digital and so we probably won't even notice as we enter the metaverse they're definitely these milestones right like birth of the internet birth of digital scarcity and crypto just like creation of like the first nfts and tokens but uh you know maybe the mobile phone is is definitely another you know piece of that puzzle but like i don't know if we'll really notice as we as we enter and as we transition unless we look across like decades and kind of measure how we're spending our time and our where our outputs are going well the probably the thing that we're going to notice the most is that like our kids are way more into the metaverse than we are it's like they found corners of the metaverse we didn't even know existed and like that's kind of when we'll really know it's like oh yeah it's for sure here yeah absolutely for sure well david we've got some more things to cover i want to talk to you a bit more about identity and how identity can be a metaversal object and also talk a bit more about items maybe we'll hit on the loot phenomenon and we got to end by talking about ethereum what this means for ethereum and eth as an asset as i said at the outset the metaverse is another way of looking at what ethereum is actually going to accomplish what it's going to do in the world so we'll link that in guys before we do we need to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz banklist and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and will say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uni-swap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the una dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless all right guys we are back uh david man we're talking all about the metaverse how it emerges what it's going to look like um and talking about how we would transition into the metaverse i think one thing if you watch like ready player one or something like this you see this concept of an avatar where you know individual might be you know a certain way in their physical life but they actually get to select their own identity in the metaverse and be sort of a different character a different person i think this this concept of identity in the in the metaverse has some implications so what what are your thoughts on this and what did you write about it is this one of the objects that need to manifest and have permanence is an individual's identity yeah and i think this is actually useful if we back up and and go back to the nation state concept of identity just to set the stage once again um if you pull out your id on your like like nation state driver's license or id card like it has your physical properties on it because your physical properties are really really good for identifying who you are so like your skin color age height weight age height weight eye color skin color like gender uh and then so this is the name like this is just your physical form right these are and you can't change these things and that's why like it's a representation of your actual dna ethereum doesn't know nor does it care about any of these things it doesn't care about the physical manifestation of your body it just cares that you are an actual individual and so after that you can kind of become anything on ethereum right you can actually lose connection with your physical form and choose to manifest yourself on in the metaverse however way you see fit um and this actually kind of goes into the same kind of concept of like mindfulness meditation mindfulness meditation is about learning to discover the entity inside of the body inside of the mind that's actually separate from the from the body itself so when you go and look at the in the mirror you see your reflection but that's not actually you that's just your body you are something else and on ethereum it doesn't care about your body it only cares about you and so with ethereum and then like this definitely gets started with like the nft avatar movement but it go i definitely think it gets more rich and and diverse from there you can pick a representation of yourself that you actually feel on the inside like and so like when i was perusing for my crypto punks i was scrolling through properties of crypto punks that i resonate with right i didn't pick the crypto punk that smoked cigarettes because i don't smoke cigarettes uh i picked the crypto punk with a hat because i thought it looked cool i actually don't even wear hats i just thought the hat looks cool so i guess my metaverse version of myself does wear a hat and it can get even crazier than that like you don't have to actually carry any any of the properties of your body into the metaverse it can be a complete blank slate of identity on ethereum and you can use these nfts these uh erc721s as representations of who you are and it also importantly doesn't actually have to be a profile picture nft like it doesn't have to be a penguin it doesn't have to be a crypto punk all identity on ethereum is is specifically erc 721s located inside of a specific ethereum address that's all identity is even if it's just fidenzas or like our blocks one of ones um any sort of nft distinct from uh 20 tokens right because like if i have an uh wallet with like mkr eth and uni tokens in it there's like 10 000 other wallets out there that have that same permutations of erc 720 tokens but when it comes to erc 721s that's how you actually make a unique address on ethereum by having unique tokens represented inside of that unique address and so by curating a collection of erc 721s which represents your taste because these things are unique and therefore culturally significant you can actually dictate your taste out to the rest of the world and so it's kind of like a black box of like we don't know who the person is but we can see their taste their digital representation of their unique assets in their ethereum wallet and maybe one of them is a profile picture nft but like really according to ethereum there is no difference between a profile picture nft and like an art block they're just erc721s it's when humans view these things that actually bestows like an identity layer on these things all right so this ethereum address has like three fidenzas and an ether rock they don't own any profile picture nfts but they're clearly uh somebody that really likes high status uh nfts this person only has like a single pudgy penguin uh that's that's who they are uh and so these entities we can they while they can't actually like the spirit of a human can't actually be on the blockchain like it can instead choose erc 721's 721 to actually manifest itself on the blockchain it's so interesting right because like this idea of avatar is far older than ethereum right like any chat room you enter like even on twitter um you can create an avatar based on any jpeg any image that that you can find and it's all free but what's interesting about what you're saying this idea of object permanence is of course like nfts aren't free they are unique and they have some economic value associated with them and you mentioned um the term signaling right and because of that tied to economic value that's associated with them because of this like ability to to select and trade because these avatars actually cost something they send a completely different social signal than a free piece of clip art that you might find somewhere on the internet and then anybody can can replicate and that's not verified in the ethereum registry and i almost wonder if it's like these kind of like social signaling dynamics that are key to instantiating the metaverse as sort of a more organic type of structure and why we haven't why crypto is going to um foster its emergence remember that the conversation um we had about memetic desire right like you can't really get mimesis mimetic desire the the desire to copy another human being for a free piece of you know clip art that doesn't have any digital scarcity but you can when you see something like a crypto punk and you're like wow that's flashing that crypto punk that like means something and so i wonder if the 721 erc 721 helps to instantiate these sort of like basic human like needs and desires and social signal and creates like um the status hierarchy i guess that we we have in the real world we see without even knowing it and it replicates that into the digital because that's what i'm thinking of as you're talking about like what's the difference between a avatar that you have to pay for that's registered to ethereum and like a random piece of like clip art i mean you could be a you know uh i don't know a sausage if you want in your avatar for free like or like uh you know a peanut human peanut or something you could be a frog you'd be whatever you want not have to pay it what's the significance of the erc721 yeah i think really the answer is that and you touched on a really important point where like you have to actually pay for these things uh and when you pay for something you are signaling to the rest of the world that you value that and when someone takes a peek into your wallet and they see all these 721s they're getting are getting a glimpse of what you value and so what is your identity other than what you value what we value kind of impacts who we are and so like it's a very pure form of like okay this individual really values these things these nfts and these nfts have these properties maybe once a crypto punk maybe an nft is like a credit for like donating towards some charity or some public goods and that is indicating who you are so going back to like removing like the meat space atoms and dna up around a soul when you a soul a spirit like chooses nfts to represent them they are choosing to communicate who and what they value to the ethereum community to the ethereum like to the ethereum blockchain and so you take a peek at their portfolio their nft portfolio you're taking a peek into their values what they choose to value and i think there's also something to say about just like how like the color of your skin or like your background the country you came from so much of society unfortunately bestows values upon accidental properties like the color of your skin that that does not work in the in the world in the in the metaverse right like just because like uh white people have like an accidental positive bias like that actually doesn't translate over to the metaverse because that doesn't work you're you don't have a white colored skin uh ethereum address and so we are actually able to rid get rid of our biases that aren't actually communicating anything of value and instead we get to and bestow our ethereum address with things that we actually value that actually do communicate to the world what we value yeah that's interesting and that's uh that's definitely a very hopeful explanation i i do also wonder if we'll like just create new biases in the process right uh maybe some of these biases will be based on like wealth and capital and so wow you have a crypto punk what what does this mean about this person as an individual definitely it means that uh they're wealthier than the average individual for sure um but yeah that's i guess it's super immersion i guess maybe what's interesting about it too is we just found a way to replicate the social signaling that we have in the real world now in the metaverse and in in the digital world we haven't had the ability to do that before and i think that is uh that is definitely a meaningful milestone in humanity's transition from the analog world to the metaverse for sure um let's talk about this oh you want to say something on that yeah so there's also the topic of just like you can actually have more than one identity you can spin up multiple ethereum addresses and like each have them represent different sides of yourself which is something that you can't do in the physical world like you can't put on a new face and like okay i'm reminded of our uh podcast with the josh rosenthal about the crypto renaissance where like in in the renaissance we had pre-renaissance we had these like planar 2d profile versions of art and then after the renaissance we had these 3d photo realistic versions of art and i kind of think there's going to be a similar paradigm shift with identity because not only can we choose our identity by choosing what represents us but we can choose what represents us at different times so like i've gone back and forth between my crypto punk avatar and my pudgy penguin avatar and my cool cat avatar just how i how i feel like what is my mood today and i can like create a digital identity for myself that is more aligned with my current state of mood or or context of what i want to be in right and so like maybe i choose one ethereum wallet which has no association with another ethereum wallet to represent me for my professional business ongoings and like the suit and tie david or i'm like in video game mode and i want my crypto punk on uh and so i'll choose that identity and so like having a fluid identity where we actually aren't fixed into one specific version of ourselves i think is going to like be a zero to one moment in the world of actual like identity and back to ethereum's role in all of this it's to to serialize all of these objects right so we you talking about loot earlier and serializing all of the the items and objects but it's also going to serialize all of the identities as well including if an individual has kind of multiple identities that they want to portray in addition to serializing all of the assets so maybe we get to kind of the final discussion point here david which is how ethereum fits into the mix here as a as a system and you called it the economic foundation for the metaverse you said a metaverse requires at least three things number one an asset registry number two a layer of financial applications a banking layer and number three an epic an economic engine and you say that's what ethereum is it's a registry of tokens it's a composition of d5 applications it's a native money an economic system and when you compose it together it becomes essentially the economic foundation of the metaverse can you get into that in a bit more uh like how important is ethereum to this whole emergence of the metaverse is it is it the core thing is this what's going to cause it i i think so um the and with the current state of the metaverse and ethereum we going back to like what i was talking about with like we have the axi infinity realm of the metaverse and we have the um god's unchained realm of the metaverse these are disparate discrete separated parts of the metaverse but what connects them is their underlying association to ethereum so like i said you can go and do a bunch of gaming and axia infinity make a bunch of money pull it out and take it over to gauze and chain but when i say take it over to gauze unchained like you got to sell your axi like uh money your smooth love potions or your axes and you sell them using defy defy applications using the financial banking layer and then you can translate that value into gazan chain tokens gods and chain cards and so it's this underlying financial layer and no wonder why defy came first in the progress of ethereum before nfts is because you have to build objects on top of financial applications because that's how we value the objects and so defy is like this early financial primitive this financial backbone that allows the metaverse to be built on top of it and so more and more realms of the metaverse will just get appended onto ethereum because ethereum is a permissionless open source piece of software and so different areas of the metaverse will be built and before we figure out how to make assets seamless in all of them they will be made seamless by their integrations into defy so defy will be the coupler the initial coupler behind all of these separate parts of the universe where like maybe the tokens aren't interoperable but the value is and so labor can actually get translated from one part of the metaverse to another using d5 and of course that is uh facilitated by ethereum's economic engine proof of stake and also uh eip1559 and that supports the financialization of so many different things and all this and the tokens in the financial layer and then that is what then creates the ability to have a metaverse on top of those things and so ultimately everything collapses down deeper and deeper towards again the protocol sync got the nfts and the metaverse on the top got the d5 in the middle you got the ethereum l1 at the bottom and that's why ethereum has always been so focused on security security security like we are going to secure the whole entire metaverse and so no like we can't have proof of work we can't have wasteful electricity spending it has to be the most secure consensus protocol possible because think of how incredibly valuable the metaverse is going to become we have to optimize for security uh and that is why so many so many of the developers of the ethereum protocol when they are working they are working to make the strongest economic foundations for the metaverse possible and that has been like the ethereum r d effort over the last like six years i i really feel like um ethereum as an economic economic engine for the metaverse is going to be a narrative that takes hold uh not this year maybe not next year but definitely in the years to come we're a bit early on some of the other ethereum narratives like you know ethan's money defy all of these things i really do feel like the metaverse is going to be sort of the next unfoldings people recognize that this is the property rights and settlement layer and economic engine of the metaverse that we're creating here and god how much value is going to be you know poured into the metaverse in the coming years uh so i guess the listeners like prepare yourselves um one other thing as we as we talk about this david this kind of comes full circle as well to our concept of of the nation-state remember we established that the nation-state earlier is an entity that likes to serialize things like serialized objects and individuals and people and identities and all of these things in order to collect taxes in order to grow what's interesting here is um i see a similar dynamic with ethereum so it's serializing all of these things in order to collect taxes in order to grow now we don't often call gas fees taxes but we have on bank lists before in fact that's kind of an interesting model to think of all of the network fees all the transaction you fee fees you pay for on a chain on ethereum are actually taxes these are taxes on the objects themselves and these are i guess utility taxes right excise taxes so like when you spend something when you do a transaction you have to like pay the pay the toll um so it's it's kind of a consumption based uh tax um but also with eip1559 some of this transaction fee gets burnt and gets sent to who anybody effectively that owns eth uh in the form of reverse dilution it's almost like sort of a a dividend if you will only it's it's kind of burnt to any eath holder um can you talk about that a little bit do you see this relationship between um the nation state and taxes and ethereum in taxes in how it charges for its gas fees yeah totally uh and when eip 1559 came out and i wrote that article the final puzzle piece of ethereum's monetary policy that is exactly how like we illustrated it is that these are how ethereum collects taxes all economies need to have some sort of value capture mechanism in order to secure itself it just so happens that nation states don't have a stop for that and so nation states are like oh we collect we need to collect taxes so we can fund the military but we can collect more and then after that we can collect even more and after that we can collect even more but in theory by the way we've got these other hidden taxes called inflation right so we can just increase the supply not even tell you about the tax right totally ethereum on the other hand it taxes you based off of your consumption of a public good it is a pay per use it doesn't tax you if you're not using it uh and so like ethereum has a public good it's called block space we can't have too much of it otherwise it wouldn't be decentralized and in order to uh use this block space you must pay the the going rate as determined by the market which is the same rate that everyone else is paying at that one moment but it isn't it's inherently fair incredibly neutral because you aren't paying you're you are by definition paying your fair share and so like it's in my mind it's a it's a very elegant mechanism you also talked about like what happens when all of these objects in the metaverse um objects is actually uh i have very limiting uh coding knowledge but i do know that objects is a code relevant term that is a technical term in the in the world of code when you like i heard hear the code of saying like that basically something i say like you grab an object uh on ethereum now that we have all these objects and like we said the metaverse is a shared state of objects and importantly that shared state allows objects to collide and interact right so like my my my uh armor also like has properties that might help out my sword in like world of warcraft and these objects interact when objects in like objects on ethereum they have like a contract calls you can call an object and that means that ob2 objects are just colliding and when the metaverse has tens of thousands hundreds of thousands hundreds of millions hundreds of billions of objects floating around in the metaverse a that each one has its own serial number because each one had to be like manifested in ethereum by a transaction but now every time an object collides with another object that is also another transaction on ethereum it's likely going to be on a roll-up that's what roll-ups are for um but like all of this economic activity this vibrancy of objects interacting with objects interacting with objects creates an economic engine it is the ec it is the heat of the economy and then eip1559 captures a portion of that heat to recycle it into the ethereum economy to make sure it's secure make sure it's going make sure the engine is fluid uh and that is uh that is the model of the metaverse and that is in my mind really really bullish it's really bullish [Laughter] it's so cool i mean so like um i guess maybe the the last piece to talk about before we get to sort of you know summing this up and concluding this is we've talked about ethereum as sort of the you know economic engine for the metaverse and we've always differentiated ethereum as a network uh from ether as an asset ether as a money that uh is you know an asset within that system within that within that network and so why not talk about the ramifications of eth uh at the outset we talked about the the different narratives of eth over the years starts as ico money then it becomes like d5 money uh more recently it's been nft money you know reserve currency for nfts and now maybe this this new narrative moving forward this new use case is for eth to become metaverse money what's so interesting about ethereum as a digital nation uh as opposed to like real nation states is all of the taxes that it collects there's no nation state on earth that actually like burns a portion of the tax revenue and returns it to citizens in the form of reduced supply right but with a crypto economic system where you don't have to pay for like an expensive military and massive bureaucracy and people in offices and buildings and all of these things you actually can operate much more efficiently and so with eip 1559 of course whenever any of that economic activity happens the taxes are collected and a huge portion of those taxes are actually burnt and passed back to the citizens or the the i guess one form of citizens anyone who owns eth well almost everyone must own eth right in order to exist in the mediver you have to do anything you have to own a little bit of eath at the very least and this is kind of the i guess the bull case back to uh ether as an asset i want to ask you about this so is there the possibility that eth as an asset becomes kind of the the trifecta money for the metaverse a medium of exchange a store of value and a unit of account becomes sort of a reserve asset for the metaverse what's what's your take there and what would that mean for eth as an asset in the future yeah whether or not it's a medium of exchange i think is up for debate i think ether as an asset uh is fundamentally going to be a very low velocity token i do think there's going to be higher velocity tokens on top of ether that use ether as collateral rye comes to mind if we want to talk about like non-state level currencies but even rye actually is kind of collateral optimized but other than that like ether is going to be like your collateral in applications inside of the metaverse inside of games it's going to be how you actually engage with uh games when there are applications on rollups that don't require eth that you do a bunch of economic activity well by proxy that roll up is using ether for you every time it makes a transaction to the l1 and we've been talking about this lately ever since we had our interview with arbitrum is like we kind of think that roll-ups are going to be the biggest eath burners right so all of these roll-ups are going to have a ton of economic activity on top of them and they're going to collapse them down to a single transaction and then put that transaction on the ethereum main chain and that transaction will be a big bundle of transactions and that will burn a lot of eth and so like it's just like ether has like brute forced itself into uh into a massive bullishness by utility and like when ether can do anything in the metaverse by nature of what it is having so much in utility means it can do anything it can be a medium exchange if you want it to it can be your collateral in your metaverse if you wanted to it can do anything the the other thing as well is um if the metaverse does emerge in the way that we've been talking about today right you have to ask yourself what is going to be the reserve money the reserve currency for the metaverse and i think it's pretty safe to say it's not going to be a fiat currency oh okay 100 it's it's not going to be us dollars it's not going to be you know uh the digital r b it's not going to be the yen it's not going to be the euro right that is a foreign currency inside of the metaverse whereas foreign invader right ether is a native currency of the metaverse and has a specific set of properties and and rights and has higher status right so like if you believe in the metaverse thesis and that this is essentially um how humanity is going to evolve over the next you know decades to come into this into this digital age then you have to ask what currency what uh store of value asset is um the leading candidate to become the reserve asset of this space right uh and any list that doesn't have ether at like number one first place from a probability perspective other things could happen other you know currencies could emerge um this could play out in kind of a different way that we don't foresee but um it seems so clear to me that ether is like the number one most probable asset to uh to take that to take that rule and to be that reserve currency ain't going to be fiat right unlikely it's going to be something like bitcoin bitcoin does not have the surface area to host or support a metaverse and all of the eath killers that i've seen to date david have made trade-offs that make them much more centralized and less likely to become the settlement layer for the metaverse so kind of full circle here a little bit on bankless where you know from the outset we've um we've been looking at different lenses to to view some of these crypto assets we've long recognized that bitcoin ether are some of the most important but i think this um this lens that ether is going to be the reserve currency of the metaverse is is something new and i think could give a could give this whole thing even more legs right like 10k 20k price of eth um yeah that ain't nothing right compared to uh what this could become and what this could be right during the 2020 nft phenomenon during like the fall winter there's that meme that came out where like um art is priced in eth and i think that was actually early premonitions of what came out of this second nft phenomenon which is eth is metaverse money uh the fact that uh when people when people value like crypto punks or art blocks they don't price them in dollars they price them in eth and i think that's just indicative as like the rest of the metaverse will be priced in eth well sum this up for us david i think your article ends with this uh this interesting kind of um table maybe maybe it's a meme but maybe you can describe this for the podcast listeners and this looks kind of simple it looks kind of uh cute maybe dumb but you also say that there's a lot of nuance here so why don't you describe what we're looking at and talk about this yeah it starts off it definitely is a meme but like i actually think it's really really profound and like we always say on bank this memes are representations of the truth and so the title of this chart is technology terms used in startup descriptions and tech articles and it has two columns it's like a pre-post it's like 2021 201 2020 versus 2021 and so in 2020 we had multiplayer games but now in 2021 we call it the metaverse in 2020 we had virtual reality experience in 2021 well it's just called the better verse uh 2020 augmented reality filter metaverse 5g cloud connection ar cloud digital avatar digital event metaverse metaverse metaverse metaverse it's all the metaverse and so like when i talked about like the metaverse will be rendered at the periphery it's because all of these things are different like representations of the metaverse on in their own domain like a multiplayer game well if you hook it into ethereum now it's the metaverse virtual reality if you hook it into ethereum now it's the metaverse like a 5g connection on your phone well if there's assets on there now it's now it's part of the metaverse and so while this was a facetious meme of just like people trying to hype up their product by saying oh we're a metaverse company they're right like they are a metaverse company all they have to do is integrate with a digital shared state of global assets and right now that's ethereum yeah absolutely that's a good way to end it so what are the what are the takeaways here for people um i guess if i'm talk you know thinking at the top of my head uh one of the big takeaways is you know don't miss this right like the metaverse is here the metaverse is coming uh if you believe this then you should be on a quest to collect all the metaverse money you can buy and hold right that would only make sense to go invest in the crypto assets that you think could be reserved currencies of this new metaverse economy you definitely want to understand how the metaverse financial system works so you can operate in it in the future maybe teach your kids because they're going to be brought up in this metaverse as well so you want to understand defy you probably want to join the metaverse economy in some meaningful way maybe work for a metaverse native entity like a dao and you probably want to immerse yourself in metaverse culture just to figure out what that's all about maybe invest in metaverse culture where you can because culture is humanity and if humanity is transitioning into the metaverse that's where our culture is going to reside as well in fact all of this seems like advice that josh rosenthal told us at the end of the crypto renaissance um episode where we talked about humanity transitioning into this new crypto renaissance maybe another word for that is transitioning into the metaverse um these are some of my takeaways do you have any others to add yeah i happen to be in denver for the mcon conference the metacartel conference and there's also a lot of meta factory people here as well and ryan like i have to say i thought that you and i were at like the the top of the game when it comes to like understanding the metaverse i think we're about a year behind some of the people that i'm talking to at this conference right now like the the meta cartel matter factory teams like that those dows which are daos by the way uh they know what's up and some of the art and stuff going on here is like really really blowing my mind uh and the the big takeaway here is that like who do you think is going to build the metaverse is it going to be the mark zuckerberg's of the world the zuck verse or is it going to be daos i think a significant part of the richness side of the metaverse is going to be built by daos because they are internet native organizations they are metaverse organizations and so the metaverse i think is going to be built by these organizations and so if you want a part of these things it's another call to action to find a dow that's building the metaverse and join that effort as well uh and then also in my article i leave off just a few notes that quickly came to mind as i was trying to tie this off and i said i can only leave you with the same lessons we have learned over and over again throughout crypto fair launches work sorry that's one and so the metaverse needs to be built and it needs to be built with credible neutrality foundations incredibly neutral foundations and that's what fair launches are so different pockets of the metaverse are just going to explode into existence via fair launches i think that's a decent prediction to make the other one is that leaders matter um we this is just a fundamental truth like we need leadership and so when we talk about like fair launches and aping into fair launches uh we also need leaders to take the mantle and actually guide us into the metaverse so there's an action item there but ultimately and this is the last one we are going to ape into everything until we figure it out uh and so the metaverse is going to be built no matter what it's just a matter of how efficiently and quickly can we do it we only see it like dimly through a mirror right now um so i don't know ninety percent of the things we say in this episode might not turn out to be true have like no idea but it's previous episodes hold up pretty damn well ryan they've held up pretty well uh so far i've got to say but um we also i anticipate i guess another way to say that is like i anticipate 10 000 things that we never would have predicted to come about i think broad strokes this is kind of a very broad thesis that the metaverse is coming you should get involved and that ethereum will be the center of this thing but there will be so many other things that we're not able to predict that you just have to keep your eyes peeled and we will of course try to update you on them as they arise that's what bankless is for guys thank you so much for listening to today's episode um some action items for you number one is read the article we've been referencing this entire episode that is the metaverse emerges we'll include a link in the show notes number two some previous podcasts that we've referenced of course welcome to bankless is kind of a canonical bankless introduction that you should listen to if you already haven't also a bankless nation where we talk about crypto as a nation state and the protocol sync thesis we'll include links to those in the show notes also we never say this but another way to level up on the metaverse is to become a bankless premium member we never talk about the the perks of being a premium member on bank list but now is maybe an opportunity to do that a bankless premium member gets a number of things including a full market opportunity report what's going on in crypto every single monday we publish that on the newsletter a bankless premium member also gets an inner circle discord chat this is a a group in discord uh of bankless sojourners that that meet and talk about everything that's going on in kryptos fundamental for the journey also includes a debrief where after every single monday episode david and i give our thoughts on the bankless premium rss feed so you get a premium podcast feed with it also includes elf alerts where if there's a big opportunity in crypto we try to publish that to you so you know about it first and a 2021 bankless badge nft that could be a valuable property in the metaverse as well in the future so if you're interested in any of those things we will include a link so that you can become a bankless premium member as well guys that's been everything of course none of this was financial advice ethan's risky d5 is risky so is the metaverse you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head
