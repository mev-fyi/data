the world coin project is now live it's on mainnet the wld I guess it's wild no world the world token is in the wild orbs are deployed and the crypto Community absolutely hates it bankless Nation it is the last Friday of July that means it's the last weekly roll-up of July well I spoiled it but uh what time is it David oh Ryan it's the bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor especially this week this one's going to be a long one so we're going to try to move fast yet we persevere into the frontier nonetheless this time quickly I have no coffee this time but I'm sure you do yeah I always have coffee uh always I you know never doubt why don't you have coffee do they not have coffee in Switzerland uh they do have coffee in Switzerland I choose to not drink coffee at 6 41 PM it's late where you are huh it is late yeah tomorrow you climb in a mountain you climb yes yes climbing uh Mountain Pollux which is a training mountain and then we come back and rest and then we climb Matterhorn the next day jeez man well uh we'll be trying if I open up these windows behind me you would you would see the Matterhorn we've got a lot to talk about this week uh mountains inside we've got a mountain of uh content to climb here so number one world coin just launched and most people love it hate it love it everyone loved it everyone loved the world coin launch it universally beloved launch everyone was so excited for it um yeah no obviously not uh we're gonna go through the takes of varying degrees of of quality uh vitalik of course had a rational take and then uh there's just a bunch of things to unpack including the topic of uh World coin on the bank list podcast we were we were a bit of main characters I was a bit of a main character this week since you weren't on the episode uh so we'll talk about that yeah you know what they say about main characters David you gotta we gotta avoid that whenever possible but uh we also got a main character crypto bill that's in the house the House of Representatives that is it's actually maybe a good one so we'll talk about that there's also a bad Bill in the Senate so we'll contrast those two things Dave we gotta also talk about this new X thing Twitter has become X and uh Elon wants to make it the everything app does crypto have a story in there I don't know I want to get your take on some of the changes that are coming down the pike yeah I yeah it's a complete mess but I'm I continue to reserve my judgment but we'll talk about that when you talk about X also weird to call X it's just not gonna stick yeah I don't know I yeah I'm still calling it Twitter uh also the recession seems to be off at least that's what Powell is saying we'll talk about that and also the phase of the market that we're in last week we gave you permission to be bullish this week I feel like it's a phase of the market that starts with an A we'll get to that in the market section but could that be before we do though we got to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at stator they are building a liquid staking protocol David you want to tell us about it yeah seder it's the new LSD on the Block new LSD just dropped uh and we want more lsds we want more decentralized taking service providers the cool thing about stator is that if you want to run a node with stator you only need for ethers one of the lowest capital requirements that I've seen around they have a pledge of course to uh self-cap if that day ever comes that they need to implement that uh permissionless pool of staking node operators these are the words that we like to hear so if you want to stake your eat with stator and run a node with stator there is a link in the note in the show notes uh check it out if it seems right for you you can also get some SD token issuance on top of your eth yield if you choose to stake with stator so check it out there's a link in the show notes uh David let's get to the market section this week and we got to start with King Bitcoin over here in the Kraken Pro charge thanks to Kraken for allowing us to pull this up um looking at what are the numbers for Bitcoin this week 29 800 is where we started 29 300 is where we ended lost 500 on the week we are down 1.6 which I call Flat that is flat in cryptos we call it flat how about youth price same same flat flat 1890 to 1870 down one percent uh even flatter even flatter back in the 1800s huh all right I don't like the 1800s I don't like it was yeah it wasn't it wasn't I wasn't alive back then it would rather 1900s and then 2000s you know and then we're finally into the future uh youth Bitcoin ratio is that saying anything on the week uh up half a percent to .064 just under um flat is flat well you know where the party is David elsewhere it's also yeah it's not in crypto it's uh over the Stockland so we are viewing the NASDAQ chart here and is creeping even higher towards all-time highs on the week and this is really interesting to me because you contrast that with what the FED is saying uh flipping to our fed watch the FED just raised interest rates again this week and this is the highest level in 22 years they increased the interest rate by 0.25 percent this was sort of expected to a target range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent and the question is of course will they raise again in September um Powell said I would say it's certainly possible that we will raise funds again at a September meeting if the data warranted and I would also say it's possible that we would choose to Hold Steady anything is possible is what uh Powell is saying his comments on inflation he said it's moderated since the middle of last year and that's certainly what was in the data yes moderated inflation CPI is now at 4.8 percent when you exclude food and energy I don't know if you should exclude food or energy but the FED see still seems determined to hit two percent and still says they have a long way to go but here was the headline news here Powell also said that the FED staff is no longer forecasting a recession no longer forecasting a recession recessions if it's not being forecasted it's not happening that's how recessions work how do you take that um I mean the people who are saying that a recession is imminent it hasn't hit yet and now the FED is saying there's not going to be a recession a lot of different ways recession is such a nebulous term I like all these happenings it's two quarters of negative GDP growth like it has a definition yeah but but the GDP measurements are poor inflation measurements are poor risk like recession is also something that exists in like consumer appetite and consumer confidence like there's so many things that go into what we're actually trying to talk about which is like do we have to hunker down or are we just do we just like check a technical box saying we're in a recession I was talking to one of my macro friends and they uh this their hot take was that we've been in a recession we're already in a recession and just because it's numbers that the FED measures shows that we're not in a recession on a technical level doesn't actually like mean anything it's so qualitative it's so interesting though why would like Powell is coming up fairly strongly and saying that they're no longer forecasting recession he's not yeah because they want to say restart the landing we threaded the needle you're welcome but it would be very strange if in a quarter or two he has to eat those words and say oops I was wrong again but they're they're the Arbiters session you were still young or not but uh Jim Bianca's take my take on the FED hike statement of the presser so far it provided the least amount of information of any meeting since they started hiking in March 2022 Powell's going out of his way to say nothing and not commit to anything I hate these games but this this not even are we interpreting the words that they say now we're interpreting the lack of words uh he also added to this tweet I spoke too soon says Jim this headline just caused risk markets to fall Powell fed staff no longer forecasting recession this is how upside down we are this is his comment on the FED uh right no longer forecasting recession the FED no longer sees a recession is thought to be bearish for stocks because it opens the door to more hikes or higher for longer I've often joked that stocks would make a new high if the economy unemployed enough people I was trying to be funny but the market appears to be taking this idea very seriously seriously I I just I don't know what's going on to be honest David so the the recession hasn't come yet that's one data point inflation seems to be tamed stocks are pumping real estate's up yes bonds got a massive haircut they got you know somewhat destroyed so there's that wealth inequality of course has continued to increase so there's that but it feels like a lot of the macro Bears have been incorrect so far so far and so some of them are saying it it sounds to you like well just you wait it's coming right we just haven't felt the you know the wave uh hit us like you know there's been an earthquake in the ocean and there's a tidal wave out in the Horizon it just hasn't hit yet we're just kind of waiting for it but I'm kind of wondering at this point like where is why aren't stocks down like here's my big question for everyone in macro right now how is it possible that fed interest rates have been raised to 20-year highs and yet the stock market is also near I was told this couldn't happen David right yeah that is crazy actually yeah a commenter on that tweet um said I never thought it could five percent inflation would cause a depression scenario is what I thought yet here we are and consumers are consuming away regardless it's kind of unreal in my opinion that's kind of the contrast to me is like the rates have been raised to 20-year highs and yet risk on assets aside from crypto but risk on assets are going back to uh all-time highs how does that yeah that's actually nice if you told us if you told us back in the start of 2022 when like everyone in the crypto industry including myself was getting our minds wrapped around interest rates and flows and risk assets and then halfway through 2022 were all pummeled and then we're all gripping the edges of our seats saying when's the pivot when's the pivot and the pivot has not come I mean it's it's there's been a decrease in acceleration of the of the raising of interest rates but there has been no fed pivot not even after the Silicon Valley banking crisis and so after all of that we still at tech stocks all-time highs if you told us that like in early 2022 we would that have been like oh yeah they did thread the needle they got it right look at that that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying and I I don't understand what's going on I I guess still my base case again what do I know about macro uh is that this is some kind of slow motion excess money printing inflationary crisis but it's just happening so slow like we just don't really know what the effects are I know I would not want to be in Sovereign bonds that's for sure I know that wealth inequality is going to increase I I have no idea what inflation is going to do in the future I have no idea about a recession and now I'm like I'm not sure even it matters that's the thing I don't know what that it matters what what uh Powell does in September and and that's kind of a weird place to be because I think the markets are saying that they they just have like interest rate fatigue I guess that so at this point what I do is I just I just kind of shrug ignore macro and just keep buying crypto because I I still think that in kind of this money printing world even when I wasn't ignoring macro I was still Bankers well I mean what I'm going back to ignoring it clearly I don't understand what's going on here um I think the question is where are we in the market and I promised an a word to describe this um I call this the accumulation phase of the market and we could see it on the chart in front of us right now this is Bitcoin long-term holder Supply and the number is up so Bitcoin long-term holders control 75 of the circulating Supply now and this is an all-time high and this happens at every point in kind of the bear Market particularly at this phase the accumulation phase is the long-term holders they're not selling they're continuing to buy they're continuing to to Pile in right those with conviction are just like not only holding through it they're actually adding to their stack this is happening with assets like Bitcoin this is happening with High conviction assets like ether it's happening right now and so what this means is these are going to be the winners on the other side of this Market everyone who got scared everyone who sold low those are the losers everyone who's not accumulating right now those are going to be the losers on the other side of this market and it just plays out like this every single time because human psychology has not changed in 200 000 years of our history here it's just a natural order of things like the short-termers come in they buy the top they get shook out and then people have to sell for the next year due to a collective reasons of you know other people losing conviction they have to sell for taxes they have to sell for whatever and then like we run out of Sellers and then people start to get okay and comfortable with where the market lands and then sellers turn into buyers or buyers start buying like the resonance between so many of the things we're talking about in the market like stocks pumping and crypto being in an accumulation phase that's 2019. we've I've seen this movie before that's what we were doing this time four years ago like it's the pattern is Just Happening once again and four years before 2019 they were doing it like in 2014 2015 right it's like this is this has happened before it'll happen again I think that um sometimes people tend to over complicate crypto investing right um they try to focus on like how to win and what I would say is from like our years in investing in this assets we can't tell you everything it takes to win but I know you are going to lose if you're selling your Ethan your Bitcoin right like that's the recipe for losing oh I think the people who have done best in crypto in my experience I don't know if this applies to you David it's just the one thing they've done consistently is they've just held yeah like yeah it's as simple as that waves wash around you yeah you don't even it's nice if you accumulate if whenever one of my trades don't doesn't work I just hold it until does is that true for every trade I know you bought it it's a a surprising number of them if you have conviction you hold that is the rule here um yeah yeah all right speaking of different conviction let's talk about uh layer twos so the layer two words are have continued or had the hottest they've ever been they're so spicy right now this was uh something that that happened this week optimism flipped arbitrum in terms of daily transactions that's the red line the first time that's ever happened yeah flipping the Blue Line uh and so that is a new event in the layer two Wars it doesn't mean arbitrum's out though arbitrum still has a 57 of all of the layer 2 assets inside of arbitrim1 optimism has uh 27 percent and I really I know we said this a long time ago but I I want to double down on this layer two beat this is where we're looking at all of these stats this really is like the default D5 pulse of like you know 2019 and 2020. remember D5 pulse we're just constantly like yeah the refresh button like d5's getting bigger you know it's at you know 200 200 million dollars now oh it just crossed a billion dollars now uh I'm doing this thing 20 of us that were bullish on D5 when we first learned about the word we're all like using this as like validation this is our it was our validation website now this is our Layer Two thesis validation website well look we've got now 10 billion dollars in Layer Two so that's about the highest it's ever been from an activity perspective we can plot the activity and this line looks like it's going up so you could see God that is a great chart right look at the Blue Line right here which is ethereum it's kind of holding steady right because the ethereum transactions ethereum transactions this is it's already maxed out yeah it's already maxed out so it's not getting any higher but look at Layer Two look at it rise it's just and like dude that is that is the Calm before the storm phase of that line we're not even in the bull run we're not even in the bull run that line is going to increase in what's the word incline that's that good thing is going to get steeper exponentially yeah there's there's I remember when you were a scaling Factor was like 1.5 now we're at 4.5 yeah I mean I I think what we're seeing on this chart is is basically like optimistic Roll-Ups which were released like you know two years they have a two year Head Start From uh because we haven't even seen CK Roll-Ups kind of enter here and uh yeah ZK ZK sings almost at half a bill bruh that's not that's not a small amount half a billion 20th it's still four percent right so in order for ZK to catch up it has to just not only like win it like has to outpace what the optimistic Roll-Ups are doing anyway this is why the wars are so fun and this is why I keep hitting Refresh on layer 2 beat and looking at all these charts but it's very good news for scaling ethereum and uh for the modular blockchain thesis one thing I would like to see I will say is is um this column right here in terms of the stage of decentralization uh our our best is stage one which is still training wheels yeah on sequencers and still technically young yes yes so arbitrum is at stage one optimism is still at stage zero I would like to see if the zeros become ones I would like to see the ones become twos uh that will make me feel a lot like the slices the slices all turn green all those little different colored slices we want those to turn green that's right I want that too um all right well David we got a lot coming up next what are we covering yep World coin launches and everyone loves it and cheered and then after that we have a good bill and a bad Bill bad bills in the Senate good bill in the house just past the financial committee vote uh Jake Stravinsky's got to take where he calls the vote a historic day for crypto policy and then after that optimism drops the law of chains laws we're getting laws yeah we're getting laws I'm super stoked about it so all of that and more but first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the shows possible especially Kraken a preferred crypto exchange for 20 23. if you are

polygon 2.0 the value layer for the internet for too long the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption the internet allows anyone to create and exchange information what's missing is a value layer that lets anyone Exchange store and program value that's where polygon 2.0 comes in polygon Labs has unveiled a series of of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK Innovations such as polygon ZK evm the next iteration of the Best in Class plonky 2 proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer polygon 2.0 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity right now there is a polygon Improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake if approved polygon proof of stake would become a layer 2 ZK evm validium so make your voice heard on this proposal by joining the polygon Discord today you have a chance to help the polygon Community give the internet the value layer it deserves the world coin project is now live it's on mainnet the wld I guess it's wild no world the world token is in the wild orbs are deployed and the crypto Community absolutely hates it David they don't love it they really hate it the least favorite thing that they've ever seen we're going to talk about all of that first I want to show you this so Sam Altman tweeted this out this is a picture he says I'll read the caption in a second but you see this line kind of forming I don't know where this is is looks like um this massive line has formed and the caption from Sam Altman is day three of world coin launch crazy lines around the world one person getting verified every eight seconds now David there is one okay so why are people scanning their eyeballs because do you get if I I understand it correctly you get 25 world for just doing it and then one world a week then from the rest of time world coin is two dollars right now so you're the people waiting in line for fifty dollars 50 right now but like I guess number could go up um and Sam calls a one person every eight seconds I don't think number's gonna go after this valuation I mean we'll talk about uh more of that but can you before we get into that can you just describe what is World coin for people who've kind of missed uh what this launch actually is and even what this project is okay so worldcoin is an attempt at a proof of humanity system that uses biometric scanning so there is a bunch of different mechanisms that one could approach to try and produce a system that proves unique humanness so this is an anti-sibil platform we've had a number of these uh come into the crypto world with varying success circles from Martin koppelman is one bright ID is one there's a few others get coin uses a collection of them this one is unique in that it attempts those are the ones I just listed are like Circles of trust as in like other humans verifying other humans this one is different in that it is biometric scanning which is another way to prove unique humanness that also gives people the heebie-jeebies and so there's three parts of the world coin system there is World ID which is what you get after you scan your eyeball there is the orb which is what we're looking at on screen here which is this device produced by World coin which also has aspirations to to be able to be produced by any manufacturer that actually does the eyeball scanning and attestation that that eyeball is the same eyeball that is hard to scan prior there is the world token the world coin which is the coin that comes with this network there also is the world layer 2 which is an OP stack um Layer Two that got released not too long ago um and uh there is also an app but I think that's also the world ID it's like this web this mobile app that is your attestation for us wherever you go on the internet saying hey I'm a real human so you could imagine it like sign in with Facebook sign in with Google sign in with Twitter sign in with worldcoin except that mechanism is would be kind of cool because the sign in with World coin button would be a provable human at least that's that's the idea and then also the world coin aspect of this is also supposed to be some uh Ubi attempt so every human gets an equal amount of world coins distributed them to their unique eyeball uh and unique eyeball they're unique so they're a unique eyeball yeah uh and so in addition to all of the proof of humanness it is also an attempt at fairly Distributing a token equally across all humans across the whole entire world uh and that's how I would summarize this and Sam Altman's part of his reason for this is like AI is going to take all the you know human beings jobs uh basically and so we need to know who all the humans are so we can give them some sort of some form of Ubi basically right and uh you know um not have just the robots kind of rule the planet and true all of the capital uh that is his stated vision for this and Sam Altman is um one of the founders of this actually so uh I mean the project he's like he's the guy that found Alex blania the CEO Sam Altman found Alex Blaney I was like yo drop out of school and help me build this world going because I want to basically Building open AI he's the vision guy let's talk about so this went to mainnet um it had been in some sort of Alpha version it wasn't live um people were being orbed but in kind of limited uh capacities but now it's now it's live now it's everywhere this is the world coin uh coin itself so market cap right now fully diluted valuation of 21 billion dollars I didn't realize it was so high nuts wld token trading at uh two dollars and fifteen cents at this point in time but um a massive amount of this Supply is like locked up the circulating Supply is just like a small it's like one percent one percent one percent so the actual market cap um in terms of circulating market cap is 239 million dollars but fully diluted it's 21 billion dollars which is an absolutely insane valuation I mean what what is that I guess like if you go to a coin if it puts it at right above Lido steak to Ether and right below usdc coming in at would be number seven it would bump Lido out it would be number seven why no steak teeth yeah it would be number seven wow extremely extremely inflated that is one of the most inflated token launches that I have ever seen this is not a layer one we should say this is sort of um deployed on uh yeah optimism right it's like kind of a roll up an open it's a oh yeah actually I think that's right it is on optimism mainnet and it has aspirations and it will eventually become its own op stack chain one other thing that I didn't mention about the whole Iris scanning thing is that they also say that they preserve your privacy by doing a ZK snark so they're not creating a database if there's like here's Ryan Sean Adams here's Ryan Adam's eyeball there's they're claiming to ZK snark that and um and so to maintain privacy claiming is a keyword here I think um so let's talk about the the community reaction here I thought um one of the most rational takes as as usual is from vitalik and he wrote an entire post about biometric proof of personhood that really focuses in on world coin what what what's kind of your summary of vitalik's post here David I think if this isn't a direct summary but I think my takeaway from this is that vitalik goes through all of these different components of what makes a biometric proof of personhood system and then kind of explains well this is how this works and this is how it leaks and this is how this works and this is how this is vulnerable and this is how this works and this is how this is vulnerable so you get to the end of this thing I'm like hmm there's a lot of like things that really need to go right for the system to work um and so he just he just kind of talked about every single aspect of it and talked about the ways that it's vulnerable and after you get to the end and you're kind of like well that's that was a lot of things um and so that's why in the intro to the bankless podcast episode that I did with uh Sam and Alex I called it like one of the most ambitious crypto projects and people did not like that phrasing and but they're not I didn't I didn't do it I didn't serve that up very well I mean it's like it has to do so much to work and it's the scale and scope of the thing is massive and the requirements of getting this thing right are huge that's what I meant by ambitious yeah it has to get a lot of things right in order order for this to actually be a good for the world if it even can be a public good yeah this um this whole post from vitalik I can't recommend it enough if you have you know it's probably 20 to 30 minutes of time to actually uh read through it but vitalik starts to learn a lot yeah you'll learn a lot he starts by talking about why a decentralized proof of personhood solution is is even necessary why do we need the idea of decentralized people why do we need to know whether an ethereum address is represented by one single person or many people or or a bot the reasons he give is that it's an anti-concentration of power sort of thing if we want to do like a vote in a Dao and specify that as one person one vote if we want to do an airdrop and ignore all the Bots ignore all of kind of the you know the Civil attacks and all of the airdrop um you know farmers who are creating multiple accounts and just distributed to individual people if we want to do some sort of credit system like on off chain credit type system for individual human beings we need some sort of proof of personhood so that is a good thing in itself if we can somehow manage that on chain but then he walks through this one specific implementation of proof of personhood which World coin is pursuing which is biometric proof of personhood and the the exact implementation worldcoin is pursuing is is eyeball based biometric uh proof of personhood which presents its own problems but this um this kind of table at the end of his post I think sums it up if you want decentralized proof of personhood you kind of have two tries at this one is a hardware biometric based proof of personhood and ideally it would be a specialized version of that you can get privacy fairly high he says accessibility and scalability medium robustness of decentralization it's fairly low because there's hardware supply chain issues all sorts of reasons why security against fake people medium that's what worldcoin is pursuing and then your other option to do this is a social graph based proof of personhood where your privacy is kind of low because you have to trust a a circle of other human beings to really um you know validate you and verify your personhood accessibility and scalability has been fairly low like these Solutions haven't really taken off uh yet which is kind of the concern even though they exist the decentralization though is very high because it's bottom up and the security against fake people is also high so he kind of contrasts all of these things and presents the world as a series of engineering trade-offs I think one of us one of the takeaways for me from this post is that we shouldn't put all of our eggs in one basket that's Pro this is a classic vitalik take that probably the best solution it is a blend of all of the above that we kind of amalgamate together into like those which is actually what Bitcoin uses in order to to achieve unique humanness on their platform they don't they don't behoove themselves to one platform they just use an amalgamation of a bunch we should get into some of the other controversy here because as you said earlier David the the crypto Community actually did not like World coin it was not received with the excitement and I would kind of classify the critiques in a few various forms one is critiques of worldcoin themselves and the implementation approach that they're taking and the other is a critique of biometric proof of personhood altogether and then some people actually don't like the idea of unchain proof of personhood at all so maybe we'll take the first one which is like World coin sucks this is um right this is left heiress what is he saying here David yeah lifter says uh just a list of bullet points of criticisms about world coin uh and goes 20 of the supply of world goes to team and investors there are privacy concerns about the actual cryptography that protects people's eyeballs there's malicious orb operators and so the idea with his orb is that the people like operating these orbs aren't necessarily World coin employees it's the public the public can operate a public person can operate in orb but then that means that one public person can try to manipulate the orb in order to scan other people's eyeballs and take their wool coin on their behalf so that's it that's that's just you can you can also Tinker with the orb so that's his next one malicious slash compromise orbs uh bribing poor people with tokens for an eyeball scan and then his last one which is kind of just like the vibe of the whole thing is it just feels really dystopian right it's called word coin it's got a chrome orb that you stick your eyeball into the one of the founders is the guy making like you know AI after Bank list if we just did a bunch of like AI Doom episodes like it's the whole thing is just like a perfect storm of dystopia yeah dystopian feeling um here's a more specific take list of issues from Zack xbt my issues with World coin he says most alarming to me is how the world coin team has boasted about how many users they have when in reality they have been exploiting people in developing countries this is sourcing an MIT technology review article from 2022 about that verification that you're a real person seems to only be currently enforced at the enrollment level is what this has led to is the emergence of a black market for accounts so you can buy a worldcoin account on telegram for you know a dollar uh per World coin account it's being attacked in that way and then some criticism about the token allocation there are a few more so this is under the category of like World coin sucks and so you can find a lot of critiques for that including another one from Andrea and Bailey worldcoin is still stupid and bad in Four Points number one the team incredibly was not prepared for people to sell that's the issue I was just mentioning it doesn't solve the one problem it was supposed to solve there's also some criticism about the foundation that world coin the kind of the org structure uh they're creating that's that comes to the territory everyone complains about the foundation of every project giving insiders 20 tokens so it's that kind of thing so one category of critiques is just about world coin and how it's implemented and how it's being done itself but going back to those circles um another category is is basically broader than just World coin sucks uh that that critique it's a category of all biometric proof of personhood sucks like we should never use biometric proof of personhood at all and going down that path will lead to dystopian outcomes yeah I was talking to one of my friends uh Scott Lewis uh he he gave me a take that I like to read out actually he goes basically every futurist thinking on biometric scanning has concluded that biometric scanning is absolutely oppressive technology and there has been a dedicated effort to tell stories where the use of biometric scanning was used by oppressors not everyone in the world needs to become a domain expert on exactly why biometric scanning is consensus scary technology in the eyes of generations of Science Fiction writers to understand that there is a consensus that this stuff should not be effed with reality land current governments are the Arbiters of who a person is and many but not all governmental systems if the initial read of the government seems incorrect to you you have a clear schedule of codified Rights and options to appeal and correct that decision replacing that Oracle with a profit maximizing Corporation composed of Sam Allman cronies who offers zero recourse is much worse we have a good track record of corporations in similar positions offering no effective recourse to their customers when they are de-platformed worldcoin would be in a position to de-platform someone from the literal claim on being a human dystopian isn't a feeling in a situation like that it's inevitable which I thought was a good analysis of the whole context because like there's a very specific like critiques of worldcoin about specific implementations and then like there's the broad sweeping Strokes of like the whole vibe is just illegitimate and and people just have to trust the Bible like serializing people in this way hasn't worked out well yeah don't serialize people yeah don't serialize people I mean one pushback against that take um before we get into it though is like aren't we already being serialized and you know so many so many ways yeah I'm just like every time and this time we have cryptography so like you get to serialize people and then ZK snarket I just I I think that's a valid take I I think our tech companies are already doing that every time I I stare down at my iPhone to unlock it right it's like doing facial recognition biometric um recognition of my face and it's unlocking it you know if you if you don't look at the camera it won't unlock it needs your eyes to look at the camera on your well you even look at you know kind of Apple's new VR goggles right that's just directly Iris unlocks scanning unlock right and I'm yeah this is so this is such a messed up position to be it's like I'm excited about that product and like maybe I shouldn't be maybe I should be fearful of that product uh anyway so so that's another criticism it's just like biometric proof of personhood descends into all sorts of like corporate dystopianism there's another critique I think which is uh which is a good critique and worthwhile and that's um we already have better decentralized proof of personhood protocols so Circle bright ID get coin passport proof of humanity these are social graph based you kind of build a web of trust right so I know you David so I'm willing to like vouch for you and at you're a real human being because we've met in person so I'll vouch for you and you know someone else you'll vouch for that person you kind of build from the bottom up this social graph based approach I think that's totally valid and I love those approaches by the way and we've talked about them on bank but several times my challenge with those is they just haven't scaled yet right like we don't have hundreds of thousands or millions of of users on these things and I'm worried that they just might not scale maybe we can crack the code here and I'm still optimistic but that's kind of the the worry but here's my takeaway after this episode what Cipher punks seem to think about on-chain uh Personnel first of all our current state is the nation right so we all have passports and the nation can go bad depending on your government so if your government goes evil or authoritarian right you know nation-state serialization is going to go bad for you uh the second method is biometric and the criticism I think most many in the crypto Community say is that well anything biometric becomes a corporate evil because you need Hardware to go collect all of the irises and that ends up being owned by some evil Corporation maybe worldcoin is is sort of one of those and so it always descends its flawed and can often maybe always descend into a corporate evil and then number three social graph that's um that's still decentralized and that really remains our best shot and I'm sympathetic towards that I just I worry that number three is not scalable but there's also David a whole bunch of people who think we don't need on-chain personhood at all which was interesting uh to actually consider this was from I think that one's a cop-out well this is from Nick before you dismiss it this is from Nick from uh ens he says unpopular opinion truly decentralized trustless civil resistance or proof of humanity is impossible you know he's not saying he's not saying that like it wouldn't be it would be great if we could do it he's saying you can't do it so it's theoretically impossible yeah he says we should stop trying to make it work and instead focus on Building Systems that don't assume individuals are unique humans so he's like Mission Impossible you can't even do it anyway so stop trying we don't need it we can rethink our our systems Beyond this so that I think is a summary of uh the crypto community's reaction to all of this and all of the criticism I want to turn towards something else though because there was also some criticism of bankless like why did bankless decide to have World coin on uh what's what's what do you want to say about that uh well it has a ton of attention and so that if there if people's attention go there then my attention goes there also there's obviously the pull of like Sam Altman and then there's obviously also the poll of Sam out on bankless like that's just kind of cool um I will say you weren't there on that episode because it was Mother's Day it was like a Sunday so I was taking it while I was in the middle of zuzalu um why did we have World coin on well it's a huge project it's a massive project there's only so many proof of personhood projects out there and this is the only one going after the biometric sector so like just as a understanding the scope of like the crypto Rabbit Hole the biometric proof of personhood is a part of the crypto rabbit hole it's a part of like the things you can explore so I I considered it a legitimate place of exploration then there was like also criticisms of like the way that I manage that interview which is I didn't I didn't really push back on anything I didn't really have like any critiques for them I kind of just let them walk through the project and explain themselves and say Here's what this does and here's what how that works and this is a world coin project I'm like great thanks for coming granted I only had 60 Minutes there was a hard stop and so that is a extreme constraint on my ability to be to be thorough and also the other half of my ability to be thorough is like some of the tech stack behind a the hardware and the zero knowledge cryptography that keeps things private I don't have the skill set to vet that and so I have to just kind of run on trust and faith of people who actually can be more technical than me and so my intention of the world coin episode was hey crypto you know you know Universe hey bankless Nation here's the world coin project here's an episode with Sam Altman discuss amongst yourselves and then I get back to like bankless why the F did you host this these people why did you not talk about like the dystopian nature of this why did you like Tee It Up in the intro as like one of crypto's most ambitious projects and I'm like I guess I got the vibe wrong I could have been more critical I could have pushed back more um but at the end of the day it's just like we're all I'm also feeling like I'm caught in the middle of bankless you're so opinionated why didn't you have an opinion on this one like you're so opinionated about ether you're so opinionated about layer twos why didn't you have an opinion on worldcoin to at the end of the day it's like I sometimes I'm in a particular State a disposition a mood I don't have the mental like capacity to be mean to Sam Altman and I'm a guy who I don't really know who he is I don't know I'm asking for forgiveness uh I guess yeah I think so I think uh like I appreciate that I I think that um we could have wrapped that episode a little bit differently but I think what people maybe some people don't understand if they just hear that episode maybe didn't catch the debrief or don't understand the wider context of what we do is like episode one is kind of like about world coin it's kind of a conversation uh starter it doesn't stop us the first episode we really can do on world coins all right the world playing panel of all of the critics about world point we're going to do the episode with all of the decentralized web of trust alternatives to worldcoin we're going to do an episode of the pros of the cons we're going to see how this whole project turns out so um yo that's another element to it and then there was also the critiques that's like oh yeah Sam Allman and we're coin paid Bank list to Co on the podcast and I've said this you've said this well I take offense to that ten thousand I take offense to that one that one I yeah they need to apologize for that one yeah bankless this has never and will never ever take money for for Content that's never happened on the newsletter yeah no investment interest we have no investment interest there's no other investors in Bank lists we're holding to No One people make up you know people can make up anything on the internet uh anyway um this was kind of a deeper take too this is um a defy cheetah saying um I thought the alternative to World coin was bankless basically the implication of like why do we even need a world coin like I thought you guys were bankless and I just wanted to push back on on that and support the idea of of decentralized identity decentralized proof of personnel so guys just so you understand bankless is an alternative to Banks but today nation states provide our core identity so you get your password are the Arbiters of identity yeah they are the AML kyc it's a passport it's a license Banks don't do that stateless is the alternative to States and if we want to do cool things like one person one vote or on-chain credit with without relying on the state to need to know who humans are then we need some sort of decentralized identity okay World coin is building a protocol to tell who the humans are without the state all right I don't know if this is going to work out well or if it's going to be bad um but I I just saw a lot of anger this week on crypto Twitter about this and someone some of it is totally warranted some of the takes that we just read were completely warranted some of it is really uninformed and my encouragement is basically to channel something into building like if we don't like what worldcoin is building once we pop the hood and look at it let's build another alternative because that's what that's what we do at crypto I mean we're crypto and we build so that's my encouragement let's not give up on decentralized proof of personhood in general and so I guess my take on all of this David after listening to the conversation that you had with Sam Altman and worldcoin is I think I'm still undecided about world coin as a technology I'm cautious I'm open to it because I hate that AML kyc and state identities is the only way forward for you know some of these use cases um I see decentralized personhood proof of personhood as an unlock and maybe we can do it maybe we can't maybe Biometrics is a really bad way to do it maybe it's not I'm kind of taking a wait and see approach I'm not at this point willing to get orb to myself all right so if that gets you uh my statement of faith about the world coin project I wouldn't do it there's not enough value for me I'm kind of like I haven't heard enough uh compelling reasons why and I'm not supportive of wld tokens I have no comment about that I have no idea what the value is wld might be but it's 21 billion dollars guys so just go think about that yeah what I care about most is the conversation about this that we're having as a community I think that's important and um I think that's been opened up in a positive way and also competition I just emphasized if we don't like what worldcoin is doing let's build a better decentralized do something else yeah yeah so anyway that's uh that's my take on things yeah on the whole world coin um token question we have a question from the nation Kyle Kaplan from from the bank location Discord how does World coin token plan on accruing any value Ubi sounds nice and all but we all know you just can't print money out of nowhere I I think it's a huge question about world coin why the f is this thing 21 billion is that what it is 21 billion when it only ever gets issued like the only Bowl case I can articulate for the world coin token is that the humans deem the distribution of world coins so incredibly legitimate and fair that they want to be a part of that very competing as the money isn't it in the same way Bitcoin either in the U.S maybe and maybe I don't even know if if it's doing that I don't even know if they have I I don't I don't even know if they like Alex blania from worldcoin has a statement about what he thinks about the world Cornell so he probably can't say it because he's the issuer of it but like that's a very dubious value accrual it's just legitimacy in and of itself plus when you see telegram Snapchat screenshots of people selling hey I'll sell you a worldcoin account for one dollar like that very much erodes that value proposition like there's other like Theses about it like it's a graph for just because it's fair like I don't I don't see the value accrual yeah neither do I I still do think it's competing in the money the monetary value category right and it has to yeah it has a good shot at that but like it's not producing transaction fees it's not a cash flowing asset so mean value money but the the question from Kyle is interesting is like um Ubi sounds nice but we all know you can't just print money out of nowhere I'm like yeah but isn't that what Bitcoin and ether did you know what I mean like if you can get a meme bootstrapped and kick-started and enough people believe in a money in the story they can solve the problem later yeah you could solve the problem now I don't think that's the path that worldcoin is on but I'm saying that if there is a path to it being worth billions of dollars my take is it the path is going to be a bunch of people believe it's a monetary instrument and it's used as a monetary instrument I yeah that so bearish on that I'm so bearish because then it competes right next to bitcoin and ether like it's not going to survive that fight thankless Nation you can make your own decision on world coin if you haven't caught uh David's conversation with Sam Altman and Alex from worldcoin then go ahead and catch it there's a link in the show notes and also should be in your RSS player David enough about world coin let's do a good bill bad bill there's some good news in Congress for crypto at least the US Congress so this bill hasn't passed but it's a set of bills that are very positive uh for crypto and they were just voted on by the house Financial Services committee and they passed that vote which is a pretty big deal apparently Jake travinsky calls this vote a historic day for crypto policy there's two bills that are wrapped up in this in the house that are pretty crypto positive the first is called the financial Innovation and technology for the 21st century Act so this is a framework for issuance and trading of digital assets at the SEC and cftc you know that whole Clarity of like what's a commodity and what's a security this bill directly addresses that so we actually get some clarity here the thing that Gary Gensler never gave us that's what the uh the fit is doing for us and that's part one part two David is the blockchain regulatory uh certainty act it clarifies that non-custodial blockchain developers and service providers this would be like miners validators if you're an at-home validator wallet providers that they never custody consumer funds and don't have to register as money transmitters you know the nightmare scenario if you run your own yeah that's like the earliest bill that came in that like deemed that hey if you're a part of it if you run a node you process a transaction there will give you a money service that was that was the very first like crypto like fire alarm that we had oh my God it would be so scary it would basically mean that it's kind of illegal without being registered the validator in the us yeah the good news here is that this is bipartisan so 35 members voted for it verse versus 16 35 to 15 at one and 25 of those 35 were actually Democrats so some bipartisan support that we haven't seen Tom emmer of course LED it um I want to play you this quote from Richie Torres he's on the Democrat side and he was weighing in on comments for it here it goes thank you Mr Charles for a few thoughts I mean they're profound philosophical differences on the subject of crypto and there's almost no point in relitigating those differences because it's been extensively debated here today but um I find myself unpersuaded by the notion that the status quo is working you know a status quo that gave us the largest crypto Ponzi scheme in history is not working it's by definition failing my assessment is that the status quo is dangerously deregulated and requires regulation Albert Einstein said if we do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result that's the definition of insanity and the time has come for us to break the cycle of insanity that governs the application of Securities Law to digital assets now there's a difference between Securities Law as we as individuals might think it ought to be interpreted and Securities Law as it has been interpreted by the courts and the southern district of New York has held yeah I really like Richie Taurus that that guy is great yeah big fan great comments there and the the one thing we wanted Congress to do is to provide Clarity and that's what this bill is doing so Tom emmer is going to be one of the architects of this bill I think the next time we catch him we'll probably be at the permissionless conference it's uh happening in September we're throwing that conference with block works that's the 11th through the 13th this is going to be a topic of discussion with time for sure um David we got a bad Bill though too it's coming from the Senate you ready for that one oh yeah no it's sad in contrast to that the Senate is proposing a bill I'm going to read you the title here it's called the crypto asset National Security enhancement Act of 2023. did you catch that I don't like those words National Security enhancement act I don't give a f what's in that I don't like it yes uh you know it's gonna sound a little orwellian when it has National Security and crypto asset in it and enhancements this one is also uh bipartisan but only unfortunately it's bipartisan again this is coming from the Senate but basically it mandates that D5 protocols and anyone who controls them or makes them available have to impose bank-like surveillance for their users so that would mean defy controllers right need to vet and collect information on the customers have to do the AML thing have to report suspicious activity of the government have to block sanctioned individual users from their protocols do you remember the stuff that SBF was advocating like a year ago in some of the crypto legislation that he was like proposing being like you know I think all D5 protocols interfaces app user interfaces should have AML kyc complete State surveillance and are basically money transmitter Banks yeah it's uh it's a lot of that um Bill Hughes from consensus has some takes he said this thing is a doozy um he says in summary it deems that digital asset protocols defined really as any software deployed on chain is controlled by that's controlled by backers and the backers are those who develop or retain meaningful control over the protocols and transaction facilitators who develop and make available applications that facilitate use of the protocols basically what this means is that any us originating or residing person or an entity who invests more than 25 million dollars in building a protocol or owns that much or more in the governance token if you even just own the governance token okay um Anyone Who develops and offers the front end of the users or owns the governance tokens would deem to be in control of the protocol for sanctions and AML purposes International Security enhancement get the F out of here they're just they're just like saying every user of crypto get the F out of the way we need to catch North Korea basically and for entrepreneurs or those investing in kind of like you know governance uh protocols or those building interfaces on top of protocols that you know some bad actor might use uh they would be part of the responsibility tree here so Bill uh concludes this by saying if this legislation goes through bye-bye permissionless Global Computing at least as the US is concerned uh really bad news and I think David this right here is like Gensler is kind of a sideshow compared to this to me you know when crypto talks about the final boss this right here National Security yeah National Security is is the final boss if like if crypto dies in the US it'll be to protect us from terrorists and bad guys and yep that's why this bill is kind of worrying coming from the Senate side of things anyway we got good news and bad news this week this one and just hope that for the best yeah well you know we got some good news coming up in the next section what are we talking about David coming up next optimism drops the law of chains I'll walk you through all of what that means in coindesk is being sold to my first boss in crypto no I'll talk to you about that chain link launches the ccip protocol all these things and more but first a moment to talk about some of these

optimism drops the lot of chains version zero so what is this law of chains it's starting off as a document it's a document kind of like I don't know a constitution of sorts that is going to be iterated on in the openstack world in the world of optimism governance the idea here is the problems that we have are the op stack is getting forked and deployed new chains like almost every single day right we got base we got Zora we've got the world coin token uh chain as well uh there's a few others ones as well coin is to play on the op stack yeah I mentioned it we mentioned it if people are fork in the op stack I don't like the op stack is getting Fork so now there's all these op stack standard chains more chains than what can be managed so like what do you expect users to do to go to metamask and drop down and go to like okay here's op section One op stack chain two no we want just one and so this is the law of chains is the first step along that process so from the law this is the what I wrote in the tweet from the law of chains spawns the op super chain this is where we're going and so because of every single new OP stack chain is a different chain we still want them to behave like one chain but since adding new OP stack chains to the world is completely free completely open completely completely permissionless how do we actually determine what is in the super Chain versus out of this super chain because you know any sense anyone can Fork the op stack and spin up a new chain that chain could be a rug that chain could be you you know and exploring that could be a bad chain so if we want all of these op stack chains to converge into the Super chain they all need to pass a certain threshold of quality assurances and this is what the law of chains puts forth It's You Must Be This good or higher to be included into the Super chain and so this is the document that the op Community is working on to determine what is that line what is that threshold for inclusion and after that we can start to have collective bargaining power for all the op sections that are in the Super chain and so what does that mean the cost to spin up a new ether scan like the optimism etherscan RB scan poly scan or you know talking to inferior or Alchemy these are it all takes those are deals that have to be Inked that has labor costs but when all of these Ops chains are formed under the same standard with a very strong level of quality assurances all of a sudden all this can cohere into one single Collective of change lanes and so etherscan and all these people can start to treat These Chains as equivalent because they are and so this is what the law of chains has started to kick off so basically like what is it though David is it like a document that isn't like a it's a proposal of Standards it's a proposal it's a document that is proposing standards okay and then uh basically these are the standards for joining like the Confederacy of all of these all of these chains and if you meet this threshold this then you can be adopted into this this Confederacy of chains if there's some sort of like formal body that votes and it's like yeah this Chain's good that that Chain's bad we're letting this one in we're booting the other chain or is this are we not there yet the first step is just to establish I believe that is a part of the process that is being proposed that is what needs to be figured out well very interesting uh there's some takes about this too including from Alex from uh the ZK sync what did he say yeah I thought this was pretty funny so Alex has he is on team ZK stack so this is a in the layer two Wars this is a layer two Wars tweet uh and so he's going tldr op stack many chains one choice single shared sequencer centralized Mev distribution protected by laws and governance and then he goes ZK stack many chains many choices pick your own sequencer handle Mev your way protected by math and code we are not the same people uh but then his next tweet kind of walks himself back a little bit and goes I must add although my preference for individual women sovereignty is obvious I admire optimism's brilliant work on governance and public goods funding mechanism designs we all learn by winning from each other making ethereum Layer Two ecosystems richer and stronger so some spicy takes out of Alex out of this whole like law of change thing I will say uh I mean gotta give credit to where your credit's due optimism has all the chains like they've got they've got bass they've got mantle they've got World coin if you care about that but I'm putting that one back in the closet um they've got Zora uh which is the tezos like the media network but now on ethereum uh and so like you got it and so when we were looking at the stats earlier of like optimism beating trumping arbitrum and transactions that's just mainnet that's not what about all the other chains what happens when all they all of those chains form into the Super chain that I think is really cool uh we're gonna do a podcast with Jesse and Ben on this whole concept because the the negotiation between coinbase and the op Collective as to help what does what does that relationship look like has carved out like room for this whole law of change thing so this is a big learning moment for everyone well since you're being the optimistic world will allow me to be the kind of the the ZK roll-up bull for a second what I would say is this is just the first inning though David and like we got a lot more Innings and it's actually a miracle that ZK roll-up technology has kind of come to my market so quickly and I do think that there's something to this last point that Alex said which is protected by math and code rather than laws and governance it's basically like ZK cryptography It's Magic Moon math right and you could do things with ZK that you can't do with fraud proofs uh that might what you can do with ZK Ryan you can turn an optimistic chain into a ZK chain let the games begin I think um we'll have to see how it plays out and again check layer 2 beat for the progress here but this is just the first inning um and disclosures Ryan and I love the op stack and the ZK stack so much we are advisors to both optimism and zksync the producers of both the op stack and CK sacks really the common denominator is we just love Stacks I love Stacks I love them I think they're so great love decentralization speaking of stacks David starknet still building in the background this is of course a ZK Centric ecosystem as well they announced last week that they are incredibly excited to introduce a starkman net app chains they say starknetism they're announcing a stack that's what they it's it's their stack right now they have a stack yes uh this is an app chain stack as well so this is another a fantastic team who's building the Stark net stack in the ecosystem and it's interesting to see this this game about in our polygon conversation earlier this week with the founders of polygon is just like there's some convergence in layer twos to like the stack based uh model where you have your kind of general purpose evm type of chain and then you have app chains and you're creating like a full stack for chain developers to deploy to your ecosystem and all of the ecosystems are competing against one another they're also working together in some weird ways against other side chains and Alternatives it's um yeah it's a very interesting time to be in crypto on the infrastructure side I'd say I love it I love it so much it's like finally it took two years more than I thought it'd take to get to this point but finally here we are uh URI URI kolodney of stockware he will also be at permissionless so if you are interested in the starkware stack he'll be a permissionless uh David I gotta ask you because all of the tweets we've been reading out this week I don't even know if they're tweets any longer because this is called okay we're doing this yes we're doing this Elon Musk has just transformed Twitter into X the everything app all right see the big X on the top left no longer Twitter this whole thing is called X it's a big Rebrand and this is part of his plan to make I guess Twitter now now X into some kind of super app what's your take on this so far David uh actually it's worth noting that uh x.com was elon's first startup that actually made him his first money I'm really fuzzy on the details um but like he's had x.com for a long time that was like something to do with PayPal it's like one of his first startups it was going to be an online bank actually like a startup uh and it was going to be the X bank and so this is not uh elon's first flirtation with this whole X thing um so he's like pulling this out from downtown like out of his pocket that he's you know just being kept up the sleeve and now Twitter is now X there's so many things to talk about it I don't even know if we have enough time to go into it but it's like man they're called tweets the bird is blue it's a blue bird everyone knows it's Twitter it's Facebook it's it's Instagram and all of that is just completely thrown down the trash like Brands take forever to get built and now we have this extremely basic X thing we they're called zits x-e-e-t-s we're supposed to be Z daily now we had it we had a spaces with Taylor Monahan and I did are they X spaces now because that sounds dirty I don't want to be in space with anyone on on Twitter or excuse me on x.com like uh okay so this my take about when uh Elon first bought Twitter was it's probably gonna break and get clunky and then if he can do it it'll get better from there yeah so but it has gotten so much worse than I've ever thought possible and he's trying to rotate it into the super app like you're really testing my conviction Elon like I'm not enjoying this right yeah I mean he's saying some pretty bold things like if Done Right X would become half of the Global Financial system right uh why do you mean he's saying pretty both things he only says both things yeah this is I mean this is is he going to incorporate crypto what's that going to look like in the future I I just got to be honest on The Branding of this you look at kind of the left versus the right and this is someone's take gonna be honest this new widget design looks like an app for membership for membership only human trafficking gentlemen's club headquarters Budapest I mean look how is your my app is my phone is still Twitter it's still a bluebird is there's an X now it's uh I don't think it's turned into an X but just the Top Line your phone I'm in here I don't know I haven't looked at that but like the top so many of these things don't make sense now because now we have the Twitter blue if you play we have that Circle tweet button it's a feather yeah yeah I don't know I stopped messing with my life there's a there's a broader I think conversation here which is um this may be a rumor I'm not sure what to make of this David but um this tweet says yesterday the owner of Twitter handle at X tried to sell it for one million dollars and minutes ago Twitter or X Elon took it away from him and transferred the old at Twitter account to it and the owner received zero dollars this could be some speculation here but the point is like your handle you don't know on Twitter your handle on X like you don't own is Elon it's not a domain name handle it's not it's it's so one thing I guess I'll say is um we have all give credit to Elon in this I think Twitter has always towed the line of trying to be like a Public Square and like a public good and an open protocol but like that being a facade and not really doing it well you know it's just like well if it's an open protocol it was a private company trying to produce a Public Square and they did a pretty good job of it then it started to like fracture right like well do you censor a tweet or not well if it's a public good you don't but if it's a private company then you do Elon has completely ripped the mask off of that this is very clearly a private company this is elon's app when I tweet I am tweeting on X elon's private property I'm I know my position in this ecosystem I am a surf for like Lord Elon basically and so I know that at least and I can choose whether I want to continue to invest in this or not um I think a lot of people will choose to pursue more open Real public Alternatives and maybe that's where web3 and crypto finally starts to take off but at least with Elon we kind of know where we stand this is a private company and a private application and as a user you can either use it or not but you don't necessarily have have have rights on this platform you don't have any assets that you own yeah yeah I I want this story to hurry up and finish like can we just can we get to the super app or can we go back to Twitter but this like limbo I don't like being here does it feel awkward stage speaking of awkward I don't know if you call this uh awkward or progress here RFK Junior just confirmed that he purchased 14 Bitcoin David so he's now joined the club officially uh that's uh 415 000 worth of bitcoin um yeah 414 000 so he's officially part of the Church of Bitcoin he's a holder at this point in time I don't know if he's doing that knowing the little bit I know about RFK he fits right in well take that as you will RFK uh David Ryan uh do you remember my first job in crypto uh didn't you work for like some shady icos or something no no even worse dude it was an Ico advisory agent wow wow I mean only in hindsight in the moment I thought I was leading a revolution uh I was a mere Community manager I would write blogs there uh anyways I worked for this uh company called new Alchemy which was a uh it did a big a big number of icos aeon Network like a i o n if you remember that 2017 interoperability I remember that yeah yeah yeah and then everything ground to a halt when we realized that all these icos that were doing are securities uh and that's actually where I got my Securities training uh anyways like my knowledge base anyways uh the owner of new Alchemy is this guy Peter vesnis he was my first ever crypto boss and so his after that company blew up uh he's been in Bitcoin since forever uh he's now in like a family office VC firm uh capital six uh and him and Matthew rosnak which is another name I have not heard of really long time uh one of the another one project that we did was called metronome which I think Matthew from I think he's from I remember I met you now yeah I remember metronome was cool um anyways that investor group has offered 125 million dollars for coindesk the news agency which we frequently use here on the weekly roll up and so my old boss and a few other of his uh you know investor friends have offered 125 million dollars for coindesk so I don't know if this is going to go through but everything sounds like it will uh so yeah I think it's an important detail there of why is coin death selling it's because parent company dcg has been in some financial trouble recently and so they need to liquidate yeah they need they have like a billion dollar hole so they've got 800 over a billion dollar hole so they've got like you know about a billion dollars left to filled not too much yeah so that's my big casualty of that yeah you know 125 million 125 million there we go David uh so congrats to everyone at coindesk you now work for my old boss [Laughter] uh so does that mean they work for you in any way or there's no relationship no it does not mean that no that's not how that works uh synthetics is releasing something big something new David what's Kane Warwick up to these days yeah so Kane work is releasing infinix as a layer on top of synthetics to help go toe-to-toe with centralized platforms centralized exchanges uh and so this is just kind of a more user-friendly layer on top of synthetics and so it is just a normal registration like a centralized exchange username email password and we'll sign you a unique margin account for every user no no new token uh so it removes all the steps for participating on synthetics because synthetics now is on optimism so you don't have to bridge there anymore you don't have to require susd you don't need to sign every action it's probably going to look and feel a lot like coinbase or any other centralized exchange but you do have an ethereum address and so this is going to release alongside synthetics to V3 later this year anyone can drive and so beta testing is currently in process that's great you know you know what I think partially with screwed us over in 2022 is um block 5 Celsius all these centralized uh C5 like they're so easy to use it was just the app just worked um and D5 really hasn't had that so if we can smooth out the user experience then uh I think we can really grow this cycle one one theme I've been noticing Ryan the compound the comp token recently has a really strong performance uniswap is releasing new to swap X even though I don't think the token price is doing all that crazy of things synthetics volume is painting numbers bro 500 million dollars in a single day from Quinta which is basically another synthetics like plug-in uh so if you scroll down you see that little chart synthetics has never been used more than it has now look at those numbers that's the most that's ever been used D5 is making a comeback OG Defy is is well yeah it's like turns out that remember the whole D5 2.0 media phase that was actually the top yeah it turns out no it's D5 1.0 man D5 1.0 that's upgrading to 2.0 in the background quietly mm-hmm something that is actually new into the D5 world superfluid has introduced super fluid subscriptions so superfluid is a streaming payments startup so if you would like to trickle pennies micro transactions over time uh super fluid is is that they are releasing super fluid subscriptions so you can manage access to software apis content Community however you want to see fit so that's something that's been released it's been a long talked about use case in crypto so you're practically in this case for streaming money no and it has been used in gaming I think has it's gotten some traction but I haven't personally seen a use case for it that has impacted my life but I did throw superfluid over to our web developer Ryan so you're like hey does this does this work can you slap this into bankless.com yeah and so he's investigating that uh disclaimer uh I am an investor in superfluid Ryan is not because he forgot to sign the document yeah and lost that email it didn't send those papers oh well oh sorry about that one on the use case yeah me too uh you know what this is also kind of a bullish use case I think for chain link they just lost their cross chain interoperability critical uh ccip is what this stands for Dave this reminds me a lot of what layer zero is doing if you're familiar zero but chain link flavored this time okay well for those that aren't familiar with layer zero and with what chain link is doing here can you kind of describe what this ccip protocol with the ccip features is actually adding yeah so the first step to transferring tokens across chains is transferring messages across train because actually tokens and data they're all the same thing and so this starts there but it's basically a cross-chain messaging platform since chain link has the security of the link token being staked and it has some amount of assurances about passing messages so you start there and then you can build up further and further use cases and so cross-chain collateral deposits cross-train nfts cross-train gaming cross-training door as data storage and computation it's like a super Bridge yeah it's like a super Bridge yeah mesh network bridge thing because you can build on top of it right if you want to build an app yeah you can right like you know it supports multiple chains underneath like Avalanche and you know other evm chains layer two and ethereum then you can build that on top of this new protocol and chain link is that right uh yes I believe so that's right I have not looked too deeply into this because a I don't really like Bridges to begin with um and B the chain link Army is always up in my mentions and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth yeah I agree but uh you know at the same time chain link has always had great Tech right um they support a lot of the Oracles in the space so they're doing some good things uh black spots has become a unicorn after a 60 million dollar raise so unicorn status is a billion or above that is flashbots the Mev platform there's a lot of a conversation about the development of what they're calling Suave a new Mev chain it's it almost it seems to me it's like it's a it's a Marketplace for Block Builders and and Searchers and the whole kind of all the participants of how a block becomes a block it's like a Marketplace it's a chain Marketplace for them I feel like we need a series of episodes on what's going on in the block builder supply chain space to like fully unpack this and understand stand it but it seems like private investors are understanding it willing to upgrade but in the meantime I think there's going to be a lot of Mev folks including haasu at permissionless the conference will be another nice check-in so another reminder to grab yourself this week if you haven't the theme is accumulate and grab a permissionless ticket um David we got a lot more to talk about though what's coming up next yeah questions from the nation we've got a eigenlayer question they seem to be pretty frequent this week then we got a takes of the week I got a take from Mike epitillo we'll talk about bridges there and then I wrote an article and so there's five takes in there that I'm gonna burn through really quickly and then of course what Ryan and I are bullish on and we got a hot meme it's very hot it's very hot you want to stick around for that so all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible mantle formerly known as bit Dao is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web free space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for tvl and liquidity and on-ramps so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle hiring people worldwide paying them in crypto providing them access to

question of the week coming from onium.eath the question is this it seems to me that eigenlayer's positioning ethereum is a kind of security reserve for other blockchains much like how the US dollar serves as a reserve currency providing economic security globally by enabling ethereum's security to cross-borders into other layer ones eigenlayer appears to be enhancing the overall security of the blockchain ecosystem the question is this could you delve into this analogy and discuss the implications of this security globalization I like that term how could this impact the future of ethereum and other blockchains this idea of security globalization and eigenlayer what's your take here yeah that's a really good question you can definitely tell onim.eth who asked that question thanks onium is like that's that's a bankless Vibe question putting these things into like geopolitical country nation-state terms um so like uh the United States passport probably the most valuable passport in the world that's probably a fair take you can get into the most countries with the United States passport like you can just walk across almost anywhere and everyone's like oh well Welcome to our country I think what they're getting at is that ether does the same thing for all the restaking networks so all these restaking networks is like oh you're you're ether please welcome and you know sit yourself down and also consider providing us some Services while you're here it's pretty pretty similar I'd say uh why does why did eigenlayer choose ether Why didn't it choose Bitcoin why didn't choose Solana well it couldn't choose Bitcoin because it's bitcoin's not proof of sake it's not a smart contract why did it choose ether over Solana well because either has all the economic bandwidth it has all the value you if you're going to have a system where you need to have your collateral to be trusted you need to post collateral you need to post the Best Collateral possible on the network that has all the networks and so that is just ethereum and so this is part of the story of capital begets Capital begets Capital uh and so you just are the most number of doors are open to you uh and so your security your collateral can transcend across boundaries because those boundaries desire your capital of the bust and I think there's pretty strong parallels with what odm is saying here hopefully that was unpacking that analogy enough to their satisfaction yeah the only thing I would add to that is like the direct answer the question to me is how does this impact the future of ethereum in the context of Reserve currency status my take is that cements ether currency of not just ethereum but of like crypto and all of the other blockchains in the same way that kind of the the dollar has been reinforced through the US's military security and economic prowess as the reserve currency of the world like the liquidity and the network effect that you were just talking about like the capital begets Capital Security begets security sort of network effect that just compounds if eigenlayer is successful right um because imagine there being like 10 15 20 tokens on coin Gecko and their layer one tokens or their Network tokens and there's secured by ethereum yeah I mean it is just um it is probably the the single most bullish thing if this takes off for either the asset since like I don't know staking since ultrasound money yep since eip1559 like it's absolutely massive um I think in its ability to build Network effect all right let's go to some takes okay David coming in with takes of the week we only have two this is Mike from block works and this is a post ECC uh take he goes if there's one thing I learned from Paris is that market makers are bridges now uh and this is a conversation that's slowly been brewing and I think really has Crescendo with uniswap x uniswap x also Cal swap I think also perhaps uh Suave itself these are all platforms that allow for Bridges to be completely uh abstracted and also like kind of largely routed around it's really Bridge almost obsoleted right uh yeah you still need them but you need them in the minimal fashion yeah and so why is that true it's because uh market makers what does it mean like why are Market Breakers Bridges now say Ryan you have ether on the ethereum layer one and you would like to have uh die on the optimism layer 2. instead of hopping instead of making a trade on unit Swap and then hopping over a bridge what you can do is you can just post a transaction not even submit a transaction to ethereum but broadcast a transaction that says to any Market maker hey I have this much ether give me as much die as possible on the chain that I want it to be on like I just broadcast my intent I don't actually have to exactly the transaction right and then a market maker is like well I'll take that deal and maybe a different Market maker is like well I'll take that deal too but I'll do it better and all of a sudden the free market fulfills your order and puts your assets that you want in the place that you want and you never had to touch a bridge and like the the bridge security is like minimized uh and so this is kind of the a meta that has been unfolding it's like bridges are kind of just being routed around yeah this is another series of bankless episodes honestly to get into this whole world of intense rather than transactions I feel like we need some content on this to fully unpack and understand it but yeah that is an emerging uh you know meta here David uh what are some other things you learned from ECC I I saw you put a post out in the bankless newsletter this week so what were some of your key takeaways so yeah I actually took some time and wrote out an article to about my big takeaways from ECC it's about 2 500 Words and I'm gonna read it let's go I'm kidding I'll just read the headlines uh the big ones are Protocols are becoming Commodities uh my big tldr here is that by the time the next bull market it comes around the cost of web 3 compute trustless computation data whatever we need to do web drops to zero we'll have we'll have approached its theoretical minimum like that's one of my my big takeaways and you can explain my reasoning and all the the tidbits of data that I have about that so that's the first one second one protocol convergence and verticalization uh so Ave just launched the ghost table coin maker Dow just launched Sparks which is an Ave type money market frax has already had both of these things and they also have their own internal LSD so these things are all starting to a become verticalized and B converge in their same design patterns we already have the convergence we have all the stacks and so those are all converging along the same design patterns then you have uniswap X becoming a vertical on top of uniswap so there's a bunch of convergence and verticalization going on so that's my next big one but then after that it's like okay we have protocols that are maximally cheap we have a D5 apps that are becoming maximally like as vertical and wide as possible it's now time to think of the consumer and I don't only just mean more apps to buy more block space but can we build front ends like infinix like what Kane is doing at synthetics can we build front ends can we build apps can we start doubling tripling quadrupling down on building consumer level stuff that is built for people that have never touched a private key that's my call to action on there and then my last big takeaway is the modular Summit versus ethcc there's two different conferences here uh some of just like the different dispositions of who who you find where but my big takeaway from module or something is like that whole Community which is it's like the Celestia espresso the layer twos the eigenlayer that side of crypto is just racing out into the frontier they are developing and discovering things so quickly they are the actual Frontier of thought I'd say um and so that's my takeaway there and then just as a conclusion if you haven't caught the theme of this episode yet next up is permissionless uh so that's gonna be where the next bankless Meetup is uh and uh the bankers party it's gonna be like 200 plus people for all of our citizens and and friends and everyone we want to party with that's awesome man those are some good takeaways um each of those could be episodes as well I feel like we need to dive into these topics true this is true Woody bullsh on this week man right behind me like I said is uh the Matterhorn and I don't climb it tomorrow we climb a training Mountain tomorrow but uh then we come back and rest and then on Sunday I climb it so it's just like a dice like my three yeah it is a giant Spike I'm actually kind of bummed that that cloud is there but it's the cloud doesn't go away this is your picture yes that's I that's right outside of where I am right now how do you actually get there yeah so you're just like this yeah no there's no car actually I'm in a city with zero cars we have to uh ditch the car park the car take a train in and then the Airbnb that we have is like 20 minutes away so we took this like a little electric taxi it was kind of cool really cool Town yeah that's awesome I'm both trying to climbing the Matterhorn and hopefully successfully are you gonna play in a big bankless flag up there at the top of course I've never missed such an opportunity awesome all right Ryan what do you uh uh you know what despite this week and all of kind of the pushback um and the anger about world's going I'm not gonna say I'm bullish on world going because I'm not but I am bullish on digital proof of personhood um I just feel like crypto sometimes underestimates how much we're going to need this right there's this like huge meta problem that's hitting us right in the face right now which is like we don't know who the Bots are and who the people are on the Internet it's like on Twitter I don't know if there's 500 retweets is how many of those are Bots and how many of those are people right and I think that um what tends to happen over time is if the Bots have the level of speech that humans do on the internet we can't tell human from bot then it starts to fracture Society like democracies run on trust like democracy is kind of a you know a conversation between all of its citizens and if you can get civil attacked by a whole bunch of bots if your democracy can be civil attacked in that way and destroy the fabric of trust destroy the conversation uh then you could destroy democracy I I feel very strongly that like human beings should have freedom of speech on the internet but I don't think that extends to Bots and so if we can't tell who the Bots and who the humans are we got a real problem and the the status quo the only way we know how to do that right now is either you have kind of like the tech companies partner with the government to do some sort of like state ID driver's license um passport AML KY something like that that's what we're headed that's like the default right and so that's bad for a lot of reasons um but I guess it's something and I guess what I'm bullish on though is that we can get to a place crypto can play a huge role maybe the fundamental role in creating the stateless identity and in order for a stateless identity proof of personhood online to work it needs to be decentralized it needs to be permissionless it needs to be private it needs to be unsensible those are the things that crypto is really good at if this type of thing doesn't come from crypto where's it going to come from no one else is building this Silicon Valley is not building this the tech companies aren't building this so I feel I've always felt like this with with crypto which is like act one is separation of money and state act two is separation of identity and state right like we need both of those abilities if we're going to make it through the potential dystopian authoritarian scenarios that you know the 21st century is going to throw at us so I don't know how this will look I don't know what kind of this the best Solutions are whether it's kind of a you know social graph based solution or something else whether Biometrics plays a role in it or not but I would encourage us with all of the kind of the pushback on worldcoin and there are a lot of good reasons for pushback to be had let's not lose sight of this use case of uh decentralized proof of personhood I think we're going to need this one and I think crypto has a big role to play so you know here's a podcaster telling all the devs to go build something cool but like we gotta go build something cool guys right anyway that's my take you want to get to the meme of the week I've been waiting for this one uh an old Gary Gensler meme that sort of fits in David did you talk about this yeah yeah okay so this was like UFO week I don't know if you caught this like somebody in uh all right uh there's Gary Gensler picture of Gary genzer her favorite and he goes all these UFOs they're gonna need to come in and register have to come in register we're gonna need you guys coming there you go it's coming to my office we'll end it there I have no take on UFOs at this point as another thing I'm just uh I mean if these UFOs can just abduct scary Gensler that sounds like the more likely outcome all right I'm not gonna touch that one uh wrist disclaimers gotta let you know at the end of every bankless episode of course none of this has been Financial advice it's not alien advice nothing of the sort uh you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
