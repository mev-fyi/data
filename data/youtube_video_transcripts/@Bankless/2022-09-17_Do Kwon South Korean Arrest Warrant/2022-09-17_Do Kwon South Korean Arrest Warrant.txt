now has an arrest warrant for his arrest in south korea so a court in seoul issued a warrant for dokuan and five others allegating that they violated the nation's capital markets law i don't know what that means sounds very broad but yeah i bet there's something in there where like if you are responsible for imploding 50 billion dollars of capital that you probably broke some law somewhere do quan has said that he plans to cooperate when the time comes and he said that in this crypto interview media startup coinage that floated the prospect of jail time to do quan and do quan finish saying life is long meaning that like i got a lot of life to live so i might as well just like go to jail and pay this time and just go through it it's incredibly stoic we'll have to see where that ends up and not only do quan it was five others five others two involved in the company with dokuan so that's happening
