one of the big lessons for the community has been around the kind of stable coin and luna stuff we actually got to a point where principles based thinkers kind of got a bit demoralized right because i mean if your principal is based thinker then you're going to say anything that offers more than 10 abi is like basically unsustainable out at best a scam at worst because uh you know nothing in fiat lands can stably offer 10 percent returns with like very little risk of losses so why the hell do we think that crypto space can do better but at the same time you know in 2020 2021 we just saw this kind of ongoing yield farming craze and 90 apys on guild farming usdc or whatever that's demoralizing right because like i think a lot of people even started thinking maybe this whole like sanity and logic thing actually is just a fiat world web 2 prejudice and then boom and uh luna suddenly taught people that like oh no no principles actually do matter and we actually do live in reality
