[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman we're here to help you become more bankless david banger of an episode who do we have on what are we talking about we had bruno massage who's a political philosopher and has written a bunch of different books that attempt to characterize the disposition of different parts of the world and that's why we got him on to the bankless podcast today because bruno really has his finger on the pulse as to what makes the different parts of the world tick so we wanted to get him on so he could share that with us but also we wanted to have a broader conversation about the disposition of these different parts of the world and how they are going to relate to a crypto first world that we see coming how is europe going to deal with bitcoin and ethereum are they going to be adversarial or are they going to be integrative what about america what about china and so we the first half of this podcast we take a decent amount of time to go through each different part of the world and really give it a character give it a personality and then we turn to the conversation of crypto where bruno actually kind of turns it around on us and asks us some questions is how we see the different parts of the world integrating with crypto or being adversarial to crypto and so bruno is an absolute scholar and he really does a great job teaching us and carrying you along for the journey and so this was just an absolutely crazy informative episode that i'm sure you're going to enjoy the first part of this is really interesting and phenomenal but the second part of this where we start talking about crypto i think the last 35 40 minutes or so is just straight fire because bruno applies his political philosophy framework that we we talked about and he applies that to crypto and takes he asks us some hard questions uh to be honest david like questions that have been in the back of his mind that quite didn't quite make sense about crypto we do our best to answer those and then he provides his geopolitical interpretation of all of this and it's quite a salient perspective yeah really the first half of the episode was a means to an end to get to the second half of the episode so you really need to listen to this and thing in its entirety so without further ado we're going to get right into the episode with bruno but first we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto assets you need to go to argent.xyz and download the argent smart contract wallet

whitelisted accounts making sure that your money doesn't ever do anything that you don't explicitly approve in order to see the argent while in action go to argent dot link bank lists and download the app when you own crypto what really matters is the security and ownership over your assets being a part of the bankless nation means having complete sovereignty over your crypto the easiest way to do that is with a ledger hardware wallet a hardware wall is a little device that manages your private keys for you so you don't have to worry about proper private key management your ledger hardware wallet keeps your private keys private but still lets you have easy access to your crypto the combination of my ledger hardware wallet and metamask lets me store my crypto assets in the most safe way possible but still lets me easily access uniswap or all the other defy apps that i use on a daily basis if you already have a ledger wallet you can use the ledger live app to participate in some of the money verbs that we discuss in the bankless program the ledger live app is your headquarters for managing your personal crypto finance it's a great tool to manage the assets you hold on your ledger as well as receive a portfolio summary of all the assets that you have stored using the ledger live app you can buy bitcoin ether and stable coins and have it sent directly to your ledger hardware wallet skipping over the trusted exchanges and getting your assets into your control you can even use the ledger live app to swap crypto assets natively inside of the app so you never need to send your crypto assets away from your ledger to make a trade buying a ledger is like buying a fire extinguisher the best time to get one was yesterday especially if you're doing something silly like holding your crypto in a hot wallet that's always connected to the internet if you haven't gained full control over your crypto yet go to the link in the show notes and get your ledger today all right guys i hope you're excited let's get right into the episode with bruno [Music] bankless nation we are so excited to introduce you to bruno massage he is a political philosopher and author of several books including a latest book called history has begun the birth of a new america he actually has a really strong familiarity with crypto uh he wrote this fantastic article i read a couple of months ago called the crypto state with a question mark at the end and we brought him on to help us understand what's going on from the political philosophy mindset the geopolitical shifts in the world and what all of this means for crypto this is going to be a stellar conversation bruno how are you doing today pretty good it's great to be here you know i'm just going to open things up that's like we this is what we would like to do at uh bankless is open up with a interesting starter question is crypto a rival to the nation state from your perspective yeah i think it is um you know that there's been an interest as you can imagine from political thinkers for quite a while to try to think about what comes after the current um structures that we have particularly those people who are not convinced that we've reached the end of history so what's the next big change and if you're a political philosopher by training and particularly in my case a historian of political thought that's that's how i started uh you're very much attuned to these um historical changes um i think if you've brought up in your college and grad school years reading about uh the whole tradition of western but not only western political thought you immediately uh understand that the changes have been dramatic radical you know you read aristotle you'll read plato it has nothing in common with the liberal democracy so i think that's an advantage that one has if you come from that tradition and you're also very aware of the differences in in the way societies organize themselves i think pretty much everyone has a mental model of this story tribes empires than the modern state a huge debate about what is distinctive about the modern state but we know something is the bureaucracy perhaps the element of civil society whatever it is it's very different from other forms and then you're interested in thinking about well what comes after the state as it exists today and there's been different theories about this different intellectual wagers let's call it that a world state would seem to fit with a certain narrative of globalization uh then technology of course introduced a very interesting debate about this and there's been some stuff written about how facebook in some respects mimics the structure of a nation state a global nation state zuckerberg himself has been interested in this idea from the very start i have started to think about this how you can fit technology into this narrative and it seemed to me that where the real historical development the big breakthrough can be found is actually in crypto because crypto and in fact if you go back to the founding papers of crypto that's obvious there crypto changes some of the fundamental assumptions about political thought i say in my piece that um satoshi is uh is very politically aware and i think that's true it would be possible to try to look at those papers and and and see them as political philosophy papers what crypto introduces a radical change is in the idea of trust of course and trust is the basis of every political structure that that's existed in the past if you move towards a trustless environment then you're really introducing a fundamental change in the way you think about politics now i don't want to go too far and all this has to be thought about and tested but in a way you could say that the break if this works out is more fundamental uh more essential than even the break from medieval straits state structures to modern state structures because they were both based on trust so that's how i get to that and how i get i got interested in that i want to think about crypto and i needed a convenient framework um to think through it and and for me what really works is this idea well perhaps we're creating fundamentally new structures of political power so bruno a lot of your work in your library is focused on uh re-organizing a or rehyb proposing a way to view the world specifically from a political philosophy mindset and and you have characterized different regions of the world using different political philosophies and i kind of want to get into your heads like how do you draw the world map in your head in ways that other people don't like where are the dividing lines is it an east first west type world are we in a developed first underdeveloped type world uh how do you draw the lines of the world right i think there's two fundamental elements there that sort of guide my my thinking and writing first you know when i was grad school at harvard uh 15 years ago i was already very frustrated with this idea that all you could do as a political thinker was to interpret ideas from the past but that was really nothing new to create you know the fukuyama narrative but it takes many forms and i don't even think fukuyama is the most important name here it's much older than fukuyama this idea that a liberal democracy is the end of political development i was very frustrated with that um and actually lost interest in in in becoming an academic in large measure because of that what i think started happening in the last few years and that's why i with a renewed passion turned to writing which i hadn't done before in my life i think it's actually now become possible to think about what comes next uh it was very difficult 20 years ago the almonds were not there the material was not there the the mood was not there but the last few years the last decade has really been pregnant with change you know and i think that started to happen in 2008 i remember giving a seminar one of my last professional seminars at university in 2007 whereas expressing to the students are really there was nothing on the horizon of particular historical significance that one could think about by the way back then china's him pacified and globalization was thriving and then of course 2008 you had um you had the financial crisis and since then uh every year or every couple years you have something that makes you think about whether the current framework is really stable or not i think those processes have been accelerating that's how i see the pandemic as well but of course crypto is part of this china and the new china much more aggressive much more self-confidence is another part of that so for someone like me who was waiting for this moment then i think when it came you really want to grab it that's the first element the second element is you know i like to think of myself as in some respects a traveler it's my favorite thing in life and now put on hold unfortunately and if you combine a philosophical interest with traveling i talk about this in my first book then you're necessarily interested in trying to explore the deep differences between different parts of the world i don't believe that you can be a good political thinker without traveling you simply don't understand the differences you assume the whole world is is the same by the way i also don't think you can be a good traveler if you don't if you're not a political thinker in some way because again you're gonna miss what is interesting about a society and what i love to do is to go to a different part of the world for an extended period and really try to explore how different societies are organized what makes them tick how they operate how they work try to build a model of that society from scratch without priors without preconceptions and that's um you know my favorite thing in terms of intellectual work and by the way it's my favorite thing in terms of intellectual work because it combines with things that are not work meeting people talking to people visiting places tasting the food and so on so it's great intellectual work and what i've been trying to do in my books is precisely that is to try to think of the world as being divided into let us call it different civilizational areas and what i mean by that what i mean by civilization very roughly is different construct constructs of looking at the world which are really fundamental because they they involve everything about about life uh everything about the way you approach the world you look at the world you think the feelings you have the way you interpret facts around you and i'm fascinated by this idea that in fact the world is much richer than one might think at first and that different parts of the world have to be interpreted on their own terms so my first book is essentially an attempt to to make a call for this approach uh and to abandon the much more natural approach for us in the west to think that everyone is converging to our model if they haven't converged is because they failed or because they're slow in the process but the whole world is essentially converging to the same model now i don't believe in that and and one reason i don't believe in that is that i actually think human beings want to find their own path and they're not convinced by the idea that they have to copy others so those two elements i think are present in all my work uh so you find both a great attraction to the future to what next and a great attraction to the difference to to what is different from us uh gets me in trouble a lot the second element by the way um then i only realized in the last couple of years the pressure for uniformity to um subscribe to our values is so strong if you try to understand turkey or russia or china on their own terms you're immediately accused of the worst possible things you know you you might even be accused of being paid by those governments to to make to make that effort as if they care about that as if they care about some foreign trying to understand the cultural patterns of china as if the chinese government would be interested in that or are you accused of moral turpitude in some way that you don't believe in our values so that helped me in the last two years those kind of reactions to understand why it doesn't happen more actually the pressure not to do it is quite quite significant it's it's so funny to hear you talk because there are so many analogies in an analysis situations that i think we see on the on the bankless journey uh within crypto right so like i guess a few points liberal democracy not being the end of history is super interesting because that obviously poses the question which i hope we get to is what supersedes it but your other point about traveling how can someone comment on a civilization area without having been immersed and engrossed in that civilization area we say the same thing at bankless basically it's like if you want to understand a crypto system and even the the political philosophy of that crypto system you actually have to use it so like the best way to understand bitcoin is to immerse yourself in bitcoin culture and buy some bitcoin the best way to understand ethereum is to start using d5 protocols and actually like understand what they're about and why they're useful and why various ones work and others don't i think that's uh super analogous to what you're saying and we do want to get to crypto in a minute but i think it's important for our listeners to have this mental model of the civilization areas that you were mentioning like we want to understand what's happening in the world i think bruno and what if we sort of take it by region because that's sort of what your your books seem to do can you take us through the important things we need to know uh with some of the the major i guess civilization areas or regions of the world maybe starting with europe and then we could take america and then china and get to some of the other places but but tell us what do we need to know about what is changing in europe these days right so that's the kind of exercise that i've been trying to do a book for each of these areas it's pretty tough uh and it will take a couple decades to complete but it's a good thing you're asking and by the way you have to be open to change your ideas about what you think is fundamental about these different areas um and what is difficult is that you actually want to go in depth you want to find the active principle of each of these um civilizational areas but obviously that's very difficult and very prone to error so you always have to be open to to to revisions and and to change your mind about this but when i think about europe and in some respects it might even be more difficult for me to think about europe because you're not outside and um sometimes it's it's more difficult if you if you have to look from the inside and if you're brought up in that intellectual environment but uh some things seem seem important to me so obviously uh second world war the fascism experience and the nazism experience is um determinant here uh i i'd like to talk about i'm trying to write something actually today the the mystery of fascism and what i mean by the mystery of fascism is i mean no one saw it coming you had the the narrative of the enlightenment in europe which was uh moving in the opposite direction commerce was supposed to make people tolerant open to difference um the enlightenment was supposed to be uh indifferent to to religious difference or to or or even to to racial difference in many languages thinkers societies were supposed to be more rational less based on on passion uh or hatred uh or other forms of uh of political animals um and then why why do you get the fascism experience and to be honest i haven't found a good explanation of this i'm reading a book that was praised a lot just came out a couple months ago called the perfect fascist um by an american historian-american italian historian and one of the reasons i was interested in the book is that actually is not a theory book it's a history of um one of the most important political men around mussolini and his american jewish wife and so i thought you know it's interesting experiment here we just go deep into the life of that individual and try to see what moved him towards the fascist ideas and towards mussolini the book has been a bit quite disappointing so far but still you know that remains a question that hasn't been answered it's uh really fundamental for european consciousness uh even today when i look at the european union i i tend to interpret it as fundamentally a response to auschwitz in the sense that the values that are foundational for the european unions are the sort the the exact opposite of of the nazism experience so a certain cosmopolitanism which is present there technocracy the rule of experts no borders nationalism is considered political evil so you build a project that is supposed to move you beyond fascism respond to fascism and prevent it in the future to the point where and if i wrote a book about europe which i will do at some point to the point where i think politics at the european union level has become a form of algorithmic politics you build very sophisticated algorithms and the logic of that is again the logic of creating political structures that are completely impervious to uh the rule of the individual of the leader of the viewer um completely um impenetrable to political arbitrariness because they are in fact algorithms they operate by themselves without human intervention and if it's without human intervention and then you're safe from the fascist temptation or fascism drift by the way fascists themselves the italian variety and the german variety were very interested in recovering this human ailment they thought that the enlightened political model was too mechanical and they wanted to recover the element of human decision making now when you get to the to the european union you actually go to the ultimate conclusion in this process of making political rule mechanical so all over the european union you see procedures that are automatic procedures that are based on fundamental algorithms it could even be about relocating refugees it could be about budget rules it's by the way one thing that is criticized about the eu all the time that is not flexible that is rigid mechanical automatic let me give you an example now with the with the pandemic president macron the other day announced that uh the restrictions will remain in place and they are pretty harsh in france right now they will remain in place until the number of daily covet cases falls below 5000. why would you do this right actually you have to think ahead to the future you have to project you have to plan you cannot create a structural political decision maker that reacts to data from the past whether yesterday was 5000 or not you have to make political decisions that anticipate the future but in europe that's so difficult because the question everyone asks immediately is who are you to make these political decisions where does your legitimacy come from and democracy is actually not an answer to that so what i see in europe fundamentally is this is this hyper rationalism where in fact you have a form of artificial intelligence in charge of political societies so so okay so these moves it's almost as if you're describing a centralized bureaucratic but almost algorithmically bureaucratic sort of europe that has i guess counteracted or gone to the polar opposite of fascism does that serve to defend europe against a future fascism or do you think it could actually have the opposite effect what are sort of the the strengths and weaknesses of europe in the 2020s as it's set up right now so that's a that's a very important question and what we've what we've seen so far is the problems that the eu is facing constantly since 2009 are very much related to this inability to respond to the external environment think of the eu as a very sophisticated machinery uh really sort of high-tech which precisely is very vulnerable to environmental disturbance it could be you know high-tech machinery that is very vulnerable to thin sand in the desert so anything that comes from the outside and that is not pre-programmed into the algorithm is a form of disturbance it could be china it could be a financial crisis in the u.s it could be refugees it could be turkey it could be russia invading ukraine every time something unexpected from the external environment takes place the machinery grinds to a halt and then it has to be repaired but what is interesting is that it's repaired and then set to work automatically again there hasn't been so far any great interest in replacing the machinery with the human beings making decisions now we're in the middle of something similar both with covid but more recently the last week unexpected political decision made in hungary and poland to veto the recovery plan that was supposed to start very soon again you see that political decisions if they are sovereign political decisions are a source of great disturbance to the machinery now the question is is this a process in a certain is this a step in a certain evolutionary process could you become better at this you could try to make an analogy to how robotics is developing you also want your robotics to be able to deal with an uncertain external environment you want to build better algorithms and particularly as you move towards forms of robotics that interact with the external environment so one solution would be okay let's keep on this path and let's try to build a u that is is even more sophisticated along the same path another solution would be you could try to remove some areas from this algorithmic decision making and make it more human-based which by the way is also something that is done you know i i would be attracted to the analogy where you think about the you as a self-driving car and then the question is do you keep working on these algorithms or do you actually create a hybrid vehicle where some parts are automated but not everything and when there's still a role for human beings that could be a model for the you or then you know perhaps the the whole machinery will break down at some point and then you have to the return of sovereign human based decision making which of course will be very disturbing because that's what we thought we have gotten rid of it's it's a fascinating portrait of the eu that you're painting it's like um from from the way it sounds it is not at this stage very what uh telev might might say anti-fragile um against these kind of major events uh in history whether these are geopolitical events or even technology change events but let's uh turn our focus across the atlantic and talk a little bit about america what's happening in the united states right now what do we need to know about america over the next decade so that's the topic of my latest book and it's almost the exact the reverse of what i've just described about the eu by the way just to conclude what i was describing is the european union now you have the national states which are different what's been happening in europe is in fact this combination of completely automatic decision-making at the eu level and then still human-based decision-making at the national level and when nation states think they are ready to move decision making to the european level then it's automated to become a eu competence means to become automated in my view but what's happening in the u.s is almost a reverse opposite of what you have in brussels because what you have in brussels is hyper rationalism where you know everything has been planned everything has been thought out everything works uh independent of human capres and whimsies in the u.s you have a form of post-reality and post-truth i think there's something quite accurate about that kind of description in my book this this latest book called history has begun i described the united states as fantasy land as a country rooted and based on the pursuit of fantasy life on the pursuit of the wildest forms of fantasy life as if almost everyone is living inside a movie or a novel and conducting their lives as the screen the scriptwriters or the authors of their own story i think this is present across american society i think it explains a lot of what silicon valley has done i see it as a form of virtual experience even we're not talking about oculus quest we're talking about everything i think twitter we can talk about it i see twitter as a kind of virtual french revolution where you replicate the experience of being in the middle of political turmoil um but in a virtual way of course i'm talking about the core of twitter that people who use twitter as they use instagram to share some photos but what makes twitter move and what stern twitter such an important institution in in american society in particular as we saw in the election i saw president trump is this political element of twitter it's a it's a virtual french revolution because every day you wake up you can pick a victim you can agitate a moth to go after that victim uh you can virtually execute him or execute her you have the vicarious experience of great political passion a certain sense of achievement but this is all virtual it doesn't take place in reality as a twitter user bruno i can definitely attest to that there are times where i feel like it's all pitchforks and guillotines and you know we are in this you know battle battle for for truth yeah but that's the feature it's not it's not a bug it's not some people say why don't we correct this about twitter that's the whole point of twitter you wouldn't be attractive otherwise and that's why i'm there as well although getting a bit tired of it by now uh but uh i think you you see it in what silicon valley has done you know my working hypothesis would be that if social networks or the internet as a whole had been developed in europe or in china it would have taken a completely different form because it was developed in america it did take this fundamental form of virtual reality broadly understood of course then other countries have to adapt to it and they modify it to the extent that they can but the kind of impulse coming from america is to think of the internet and and of social networks in this way i think you see it in politics we can talk about trump but i see trump as essentially a figure of virtual political reality a kind of a virtual nationalist figure but the word virtual here is crucial in all these things and then you know delicate thing to talk about but when i look at american religion i also see it as a form of virtualized religion where the experience is very intense it's immersive that's that's the difference with religion in in in sweden or many parts of europe it is immersive it is intense but it's not literal like in iran so the united states when it comes to religion maybe religious people would be offended by this i don't mean it in that way but religious experience in america is something between sweden and iran it is felt in an intense way it is fully immersive but it's not taken literally i remember seeing on on one of the cable news channels um reportedly interviewing an old lady coming out of a church back in in march at the height of the first wave um somewhere in in in the midwest i think um and asked this old lady the reporter aren't you afraid of getting coveted uh and and she answered no because i'm covered in the blood of christ now for european to to listen to this you know you you get scared because you know in our experience if someone says something like this it's a potential theocrat or for many people in europe who no longer believe in religion this would raise some questions about how someone in a modern society can believe this but obviously i think you have to interpret american religion differently from how you interpret in other parts of the world there's a virtualized element which is very powerful it's not like this lady literally believes in this but she does understand it's a very sophisticated understanding she does understand that religion provides for a certain intensity of living that would not be there without religion and then you know everywhere you look in american society i see this uh this element of virtualism as being very central as you saw in the case of the you know in the case of america there's an intellectual wager here i want to explain everything about american society or about european society in terms of a single principle it's been tried before one author that did this systematically was montesquieu it's very difficult to do but but that's kind of the the ambition i have uh and in american society i would i would start from virtualism as a principle that at least if it doesn't explain everything and it doesn't it explains what is distinctive about american society compared to other societies so bruno what you're describing america as versus europe is america is a less mechanical less like a self-driving car more human sort of experience but you also use the term like virtual post-truth fantasy land um is that is that healthy for america what are the prospects for let's call it the the american empire if it's living in a post-truth fantasy land i think i think you can defend it i think it's easy to defend now in this world that i'm describing with different civilizational areas you only have to step outside america and become a european to find lots of arguments to criticize it and europeans are very good at this but if we try before we do that to stay with america and try to understand it from within i think it can be defended and there would be two basic arguments first contrary to what many people say and sort of europeanized intellectuals in the us many of them actually europeans political truth is is not such a good thing truth in politics and facts in politics are very dangerous and very problematic so i keep reading that the the rule of fiction is very distinctive of totalitarian movements now that's not true at all sometimes anaheim is quoted in this context i don't know if he ever said this i don't think she did but if she did she was wrong because when you look at nazism or sovietism what distinguishes them is actually the attempt to subjugate human beings to a certain understanding of truth and that's why they are part of the european tradition that i described earlier what does nazism do comes up with a concept of biological truth there are races some races are biologically superior and so in the end as darwin would teach you they will win out and you might as well follow the the biological truth that that you know about and sovietism has a certain understanding of historical truth there are historical forces that point in a certain direction and that's this is where human societies are going and we might as well accelerate the process so both nazism and sovietism what is disturbing and problematic about them is that they place political truth above human beings and human beings have to have to follow it so i'm always a bit puzzled and skeptical when i see this argument that we have to go back to truth uh because it didn't work out so well last time we tried it um and by the way when we tried it with nazism and sovietism it was actually a way to move beyond the relativism of the enlightenment and the kind of tolerance towards different views and to really inaugurate a period where truth would be in charge so that's i think the first argument that if you want to defend the american solution uh to the political problem that you could use and the second argument is well fantasy life is not such a bad thing there is of course in human beings this primordial aspiration to pursue their fantasies you know you could argue this is what makes us human now it hasn't been possible in the past if you wanted to live with your fantasies you usually retreated to a private life or you know you you you regard it as a form of psychological dissociation or a form of madness now what american society is doing is actually to create the possibility of diminishing the distance between real life and fantasy and and you know that's a valuable important aspiration if you can make it work it has taken recently of course a certain form in american society which for a european is particularly perverse you know i remember during the pandemic seeing all these videos from people who go into the supermarket and they just refuse to wear a mask uh and you know the karen phenomenon right oh my gosh and and that's a form of uh that's a form of fantasy life we can do an extreme you want the whole world as if you are playing a video game or on awkward quest and you want the whole world to circle around you uh and and to do as you wish as if you know the whole world adapt to your wishes immediately as soon as you have them so i think that's quite typical of american society and there's a perverse element to it but there's also an incredibly attractive almost irresistible bankless nation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to a die which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized

be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment wiring is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wide system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that iron has to offer at yearn dot finance that's y e a r n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing so let's let's bring the uh the the last i'd say physical civilization we want to bring into this and this um i think dovetails nicely with kind of the american fantasy because part of the american fantasy i think for many uh americans is that america is the center of progress and the universe uh and they're you know america's number one right like we have our flags there's no other no other place in the world where you get this level of opportunity right and some might argue that that is part of the american fantasy but let's turn now to china because it seems to be the case that china is not so much playing in a fantasy world it has it is playing for keeps it is playing for all of the marbles uh if if you will it is becoming hyper competitive and has long term plans and strategies in which to supersede american power what do we need to know about china right now okay so maybe i have in this case a less organized and more tentative uh understanding of china china is is very difficult for an outsider to to understand um but but here are some thoughts so what what strikes me about china i lived there for for a year very recently and trying to to pursue this investigation almost on on a daily basis what strikes me is what the importance of uh political power that's really what organizes everything gigi ping wrote an article an essay recently about what is um communism and chinese characteristics and he said well what defines communism and chinese characteristics is the rule of the chinese communist party so what is interesting about that is there's no principle there's no set of values there's no ideology which is kind of the way americans and europeans would think about it there is a source a seat of power the chinese communist party is in charge so you define the source of authority the source of political power before you actually define what political power is for or the set of principles organizing out your society that's difficult for a westerner to accept we are quite ideological quite philosophical we like to start with with principles uh of some kind so chinese society is certainly more pragmatic in this radical sense this i think goes back to the confucian tradition which was clearly not about finding true principles but about a certain practice a certain way of dealing with the world and then communism dovetailed rather well with that um and of course the person you usually turn to when you're talking about chinese pragmatism is then chopping and many of his famous sayings are around this doesn't matter if the cat is black or white what matters if it catches mice or doesn't catch mice i think that's a good good way to describe this or the way you move forward is by the way you cross the river is by feeling the stones in your feet not by actually deciding what's the point on on the other bank that you want to reach but actually moving stone by stone and feeling them very carefully in your feet this is a a different way to think about society and you can pursue it in different directions um by the way it's also interesting if we bring in the question of artificial intelligence again this fits right well with the idea of a black box and many people have compared chinese society to a black box and i think that's a that's an interesting comparison and again what what you do in china is you focus on obtaining a certain kind of results and you modify the input in order to get better results without necessarily being interested in understanding how the process works i think this has helped china in in the last few decades maybe one of the causes of the 2008 financial crisis is an excess of economic theory in the west which sometimes becomes dogmatic you want to pursue this you know you have certain ideas about inflation or you have certain ideas about uh how innovation works how creative destruction works you have certain ideas how uh central banks should stay out or you have certain ideas about the separation between political authorities and uh and economic activity and so and sometimes these very rigid theories become a problem and china doesn't work like this china is very open to try different solutions provided that they work you manipulate the inputs if you don't understand why it's working that's not necessarily a problem but it's a big problem for us right both in the on this europeans and americans we we kind of agree we want to understand uh how the black box works and it also reduces your ability to have an impact if you first have to understand how the black box works and chinese will just go straight towards them straight towards the outcome manipulating certain level of inputs what impressed me about about let us say the chinese intellectuals or young people that i met was they have this understanding of chinese society they don't know exactly how everything works they they test they probe you know i'll give you an example uh remember dinner in beijing with uh with the important journalist a rather independent one and i take seriously his aspirations to be relatively independent and his outlet is he's private but he's of course subject to political control and what he was telling me is what you don't know before you try something you don't know so you you probe the beast you you publish something you see the reaction maybe you'll get away with it i think it's worse than that in china and it's a source of great stress for every ambitious chinese entrepreneur or intellectual or journalist if you try something it could work incredibly well um and and and you could uh move up very quickly or you could work very badly and you could end up in jail and you're never quite sure and you have to try the whole whole life is a gamble uh so to give you an example it's a famous photographer that went out and took some photographs of chinese aids patients and i'm sure many of his friends i can't remember his name many of his friends i'm sure advised against it it seemed an incredibly imprudent thing to do back 15 years ago or 20 years ago well it worked out very well authorities actually liked it perhaps unexpectedly to many people you wouldn't have expected that in advance that they would like to have some of the fundamental problems of chinese society and the way they were unaddressed exposed in public he actually became internationally famous as well well two or three years ago he repeated the trick he went to xinjiang and he took some photographs there of what was happening there and he hasn't been hurt about since uh chinese life is a lot like this you you it's the black box you never know in advance and you have to probe to try but if you're ambitious you also have to prove that's why chinese society can't be compared to to soviet society let's say where i think the result of political authoritarianism was that everyone was extraordinarily cautious and and didn't try anything new that's not the case in chinese society you probe you try some sometimes it works other times it doesn't work but it's the only way to move up if you want to move quickly is also to try some unexpected things this by the way is the way to read um op-eds in in chinese society many people are cautious and repeat the official line but every now and then there's someone who takes a big gamble and says something unexpected and and sometimes it works well for them so you actually in case of china can't dismiss everything that appears in the newspapers because sometimes uh it has not been controlled in advance and i think also explains why there's some dynamism about chinese society which been very puzzling for americans in particular because i think many of the people in dc are still operating under the cold war model and they think about china china's new soviet union but it isn't the new soviet union uh let me go back to where i started because when xi ji ping wanted to define what is communism with chinese characteristics it didn't come up with 12 principles as the soviets would do or you know as trotsky or lenin or or or stalin would do the 12 principles of communism it's just sad chinese with communism chinese characteristics is the rule of the chinese communist party now what will the chinese communist party decide uh you're not quite sure before it happens it's incredibly flexible and attuned to the historical moment political power in the moment is what i think defines china for bad and good but it is likely that the chinese political parties will optimize political party that is will optimize for pragmatism and i i guess as you look at these civilization areas europe america and china which is the best positioned um in in the decades to come to accrue some level of of dominance i you know my last book i argued the u.s um i had i had tried to describe how powerful uh contemporary china is in my previous books uh again getting in trouble because you know there's this intellectual environment now where if you're describing how chinese the chinese economy and chinese society is actually quite effective at producing uh positive some some positive outcomes uh you're not necessarily praising the regime because by the way some of these outcomes would not be regarded positive bias let us take the case of the pandemic where individual freedom was was trampled upon and we can talk about that a little later but in terms of the outcomes that the regime decides uh the country is able to to reach them and deliver them on on a consistent basis and is organized around a single political authority and that doesn't seem to be a significant organized resistance yet to that single political authority so i was just describing as a matter of fact not as a matter of value whether you like it or not but in fact you may actually describe a very powerful and efficient china as a way of warning everyone else if you don't like how chinese society is and how it works then you should be you should be very careful and very afraid because it is powerful and it's not collapsing next year as you know any analysts are saying so i did investigate that possibility in previous books and i think particularly my book on the belton road gives a very objective picture which has resisted very well the book came out already three years ago there are many books three years ago saying that china would collapse before 2020. i'm not going to give examples but there are many books and mine said that china would would do well for the foreseeable future and you know in january february i was saying that china is going to respond very well to the virus and other countries in the west are going to be in trouble uh so i think it's it's resisted well the test of time so far but actually in the in the most recent book i i sort of come out defending that american society still fundamentally is in a better position uh and one of the reason is one of the reasons is i think this precisely this ability to uh unleash the energies of creativity of fantasy um and also a certain ability uh to to change you know what is remarkable let us say about the present moment is people ask me all the time is anything going to change with biden well if you're talking about the structure of the global system not a lot is going to change because it changes slowly and because the u.s is not as powerful as it was so he cannot command changes in the global system but if you're talking about the level of symbol language and the level of storytelling the change is dramatic so you go from trump to almost an anti-trump who's going to be talking about the opposite things that trump talked about he's going to be talking about climate change all the time and he's going to be talking about working with europe all the time so american society has this incredible ability for sharp turns which should not simply be impossible in europe and and china i think that's that's a quality that's an that's an advantage um and i also expect american society to evolve towards uh a much greater curiosity about the rest of the world and potentially more open to cultural difference than either china or europe are china europe are very convinced that they have the best model i think the new america that is developing now um where new conservatives missing crisis where americans are not quite sure anymore about what is exactly the best model for society to organize itself this sort of crisis of nihilism that exists in america today i think it could be interpreted positively as a way to being open to different possibilities into the world i see that more in america than i see in europe india or china where really this evangelical appetite is very strong um so i i'm hopeful about america let me put it that way bruno i recently wrote in an article on the bankless newsletter a line where i said the world seems to be falling apart at the seams and we've taken our time to go through some of the regions of the world and to you've described your your perspective on their dispositions right there's an american disposition there's a european disposition there's a chinese disposition and one of the reasons why we've taken our time to characterize these dispositions is because we want to get to the inevitable question as to how do these different dispositions play with crypto how do they interact with a crypto world because there's plenty of political implications with crypto as well but before we get to that point i want to ask are these the divisions are these scenes between america europe and china that seems that we see being stressed right now under this current world order that seems to be highly unsettled the world seems to be really unsettled right now we seem to be moving into a chaotic state are these the divisions that we see being tested right now or are there other divisions that we need to be paying attention to as well and maybe are the are these contributing to the the disorder and chaos that we see in the world right now what's your perspective on this right i think this is this is a main cause um that you have this radical difference between different regions of the world and they are not converging to the same model they have all become very self-confident they are all committed to affirming their way of of seeing things and doing things so there's an inevitable clash between systems by the way in this case the block that has recognized it has been actually the european union that published a document a year ago saying that china is a systemic rival so this idea of systemic rivalry idea between of a rivalry a competition between different systems is is important you have a world that is radically new in the sense that it is a technological world with multiple poles of power and i think that's the first time it happens we had a world with multiple poles of power before but fundamentally before the modern age you have to go back to the 15th century have the um ming empire ottoman you have start of the mughal empire in india you have the habsburg empire in europe so you have multiple sources of power but they are separate from each other distant they are not daily involved in the affairs of each other and one of the reasons they are separate is that technology still is not a fundamental force then with the modern age you have fully technological societies um in the process of technological development which tends to accelerate but it just so happens that when technology enters the stage you have a relatively more organized world because technology enters the stage essentially in europe so europe takes over the world develops colonial empires but the rest of the world has essentially to to follow suit and it has essentially to subordinate itself to european power so what happens now in the 21st century is that you combine these two worlds that i just described a world where technology is everywhere and constantly accelerating but where power is divided between multiple poles that's what we have no experience of and it's a world potentially very dangerous you have these gigantic civilizational spaces which are powerful which are confident that they control technological forces are confident that they can actually control the technologies of the future but they are very different among themselves and they are in competition and they are on the same level of power distribution that's very clear now you know if we stick with the three we talked about european union united states and china are when it comes to to gdp within the margin of error let me put it that way the differences are so small that you can no longer affirm your power unilaterally over the other blocks radically new and very dangerous world where everyone is as technologically advanced as everyone else and power is divided we really haven't had anything so potentially coercive is this so you have reasons to be concerned obviously uh your second question uh no we we couldn't we if we wanted to have a full analysis of the situation today we would have to add a number of other actors certainly russia certainly india japan we would have also to be interested in turkey and what's happening in turkey also the development of a autonomous sovereign self-confident civilizational space in turkey as well so it's even worse than we've described it so far because it's more complex and the pieces are actually more numerous and change is happening uh in in all these regions as we talk on top of everything else as if this is not enough what i've described so far we now seem to have another actor which has joined the stage because so far we're talking about a system of states or civilizations in competition but with the pandemic when i think about what the pandemic brought that is new you have a new actor and that's you know we can call it the environment um dangerous environment an aggressive dangerous environment and it's not going to go away uh we didn't we weren't particularly aware of it when international relations scholars talked about world politics they talked about a system of states and the threat came from other states i think what the pandemic brings that is new is that the threat actually came from the external natural environment and this condition is not going to go away because after the pandemic we'll have other pandemics and then we're going to have climate change which will reproduce that model very precisely as well so it's a new world completely new and extraordinarily chaotic compared to what they had before so we have a genuine system of states rather than having an organized hierarchical hegemonic west and on top of the system of states we have a threatening dangerous external environment so bruno um this this new challenger that has entered the entered the game right with the the external environment as you mentioned um it presents challenges to the nation states which many see are sort of cracking at the scenes already but also a new hero has kind of entered the game at least we think so and your article seemed to indicate that this could be a possibility too when you talked about the crypto state let's turn our attention to talking about maybe what we might call the the crypto civilization is it is it too early to talk about what the successor to the nation state might look like and could that successor be something digital something like a decentralized nation like a bitcoin or ethereum what's your take well my thoughts on this are very tentative and i have lots of questions for you guys um so but but let let me um let me throw some thoughts on the table uh so first of all uh what i was interested in my piece was my recent piece on crypto was well we look at all these powerful blocks uh operating in a dangerous external environment are we still missing something it's already a very complex picture where are we still missing something and it seems to me that if we are really in the middle of radical historical transformation then we shouldn't assume that the most powerful state in the world the united states is going to be replaced by a state that is organized in fundamentally the same way a modern state with a bureaucracy with an army with a president with a political authority and so on right the principles activating the chinese state might be very different but it's still a state like the united states isn't there a chance actually if we are in the middle of such important transformation and also technological transformation that both china and the u.s will be superseded by a radically new kind of state and we've seen that in the past in history certainly a tribe was completely different from the state that we have today bureaucracy is not something that always existed and other structures of the modern state are fundamentally different so is it possible that we are on the cusp of actually more radical innovation when it comes to estate structures uh and it seemed to me that crypto is clearly where this can at least be discussed and theorized even if your final conclusion is that it's premature or that it's not gonna work but it can be theorized um i remember something that uh peter thiel told me uh once that really bitcoin is the only can quite remember his exact words but you know um if you believe in the sort of great man and great women theory of history where completely uh new unpredictable uh innovation is introduced into human history over my lifetime i think probably you'd have to say bitcoin i don't quite see anything else everything else is development is evolution but bitcoin comes out of nowhere just a paper nine page paper that is thrown into a message board like many other message boards uh and just a few years later uh look at at what has happened and look at the enormous amounts of wealth there are traded every day look at the value of bitcoin you know that if i i bought some bitcoins in 2011 if i have kept all of them i i don't even like to think about that um now uh how did this happen right this is kind of has to be thought about and i'm puzzled that's so much talk about bitcoin but there hasn't been the kind of um really ambitious uh attempt to place it in in a larger context something really important is happening and we don't quite know what it is now what i think is interesting about about crypto in bitcoin is it's not just about the technology right because there's usually some attempt to think about some of these changes as being about digital you know we facebook just makes things that happen in the real world digital but if that's true of facebook it may well be true of facebook just was you know life was digitized it's certainly true of let us say you know books have been digitized i don't quite see a radical change there it's just a book happens to be in digital form but bitcoin is not that in bitcoin there's an idea and then actually the digital technology is the way to make the idea work it's not the other way around and that's i think what explains the radical innovation something completely new entered the world and it doesn't happen all the time it's extremely rare from the point of view of previous history and the idea when it comes to crypto is i think that different ways to think about certainly that you can eliminate trust uh from social activities um but also in my piece i'm interested in this i couldn't quite develop it there um that uh in fact it's a pure a pure record of of of history of time because what bitcoin does is to replace the human authority we're just a perfect record of events and the record of events is the authority so rather than having someone tell you yes he is x is married to y you actually have a completely inviable record of events and everyone can go and check that x is married to y and you don't need uh someone to to tell you that so when sort of direct access to social activity and social reality without any intermediary anyway any way you think about bitcoin the the change is is quite radical uh and the possibilities it opens are enormous now i have many questions about how this is gonna work and let me put two questions on the table and then and maybe you guys can discuss them as well first of all you know i've been curious since the beginning since i started thinking about bitcoin about the idea of um well it it just seems that we have a certain problem here in the sense that if bitcoin is is replaced uh by something else uh then um this sort of perfect uh universally accepted record disappears if you have another cryptocurrency or another crypto technology and that's obviously uh ever-present threats isn't it the case that bitcoin has to remain the the only one because otherwise it loses its um image capability that's my first question for you guys and how how do you solve that and why has bitcoin survived and not been replaced by actually better technology because my understanding is that bitcoin from that point of view is actually rather primitive and even ethereum has still to some extent stayed within the framework of bitcoin would you say that uh and if it didn't at all wouldn't that be a problem okay first question that you guys can help me think about and then the second question is the political question um so i think i just got here a newsletter by then held this guy probably know very well and uh you know he's making an argument that is very common these days that there's no way existing states can get rid of crypto uh i think ray dalio said the other day just last week so the question is is very hot right now that they would try uh and you know in this case i find the arguments coming from the crypto space rather naive for someone like me who thinks about politics and has also political experience and things about political philosophy all the time it seems to me that if states want to get rid of it that potentially they could because they have the monopoly of physical violence and in the end that's what determines things so you have to address this question if you want crypto to survive we're certainly reaching the point where states are getting nervous uh and where china in particular uh might be tempted um by by the possibility of just getting rid of the whole thing altogether at least within its borders and other states are getting nervous as well so i see emerging the possibility of a real clash between crypto and existing states and this is something that has happened in the past if we go back to my framework tribes modern state and so on there's been a clash between the new form of state that was emerging in the old form usually the way it worked is actually that it was more the effect of butterfly and chrysalis that the new state would emerge from within the old state there was more like a metamorphosis of the old state you know what i mean rather than a clash on the battlefield and it seems to me a much more plausible model that i would recommend to to crypto people to think about how the united states let's say could transform into a crypto butterfly from within rather than you know as balaji with you know balaji then talk to him quite a bit about these things he has a kind of a model where where crypto state would emerge somewhere in some geography um i i see it more as emerging from within an existing state and the best candidate would be would be the u.s right yes yeah and i i think i have an answer that touches on both of those things and the the answer that i have for the first question and the question is does crypto have to remain under like one monolithic blockchain right now that's bitcoin and of course the answer depends on well are we judging a blockchain by its market cap and people in the crypto world tend to do that so i think we will do that here on the podcast then the other question is um can states get rid of crypto can they ignore it can they remove it from the relevant seed for their citizenry and the answer i think to both of these questions lies in the fact that you know crypto systems and ryan and i on the bankless podcast call these nations bitcoin there's a bitcoin nation there's an ethereum nation um these are inherently opt-in nations which makes them extremely unique when you are born in america you are an american citizen before you as a baby have the ability to comprehend what that even means it's not an opt-in system you ha if you want to not if you want to become not an american you have to opt out but these crypto nations these digital nations are inherently legitimized by the bottom-up acceptance of people from the world who make them real right bitcoin is just a technology but there is a massive community amount around bitcoin that makes bitcoin btc the assets valuable and that's going to be the same thing for all cryptocurrencies and so i don't and so that i think that answers a little bit of both is is there's no way for uh for a nation to stop a system from people volunteering their energies into the system right like these are in the same way that no one has really been able to stop the internet or to stop torrenting on the internet it's too it's trivially easy to volunteer some sort of your personal energies into bootstrapping the legitimacy of these nations and so to that reason there doesn't really need to be just one cryptocurrency it's but it is it is a liquidity begets liquidity effect where the more people volunteering their their energies into one um they're opting into one crypto nation that makes that crypto nation more legitimate and that can be get more and more legitimacy and all of a sudden we have a stronger and stronger nation um but uh i mean me and ryan on the bankless podcast i think we extend our perceptions of legitimacy to both bitcoin and ethereum as legitimate nations um and and combating that when it is a bottom-up revolution from the nation-state i think is extremely difficult let me put the let's stay with the first question let me put it this way um if you think about uh about crypto as pure technology then you could have a phenomenon where people move towards um new technologies and new offers um why can't bitcoin be compared to netscape where suddenly the model just collapses and people move to something else but if they move to something else then obviously the instability becomes a problem and this takes us back to the role of political power which in traditional states um stability of currency is provided by political power that a state can say well this is going to be the currency you have to accept it and if everything else cannot be accepted to pay taxes for example and that provides a certain stability to the currency without which um a system might not work um so that's uh yeah and that you know takes us to the second question which is kind of similar again the role of political power you know if it comes to if it comes to a clash between crypto and the state the state has political power and crypto doesn't let me kind of build off of what david is saying bruno and and get the good kind of your questions right so like on the question of does there only have to be one i think david's spot on about sort of the ability of individual sovereign individuals to kind of opt into these systems that makes them special and we do have of course multiple nation states with different um value systems and different strategies almost as we were describing when we were talking about like the difference between europe and america and china and it's kind of well you know the the best strategy will win independent of whether you uh ascribe to the value system or not it's sort of a darwinistic you know some uh societies and some civilizations will last and others won't i think the same sort of effect goes on with multiple crypto nations you might have the the bitcoin nation you might have the uh ethereum nation and both have different strengths and weaknesses just as we have multiple currencies for these nation states we have ether and we have we have bitcoin and just as we have multiple store values even that that humanity has valued across the ages you know for at one point in time we had more of a silver standard and then we move to uh to a gold standard so i do think that these things will remain uh fluid and dynamic and um every chain has a certain strategy but i think your your gut reaction to all of this and your framing of this is um is the right framing which is these are not technologies these are political movements the the political movement of bitcoin is is kind of an austrian uh fixed supply sort of 21 million only kind of movement i would say the political movement of ethereum is a bit more of the bankless movement almost that we want to do more without centralized intermediaries whether that's a central bank uh or whether that's uh you know wells fargo or bank of america for instance um that's what we're really doing in kind of our our community our corner of the world is we're using these decentralized finance protocols and actually living off of them like so we're we're migrating our money from our bank accounts and we're living on crypto native assets like ether and stable coins like dye and we are no longer keeping our wealth in the existing system and we can do all of that without the um without the cost of nation state infrastructure like a military like a government system so that is the piece that is really revolutionary from a nation-state perspective um to to the second point about nation states getting rid of crypto i think that is an interesting question and something that like we started in the crypto community sort of called the final boss right when is the final boss going to peak its head up and you know do something or like you can think of lord of the rings the eye of sauron just sort of turns on on crypto these are analogies we use i like raul paul's answer so we had raul paul on the podcast uh recently and he he just thinks it's sort of a it's a game theory thing between nation states so it's it's basically like if you which all nation states are right now are um printing money like there's like there's no tomorrow modern monetary theory is kind of the physique guys for sure um well if you're a nation state that sort of defects from that strategy and starts to acquire harder assets like maybe maybe a bitcoin even if another nation state decides to outlaw it uh then the nation state that does not outlaw is going to accrue some advantage versus the nation state that that does outlaw right it's it's almost like uh if you are an authoritarian state and you ban communication protocols like the internet well your society suffers and your progress suffers and you can't afford to do that for long so it it seems more likely that there might be some kind of a metamorphosis where the nation states realize that after banning if if some other nation uh particularly in the multilateral world that you're describing does not ban then they will accrue a significant advantage therefore they can no longer ban it but they may try to accommodate it they may try to um take crypto networks and start using them and that's actually maybe closer to what the the uh future might bring is sort of a merging together we even see like central bank digital currencies we're seeing that in in china they've got their own approach but maybe the us maybe the more liberal democratic approach is to issue a central bank digital currency on something like ethereum something that is open source and available uh you know to the world and is on completely uh non-sovereign neutral uh technology stack versus a china that kind of controls all of the transaction knows exactly and can like freeze them at a whim so those are those are i guess some ideas uh i'm not sure if any of those resonate or what's your what's your feedback i i i can't help thinking that this is not the whole story uh and i can't help thinking that bitcoin nation and ethereum nation and the crypto space as a whole is gonna need a lot more political savvy to navigate the next few years and decades uh that's kind of what i worry on one hand i worry on the other hand i think it's gonna happen uh because i think you have uh the question of political power which is gonna become central very quickly uh on the one hand uh you know i don't really buy the idea of stable coins i think they are not they are not cryptocurrencies at all it's just like digital currencies or digital tokens it's not the same thing that we're talking about here but you do need an element of stability so i still can't quite understand or accept and maybe this is a naive question why a fork within bitcoin is a mortal threat but a fork between bitcoin and the new cryptocurrency x is something that the system can deal with very well because after all you have the record of of social activity you have assets that people have worked towards and if suddenly there's a stampede out of bitcoin towards something else for whatever reason you know financial markets are like this we know i think you need some kind of stability to the system which i don't think is going to be uh provided by collateralization uh or or sort of real-world assets i think it has to be provided by the very political character of the network so in the end crypto has to be embedded in a political system that taxes are going to be paid through crypto and that's what provides stability to fiat and it will be the necessary element to provide stability to to crypto but once it gets to that point you have this real battle of giants between crypto and existing states they're already getting very nervous and they'll get more and more nervous and at that point you're going to need some kind of communication between the two spaces which is going to be difficult it's going to require a lot of diplomatic news that in the past before as well uh and i do think that states uh have the ability to root out the whole thing uh i don't quite buy this idea that uh you know because the market uh where they are competing and they and cryptocurrencies exist and if one state moves against it others are going to benefit that market can be just sort of uh completely destroyed by by a powerful nation-state and so it doesn't matter anymore and people can be put in jail and and their you know their real world assets can be confiscated this idea that you'll be totally anonymous and you'll be transactioning uh cryptocurrencies and living in a part of the world where the state doesn't know where you are uh i don't think this is a plausible model for most people there may be some you know talking about from cypherpunk to cyberpunk you're going to be uh living anonymously in some neck of the woods and in the developing world doesn't work for everyone and second uh i think you know in the end they're vulnerable points and choke points that states can just appropriate and haven't we've seen that with china in the last five six years you know exchange uh or even you know just talk about energy we talk about actually the the the processors that you use for mining and so on there's so many choke points that a state could just uh seize yeah yeah absolutely and and that's that's partly the bankless thesis as to why we are so interested in ethereum is because uh making turning things into protocols as a way to reduce a choke point or reduce the total number of drug points however that will never ever change the fact that you know people are the globe is not on crypto now as infrastructure and in the future we hope them to be on crypto and at some point they will have to transcend from one system to another and that will require going through a choke point and that's kind of why we wanted to get you on to talk about your perceived dispositions of these different arenas of the world because the dispositions of china of a europe of america will help define what those choke points look like like you described europe as like this you know this uh region of the world that is really into automation and perhaps outsourcing the management of things to algorithms or protocols or just a rules-based society and to me that actually resonates really well with using ethereum as public infrastructure like what is ethereum other than a massive interoperable property rights management system that you could tap into as little or as much as you wanted and then there's also the issue of america which america is in this post-truth fantasy land but but also in a world where crypto is offering one canonical version of reality like there's only one bitcoin and there's only one version of the truth that bitcoin offers and same thing with ethereum ethereum is a truth machine if it is if it isn't state on ethereum then it doesn't exist and maybe that's exactly what america needs right now and so there's different dispositions to what these choke points will look like and if you tell if you tell me that there's going to be a spectrum between a nation state completely locking down and going full banning on on crypto and just doing everything to to diminish it and on the other end of the spectrum there's the nation states that are going to be crypto powered or running on crypto running on ethereum i think we're going to see it all i think we're going to see the entire spectrum of how people integrate with crypto you know how nation states leverage this technology but i think the point that ryan was making and what raul raul was talking about on this podcast is as soon as any nation integrates crypto just a little bit that opens the door and it doesn't matter if one side of the world completely goes on an outright ban because you know the the rest of the world only needs to legitimize it a little bit and then a little bit more and then a little bit more and it's just kind of a death by a thousand cuts and we're seeing that today with btc bitcoin the asset being integrated on into the balance sheets of so many american companies and so it's going to be harder and harder for the american nation state to quote unquote ban bitcoin when an increasingly large part of its corporate treasuries is accepting it and have political influence in how the americans and how the american governments treat it yeah i'll just add one thing to what david was saying and then i'd love your response on on uh these thoughts bruno but it's just also this we've described probably a uh a nation like a world of rivals rivalrous nation states right now so like uh you know bitcoin or uh excuse me in china and the us neither are dominant and then there's europe in the picture and of course other countries that we didn't mention which credibly neutral infrastructure do they communicate on right now payments are swift and that is completely u.s controlled right now the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and that is also completely uh u.s controlled so what is the neutral money system that all of these um rivalrous nation states can trust well it's not one that one or the other nation state controls it has to be something that none of them control and can't control has to be something more like tcp the internet for communication it can't have a political bent it has to be credibly neutral and uh that could be another reason that something like an ethereum and uh and a bitcoin take hold right no i i love that idea i think it's a very promising one um vitalik the other day on twitter asked why it is the case that crypto seems to travel so well across um civilizational spaces uh by the way when you asked me to come here on on bank list i thought that was one of the reasons you're interested in this idea of civilizational space is because clearly there's something about about crypto that that seems to operate outside and there's very few things if any that can do that these days so the world really is breaking apart into um spaces that don't communicate uh and so for example if you compare let's say crypto to the united nations system uh uh that's one way to think about crypto the structure that stands above all these rival spaces and is neutral between them and clearly the united nations has failed in that mission i think we can say that very confidently and so we need something else um so that's um that that's promising i mean that would also i think uh be one indication that crypto is emerging as a new kind of state um but for the time being there's kind of an interregnum where crypto could be used by every state also as a form to communicate between them but it would already be the case that crypto occupying these spaces in between these blocks would be preparing the way to replace them fundamentally um because it's the structure that uh that stands above all of them i think that's true i mean crypto is a technology of social a social glue that's why every state is very interested in it because in the end and i think particularly vitalik has written a lot about this in the end traditional states they've done depending on them but the ones that have succeeded have done a relatively good job at providing social the social infrastructure for common life as providing a form of social glue but none of them has done an extraordinary work and continues to be a difficult a difficult job for them to do continues to be difficult to provide trust at sufficient levels continues to be a very scarce commodity and so in a way they're all all looking for something that can that can provide a cheap source of of social cohesion they're all interested in crypto because of that now the question is so far they don't seem aware that in the end crypto could become a threat to their own existence if it does provide a better form of social connection than the forms they have provided you know they've provided they've used religion for that they've used nationalism for that they've used education but in the end crypto seems a purer technology of social connection than any of those makeshift solutions maybe the the um enduring state of this will be less a total replacement of crypto um like with a replacement of the nation state with crypto but more an unbundling of some of the offerings or features of the nation state and kind of an outsourcing of those things to crypto you know maybe non-sovereign money might be part of that outsourcing property uh property maybe a international payment system might be part of that it's no longer a u.s swift type system might be aspects of of property rights or like you know capital pool registration or even global finance that might be the steady-state relationship because there are absolutely things that crypto cannot handle politically it's it's um at its core it doesn't have humans it is like like you can't code everything it's not going to come into your community and take care of the elderly it's not going to vote it's not going to put in roads and schools and that sort of thing um but but that could be the steady state do you see a world where that kind of exists right but this is i think where where a political philosopher would think about things slightly differently because you know we've seen that before with the emergence of the modern state 15th 16th century you still had many of the structures you have the papacy above it you had the holy roman empire above them and below you had lots of structures provinces which were semi-sovereign municipalities you had a nobility you know a count or a duke would be nominally in charge of a certain parcel of the nation state but at some point which is difficult to date precisely the nation-state becomes the seat of sovereign power of ultimate power and all the other structures can provide lots of public goods and they can still even to the outside observer look like real political units but they have been sapped of the real source of power the ultimate source of power and i think you could you know what you're describing i would tend to interpret differently at some point 20 years from now 50 years from now 100 years from now you know states might still be around but the real source of power is going to be in the crypto system in the sense that uh that's where people turn to uh to resolve their differences and if there's a conflict that's where the conflict is resolved ultimately it could be because essentially the activity of the courts has been uh subsumed into the crypto system with smart contracts it could be because taxes are now ultimately in control of the of the crypto system even if some functions may be delegated to treasury authorities and so on but you know the political philosophy in me tends to think that there's always only one state of final political authority and at some point one could imagine a transition this is so fascinating bruno this has been a wonderful discussion you've brought kind of the political philosophy lens on crypto and i think taught us a lot and i think bankless bankless community is really going to resonate with this this podcast so thanks for thanks for joining us and my only hope is maybe one of your future books will be about the uh the crypto civilization the crypto nation state it seems like a worthy successor to your um to your fantastic books on these other nation state civilizations well i'm certainly thinking about it and and discussing it with agents and publishers so it could it could happen it's been a great pleasure i've been a fan of the podcast and of you guys on twitter for a long time and i was really happy when i saw the invitation i really enjoyed this hour and a half which flew so quickly the best conversations always do bruno thanks so much for your time bankless listeners we've got some action items for you of course first we will include a link to check out some of bruno's books including history has begun book the birth of new america if you are interested in more on that subject also i have recently subscribed bruno to your fantastic sub stack of course bankless has a sub stack but bruno's sub stack uh the world games sub stack where he posts uh his thoughts and it comes out a few times a week it's just you know fantastic way to keep up with geopolitical events as well and get into brno's political philosophy mind here that's the second action item and then third of course guys if you want to see bankless rise up the charts if you want to get the message in the minds and hearts of more folks give us a five-star review on the itunes podcast david we're getting pretty close to what 200 or so i haven't looked at it in a little bit but we're just just shy of 150 which means the bankless nation has some work to do our trajectory has slowed down while the crypto world has been heating up so we need your five star reviews to make sure that we can get the bankless gospel and build out the bankless nation into the ears of so many more people listens are going up and we need if you are a listener for you to hit that five star review so we go up on the itunes charts too lastly guys risks and disclaimers of course none of this was financial advice eth is risky so is defined crypto as we always talk about you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks so much for joining us [Music] you
