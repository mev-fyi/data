my mind has been invaded by this concept called evm equivalence and the idea here is that optimism has been working towards making not an evm compatible layer two which is what people are used to but an evm equivalent layer two the nuance behind that is that the values and the actual ethereum layer 1 starts to bleed into the layer 2 itself the difference between the layer 1 and the layer 2 starts to blur the point is is that the optimism layer 2 because it's evm equivalent whenever some public goods funding thing works because of the equivalence it is so easily transferable it can go back to the layer one it can go up to other layer twos and so this these public goods that optimism are generating via retroactive public goods funding and the things that these new silicon valley of the web 3 world build on optimism they get immediately and freely transferable to the rest of the ecosystem that is something i think is just so beautiful and again how i think that we go from where we are now where we're going to be dominated by climate change and war to a star trek future
