I love this story and it'll illustrate what cryptoys is really well and why I think it's so cool yeah sure happy to do it so a bit of a serial entrepreneur um my last company before I started this one was called live ninja basically a video chat Marketplace and you know we raised some venture capital I ended up selling that company in 2017 to IDT Telecom and had to earn out with IDT and you know this was around 2017 going into 2018 and you know it's just always been into Tech and early adoption of things and you know I'm a I'm a big Fred Wilson fan uh Union Square adventures and you know subscribe to his blog post I remember one one day he published a blog post talking about this new company that's investing in called Axiom Zen they're kind of renaming to Dapper labs and they got this thing called cryptokitties and it looks like kind of a gimmick but it's not trust me nfts are going to be a really big thing and usually when Fred Wilson talks you tend to listen so I took note of it I actually bought a few cryptokitties uh around that time uh just kind of playing around with nfts and what they meant and at that same time my daughter was really into this thing uh called Blind Bags or surprise unboxing basically the hottest Trend that physical toys I have three kids my two oldest currently nine years old my daughter and eight years old my oldest son Kevin so a few years back you know they were just addicted to this concept called bags so basically what they are these physical toys you buy them for like 20 30 bucks at like Walmart Target kids buy them they take them home inside is a random toy and some are more rare than others kind of reminds us of something of anything yeah so so basically you know one day I'm working from home this was like early 2018. my daughter screams from the playroom with excitement and she's like Dad come quick come quick oh my God I got it I got the ultra rare finally got the ultra rare and I go to see what she's doing and she's holding up this little glittery gold plastic toy and she looks at it for like 10 seconds and then throws it in the bin with all the other ones just collecting dust because we were spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on these things because again this was the hottest Trend in physical toys and my kids were absolutely addicted to them so uh you know as soon as she said the word ultra rare that was the big light bulb moment for me because a few months back I was learning about this concept about nfts and hearing about cryptokitties and whatnot and I thought to myself I said oh my goodness here is this multi-billion dollar segment of the toy industry that's predicated on collectibility and scarcity we can now do these digitally for the first time ever thanks to nfts so I go to my daughter and I said sweetheart what if I were to make you the digital version of these toys that you like collecting so much where you can collect them chase after the rare ones like you're doing now but then when you get them you can actually do things with them play games with them interact with them do different things would that be something you'd be interested in and she's like oh my god dad that'd be amazing I'd love that so I thought to myself I'm like all right let me build this little side project with my daughters it was early 2018 when nfts were just kind of like kind of starting to emerge a little bit and I thought to myself okay this could be like a little father-daughter kind of bonding experience teaching her about tech and Entrepreneurship and I can make this fun little toy for her so we got together my old co-founders at live ninja we banded back together and then our friend Freddy joined Freddie had experience in Disney and Konami games before doing some other stuff in the gaming world and we created this little side project for our kids called crypt toys uh and this was again 2018 so nobody really you know Knew Too Much about nfts at the time so I remember going around and showing people early concepts of it and they were like you know hey Will what are you doing you just sold your previous company what are you doing next and I'm like uh not sure exactly what I'm doing next but let me show you this digital Panda that I'm working on and they're like uh-huh I'm like it lives on the blockchain and they're like uh-huh sure it does it's like one of those moments where like these digital pandas are they in the room with us now kind of thing and uh so we just did the little side project for our kids 2018 to 2020 nobody really cared and then obviously the the market started to turn and there was some real interest in the project and off into the races we went early days and maybe it sounds like almost early days being these first two years is it was it literally just like you partnered with an artist to draw some some cute bears or like talk about what you really built out as a product in those early days yeah so I remember we were really inspired by cryptokitty so like you know first of all it was just me Emilio and Alfonso the three of us and neither of us or all three of us frankly are not artists so we needed someone to help us so we went on Fiverr and uh we hired a freelance artist to help us make these these two-dimensional characters basically little cartoons different they were like crypto kitties they look like but just different animals and different variants of them and we did it for like a few months and then Emilio my CTO and co-founder came to me and he said hey will you know this project of yours is cool and all but if you really want to blow this thing out of the water I got a buddy of mine that I used to work with at Disney he's now at Konami he's doing a bunch of video game 3D artist stuff like we should really bring him onto the team so that's when we met Freddy and he took the idea from a catootie concept to fully 3D and again in 2018 there was no real like 3D interactive nfts that was really like one of the first of its kind so um it was kind of a novel concept back then and that's when we really got started with the project and and maybe you said this or maybe it's obvious given where the inspiration came from but at that point did you have this whole unboxing reveal experience that was very much designed to be like the unboxing experience that your daughter was having with these LOL surprise dolls yeah yeah so that was like the goal from the get-go was to make it as toyetic as possible as possible it's a concept you'll hear me talk about a lot is things being toyetic even though they're in the digital space they have to be as analogous to the physical world as possible because there's a lot of joy in opening up a toy and playing with toy and using your imagination and lots of different things that we could definitely translate to the digital world but we wanted to stay true to that physical experience as well harking back to like the Golden Era of of toys so the unboxing experience is such a key component in the physical uh experience we wanted to have a great unboxing experience in digital as well and as we see with nfts that unveiling moment the reveal moment is always a big thing as well so it's a good kind of connection between what's popular in the physical world and the digital so I want to ask you about that because I think talking to you I've had sort of two interesting arguably unlocks that I want to get into but I first just want to emphasize for folks like you know you I don't have kids I'm sure a number of people who listen to my podcast don't have kids so I really was not tracking this like lol surprise dolls blind box concept at all but my understanding now having gone back to dig into it a little bit is it really started with LOL surprise dolls um it was like the the first and it wasn't the towel I'm trying to remember the name of the the MGA it was MGA toy manufacturers whatever that initially came up with this concept and and everybody turned them down like initially I think Walmart turned them down or Target turned them down being like no kids gonna want to buy a doll they can't see but it was really inspired by the uh Isaac Isaac something or other um you know president seeing the unboxing phenomenons happening on YouTube where these kids would get toys or iPhones or whatever and they would do this unboxing thing so he really began with sort of the end in mind of like we want this to go be like a viral YouTube toy and then you know boy boy did he succeed and at one point at the end of The New York Times was profiling this and it was like you know they did like five billion dollars on LOL surprise dolls in whatever it was 99 2020 are they still as big today or was this a bit of a fad that had a peak and is Flaming out at all well I think they were early mover and the latest wave I remember like surprise unboxings has been a thing for a long time like you know there's Kinder Eggs decades ago there were Cracker Jack boxes where you'd find a toy inside Happy Meal toys in some ways is a similar concept right but like what you pointed out you hit the nail right on the head right like they really got a hold of the whole YouTube unboxing Trend and they made the ultimate unboxing toy that people would want to film and then share and and whatnot right so uh I know they were the hottest selling uh hottest selling toy for a few years in a row and I think lately some other stuff has kind of caught up to it but uh nonetheless they they kind of set a big Trend and a lot of other you know people kind of followed suit and made similar stuff so something we might Circle back to which is how you think about longevity in this space that like moves so incredibly quickly but we'll save that for for end and future planning conversations so here were the two unlocks that I felt like are things that kind of clicked for me when you and I first spoke which is the first is targeting kids and ins like when we talk about the analogs to the nft industry we talk about like comic books we talk about we look at Transformers which started as a collectible toy and grew into a whole media franchise and this concept of selling from the Shelf which I think was a kind of big in the 80s where you would sell these toys first and then build these franchises around it something Mattel is now diving into in a big way we'll probably get into that because you've got a partnership with Mattel and it strikes me that even Star Wars like a lot of this stuff actually starts as something that is loved by children and then as they become adults they get nostalgic or obviously you know adults love Star Wars and things but it's actually a kid's first thing and it feels like not many nft projects if any have really started with kids in mind and so while on the one hand what you're fundamentally doing is releasing cute animals on the blockchain which we've now seen thousands of of projects do having this very unique angle and very specific targeted approach to it it it I'm like oh my gosh what a light bulb and and why I think it's really exciting what you're doing do you agree is this something that's like under tapped do you think in the nft community where people and projects aren't really thinking about kids first yeah well I think what's interesting about what we're doing and you know again we're building a digital toy company so obviously you know kids are a big part of our road map but we're really focusing is like family entertainment like across the entire family where it's something that parents and kids can enjoy together in unison right so you know I think that's an important piece to to recognize is how do you kind of cross the chasm if you're doing stuff that is related to blockchain nfts crypto and involve kids in the right way in a compliant way and all these different things that you have to consider how do you do it correctly now what I like to think about is is how does collection starts how do people become collectors what does nostalgia look like and how do you bond cross-generationally with with you know your family and other folks so like for example let's use uh basketball cards and and football cards as an example right when I was a kid you know my dad was really into collecting baseball cards so I would walk by his office when I was eight years old and I saw that he had a bunch of baseball cards all like laid out on this table and he said Hey will come check this out and then he showed me what were the rare ones or the rookie ones how to collect them how to you know care for them Etc and I enjoyed that so much that I got involved with collecting baseball cards and to this day I still collect cards I mean actually I have you know if you have some football cards here on my desk and things like that because of the Nostalgia that it reminds me of you know back when I was a child now the same thing's happening now with nfts it just was never built that way so for example parents you know in this last wave right we bought Cool Cats we bought all we bought Doodles we bought all these different ones and parents are starting to bring their kids to the screen and say hey check out this cool cat check out this doodle do you like this one okay this one's ours we're collecting it together and kids are starting to get involved and this comes very naturally to kids because kids are growing up and you know big before they get a phone they get iPads and they're playing games and they're collecting digital items so to them this makes a lot of sense okay here's a rare digital item I can collect them just like I'm collecting them in Roblox or I'm playing an Animal Jam or whatever the case may be so for us yes we we always wanted to make sure we created something really incredible for kids and what the next generation of toys and the next generation of play would look like but we had to do that starting with the parents introducing it to the parents right through you know safeguards about how to use Safeguard a wallet how do you introduce blockchain and nfts to a kid having a parent controlled wallet making sure that they can transfer uh in in the correct way and and whatnot so it was always a big part of what we're doing but I would say we focus more so on building around the entire family as collectors together versus just marketing directly towards kids with that being said this unboxing experience does kind of mirror again what what kids in particular were gravitating towards with these like lol surprise boxes and this was the second unlock to me um potentially and and which is and the question again is do you think this is something that's being underutilized by other projects where mint day is cool or reveal day is cool but nobody's really tried to tap into at least as far as I know people on Twitter can come yell at me and tell me no what about this project but like again the kind of YouTube unboxing like this really like you know kind of climactic moment of your reveal that's like super streamable and everybody wants to watch and you're trying to tap into that which I think is really interesting again do you think that's undertapped in the space broadly today I think so absolutely I think right now we're we're in the early Innings right I think if we look back on this like 10 years from now we look at like the pfp era and like that's kind of like inning one everybody was looking for pfps and kind of static images and whatnot and obviously we're going to see different use cases emerge um I think Top Shot to an extent had a little bit of that early on when the people were on on boxing packs and sharing them on YouTube and whatnot and then if you were queued up waiting for a drop they would do fun activations like there was definitely a lot of interesting creativity there yeah and Dapper Labs like I have a lot of respect for adapter Labs obviously you know they're investors in in our company and we're building on the flow blockchain which we can get into a little bit later right but like you know they're real Pioneers in the sense and you hit this on one of your episodes recently in the car early was like this only becomes mainstream when we stop thinking of it first and foremost as an investment right that's the only way this ever hits the mainstream because right now it's a very speculative thing you're you're hoping to buy you're hoping to flip it we've seen that with a lot of Ip drops that you know have happened on different platforms right kind of the floors kind of sink once you you know take them out of the quote-unquote packaging you see what you get and then you try to to sell them on the secondary Market because there's no utility but that's what we're really focusing on is yes that moment is great because again it it gives you a a taste of what it's like in the physical world when you get a toy you open it up you don't know what you're going to get inside you're doing that digitally but then creating enjoyment and utility and entertainment and all the phases beyond that unboxing and the things you can do with it I think is really really critical so we're really focused on those like moments of surprise those moments of joy and like constantly making sure that you get that when you have a cryptoy when you're able to interact with your crypto and things like that it's not just about that initial get and then flip we really have like two big moments in the nft spaces when we get it when we flip it and there's so much more in between that that we have to kind of build so really make this a mainstream thing that people are are starting to accept more as as things Beyond just a speculative investment so interesting way that I want to ask you about so the unboxing experience for cryptoys as far as I understand it is they start off as these like Rubik's Cube looking yep toys and then you can open the box and in the Box itself is what looks like a package like a you know like it's like sort of a plastic packaging you would get for some toy in the physical world and you can make a decision at that point so at that point you can see your cryptoy you can see some of its traits and you can make the decision to keep it in that packaging or open it further and turn it into its 3D character that will have sort of a an additional life and game life that we'll we'll get into did I describe that experience correctly yeah absolutely so we have these things called cryptos cubes basically you got a cryptoscube you don't know what you're gonna get inside you buy them you can buy them with US dollars so take credit cards so it's easy to onboard folks you don't need a metamask wallet or or crypto or whatnot you get them and then right then it's kind of boxed then you can it's an interactive unboxing experience where you're kind of rotating it there's like clicks and Clacks and even though it's digital it feels very tactile uh and then once you open it it's then revealed a wrapped kind of like a blister pack hanger box like you would see like old school toy is uh they used to get back in the 90s it's in this blister pack and that's when it's wrapped so basically you can keep them wrapped and keep them in pristine condition in the physical packaging and there's benefits to keeping it in the in the packaging like staking style benefits that we'll be announcing soon another kind of gameplay components and then you can decide do I keep it in there or do I tap on it again and if you tap on it again the whole packaging will burn off and the cryptoy will come to life it'll jump out at you on the screen and then you can interact with it and now it's really more like almost your playable Avatar correct um so you use the word toyetic I would argue you could also say skeuomorphic you know it's it's very analog to something you'd buy in in the the world like you know the real world why did you decide to go that way as opposed to designing a totally new kind of metaverse looking unboxing experience yeah so I think it's it's interesting you know we're looking at like the patterns of of play and how you know kids are adopting it and also how adults are adopting it so like instead of thinking it also like an avatar it's kind of like an avatar in a sense but you know a lot of folks are saying this is the representation of me in in the metaverse right when you think of like what like yuga's building and like what other folks are building saying okay here is me and this is what I want to look like in the metaverse so I represent myself crypto is a little bit different cryptoys you might have 40 kryptoys in your backpack instead of calling it a wallet we call it a backpack so you might have 40 cryptoys in your backpack and you could take a number of them out and do different things with them um and the reason is like you know think about in an analog world right you can set up a playroom you can have a bunch of different toys set out different layouts and do different kind of play patterns and whatnot and if you see how things are evolving in the digital world we talk about gaming um and if you look at like the gaming industry like you know you might look at what my son does after school and he takes his iPad and he goes on Roblox and we might think of that like okay he's playing video games right but it's not the video games that you and I used to play when we were kids what he's really talking about it's not like hey it's not like a Shoot Em Up game or something like that he's really saying like hey Benji meet me in the corner and let's go build this out together or hey come check this out or follow me here it's very much like an after school activity like he's socializing in a virtual playground and these are like the play patterns that are emerging you know so it really doesn't make a difference if he's in the physical world with his friend or in the digital world they're still playing in the same kind of communication style that they're used to so for us it was like looking at those play patterns and then how do we adopt that into a very toyetic lens um taking a toy unwrapping it and then okay what can I now do with this toy like you would in the physical world giving them kind of fun things to do in the digital world as well and the cool thing about doing it digitally is you're not bounded by the laws of physics you're not bounded by like you know hey I just have this and this playset you can constantly get give them new experiences with that toy so it's interesting and then that's how we we like to think about it is to kind of go through that play pattern um and build around that specifically my impression and I'm worried I might be wrong about this is that uh it's still sort of a a crypto is still sort of in beta in terms of being able to go and mint it's not just like an active live ever green present mint at the current present am I right yeah so it's so we we actually haven't launched publicly yet we're about to start launching some private I am right okay yeah so you know um for folks that are interested definitely drop me a note we're rolling out private betas you know pretty soon actually uh shortly after this airs uh and then we're doing a bunch of like licensing Partnerships obviously you know we announced something with Mattel uh which we can get into and some of their IP that's going to drop on the platform but yeah they'll be like kind of NBA Top Shot style drops that you know will announce a drop there'll be a certain inventory for that you'll be able to get in queue and then buy your crypto cubes from there so you've been building for longer than 99 of projects in this space why didn't you launch sooner did you look at cool cats being like we've missed the we've missed the window yeah so so again from 2018 to 2020 it was very much just the passion project side project for our kids and this is a big lift of a project so we're doing like a bunch of different things that kind of one part were digital toys and collectibles company one part we're a gaming company and Another Part One Entertainment Company because we're building like original Ip story lines and an animated series actually behind behind the scenes here so this is a humongous lift and we always knew to really do this right you have to raise Capital you know the markets have to be right for it so for going from 2018 to 2020 you're just chipping a win we all had full-time jobs we all had full-time responsibilities and and kids to feed and families so again just you know from 9 00 pm to midnight making a little progress then on Saturdays and Sundays making a little progress and we were just chipping away what specifically did that look like at that there's like three of you so there's you're limited in what you can really achieve is three people you know you're not you know probably building out a full game engine at that stage like what were you practically working on for those two years yeah so it was the four of us and basically we were just working on an IOS app and inside the IOS app had this unboxing experience and you can kind of rotate it and it's fully 3D uh animated and rigged characters so again just doing 3D art and animation and conceptualizing that and then building the IOS app and then on top of that and there'll be some flavors of this that will launch as part of our roadmap but we built a an NLP natural language processing and AI component to it as well so you can converse with your cryptoy much like you would an Amazon Alexa or a Siri you were able to do that on the IOS app so we had this like little working prototype again it was you know just kind of basic we were able to unbox your cryptoy and then communicate with it almost like kind of a new wave Tamagotchi in a sense had some elements of it to that and then we're like okay the next wave is kind of building more infrastructure and gaming around these toys so you could really play with it in different ways and to do that we knew we had to raise some Venture Capital you know I again I had sold my previous company and so did Emilio and Alfonso who are my co-founders of that company we had earn outs Alfonso then left the company he went to go work for Facebook Amelia went to work for another company et cetera and timing just wasn't right again the market there was really no consumer interest in nfts from 2018 to 2020 um so it was just more of a passion project and then it was really late 2020 when we saw with NBA Top Shot things started to Bubble back up and then it was early 2021 where you know there was just a lot of momentum a lot of folks were interested in what we were building in this early concept and that's really when we were able to raise some venture capital and quit our jobs and then do this thing full-time and that's when we were Off to the Races and so you you intentionally clearly didn't hype on like you know jump on just like the pfp craze and say okay you know what we're gonna release 10 000 cryptoy looking things and get some money that way and and whatever why did you make that decision I just think pfps in general it's it's just it's it's a great use case of nfts but to me like we talked about before it's like inning one uh I think you know you want to create something and and for me you know this started off as a project for my kids and you know when I think about this like I really want to build like a generational company uh and something that you know could stand the test of time and like I don't think pfps are necessarily going to have like massive generational impact on these little ten thousand you know profile pic projects of course you can extrapolate them and create different lures and lines and whatnot but this all went back to the concept of of toys and you can ask yourself you're like all right there's this these amazing Legacy toy companies that have been around for decades so if you have the opportunity to create a toy company from scratch today and it was digital first an nft native what would that look like and it doesn't look like pfp projects where kind of everyone is a little bit different Etc it looks like a with toys you have certain lines of toys you know there are you know some that are mass produced there are some that are more limited edition Etc and it creates this kind of um environment where you can kind of customize them in different Ways by accessories get playsets Etc so we really wanted to take that model which is kind of tried and true in the physical world but then expand on what works physically uh to the digital world and go beyond that and I think it's just a better place to start and build something that's very long lasting and also Bridges the Gap from a web 3 audience to a mainstream web 2 audience versus just a kind of a pfp kind of style ten thousand you know profile pic limited projects so we wanted to go for something a little bit bigger foundationally I think this was you know to not to be a broken record here but like was part of what was so striking to me chatting with you is like if you take the individual elements of what you're doing in a vacuum they're not that dissimilar from what a you know a number of pfp projects now we're kind of saying they're trying to do right you have this kind of collectible cute you know visual thing you have gaming which we'll get into you have you know entertainment IP you're trying to build out I mean you could be describing Doodles frankly with that the difference is the intentionality from day one and the why from day one that functionally when you look at how it things get plotted out how things get built like how you build one on the other like how you do different elements actually in the details makes a huge difference and you know I almost feel like what a lot of these projects have to do is like retroactively kind of become the company that you've been since day one which is um really interesting well thank you for that that's a huge compliment and I think that's what's interesting about the space as we kind of turn into the next inning or the next chapter of these spaces is like before we started off with you know these projects that are promising utility and entertainment down the line it's like hey fund us buy the men's buy the projects we'll give you entertainment and utility down the line as part of the road map I think the next wave of projects and we're certainly hoping to be part of that that next wave is start with entertainment and utility first and foremost and then let the value of the project be a byproduct of the entertainment and the utility versus speculative value and then hoping entertainment and utility come down the line so I think we're as a space I'd like to think that we're all kind of maturing towards that and I see a lot of other projects also taking that very seriously which is I think is healthy for the space overall yep so to talk us through the timeline here and then that'll be an entryway to dive into more of the specific elements of the game world and the lore and all of that because I want to talk both macro and micro about get your thoughts on all of that um in terms of so you've got these betas that are going to roll out which will allow people to to do their first mints of of cryptoys and and I assume make that decision between do I keep it in this packaging do I you know let them free with that beta launcher you're going to have this arcade world you know you can talk about I know there's where what is the timeline what are you going to get during these betas and and how long will it be to beat this whole thing fully rolled out yeah great question so again this is a beast of a project this is a very you know cohesive and comprehensive road map and you can kind of see the roadmap if you go to crypttoys.com and check it out at the bottom of the site so the first thing again we want to get this out we want to get this in early adopters hands we want to get feedback from folks and see what they like about it what they want to see improved so we're starting with a Genesis launch there's going to be 30 000 uh Genesis Heroes that we're launching these are going to be our initial three characters which are also going to be some of the the most capable toys that you can do on the platform so there's different like skill levels and power meters and stuff like that and these will be some of the best of the best and there's 30 000 and we're launching them in waves so we're actually not launching all 30 000 at once they'll be a wave of a couple hundred they'll be a wave of like 500 a thousand Etc and we'll go throughout these different waves and release dates um and initially you'll be able to collect them you can build out your backpack Etc and then also you're able to unwrap them and take them out on what we call the block and the block is like our test drive area it's kind of like this Tron looking style grid and you can you can see exactly firsthand that these are interactive toys this is not something that's like speculative like we built an engine on top of unity and a whole kind of environment so be able to take your toy unwrap the actual toy place them on the Block and then fully interact with them and like spin them around do a bunch of different things and then by the end of the year hopefully uh you know we are working on three mini games right now that you'll be able to play with your character hopefully all thing I know things things happen but the goal internally is to launch these three mini games by the end of the year so that you could then launch off of the block you could launch these three different games and interact with your crypt toys and have different play patterns Etc and beyond that there's so much that we're working on on collectibility there's a mobile app coming there is a NLP and AI component we have two people full-time on the team that all they do is focus on NLP and Ai and the tests are absolutely unbelievable if you we do tests all the time of us talking to these cryptoys and them talking back and it's just absolutely amazing um so so much is coming through the pipe but initially it's the collectibility aspects and then walking on the Block unwrapping them and doing that kind of thing are you mirroring the LOL surprise dolls and resultant projects that came out of that in terms of price point like are these 20 to 30 bucks where where are you guys Landing so the initial price points would be 39.99 per Cube people will be able to buy five cryptoy cubes uh you know when it gets to the front of the queue and we're actually giving a reward uh for the people that buy five we're actually giving what's called a golden ticket and a golden ticket is an nft that you'll receive which basically we're doing a number of amazing drops next year in 2023 a Golden Ticket allows you basically to the front of the line Priority Access to some of these drops so every time you mint five crypto cubes you'll get a golden ticket as well so you can be able to be prioritized for some of these drops that we're doing in the future very cool what is the the marketing strategy now it strikes me that you're in this weird position you said you you're targeting families but it is a very kid-friendly thing but how much are kids really on the blockchain at this stage how are you approaching marketing for all of this great question so we're starting to start you have to be 18 or up to get on the platform right because of registrations Copa compliancy and whatnot right you're getting effectively wallets created for these accounts so there's a reason if you look at the lore of what we're building and a lot of like the story lines and some of the IPS we're working on it's very nostalgic heavy you know there's a lot of like cues from the 80s and Throwbacks to Twilight Zone and stranger things and whatnot um so initially folks have to be 18 or up to sign up you know you'll be able to create these accounts you can collect them and then we're rolling out in early 2023 parent controlled wallets so that they can create a sub account and then allow the the child to then log in with their own sub account and then use the assets in different ways maybe not transact with those assets but play with the assets in different play patterns so very much like if you're familiar with like Netflix or Disney plus you know you have the parent account which is unrestricted but then you have the child account which has like certain limitations we have to take a similar approach if you want to get uh kids on the blockchain and people under the age of 12 years old you have to be very very smart and thoughtful about it so we're going through all these different uh guidelines and and controls for parents is this the first time as far as you know that this concept has been enacted where there'll be this sort of sub-account style thing for kids I haven't seen that yet you know so like as far as web3 goes again this this is like a mainstream platform for us we're not focused on like a niche kind of Market in web 3 as much as like oh you know we're so grateful for all the folks in web3 and you know they've been such huge supporters of what we're building and you know we're counting on them to you know be early supporters of the project we wouldn't be here without them the only way this is successful and it turns into the company and the platform we want it to be is if it Bridges the Gap and it's amazing to go to Comic-Con for example which we just went with Mattel and hear about how mainstream consumers think about nfts uh we think you know all nfts are great and it's the future and whatnot but there's a conception about nfts that you like it or not the public has and we talk a lot about how we're going to onboard the next 10 million 100 million people into nfts and web3 we have to fix that perception and educate people on on what this is because a lot of people they see nfts and they think cryptocurrency they think Ico scam they think all these things of the bad headlines over the past three to four years but if you kind of just change the narrative and you'd be like look nfts all they really do is allow the internet to be ownable and digital things to be ownable and collectors and like mainstream consumers they get they can wrap their heads around that concept it's about like the the infrastructure of like all the the 2018 and the 2017 cryptocurrency uh stigma that comes with it that is presenting a lot of problems so uh for us bridging that Gap and then doing it in like a parent safe way where everything's controlled I think is really important and by the way you might think of the name crypt toys and it'd be like okay careful because there's crypto in the name we actually like leaning into the conversation and just being like hey this is crypto but in a friendly way and let's show you why crypto can actually be a good thing so remains to be seen how how much people will accept it but we're actually leaning full force into it and trying to change the narrative and the perception behind it well thank you for that uh on behalf of the industry it feels like it again comes down to this having a strong why and for the outside world why well because it's this new tech called blockchain is not a good reason to spend 69 million dollars on you know like an image or whatever but when the answer is well look at all the money your kids are spending on their fortnite skins you know and and look at how much they love their LOL doll but they don't get to show it off their classmates because it's sitting at home in the toy pile but now it's that why you're gonna find very few people from aren't like oh okay yeah that makes sense you know and and yeah yeah I think it's something old parents can relate to so for example I'll tell you a story so so we're Jewish so we celebrate Hanukkah last December and you know I asked my daughter what she wants for the eighth night of Hanukkah and the eighth night's like the big night right the first seven nights are like little like tchotchke gifts and whatnot the eighth night's the big night so like for example when I was a kid I got a bike one year got a trip to Orlando to Disney World it was like the big gift right it's the big gift so I asked my daughter I said sweetheart what do you want for your eighth not a Hanukkah gift and she goes oh my god dad I know what I want she runs to her room immediately grabs her iPad and she's asking me to authorize an in-app purchase for 99 in her favorite iPad game that was the big gift the big like once a year gift that she's gonna get is an in-app purchase for digital items in her favorite iPad game now first of all surprised by that it was second of all it would have been nice because this is not the first time I bought digital items for her on the iPad it would be nice to say okay sure happy to get you you know the the 99 pack of digital items but before we do that why don't you go ahead and sell all the other items that we've bought over the years that you don't have a chance to play with or better yet why don't you donate them to charity or to someone that can't afford them currently she's unable to do that either yeah right so you know I think when you tell parents about these Concepts immediately they get it because there's nothing stopping the parent or the kid right now from going to the kid's room and saying let's get a box of toys that you don't play with and either sell them on eBay or donate them to Goodwill or to charity they have free control over these items because they're their items and as the world gets more and more digital like it or not that's where we're heading we need to offer the same empowerment for people that are spending the same amount of money if not more in the digital world so I think parents and kids can kind of grasp that concept more they can just talk about nfts at a tech level and that gets back to the point that you made that I had made you know around like we need to get away from it being speculative where it's like the goal for that is not that she makes a bunch of money on those previous items she owned it's helping to offset the cost of it it's it's just a little extra compensation it's just offsetting the original cost of it much like selling something at a garage sale you're not recouping the original value you're offsetting the cost of of what you once spent on it for something you don't need anymore and it's it's such a no-brainer um right and it's interesting because again we don't we're not applying the same ownership uh that we do in the physical world like by default mentally than we do in in the digital world so for example like video games are a great example of this and I know there's like rights and digital rights and whatnot but let's like think about this at a high level right I can go and I can buy a copy of Halo the video game right the physical copy I can get that copy either on Amazon or go to GameStop if I buy the physical copy I could do whatever I want with it and go give it to a friend I could sell it back to GameStop I can put it on eBay you can do whatever if I buy the same copy digitally for the same amount of money 59.99 cost me 59.99 a GameStop cost me 59.99 digitally I have no rights to it whatsoever the same amount of money and to me that's fundamentally broken right if I'm paying the same amount of money for the same piece of content I should be able to give it to someone else and right now we just don't treat digital citizens like we do people in the physical world and I think the worlds are combining and frankly I don't think the next generation is going to settle for it so that's why you know I think kids are going to look at us like we were crazy my kids are going to say wait a second dad you mean to tell me that you spent 80 hours playing that game getting digital items and didn't actually own the items they gave you like before exactly you idiot exactly it's gonna be a foreign concept to them yeah well and what's exciting to me is seeing how you know what the mainstream big players are get this as well and are moving into it and Mattel being a great example why don't you tell us about the Mattel partnership how did that come together and and what is it practically speaking oh sure so you know we were introduced to Mattel by you know Mutual connection uh so we got a chance to meet with them and you know we were fortunate to meet with a lot of the the big toy companies uh early on as we you know raised some funding and we became known as like the digital toy company like crypt toys was like going all in through the angle of toys so I think we we attracted the attention of a lot of the you know the Legacy toy company so we had we chatted with all of them and it was just clear from day one that Mattel set itself apart from the rest because they were like leaning in a hundred percent into where like the the future of toys was heading the future of play and they knew that digital was going to be a big a big piece of this and I think all the other toy companies were like uh blockchain and the thing and this and oh this is gonna disrupt our business and they were worried about you know like you know how is digital gonna you know bite into the physical sales and whatnot everybody was like okay we're required to take the web 3 call because everybody's telling us we need to learn about nfts and web3 but everybody was like trepidatious about it and they were like okay let's do a small test let's do a deployment that a Mattel was like no we need to innovate and if we have to disrupt ourselves let's disrupt ourselves and like let's lean into this like clearly digital is a big piece of the future of play and we want to you know partner with the folks that really believe that as well so it was just clear from day one the energy around those conversations what they were thinking was aligned with how we were thinking and uh you know was a great partnership just as we were discussing what that would look like not only did we work on a licensing deal together but it was around the same time that we were raising our series a financing and they invested in the company as well so they're not just a licensing partner but they're also shareholders of the company so it's a it's a truly aligned partnership and and they've been fantastic supporters from day one so we're working with them we already announced it on the Masters of the Universe uh toy line which is launching you know sometime in the next couple of months here shortly after we launched our Genesis line and uh and we got a number of other stuff that were working behind the scenes that we can't announce just yet but we'll be announcing soon uh and they've been just absolutely fantastic on every phase and so that licensing deal looks like basically they've licensed the Masters of the Universe IP to you and there's a crypt toys right and and cryptoys in turn then is going to take those characters turn them into digital Collectibles and give them a similar unboxing experience Etc that we just described with the cryptoys themselves is that the the basis that's exactly right so I think you've seen like corollaries like if you've seen like Funko Pops that's exactly what I was gonna say yeah right like you kind of see that and then a lot of people think that we're a digital Funko Pop in a sense but we kind of take it a little bit beyond that we're doing gaming and entertainment and all these different play packs an original Ip which I don't know if Funko Pop does not sure exactly no we're focused a lot on the original lore and the IP of the platform a lot of people have have compared us to an nft native Nintendo in a sense where you know Nintendo started off with their own characters Mario Luigi Donkey Kong and Zelda and we have our own lore and IP as well but very similar in that sense so yeah Master the universe will be the first line and then there's all these experiences that you'll be able to take these toys you can collect them build out your collection but then you could also play with them in in different ways and some really fun stuff uh behind the scenes and you know I'm a huge fan of the episodes that you guys have done with John Rogers John's super smart guy and you know actually we connected thanks to you a few weeks back and you know a lot of the stuff that you guys talked about is how do Brands kind of get into the space in the right way right because it's very tricky we've seen a lot of drops go wrong and again I think it's directly correlated to again the precipice that you mentioned that we keep referring to is like we got to get Beyond this being a speculative investment first and foremost because fans are smart and they could they could smell a cash grab from a mile away and if this is just a speculative Flip or Etc like they'll revolt against that well you really have to lean into is like building community in an authentic way with the fans of that particular IP yeah so you know with Masters of the Universe like we're reaching out constantly on a daily basis to super fans of that line people that grew up with that that IP in the 80s like like watch Saturday morning cartoons with a bowl of cereal and like showing them behind the scenes like hey like this is the stuff they were working on what do you think about this uh you know how could we do this better and we think of it like a love letter to the fans of that IP we don't think of it like hey buy this and hopefully you'll be able to 3x you know a week from now or you get an early you could 10 exit two months from now like there's none of that talk as a matter of fact we actually don't even say the words nft very much at all like when we talk to people like we do it in educational space but we shift the the conversation away from that because I think nft is just the technical infrastructure of it you got to go back to like you mentioned the why and and and what's the point of all this right what's the use cases behind it how do I enjoy this as a fan and and that's what we start with what has been the reaction or the the feedback from Master the universe fans well I think again you start with the the shared sentiment because I'm a fan of the line right I grew up in the 80s and you know my older brother was really into He-Man and Masters of the Universe so I just remember like looking up to him and he was like the big He-Man Star Wars guy so I was just sharing like my memories of that as a kid and all the people that worked on the line here at Krypt toys and the artists they also grew up in the 80s and were big fans like to them to work on this line is like Pinch Me moments all around and there's certain just like warmth and like wholesomeness of like working with something that matters so much to you um and and just showing them the kind of these stories and how we're building it like there's all these little like Easter eggs that you would know if you kind of were fans of that IP that are present inside of the crypt toys and the unboxing experience and the whole thing that we have planned uh they've been huge supporters of what we're building we want to talk to more folks but the early folks that we've shared this to is like this makes sense and 100 I would buy this they basically said this would be my first nft so they go like I think if there's an aha moment it's like okay see this makes sense because it's analogous to like a toy or a collectible not what they've seen and don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of like you know pfps and board Apes as you can see I got my Apes right there like I'm a huge fan of it but it doesn't correlate to like mainstream consumers in the sense that like you know they have a corollary to match this to but they can match it to stuff from their childhood or to toys or whatnot so so far the reaction's been very positive there is a brand new staking feature in The Ledger Live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside The Ledger Live app Cosmos polka dot Tron algorize tezos Solana and of course ethereum with Ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its Network all inside The Ledger Live app through a partnership

easy so sign up at coinshift.xyz slash bankless you know strikingly and this is like a deeply anecdotal might mean nothing point but it's something John Rogers and I have actually looked at together which is some of these properties that have been licensed and the one that's coming to mind is is Looney Tunes that may not be the this again the concept here is correct whether the specific project whether Looney Tunes is the right specific example if you look like the the drops themselves of like hey Looney Tunes partnered with XYZ and just did a bunch of nfts were very mixed the Funko Pop nfts of like the collectible looking characters actually have have historically done better now again I the the the size of the drops may have varied but like it that was something I took note of and John and I both looked at like oh wow these funko pop nfts that are like very collectible kind of cartoony looking versions of whatever IP they partnered with it seemed like they've had more success than even just like the the uh whatever or I don't want to call anybody out but other drops of that IP ad absolutely and there's interesting kind of if you look into that like why is that right because it starts with like fandom and collectibility first and foremost right like there's a mindset of collection there's a mindset of like you know what is the collector's mindset there's completionist there are people that like to collect things for the joy of collecting like if you look at a Funko Pop collector and by the way a hats off the Funko for what they built I'm a huge fan of the company I collect Funko pops with my kid you know we're getting into that as a little hobby right nobody buys Funko Pops or I shouldn't say nobody but the majority of people that buy Funko Pops they're not buying it focused on like oh my God this is worth 100 this is worth 500 it's worth a thousand dollars they buy it for the sheer Joy of collecting and the feeling they get when they look at their Ninja Turtle funko pop or you know they look at their Masters of the Universe Funko Pop right there's a joy and an ethos behind that and it's not based in uh speculation or flipping or money right just changes the conversation and funko's built a great brand around that and I think you know that's why you kind of see the nft drops be successful and it's interesting because the mainstream ethereum nft Community doesn't even pay attention to that stuff right you don't even hear it talks about on Twitter uh you know Mattel did a a super successful drop with Hot Wheels a number of months ago right nobody talks about that because it wasn't baked in like the ethereum ethos and and PSPs and whatnot which gets all the attention so it's really interesting if you kind of dig behind the scenes it's not what's going getting like three tweets and and all the Press but there are some utility-based nfts that are becoming very very successful and I think we're going to start to see them Bubble Up more so in the next like few months here in this next wave really interesting um the other thing that I know Mattel as a company is doubling down on a huge way is is entertainment and IP around their toys I I think they're coming out with like a Magic 8-Ball movie and an UNO movie like like they're creating franchise and like you know Entertainment Properties around games that you don't even think of as like a natural fit for that Barbie's the big example everybody probably knows the Barbie movies coming out Barbie being a huge Mattel property um it feels like that's the way the world is moving is like everything has to have kind of story to to kind of capture your the imagination of the user otherwise we just move on um talk about and maybe like the origins of determining that you guys needed to have lore how you're thinking about that where it falls in the timeline um Etc yeah yeah so like again like like I mentioned we have three pillars to the company we have toys and collectibles gaming and entertainment and entertainment uh it's like a throughput behind everything that you're doing right you have to have captivating stories so that the games resonate more so the toys you know Captivate more et cetera so storytelling is a huge aspect of the project and if you look at like the big successes like you know Nintendo and Mario Mario had a story behind what he did there was an objective right uh if you look at like Master the universal I'll use them again as a great example as the universe you know Mattel built a line of toys but they also created an amazing Saturday morning cartoon that you were able to watch and get involved so that would kind of feed into that's a good selling from the Shelf Transformers example you know exactly right yeah you got it so so for us it was really important that that narrative drove a lot of what we were doing and you know I think storytelling is again it's interesting because the space again this is something that happened after the fact you know you would mint a project and then you would figure out the storyline and build the storyline after and again we wanted to do everything with story as a foundational element with entertainment and collectibility as a foundational element and kind of holistically tied together again a lot of the stuff that Legacy toy companies have done successfully Legacy video game companies have done uh to set yourself apart in a space that's crowded you need compelling story and again this is not something that we just wanted to be a video game company we didn't want to be a Toy Company we wanted to be an entertainment company and you need good storytelling to do that is this where Beanie Babies went wrong like people love to point out beanie babies like nfts or Beanie Babies it's like this weird fad that's gonna flame out and I don't know what attempts were made on the Beanie Baby side to create like TV shows but like it strikes me that that was what was missing you know you had it even had little bits of stories and those little tags that you could open but they didn't actually create like media properties around them as far as I know like is that what yeah I don't know too much about the Beanie Babies so it wasn't a huge Beanie Baby uh person as a kid that I think with Beanie Babies there were so many of them and I think you know there there are so many different variants and whatnot that it's tough to artificially create after the fact after the hysteria and after the rise of them you then artificially try to put the storyline in it I think the best the best stories live on when storytelling is organic and foundational like day one and then you build everything out from there versus the other way around what kind of feeding story was this literally day one for you like oh I have this idea for for cryptoys they're gonna they're gonna mimic these surprise dolls that my daughter loves so much and there's gonna be story or was it like a year in when you're like oh we're really making a company here we'll have to incorporate story into this or where did it actually fall oh from day one again once Freddy joined the team and Freddie came in with you know he came from Disney and Konami and 3D art and animation we're like okay this needs to be an animated series we really got to create like a brand around this whole thing and it was something we wanted to do from day one again as four co-founders working part-time there's only so much that we can do so we started building out everything in in unity and doing the art and animation and then the the NLP and and the app but we knew as soon as we had the bandwidth we're going to be building a lot of Storytelling into this and it was really after you know we we raised our our precede round and we were able to really kind of now do this full-time and kind of see kind of where the space was at the moment and then kind of weave in all the things that we wanted to see foundationally from a storytelling perspective uh that we wanted to bring that in and I was I was a huge I still am a huge Guardians of the Galaxy fan and I was always kind of captivated with this opening scene in Guardians of the Galaxy where you know you see him uh you know for the first time he puts on the mask he gets out like the Blaster and then he puts on a cassette of like an old school 80s cassette tape of like old school 80s music and I always just love the the combination of past meets future uh so we wanted to bring that into the storyline and again if these things are like old school you know video games from the 80s and they find themselves in present day on the blockchain and they're you know trying to discover this new world I thought how many fun things could we do with that as like the foundational story you could bring in new characters you can kind of tie things around nostalgically so that's when we introduced all that so yeah so you you started teasing if folks watch I actually retweeted it the like kind of there's like a launch video it appears like or you know that that that tells the story of like you know it's very stranger things-ish in the in the 80s thing or you know even ready I guess ready to player one with a lot of like stranger or um you know 80s references to it and it's like this old 80s arcade and then they get get blasted into like a hole in the universe or whatever I'm sure there's a technical term and they kind of end up in this new arcade world that is this you know where what I'm assuming the the kind of arcade in cryptoy's world will look like um which is super cool do you actively have like story writers right now like hacking away at like a pilot script wow is it is like a movie or a TV show like what's the what can you tell us I can't I can't say too much but it's an active development right now and we're talking with some amazing people in Hollywood uh that that want to take this thing to the next level we have a full-time writer on the team uh who has uh previous experience uh with one of the most popular cartoon shows I can't name exact names but she was a writer on that series and uh you know she's helping write the pilot we actually just have the the pilot and the pitch deck we're sending it out to a bunch of folks uh actually this week so we're taking that to the next level for sure so one of my questions but now given how real this is I don't know if you can answer it is like yeah have a dream director a dream voice actor that would be attached to this project like in your just like hypothetical Fantasyland that's a tough question uh to answer uh it's hard because there could be multiple fits you know depending on if we turn this you know right now it's scheduled as an animated series but a lot of folks have said hey this actually could be a full-fledged movie and with that could become you know a totally different fit for a totally different kind of uh Studio or or place so I'd I'd rather not name names only because we're in so many freaking conversations but uh yeah we're we're excited about all the possibilities for sure yeah and I think you you basically made this point and perhaps it's an obvious one but like the story and the lore is so important because if you're you're doing these like arcade mini games there's gonna be no moat around the mechanics of the games You're Building I'm sure I'm sure they're very basic you could go play a similar kind of mechanic the moat becomes the story and the moat becomes the character you are and and and um you know wanting to play as your cryptoy or whatever other pieces you sounds like maybe you wanted to caveat me on that but yeah no I think that's a big like a lot of the things we're doing is around casual gaming and making things simple like I think you know there are other folks in the space that are focused on like the MMORPG metaverse Ready Player One Style hey this is me and it's it's a it's a almost like a a real looking environment kind of like you know again what Yuka is doing right with improbable and all the amazing stuff that they're doing they're incredible and that's more like a World of Warcraft MMORPG looking kind of game we're focused more on the Casual gaming audience games like people can play for like 10 15 minutes at a time and again all ages like it uh won't say my wife's age here on the podcast because she'd get very upset with me but you know we're parents we have three kids my wife plays Candy Crush for uh you know a lot uh you know per day and so she plays toon blast and all these other casual games so again we're kind of focused on building an all-ages gaming platform kind of Nintendo's a good comparison because kids love Mario and Nintendo and so do we we love Mario and Nintendo as well so you know we're focused around that and then the idea is to build a holistic platform where you could do a lot of different things on it and as you build out your collection and as you play more games and you progress in the ecosystem more functionality uh you know is enabled and you're able to kind of you know do different things with so we hope that will keep people onto the platform and onto the ecosystem just because we're continually releasing new and fresh experiences for yeah it reminds me in some ways like the of like a Club Penguin like you were talking about how your son comes home and plays Roblox I mean that was well I don't know 8th grade for me probably or something and it was only a couple of months and in my world right but it was like that I came home and all my friends were on Club Penguin and I was on Club Penguin and there were little games I think you could do and you know whatever I think that is an early example so this gets us to you know how do you think about longevity and and and it strikes me that Laura would be a big part of this you know Club Penguin for me flamed out really quickly but but even in general eventually was just kind of shut down um a couple years after like do you worry about that with attention spans being what they are how do you think about not just planning out after a year or two of of hype yeah so I think again what's great about what we're building and we hope it'll resonate with people is we know for a fact we don't have all the answers in our hypothesis we we have a good framework for what we want to build and so a Toyota experience and what the future of digital toys and play looks like but we're going to need the involvement from the community and if you look at the mini games that we're producing these are games that we're making internally and some we're making with Partners in gaming Studios and we're constantly going to be releasing fresh experiences so if things feel stale or folks you know have ideas for a new game where there's a new uh concept that they want to see we can quickly iterate on that build it and ship it out and what's great is again if you think of us again as a digital toy company forget about us the NF as an nft project think it was like a digital toy company a toy company can always iterate on new methods of play and new lines of toys different Partnerships and IP so again I can name names but you're going to see a bunch of announcements from us with like household names uh that will be you know be able to announce in the next few months that'll have their own lines of kryptoys and with those lines of kryptoys will come fresh new experiences and different forms of play that could always keep things interesting so um you know it's on us to continue to innovate and bring forward value to the consumer but also we want to make sure that the community is very involved in bringing those ideas to the Forefront so we can build for them so Community involvement is a huge piece of what we're building uh alongside our fans are there active plans for physicals of the of the toys yeah I I can't say uh you know anything on the Pod right now but I'd say Obviously we have an incredible uh partner that has a lot of experience and physical um so when you know the the timing's right you might see physical crypt toys out there for sure part of the reason I ask and again it all ties to why I'm just optimistic about y'all because concept to the act seemed really good like these things are freaking cute like I look at them and I'm like I want to I want to like squeeze it you know what I mean like I want to touch the thing and so like my like that like I had that I had that very immediate reaction to the little characters so I'm just like when physical you know ironically I'm like thank you I want my physical cryptoy um I think there's a real there's some really cool Concepts that we're talking about in that with obviously a certain if you collect a certain amount of cryptoys we'll actually send one out to you and things like that we can't announce anything just yet but a lot of stuff behind the scenes that we're thinking about on that front so let's close here with with some of the more technical stuff you mentioned you're building on Flow obviously cryptokitties was a huge part of the inspiration for all of this but really how did you make the decision to build on Flow as opposed to ethereum say yes so for us we again we're focused on building a mainstream platform you know so it was really important that we were able to onboard folks that have no blockchain or crypto experience whatsoever and if you look at the the folks that'll be able to do that incredibly successful look no further than Dapper labs and and what they did with NBA topshot right uh you know I attribute to what Dapper Labs did with NBA topshot as the Catalyst that started everything with this last bull run right it was really like the first project to introduce nfts and the concept of digital Collectibles to a big audience of sports fans and fantasy fans Etc obviously the Trading Card Market was blowing up at the time and there was a good kind of on-ramp for folks and then folks dived into ethereum and whatnot but the ability to go on with a credit card and buy something with no metamask wallet or knowing what a gas fee is is incredibly important so that was number one easy on-ramp uh for for folks the other thing is having a great partner in general like Dapper labs are just fantastic Partners not only did they invest in the company but we work alongside them on licensing deals and a lot of different opportunities so they've just been a phenomenal business partner to be involved with and then three we think it provides the best user experience uh you know on the market frankly from like just getting to be a user on a platform starting signing up and then getting the the actual uh collectible so my whole Theory with blockchain uh and which blockchain to choose from is that for the most part obviously there's going to be exceptions to this uh for the most part if you look at like five ten years from now the blockchain is not really going to matter at the end of the day what's going to matter most in my opinion just my opinion is that you do three things right number one the user experience is phenomenal two that fees are incredibly low and three that the user has true ownership and liquidity of the asset and if you achieve those three things the blockchain that you choose kind of Fades into the distance uh because I think you know if you look back at like this happened in web 2 like my previous company live ninja I remember specifically I would ask folks like you know like about different kind of programming languages and we coded our first initial prototype in PHP and they would ask like oh what are you coding in and I'd say oh building a PHP and they're like PHP wait you're not building in Ruby or python like oh you're not gonna make it bro like it has to be Ruby or python now if you look at like 10 years later does any consumer go to a website and wonder what coding stack it's built on no they just care that it's a great user experience on the website and I think that's where we're gonna head with web 3 applications but user experience has to be first and foremost phenomenal um and then again gas fees or any fees whatsoever has to be low and then ownership and liquidity is important right you have to be able to if you wanted to sell it sell it right and it's not going to sit uh in the market forever so we're just focused on on nailing those three yeah I think flow gives it the best chance to do that you know I think folks have misinterpreted me on this podcast before because I you know I've talked a lot about are we gonna live in an omnichane world and initially saying like for sure it's just gonna be multi and nobody will care and then diving deeper into some of this and being like oh wow but I really understand how ethereum scales and I don't really understand how bridging works and so you know maybe if all the network effects accrue to one chain that's scaling really well like maybe it does just become an eighth dominant world and then I go back to being like I think you're probably right it doesn't matter so I have I'm a little bit agnostic about that but I have been outspoken about like thinking Doodles should stay on the ethereum ecosystem because I do worry about bifurcating their brand right now and and losing liquidity in their brand and that and people have interpreted that as being like anti-flow because that's of course the debate is like will they go on flow or will they settle on ethereum um and it I don't actually mean it anti-flow I mean it for that particular project in that particular use case I I don't know and I trust the Doodles team they'll make the right call but like to me I think they should stay on ethereum and settle on ethereum for you and what you're doing I totally hear that and it it really makes a lot of sense I think to be on Flow and um so so for all people out there who think I like hate flow here I'm conceding I think there are great use cases for flow and I think this is a really good example of one that kicks off from their from the start focusing on family onboarding easy you know good partnership et cetera et cetera so um is there anything like any uh takeaways from the flow ecosystem you would say whether you're like you know if you're thinking about building on it here's what you should know or these are some projects I'm excited about in in the flow ecosystem I'll tell you this as uh entrepreneur building on the on the flow blockchain number one if you're building a company or a project and you're considering it just know getting like a web to Dev and introducing them uh to Cadence right which is flow's programming language is incredibly easy for them to transfer over right it's not like something where there's like a big learning curve like if you have a really good like developer in web 2 they could easily adopt this and learn this pretty quickly so it's a great like way for them to jump over which if you're building a project and looking for devs to build I think that's a big perk two if you're looking for licensing deals and it's important for you to do IP deals with Brands flow gives you a big leg up why because a lot of Brands like it or not if there's truths to it or have truths or whatnot a lot of Brands perceive the environmental impact of a project or the blockchain right like the negative press that they'll get because blockchain is perceived as bad for the environment flow just did a whole study where it basically showed I don't know the exact number but basically like if you're mincing something on the flow blockchain it's like the equivalent of like four Google searches from an energy consumption perspective and believe it or not that stuff mattered when we were closing licensing and IP deals so these are things to really consider and then I think also there's a lot of like decentralization maximalists right like oh it has to be fully decentralized not your you know not your keys not your crypto and all this stuff and to an extent I you know I think that's very valuable in the space I think decentralization is really important um there's also some advantages to having a partner that you can go to for help in certain things and building applications and businesses uh that can scale to potentially millions of users as much as I love ethereum and there's stuff that that incredible stuff that's being built on that everybody's kind of just building off decentralized in their own little individual Islands right um sure you have layer twos and things like that that could that can be helpful but you know it's been an amazing experience like working alongside a company like Dapper who can help you really push the ball forward in different phases of the company to try to make a big impact and to take a big swing to uh to produce something really really great so that's just a few things that I would mention to anybody considering building on flow or any other blockchain like look at what the advantages of the ecosystem are like like you know I'm not just going to be here on the top of the mountain talking about flow which I absolutely love but like I know Salon is doing a lot of cool things polygons obviously making a lot of strides I know you're doing a lot of cool stuff with immutable they're crushing it as well so really kind of like look into the ecosystem and see what they offer and then make the the best choice for you yeah flow IMAX and polygon right now where I'm like eyeing is I think really and each shaking different approaches although I guess polygon and IMAX are actually taking polygons now really becoming a layer too so similar approaches and arguably um from that standpoint but I think our have a lot of potential and and each fill needs in the in the ecosystem okay last question I think it is a no-brainer that there is going to be a massive call it probably multi-billion dollar company that will come out of the space you're building in right this like start with sort of digital toys digital Collectibles that um the self on the Shelf broaden into games and and lore and and whatever and from my vantage point I'm like all right looks like it's gonna be you guys you know like I think you're you're from what I see from the outside of course like it seems like you know it all looks great you obviously are internally so you know that the trials and tribulations on a day-to-day level so if that didn't pan out if like if cryptoys doesn't pan out for some reason like what would it be like what is your biggest risk case right now in your opinion such a great question I think the biggest thing whenever you're building consumer Goods or you know applications or whatnot it's just involving consumers it's always a risk because consumers you know you can like look at like some of the movies that get made you can have like 100 million dollar budgets and on script they look absolutely fantastic and they can hit all the marks and they get a promote it's gonna be the biggest movie ever and flops at the box office or a video game right we see this all the time with big video game studios you could spend five years 10 years building a huge game and then all of a sudden you know millions of dollars a budget just the game doesn't hit it doesn't resonate so I think any entrepreneur that's into consumer uh you know just the space in general in building consumer apps and consumer games and and products you have to just make sure that you're talking to the consumer and researching and you got to hit your marks it has to connect I think that's the biggest risk is that you know you missed the mark from a consumer perspective and what they really want so the onus is on us and and I think one of the benefits that web3 projects have is they're very Community Driven where before if you think about people like making like real physical consumer goods it's a very like big feedback cycle to like involve a community and get feedback and iterate and kind of change on you know on the dime but here with digital and web3 everything's built with a community Centric approach so I like to think the onus is on us to make sure the community stays involved and and we're building stuff directly for them so I think that's the biggest kind of key marker that I like to hone in on and uh and that's the biggest kind of indicator for success is it resonating with the community well thank you so much will thanks for hopping on the Pod I'm sure we'll check in with you we'll have you back in a I don't know I don't know when it'll be maybe a year maybe three years maybe sooner than that but just to track your progress again I think this is awesome what you're doing and frankly great for the space as a whole so thanks for coming awesome thank you Carly honored to be here hey don't go anywhere if you've made it this far we have a special surprise for you will is offering to let overpriced jpegs listeners into the early private beta for cryptoys which is being rolled out over the next couple of
