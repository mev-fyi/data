foreign [Music] ation how you doing today on the Pod we have peace who is working on metagame what is metagame it is you can kind of think of it as an MMORPG interface to exploring the web 3 and the crypto world so basically people come through this front door and they see several different houses a house of finance a house of regen and they can go explore different quests within those different houses and which they can explore explore the web 3 ecosystem so it's kind of like an onboarding tool to the web3 ecosystem that itself as you get deeper into it gets you deeper into the web 3 ecosystem but also can get you into deeper into building metagame and so basically it's kind of this infinite game in which it teaches people about the philosophy and the ethos and the tools associated with web3 but when you talk to Pete you just get this this sort of sense of attention between being a philosopher and being a builder uh puth is an entrepreneur working in the web threesome him and I actually met at East Berlin in 2019 and I've seen the growth of metagame from just a Discord server into this community that's thriving and is trying to create a more game B world so basically game B is this idea that you may recognize from the episodes that we've done with Daniel schmachtenberger about creating a omniwind civilization that maximizes human flourishing uh maximizing collective intelligence coordination collaboration Omni consideration um these are all provocations that are meant to provoke the idea that we're playing a game a that is more molokian that is more about defecting and maximizing resources for yourselves as opposed to creating an omni win Civilization and so game B has become this really interesting Philosophy for me that has sort of provoked a lot of these questions about what if we what you know what if the internet of Finance was emergent how would you build a game B that is more different that is a little bit different than the existing system that has been inherited from the previous generation and so you know there's some of those provocations in the conversation with metagame it's about routing talent and capital in web 3 to projects but it's also about if you look at it at a systemic level in MMORPG that routes talent and capital in this more game B Direction so um I I think that metagame is going to be an iterative evolutionary game as is web3 but it's kind of interesting to talk to peace on the week of metagame V1 launch about his plans for metagame and also the becoming of a Dao and uh the launch of metagame V1 so interesting episode a really timely one like I said I've been talking to Pete since 2019 it's just been really cool to see him grow and see the community grow through Bull and Bear they are here trying to build for a more game be a more meta game world and that's why I invited him on the Pod to talk about the V1 launch so without further Ado I give you peace and metagame the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer year one for the regenerative Finance movement it's fast Planet positive and built for the real world celo has committed to producing a

it's the week before Devcon and that's got me pretty busy I know that you're about to launch metagame so I think that that's probably been keeping you really busy tell us tell us about that what is metagame what is a massive online coordination game so you can think of it sort of as a real-life MMORPG about uh using web3 and building the future that we want to live in uh basically you can also think of it as sort of a mesh up platform of like so it's not a social media platform it's not a freelancing platform it's not a learning platform but it's kind of has elements of all of that plus like MMORPGs like it's gamified wow uh so I I've never played World of Warcraft but I I know about it I know that these MMORPGs can be really very vast um but also very small depending on what Rabbit Hole you want you go down so can you take us down the sort of front door of of metagame is it is it a front door to the web3 ecosystem that helps you explore the the weird wonderful diverse world of of web3 what is metagame at its kind of like smallest First Steps level yeah it's pretty much what it is at least what it starts as so you scroll down the landing page you're presented with a screen where you like it the landing page explains the really basic ideas of meta game and what we think web3 is about and then you click join in the computer screen and you get this uh roll down text that says like uh wake up in and follow the purple octo so you know like the The Matrix text rolling down the the screen and you have this sort of a text based Choose Your Own Adventure where you we call this the onboarding game where you basically just uh answer these prompts that the computer screen asks like presents you with and then based on whether you're completely new to web3 or whether you like have a project and you're looking for uh like either people to help you build it or different resources then it is like directs you to learn like explains you the basics of web3 and sends you off to different directions to like learn more about dial space or the D5 space or the nfts or it like tells you to go create a grant on git coin or yeah like really depending on what you need and then one of those paths is to join marigame yeah you're about to say something how many how many Divergent paths are there because I mean I think there's web3 is just this kind of like infinite Frontier of different things that you can do with money in with tokens and with public private key cryptography I mean how many how many sort of like 101 level quests are there a soda we split the web Tree in this case to I think five different pages so the first one is just like the we call this the great houses so we have like the house of ethereum that explains the basics of what ethereum is and then sends you off in different like has a list of links to learn more and then we have the house of daos the house of nfts uh Defiance and the house of depths and so these great houses are really about like giving you the sort of a meta overview of the different fields of interest and then uh like just a bunch of links to like explore further like like that post the podcast whatever else to learn about these different domains cool is there a house of regen you know say I'm green pill than I want to learn about pro-social causes of web3 which houses is the best one to start in not yet but there definitely should be it so I think one of the next ones I want to build is the house of game change and that I want to include like all the region stuff the game B stuff you know the meta modernism and like all those more philosophical topics but I think refi fits right in and also we'll include some more notes of about rifa in the house of D5 cool um yeah that would be great I uh we could call it maybe the house of coordination I think that's a meme that you and I have talked a lot about when you're not recording so is there uh you know once you're in the house and you've kind of established yourself you've done a couple initial quests is there a leveling up system I'm thinking of MMORPGs where you start as a mage and then you learn all of these more skills and you gather more loot as as you go on so what is the progression from from joining the house look like from there I'll joining becomes like the this is just exploration phase still so like people go to explore houses and then they can report their findings so like so that's a quest to like report what they found or what they learned but the the leveling up really starts when you choose the path to join metagame and that splits to like join as a player or join as a patron or join as a guild and player is like the the most popular pet for like learning and contributing to metagame patrons are just people who are supporting metagame financially and then guilds are different dials that might want to join the network and integrate their own like uh successorially different building blocks that they're building into the metaos which we can get into a bit more later but yeah so once you choose the player path then it really starts the onboarding to metagame which starts with eight quests that are called the engaged octopath which is the first role that you get in metagame so like you prove that you're not a bot and then you become an Engaged doctor so it means that you're on the onboarding journey to John meridian so you complete these quests and then that sends you to like uh the pet selection screen where you like choose different paths based on the role that you want to take so there's like a builder's path designers pets and a few other pets that people might want to take there's also like a create your own path so like people are not forced to take these pets like they can like create their own path but yeah so like then you complete more quests and then if you're accepted you become a player and then the more active you get you rise up the leaderboard there are so there are 150 players in total like that's the cap currently the top 56 are What's called the ranked players and there you have like the bronze League silverlink silver league uh gold league platinum and diamond so you like rise up those leagues and uh each league has their own uh perks that you unlock and then yeah as you get uh more active you can become a deputy or a champion so these are like the the leaders of different uh initiatives or domains inside metagame so that's another like level of involvement and that's where you join the coordinate Circle and there are additional Rewards yeah so so first off uh I think you and I met at youth Berlin in maybe 2019 2020 was it and it could have been 2020 because of the coveted pandemic but I remember you telling me all these different ideas about Medicaid they're like kind of like it was just it was it was a it was this big Vision that you're trying to compact down into something that's approachable and understandable by people and I think that you've come a long way in sort of explaining what this is but I always feel like as a as a viewer I need a visual overview and I know that if you go to metagame.wtf uh which is where the experience is hosted you can kind of visualize all the different paths down and nooks and crannies of metagame so it's just been cool to follow the progression of this project over the last couple years and such an honor to talk about it as the V1 is launching literally this week so uh Kudos on all the traction yeah thank you yeah like things finally actually exist I remember like reaching out to you like even before we met in Berlin like hey what do you think about this idea and it's like just such a huge idea it's like people that I sent it to most of them were like dude you can't just do all of that like choose one thing yeah yeah um together right yeah in the end it fit together I think like in some ways we started like uh we built some pieces that should have been built last we built the first like the my meta profiles which are these sort of a decentralized LinkedIn Pages for the people who want to work in the dial space so like that's our first product when actually probably was supposed to be our like we were supposed to be building it now and instead of that like we've built that first so the whole onboarding flow was broken like the onboarding quest didn't exist the onboarding game didn't exist we just okay create a profile now go to Discord and that was the the whole flow but yeah like over time I think finally all these pieces are in place and we have the the functional platform yeah that's great I noticed that you called metagame a massively online coordination game as opposed to a massively online role-playing game and I thought that was an interesting distinction and maybe you know as someone who just thinks a lot about web3 error coordination and collective intelligence I'm reading too much of the tea leaves here but it feels like to me something like World of Warcraft or a role-playing game is is a fun entertaining experience but in at the end of the day it's it's kind of like Escapist in that like the loot that you get is only good within World of Warcraft and the experience can only be experienced within that one little like intranet um and with metagame what's cool is that it's kind of turning web 3 the exploration of web 3 into a a coordination game a massively online role-playing coordination game and what's cool about that is that the assets that you acquire and the skills and friendships you acquire actually like professionally relevant so I don't know if that was a purposefully purposeful message thing that you're doing there but I think taking some of the MMORPG mechanics and applying them to web3 is a really interesting idea and and can't wait to see where that goes yeah definitely so one of the things that uh that helped me and the impact on me was this this thing called the octolysis framework which was built by this guy that was like uh big gamer but also studied like behavioral economics and sociology and I don't know what what else he studied but he came up in the end with this octolysis framework which basically split uh like these different uh reasons why people love games in general so like own having ownership having agency I don't know it splits like into these eight different things and the all successful games hit up like at least a few of those things like they can you know like uh there's a meaning making and things like that but the thing is like with all games it's still all virtual like you said like you're like you're you're leveling up in your unlocking achievements and all that but it's still low like in this game world and same with the World of Warcraft like all of them all of those games hit like a combination of these elements but metagame has potential to hit all eight of them because it's like it's actually like you are leveling up but you're leveling up like in the real world like you're acquiring skills learning things and progressing through organizations I think that's super important so I know that you're launching this week by the time this episode airs the experience will be live at metagame.wtf so go check that out if you're listening but you know Pete what would a successful launch look like for you I think you said there's a cap of 150 players what is what is sort of the rest of 2022 and early 2023 look like for metagame are you are the people that are coming into metagame once they get more advanced building meta game uh like the next trance of of metagame and I guess I'm just asking what's next over the next six months uh so over the next six months there will be a lot of uh more boring stuff so like restructuring the dial and launching it on Dao house like uh finalizing the tokenomics for phase two since we'll be like transitioning in less than a year and that sort of stuff but what I want to focus on in terms of the platform in terms of the meta OS is really going hard on the Integrations so like making the dashboard and the whole Matos experience a lot more useful and integrate a lot of different building blocks which is actually the idea from the beginning and but then like most of the things that are in there are things that we build yeah but uh yeah so like you have the dashboard which displays uh the latest content from the community the leaderboard the calendar your XP and token stats and I don't know what else but we want to like also to integrate things like okay what uh what tasks are assigned to your ethereum address on different like Bounty networks or like the D work or like uh to like surface proposals from the dials that you're a member of and different things like that so like really want to yeah make this is possible for people to create these custom blocks in the dashboard and like build their own Integrations so metal is really meant to be this Mosaic of different uh web3 building blocks yeah I think that you said the the different types of users are the users the guilds and the patrons so I wonder if you know if you can make it all self-service for users and uh guilds and patrons to maintain their own part of the journey then the whole thing just kind of grows frantically according to those experiences obviously easier said than done but uh it reminds me a lot of when we decided to turn company uh get coin from a company into a dollar let's get coin grants the experience of making it so that the matching funders and the individual funders and the grant owners like they're different parts of the hyperstructure that all sort of interact with the with the smart contract uh so so it seems like that refactor there it just it just brings up a memory of me of doing that at Bitcoin great yeah yeah and it's really like a long term what I want to marry him to be like so like that's why from the beginning I created this like at least I attempted to create this separation between uh metaphem as an organization that started metagame and the metagame itself as a project and then as we transition to phase two I see like us just being one of many guilds that are building that again that's cool yeah so using metagame to build metagame in a way right take us uh okay so I asked the what's in the next six months question and now I want to telescope further into the future take us to the year 2033 which is about 10 years from now what does metagame look like if it's maximally successful and what impact has it had on the world in phase three what we're calling the uh the phase should be called the Web of Life uh and it should really be about you know the phase is called equilibrium but the meme is the web of life so like the right now the meme is the an onboarding machine and a decentralized factory so it's about onboarding people to web3 and building this network of uh project and service does and then the second phase is the growth phase where the meme is the web of opportunity and then the third one Web of Life where it's like really a zoomed out of crypto where crypto is really just the one of many tools that we're using and it's really at the core of what we built but it's like marigame is not about crypto it's about helping people find the the most optimal ways to play life like for themselves and to make an impact so like at that point meta game should be this huge network of uh people and projects together with the physical locations that we actually already have a view in the network but we haven't created The Guild Pages for them yet but really I have this whole network of uh Eco Villages and that sort of places where people can go between and uh overall just having this whole uh alternative socioeconomic system where people can join meet people level up like find the meaningful things to work on and uh yeah make an impact beautiful so I mean it feels like it's a way to discover the opportunities in web 3 but as web3 eats the world it kind of becomes a way to just like level up your skills and your relationships and hopefully your bank account well not your bank account your crypto wallet uh in in and exploring the wide diverse Divergent things in web3 and so maybe you can find opportunities in people that align more with your values and it helps route you to where the most value is but I mean how do you think about the player testing or like the balance testing of that like you know if I'm someone who's trying to decide if I want to go into Finance or uh regen stuff or nft flipping you know like the balancing of all those different routes like how do you guide the user down all those different paths it feels like there's so many Divergent Divergent uh parts of web 3 and the world that they could be exploring at that scale yeah I think it's at the end of the day like I mean further versions it stops being less about start being less about us guiding them and more about discovering your own path so like there's these basic path that you take for joining and contributing to numerican specifically but this uh questions and this project we're calling playbooks is really like what it Forks into where people create these different paths and you can actually already find people like on Twitter posting these different threads that are about uh doing useful things for joining the web 3 space things like that that's also what we want to focus on is just trying to get people from the general web3 space or like not just web3 but in general uh to write these uh playbooks and create their own Quest chains so questions is the the first Dao that came out of metagame so like the first Standalone project that's used for like to begin with creating this uh onboarding Journeys and it's made in such a way that people can integrate into their own platforms so you like there's this uh you create you complete this Quest chain so like a sequence of quests and you unlock an nft and then yes we're using it to for onboarding people but it can be also be used for like uh micro courses it can eventually be used for building skill trees because like with one nft you can unlock another question and things like that so you'll see a lot of people uh creating their own paths and then like creating these uh playbooks out of that and then people like filtering and browsing through these playbooks and seeing what works for them Hmm got it so it becomes kind of like an interface for Discovery uh for the users and at scale hopefully there's a broad diverse uh and inclusive set of opportunities that that people can discover and you know it feels like at that level you know projecting out 10 years in which this becomes a way for people to to do one of the most important things of their lives which is build skills and build up their balance and discover their purpose like the governance rights to that become somewhat important so uh so when Dao for metagame I mean we hear the dial from well not from day one but we started on Aragon but the reason we refused to use it is because like we studied on arrogance because didn't support a minting of tokens but we never wanted metagame to be like token weighted voting so like we were minting the tokens on Aragon but we never used the Aragon for voting besides actually minting tokens so like voting on minting and uh like until now metagame basically just been uh one person one vote or hopefully one person at this a big part of the reason why we limited 250 players so that's like uh less trying to fight the Bots and uh like build up a single resistance and more like trying to build this tight-knit community where you know that like each of these people is a unique human and that's deserves the one human one vote for the like voting in metagame and then earlier with restructuring it and uh like launching a new tower will actually be voting on chain rather than in a Discord Channel which is kind of embarrassing at this point but yeah there was no a better and simpler solution but at that point I want to transition more into a system where people can earn multiple votes so they can like maybe like with each season that they are active in metagame they get uh one additional vote and then also like so there will be different scales for like how players unlock additional votes and how patrons unlock different votes so it still won't be like uh based on how much money you have but like a lot of different a lot of different uh things so it's that's like super important important for me from day one like if you're building this whole new world like it cannot be a plutocracy it's just yeah weird well uh you know I hear you you sing in the song of civil resistance uh a little bit with this one human one vote stuff I wonder if there's any way that uh the people out there get coined out in their work on get coin passport could derive civil resistance from metagame and vice versa so we'll just put that idea out there into the universe and um you know as listeners know I've used civil resistance as a huge opportunity for the space to go from one token one vote to one human one vote and however we can make that happen I'm very supportive yeah yeah yeah I met one of your people who was working on that at temcon and they talked to him about like how uh when I was starting we we also use ceramic but when I went to make my git coin passport it actually didn't detect my existing uh ceramic uh profile so we need to get that working somehow at least and then from that like we have like the down memberships and we'll be adding more stuff that could be useful for the passport as well okay I wanted to have our own uh like uh calling it a metapass it's like a old lady of like just uh receiving this passport based on like if you're a member of at least one doll that's a member of metagame then you can get it got it okay yeah so maybe there's an opportunity there it seems like ceramic is where a lot of the web 3 reputation off-chain web3 reputation stuff is going to be recruited it's gonna be the shelling point for a lot of that information but getting it to talk to each other is is something that's going to have to be consciously planned it seems like yeah and they're transitioning to the new graphs graph structure and apparently making it a lot more composable so that should help yeah that's cool well I'm so bullish on this world in which we have a crude reputation and that gives us access to the nooks and crannies of web 3 where there's deep value so I think metagame is going to be uh well we'll see how the launch goes but I'm rooting for it to to become a way that people discover discover the opportunities working in web 3 is awesome it's freeing powerful and so much fun but working outside of the typical W-2 employee structure is a deal breaker for so many opolis is helping the self-solving worker focus on what they do best their work while managing the back end for them there is a lot of nation-state overhead when working in web 3 and opolis takes care of all of the back end stuff freeing you

empowering real business growth worldwide at goldfinch.finance I'm curious what other hopes and dreams you have for for metagame on the eve of its launch on the eve of its launch I just hope that yeah a bunch of people show up on Discord and we talk about it I give a demo and in general just that we have I'll let new people showing up so you know like in the past few months as the as crypto took a nose dive and so did our Treasury and their token and there's there was a lot less activity but funny enough like uh our newsletter subscriptions have doubled over the past few months like he's just been going like this and I hope that we can get a lot of those new subscribers to actually jump in and go through these onboarding paths and discover discover web3 and more of metagame yeah I think there's a huge opportunity to just kind of the breadcrumb approach of of onboarding where you just kind of teach people new primitive show them a new ecosystem every day and then those atomic habits compound over time into a real knowledge of web3 and it in retrospect it feels like you know a lot but if you just learn one bit every little day then I think that it really breaks down some of the onboarding problems in the space so curious to see how that works with metagame and also I know that there's kind of like a social layer on your Discord I've been on your Discord before I've hung out with some metagame people before and learning socially is a great way to onboard people as well so what is what is the sort of social layer of of metagame look like uh do you guys do Town Halls on on Discord is is it mostly centered around Discord what does that look like yeah so far it's been mostly on Discord so we had the community calls every Friday where usually we had two guests so like uh we invited the two Dallas per Community call and then we had two of those people present their Dallas and what they're working on so that was happening every Friday up until like a month ago and that's been happening for a long time and yeah we have other like uh Builders called like uh Builders online that's like a weekly Builders call and we have the other Champions ring which is for people who are leading these different initiatives but yeah like mostly happening on Discord well I think that we're getting close to time is there anything I didn't ask that you want to tell us about metagame I guess just uh like the inspiration for starting the whole thing it kind of didn't uh really go into that but yeah like even you want to say something let's go there let's do it uh so like before crypto what I was really into is like researching this uh this like uh different sort of uh society different sort of social social socio-economic systems I don't know like initially what I started with was the watching the Zeitgeist documentaries that was like 10 years ago and like now that I watch them it's they're kind of cringe but they made a lot of impact on me when I was uh like in high school and they like really set me on this path of researching these different like Eco Villages and that sort of like self-sustainable uh places and in general like researching uh different uh economic system different political structures and that sort of stuff and then when I found ethereum is like like okay so like this is the softer layer like for building any like these new kinds of uh social economic systems and that's really what drew me into ethereum that's what was like really so deep into the dark space from the beginning and then yeah a few years later I joined the metacartel Dao which at the time like even though house didn't exist yet so we just uh front-end for voting and the treasury management it was like super basic and the telegram group and I was like okay so I joined now like who are these people what are the projects what can I do what's going on like I didn't understand anything so I started working on this thing that I was calling the medical black paper and then as I was developing this whole structure like the more I was thinking like if we were building this whole system it doesn't make sense to build it just for this one Dao and it's like a project that pretty much there is a problem that pretty much any doubt has like any there won't even many dollars at the time but like well then we had onboarding problems and there's a huge like onboarding problem for the web3 space in general and like helping people understand you know like what crypto is about besides the number go up and that's what we like uh made me start mating so like yeah put they say wind in my back like starting with this niche of onboarding people to web3 but really like putting it together with everything that I ever wanted to build which is uh yeah a new kind of uh socioeconomic system like finally enabled yeah this is the Webster Technologies and yeah hopefully Inspire others to think along the same lines one of the things that sort of strikes me when I hear that story and also just thinking back to meeting you at youth Berlin in 2019 when you had all those crazy ideas and um is is how metagame is kind of just like it feels like a fractal of metacartel in in a way to me uh how Peter Pan and the other ogs at metacartel kind of did this cohort based onboarding of uh the ecosystem and originally meta cartel started off as this meta transaction working group and then it evolved into a social network and then you coming in as kind of its resident philosopher I don't put words in your mouth but that's how I perceive you uh and then and then kind trying to switch to play that forward okay this was my path forward into web three and for making an impact in the world how do I pay that forward to other people in the world and so just the relationship between metacartel and then metagame and then whatever comes next from the next cohort that's onboarded from that feels like a very interesting fractal thing to me yeah yeah I mean even America till kind of started because uh Peter Pan was denied entry into molok Dao so like then America tell came to be and then from America told Kim metagame and now metagame spawned the like Quest chains like it's owned out and then hopefully at some point question will spawn another though and like so um for actualizes further yeah and the other thing that's really cool to me is the like the super modularity of these ecosystems so basically the idea of super modularity is having each composite part be modular in that it's self-contained but the super modularity is that the sum is greater than the whole of its parts and so just having been involved in metagame and metacartel and being from my perch over get coin while I was there just seeing the interoperability between all of these different sister projects in the metacartel ecosystem and then the sister projects between git coin and kernel and the hackathons over on the get coin side of things and then they interop with the rest of the ecosystem that I saw at metacom this year in Denver was really neat and and so it's not just onboarding people into web 3 but there's all these little like camps that are are there for the ethos and the coordination technology that we're building and can kind of bond together and I think that that's another another piece of the metagame that's that's super important and then in a way that's kind of your business at metagame is to help people on board into these different modules that are all socially interoperable with each other great we had to onboard into this network of dollars and yeah somebody told me like well but this onboarding game like why is it sending people to so many different directions instead of like funneling them into into America and I was like yeah like it's better give me just part of this ecosystem like if they need to go to Radio they should go to Radio they need to like go to Dallas they go to dollhouse like they need to discover all of these different uh guilds that they can join and like join these different communities based on their interest not because of like you came to our landing page so now join like our Dao yeah yeah I think it's neat the the reason why it's so Divergent is that web 3 is so Divergent and there's this infinite Garden this infinite Frontier of different things that people can learn in the space so uh I think it's it's neat to give people a little bit of guard rails as they go in those directions and you know because it's a frontier there's there's rattlesnakes there's tarantulas that can bite you uh and keeping people away from the scams and towards the projects that have the Good Vibes I think is a really hard curation task that I'm curious to see how metagame as it evolves keeps that it keeps keeps that ethos and and scales it so uh congrats on all the success congrats on all the launch and and and looking forward to seeing how it goes so uh where can people find metagame and find you online metagame.wtf and then yeah if you want to build your own metagame consider looking into metal game and seeing the the post about the meta OS like building this uh Mosaic of web3 building blocks you should also consider coming to metafest IRL so it's finally happening next summer Croatia it should be fun and I want to before we close it I want to share a fun fact with you if I remember correctly you said that you that you found a game B you know Daniel schmachtenberger through the future thinkers podcast that's right yeah I was actually working for the featured English podcast I edited the episode with Daniel schmachtenberger oh really but but then yeah like two months ago I reached out to Daniel schmatter Burger to invite him on our podcast and he refused because he said I'm gonna go to a walkies podcast it's like it's a great great episode like anybody who doesn't know about DMB should definitely go listen to the green pill with Daniel schmucktal Burger that's yeah uh Daniel's such a such a uh a Galaxy brain and some of his thinking about the meta crisis in game B has been something that we've unpacked on the green pill pod it's actually one of our the episodes that I worked the hardest to get him on and it got the most views and has had the most influence so I'm glad I put in the work on that but uh yeah so game B is this like flag on the hill for an omni wins civilization that maximizes flourishing and it sort of provokes that we're playing a game a where it's all about the flourishing of individuals and there's kind of this milwaukeean coordination failure in which we're all over taxing uh the human like the resources on the planet for our own selfish needs and what if it looks what would it look like if we optimized for an omni win Civilization so it's a provocative design space and and again you know I know that we're kind of wrapping the episode now but I gotta ask you uh has game be the word game is in both game B and metagame has game B influenced the design of metagame in any way is that going to be helping create a more game be world absolutely like I I was into the games game b space before I even learned about crypto so that's uh he had a huge that was a huge influence on me definitely and actually even had a I went on the stall and the title of the talk was called the metagame a game B of sorts it was um actually that's funny um so so you're taking these ideas from philosophy and building them into the wet clay of the internet of money in order to actualize it it am I getting that right yeah I mean that the my main problem with the game b space at the time was that they were kind of against starting a game B project so they're like oh no it's a collection of ideas it's supposed to be emergent you can't like just build the game d and I was like no I just that just starts let's try to build something that's a beautiful place to end it the chaotic and beautiful tension between Builder energy and philosopher and energy is is where I'm trying to live my life right now so that's a great place yeah and uh you know was the the one line when you opened the American newsletter building a new world at the intersection of technology and philosophy so that's like what you just said perfect great way to end it uh we'll also end it on a call to action check out metagame.wtf and we will see you in the meta game dear listener thanks for joining peace thank you for having me cool [Music]
