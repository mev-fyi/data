if you were someone who is affected by tara you lost a lot of money it's terrible i'm sorry you will recover i have been smacked down by the markets many times i think the crypto community will come back stronger from this crypto as an asset class will come back stronger for this there are some learning lessons that i hope you take with you and teach to the next generation who are new in this space and want to go down a path and take risks just to add on to that i also got smackdown during my first cycle in the crypto markets and there seems to be a lot of new people who came into crypto looking for the cool new thing and they found the very loud community of the terra ecosystem and so this is going to be uh the first experience the first like round of pain that a lot of first cyclers have as they come into the crypto industry usually it's not this acute usually it's not or is this trash or this shark believe how fast it happened david right yeah when i lost all my net worth in 2018 it was just a slow decline from the top down to the bottom but it was not a collapse like this
