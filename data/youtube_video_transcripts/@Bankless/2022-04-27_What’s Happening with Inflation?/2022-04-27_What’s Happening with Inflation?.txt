the big thing right now in the news this week is inflation i think this is the highest inflation something like 40 years 50 years something like this 8.5 cpi what's happening here can you tell us what's going on yeah so it's actually 35 years i've been doing this so i've seen a lot of cycles this is the craziest one ever the federal reserve pumped up a bubble in bonds and the bond market is obviously what fuels the mortgage industry and a record number of americans took out a mortgage last year not surprisingly houses are up 19 so if you are a homeowner that's a good thing but 35 of americans are not so that i think it's a terrible thing so the fed's pumped up this massive bubble and it's created a massively overheated economy and the chairman of the fed about a year ago said it was a transitory blip in inflation this is not transitory this is a massive massive problem
