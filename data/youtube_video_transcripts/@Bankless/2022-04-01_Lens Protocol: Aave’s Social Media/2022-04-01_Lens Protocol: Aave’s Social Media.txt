in the current form the way we build up to social you know you you have uh different kind of interactions you as a user you you create your audience in a uh one platform and uh you can't move that audience from one place to another essentially web to social is is about capturing the data interactions that you you do on the platform and then selling services and products to you that you might uh buy so at the moment there isn't a way actually to have a system where you know all the developers just come to can come together and build competing algorithms and actually allow the users to vote with their feet uh very easily and go towards applications that are providing them better uh i'll goes so what we did is that we created a protocol that is essentially a social graph meaning that you create your profile once and anyone that builds an application on top of the the lens protocol can leverage of the whole social graph user base essentially everyone is helping to each other providing users essentially it's a public good for the whole community
