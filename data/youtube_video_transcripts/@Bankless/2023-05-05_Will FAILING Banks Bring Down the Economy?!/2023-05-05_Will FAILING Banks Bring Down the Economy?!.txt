the reason Powell is raising rates is because he's trying to fight inflation and the more he raises rates the more economic turmoil that seems to be causing namely and we're going to get to this in a little bit in in the realm of bank failures okay so that's starting to happen another bank failed this week which we'll talk about in a minute bankless Nation it is the first Friday of May it's Friday morning hope you brought your coffee David what time is it uh Ryan it's the bank List Friday weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier how you doing this week David I I'm doing well I don't know if the banks can say the same though because we got more bank failures on the menu season two seasons that's a big topic big topic of conversation we're also going to talk about Jerome Powell and the FED raising interest rates how high can they go that's the question we gotta ask David what else we covering today uh biology waves the right white flag on his bet a little bit early he capitulates as bitcoin's not going to go to one million dollars in the next six weeks I think by June 17th June 17th which was when it was over okay well it is May 4th so he he's waving the White Flag donated donated 1.5 million dollars uh and so we're gonna cover that and then also uh there are some other main Nets just drops so eigenlayer main net the Suey main net the axillar has an announcement and uh lens has uh a layer three that we talked about last week we got some stats and then speaking of main Nets not really mainnet but coinbase International new exchange just got announced so a bunch of stuff to run through in this Friday weekly roll up oh yeah totally always jam-packed for you guys of course if you like this episode if you like what we're doing over here at bank list make sure you like And subscribe that's how we pop up on the charts on Spotify on Apple podcast on YouTube you know how to do it it's just like important subscribing it's very important yeah especially in the bear Market all right can you spare a light guys please paralyze one thing before we get into the markets today day David gotta talk about our friends and sponsors over at Swell swell is a staking protocol and this is a staking season I'm calling it not just spring but it's also staking season David tell them about swell swell is a brand new staking as a service protocol entering the foray of the LSD world but since they are brand new they are charging zero percent staking fees so they are the highest yielding staking provider out on the markets brand new simple interface and one of the new competitive advantages about swell is that you can also get defy yield along with your e field so some interesting new Innovations to be competitive in this market they are also looking to Frontier Technologies to improve the product something that's getting me excited like DVT is something that is on the swell road map decentralized staking yes yes squad's taking squad's taking exactly they have this thing called a voyage which they are teasing I don't know what's in the voyage but it is starting soon and they would like you to know about it so there is a Link in the show notes to go explore it is staking season David look at that uh APR four point five percent on your eth and I don't know about you David but risk free sounds pretty good right now with all the bank failures going around I'd rather have uh my eth in a staking protocol than in a bank account that's for sure protocol or Bank protocol or Bank what you want what's your what ah speaking of that let's get to the markets today all right how are we looking on a Bitcoin on the week are we up we down we sideways it we are sideways sideways week uh literally nothing to report 28 000 and 900. you tell me we could have just skipped this entire week it didn't even matter yeah yeah that's about right yeah not even one percent move on either Bitcoin or ether or is it the same both just flat and flat eighteen hundred and eighty eight dollars the most interesting thing about ether right now is that there are three eighths in the price man we could have just uh saved the last roll-up recording clip and just replayed it huh same price nothing changing volatility we uh went down to 800. oh we almost got back above 2000 but uh if Bitcoin ratio also this is weirdly flat yeah but also Banco station I'll remind you please pull up your tracker apps your price trackers and make sure that the prices have not moved in the last 24 hours and if you want some of the best charts in the biz you got to go check out uh Kraken Pro over here pro.crackin.com professional interface so all of my charts look uh very professional these days David it wasn't like that before and I'm learning how to chart a little slower taking some time uh let's talk about the big news today David which is uh the FED raising rates the big news this week at least so the FED just raised rates interest rates by 0.25 or as you like to call it 25 basis points I love it all right look at that I know you always are all in terms of basis points so here's the uh the press release if you want to read something uh you know kind of boring and what the uh what what the notes are about this but 5.25 between 5 and 5.25 range that's a 16-year all-time high we haven't been higher in interest rate um in 16 years it was 16 years ago when was that David it was before 2008 before the you know financial crash um yeah we're talking like mid 2000s what were you doing in the mid-2000s last time the the rates were this high are you buying a house did you know that rates existed not at all no I just understood that my parents were stressed oh I know this was pretty this is pre-pousing crisis never mind yeah yeah everything was fine it was but it was about to get things were about to get bad yeah right right okay so it doesn't make sense that high interest rates created the housing bubble to pop that makes sense do you think uh kids in middle school right now are talking about inflation or interest rates uh at all are they just still just way more than I was when I was the kids are getting smarter every generation that's what's happening I think um but you know what this this is kind of the uh the decision Point here right because Jerome Powell has a question uh they want the reason Powell is raising rates is because he's trying to fight inflation and the more he raises rates the more economic turmoil that seems to be causing namely and we're going to get to this in a little bit in in the realm of bank failures okay so that's starting to happen another bank failed this week which we'll talk about in a minute and I kind of feel like Powell is choosing maybe the worst of Both Worlds like so we're gonna end up with high inflation anyway and also bank failures that's my critique as to what's going on on the other hand like I don't know maybe the guy's actually not in control of anything it just seems like what happens David if we tighten so much that we cause a Cascade of 2008 like economic effects right we we just had our third major bank failure this week and we're still raising rates it seems like a bad time to be raising rates but I'm not a central Banker I want to yeah I want to present the actually the counter argument to that point go for it so we got it we gotta raise rates because inflation's still up right core inflation has not gone down uh the the more volatile more expressive and inflation has come down but core inflation things like Services services and goods have gone up right that's the hard part so that's why we gotta keep on raising interest rates and then when the bank failures uh occur that's a sign that's a sign of raising interest rates of course uh economics and finance are just harder and I think that what the FED is able to do with bailing out these individual Banks as they fail is like the FED is more Surgical and then they are catching the distressed banks on the way down so it's not a like an impact they're just cradling the bank failure into the ground and then they're catching the next one and so they are actually able to continue to increase rates because they are surgically catching the catastrophes that they are causing which allows them to continue to raise rates because they're not they're they're like oh there's contagion go gotta go catch it and it's working so far so far and maybe but also has a whole bunch of unintended consequences as well that we'll get to and I worry about life which is like Bank consolidation into too big to fail bank so that the bank sector becomes nationalized doesn't sound like it's unintended that's kind of what's happening right but I do think the the picture you just painted is what the central Bankers in Powell would like to have happen right right I just worry I think we're gonna get there's a very real possibility David at this point we get the worst of Both Worlds in that we're not able to cradle the banks on their way down but we just get cascading bank failures and also a high massive High inflation right so just like what was the point I don't know that's the risk that we're in inflation but economic deflation oh that sounds awful we'll have to see what happens I I uh we do know this that is what stagflation is um from the policy statement this week anyway the language saying that that the fed this has been you know previous uh fed language that it anticipates further increases would be needed that wasn't in here right so this does seem like this is the last the top rate of Rise right and it was only 25 basis points as you like to say so I guess hoping for the pivot interest rates and now we're just going to hold it is not exactly the pivot that we were looking for as an industry that has very high risk crypto assets look ultimately though David I on it I want crypto to deserve it I want our like industry to deserve it and not just be kind of a money printer hedge completely like I want us to provide a pure utility I want um the US economy to be in an okay shape uh and I don't want things to kind of cascade downward and you know just the casino markets to rain so I'm not sure what the best uh position is here but Jim Bianco here has a different take his take is the Fed knew the risks already of bank failures Powell knew the risks and he's being a careless being here he's being Reckless here he puts this in a tweet thread on February 14th the FED board was given a presentation that went through the risks to the banking system due to unrealized losses because of the rapidly Rising interest rates it gave this example people of a bank sitting on unrealized losses and particularly vulnerable this was February 14th mind you before the bank failures after hearing this presentation Powell went ahead with very hawkish testimony that was on March 7th and 8th the probability of a 50 basis point hike on March 22 soared based on Powell's words and less than 48 hours later Silicon Valley Bank failed and the FED backed off to a 25 basis point hike the point Bianco is making here is that Powell's getting into Reckless territory right he's making these policy decisions and then he's seeing bank failures and he's adjusting them a little but he's still edging towards kind of the brink of cascading bank failures I think bianco's criticism is he knows this is a risky game why are we playing this game with the US banking system right now so that is the critique of Powell's actions I guess the illustration that I gave was that oh bank failure fed steps in and like Craigslist it on the way down really depends on that they fail in a very orderly manner gracefully it works I think uh orderly and contagion banking crisis or not things that I would put into the same sentence it's a little bit like the the bike wobbling downhill you know when you start to oscillate and it's like okay now now we're oscillating right here and then it gets to a point where it's catastrophic unrecoverable and the bike tips over if it's going too fast and that is the word here if it's going too slow and if it's going too slow it's because interest rates are adding friction to economic transactions and so in order to correct for wobbles we need it to go faster which means we got to lower the interest rate Maybe that's what we have to talk about next First Republic Bank failure the biggest since 2008 that's coming up next what else we got coinbase

biggest bank failure ever in U.S history just happened this week and I feel like people are barely talking about it they're kind of talking about it this is a First Republic Bank based in San Francisco California pretty big 200 billion plus in assets so this was a big one David what happened well I'll think I'll throw the question to you Ryan what happened that was different than any of the other Banks so uh Banks bought a long a lot of long-term dated Securities and then the FED jacked up the interest rates and then the bank think this Bank failed just like the other ones this one was different in that it got a 30 billion dollar injection from JP Morgan and a number of other too big to fail Banks and then that depleted that it also ran out because customers chose to withdraw and then eventually the FDIC said like man this bank's not going to make it we're going to throw the white flag on behalf yeah that first Republic I mean that's basically what happened my interpretation of events so Regulators took possession of First Republic on Monday um this is the biggest bank failure since 2008 uh the second biggest in U.S history when there's a bank called Washington Mutual that exploded in the 2008 crisis that was my first bank ever as a child that was my first account yeah uh your first was Washington Mutual is that based in like uh the Seattle area yeah Washington State yeah yeah well so it no longer exists um I'm not sure what happened to them that I'm sure they become became part of a a bigger bank here um but yeah I think that account it's still there you still got it down I I think this has a lot of similarities with the first bank failures that we saw including Silicon Valley Bank the difference here is you know how Silicon Valley Bank their their big kind of uh in you know uh debt was in startups various Silicon Valley startups well for First Republic they were in the jumbo mortgage business so you know not great Mansions not crypto big house not what Gary Gensler said it's another asset well he he yes he he'll probably blame this one on crypto too David don't don't you worry give me some time all right have faith and getzler uh jumbo mortgages were their shtick okay and so when rates were low of course they gave out a ton of these loans and you know as one does and then the FED raised rates the value of the mortgages the collateral went down of course but then also yeah the uh the the treasuries on the balance sheet also went down in value too under par value thus making the banking solvent so for me it reminds me a lot of Silicon Valley Bank so all the lessons that we learned a couple of weeks ago have come into play here except the asset class wasn't Silicon Valley Tech companies it was jumbo mortgages it also wasn't United States treasuries and so I think this is probably like where the theater kind of strikes two reasons one we have another bank crisis bank failure excuse me not I guess a single bank failure isn't a crisis but like all of the other banks that failed happened those numbers of weeks ago in that like pocket of time it's all related now we have this Bank failing for the same reasons different asset class so mortgages they did have they did have some treasuries on the balance sheet so that didn't help but yes go on I think the point is this is like the balance sheet doesn't matter what the balance sheet is doesn't matter what the asset class is the issue was that the FED raised interest rates too fast so it doesn't matter like was it United States treasuries or just like long-dated Securities or whatnot like all banks are getting distressed by the the Whiplash of the rising interest rates also the timing like how long were the how long ago were the other banking crusties like six weeks ago right yeah and so six weeks later we had another big banking crisis it would have been made it would I would have felt better it would be easier to be comfy if all of the banks collapsed in the same time frame and then it was over once and then it was over but now we have one that's six weeks later and so the question is to me that I have is like okay clearly the common denominator is not the asset class this is not con this contagion is not contained waste it's not just crypto it's not just a Silicon Valley Tech companies for sure this is something different this is and that's the big common denominator is the Whiplash behind the rising interest rates which affects all banks and now six weeks later from the crisis we have another bank that fails which begs the question how do you know when it's over and are is are there more shoes to drop are there at the beginning of this thing another pattern here for you is another mid-sized Bank basically it's not one of the too big to fail Banks here right it's another Silicon Valley Bank sized bank that just went Belly Up and um yeah so in the common denominator as you said is rising interest rates so here's here's what happened the bank failed effectively the FDIC stepped in that happened on Monday and then what they do is they auction off all of the assets all the people savings account in uh First Republic Somebody's gotta Bank them still right the FDIC is not going to uh just say sorry your money's gone right of course shareholders get wiped out in these sorts of situations so that means a bigger bank has to go buy the assets buy First Republic so it can still say functional and operational that bigger Bank happened to be our friends over at JP Morgan Jamie Diamond and Company uh there was an auction uh JPMorgan won the auction against two other bidders those other bidders were also very large Banks and so JP Morgan ended up with the 92 billion dollars in deposits which includes 30 billion that it and the other large Banks put into First Republic to try to prop them up previously as you mentioned and 137 billion in loans and 30 billion in Securities okay so that's what they took over so the bigger Bank just got even bigger and then the FDIC absorbed the losses on the mortgages and the commercial loans and it also provided a 50 billion dollar credit line so it's going to cost FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund about 13 billion dollars svb cost 20 billion for comparison these losses David what happens to them oh the FDIC just takes care of them they were socialized we taxpayers like it cost us and so these risky Investments and um the interest rate rise is ultimately costing taxpayers so that is the cost we were talking about like earlier of um you know John Powell is hopefully like cradling these Banks down as they die well there is a cost to this and and the cost is JP Morgan gets bigger JP Morgan David now has 10 percent of All American deposits all right under Federal Regulation it actually can't rise anymore they made an exception for JP Morgan to actually make this acquisition so the banks just get even bigger the too big to fail Banks get bigger and then also these losses are socialized right it's like the average taxpayer wasn't responsible for that loan for a jumbo mortgage I mean this just this is reminiscent of 2008 all over again and you also can't say um wait I don't think Congress before you move on so I I heard a slightly different story so I want to throw in what I think could be a correction here um taxpayers are not it's not going to the taxpayers it's going to because of the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund that comes from Banks Banks pay for that so that comes from bank money to fill up the deposit Insurance funds that's coming out of that but where does the banks get the money to pay for the Insurance Fund like fees on customers and in the economy and so while taxpayers aren't being charged directly It ultimately goes back to the consumer because banks are going to have to charge higher rates for all their products and services down the line that was the the take that I heard and then the other thing that I the the take that I heard is like you said that they made an exception so that JPMorgan could buy this Bank um that was not an exception made right now that was an exception already made in Dodd-Frank forever ago where big banks that are so large above a certain threshold can't get bigger by buying Banks unless that bank is failing and so this was an exception built into Dodd-Frank forever ago that that was these are my interpretations of or what I've heard yeah I think you're right David those are definitely worthwhile details to to clarify so the banks got bigger um the losses were socialized in the form of higher you know Bank fees right you know taxpayers ultimately paid yes ultimately get paid by by the people I also think that it's becoming less defensive it's I haven't heard anyone in Congress anyone in the US government blame a particular party for this one right very easy to blame kind of the the crypto Bros first and then more widely kind of the tech Bros Silicon Valley people for the second but when you have this pattern of mid-sized Banks failing right and like who are you going to blame now this is starting to look systemic guys starting to look like a problem I want to pull up this chart I think this was the graphic of the week did you see this David yeah describe what we're looking at this is a timeline I'll start by describing this is a timeline from 2002 all the way to 2023 and we see on this timeline a series of of circles series of what look like dots and the size of the circle represents the number of assets in the bank that failed so for every bank failure there's a circle and the really big Banks get bigger circles and so David describe what we see uh in bank failures around the 2008 to 2012 time range what are we looking at yeah so we talked about how the First Republic Bank is the second largest bank failure in U.S history well the first largest is the big blue the the big circle that is for in the 2008 housing crisis Washington Mutual Bank 307 billion dollars and then you see like how would you describe it just like dots and and stacked snowballs big circle and then a mountain of tiny little snowballs that you actually can't oh there's a mountain there's like 300 dots in there of various sizes but they're all small and only three of these dots I could actually actually have the names of the banks in them so Indie Mac Bank Colonial Bank guaranteed bank all the other ones are just dots because they're too small to actually fit the names of the banks in two so these are all bank failures all bank failures so what happened to these dots what happened to these dots David um is that technical term yeah they got gobbled up by the bigger Banks right and so fast forward to where we are today 2003 there are only three big dots for the public bank at 229 billion dollars Silicon Valley Bank at 2009 billion dollars in Signature Bank at 110 billion dollars which goes back to my question this is just season two of The Big Crisis TV show how many seasons are there is the right side of this timeline which we are about to go into in the 2023-2024 going to be similar to what we see on the left but with bigger dots right and look how big there's no more money ready there's a lot more money out there in Banks and right like is they're like 300 dots in 2008. we got three dots we're trying to describe this the best way is just to go to YouTube and get the visual okay podcast listener so sometimes you just gotta capitulate and look at the video here to get to get the graphic but what we're looking at is a mountain of snowballs in in 2008 versus a Snowman in 2023 right right we just got big circles and a slightly smaller Circle and then kind of a head Circle that's what that's what we're looking at and this represents David what looks like the second third and fourth largest bank failure in U.S history and it all happened this year yeah it's pretty big like this doesn't look good this doesn't look healthy and yeah it's your question is what happens next uh David do you want to hear Arthur Hayes take hit me with it all right so here's Arthur hey is uh of all of the Season One banking crisis conversations we had the Arthur Hayes conversation sticks out the most in my mind and I think is maybe the most predictive of what we're seeing start to happen and if you recall David from that conversation in fact you were on it I was and I just listened to it a couple times after that episode he basically predicted okay I I will remind you I will uh pod spleen it to you David um it's like he said that the midsize and small Banks were in real trouble in the US that they're basically insolvent but slow motion type insolvent so he wasn't predicting that Bitcoin would go to a million in 90 days and you know massive Bank crisis but he said like it could take a year or two and the FED would have to basically step in and do something absolutely massive that would result in a whole bunch of money printing trillions and trillions of dollars worth of money printing so here's his take after the FRC the First Republic collapse a longer essay coming soon on my take this JP Morgan First Republic deal means the US Regulators decided to nationalize the banking system nationalize the banking system he goes on the eight too big to fail banks are effectively nationalized because they have government guarantee on their entire deposit base they will not be allowed to fail regardless of decisions they make socialized losses privatize gains it's a great deal but when called upon the eight too big to fail Banks must absorb their shitty cousins who couldn't handle the Rough and Tumble free market the prodigal's equity The Prodigal children's Equity holders will get a zero first but the deposits will find a new home and a safe too big to fail bank that bank of course JPMorgan in this case the government will provide rule exemptions and mates rates on loans like how the OCC waive deposit concentration limits an FDIC loaned 50 billion dollars to JP Morgan to get them to do the deal but a deal will get done the whole point is for the federal government to claim it isn't bailing out a failed bank but a private company is it's a bit of left-hand right hand but those are the policies of the day just look at how China allocates losses as a blueprint for the U.S as long as inflation remains High and the politics surrounding banking credit and debit are toxic there will be more contorted solutions to try to confuse you as to who Bears the loss if you aren't one of the eight too big to fail Banks you are f'd as long as inflation is sticky at these high levels and possibly Rising today I will choose a bank with large cre exposure and 50 to 50 otm puts that expire before June this is Arthur of course being the trader and betting against a small and mid-sized Banks what do you think of this idea nationalizing we are de facto nationalizing U.S banking system well it reminds me of the article that um he wrote which brought him onto the podcast last time which the whole theme of that article is um the destination is known but the route is uncertain he was actually applying it in a different way but I'll apply it here the destination is a nationalized financial system uh because that is that is the era that we live in the era of the cbdc it becomes really easy to roll out a cbdc when there's only eight banks in the commercial banking sector and so like that is the conclusion of things a financial system that is just highly centralized controlled with a ton of oversight and a ton of Regulation because it's not hard to control things when there's only eight Banks and so this is to me a convergence upon that we we talk about cbdc's and like the evils of cbdc's because it just means central control yeah so this is the conversions that we're going towards here's the Insidious thing about this too is like you heard him talk about like these contorted measures that were being made they're not going to announce that the U.S banking system is being nationalized no there's never going to be legislation that goes in front of Congress which is like check yes or no let's do a vote should the U.S banking system be nationalized or not it'll happen like this slowly and with them doing the the theater of basically we're not nationalizing it it's private see JP Morgan look private company went and won the bid right so it'll happen like no one will directly tell you that that is what is actually happening as as an investor and as a participant in this economy you just have to keep your eyes open and connect the dots and see the pattern playing out and you're right I think that is the destination of this just don't expect the trumpet from drum Powell saying we are nationalizing the banking system because they know that that uh would be soundly rejected by the American people well the way that you're saying is that is that like they are the puppeteers of this master plan and they they want that I'm not necessarily sure that they do want that is if you zoom out and see a nation state and fiat currency systems as the powers that be and with a mind of its own that is a conclusion because the aggregate incentives pushes it there oh yeah like individual players like Jerome Powell's like I'm gonna nationalize the banking sector I don't he's not doing that no no a larger body with a direction that it wants to go in I agree with that too I don't think that there's like an intent to like I'm an evil emperor to nationalize this system but there is an intent not to tell you that that is that name being played 100 true that is right they're not Point like they know what they're doing they know they know where this inevitably goes they're not stupid is kind of what I'm saying they're not like oops I guess we have to take over another bank what's gonna happen they know exactly where this is leading but they're not going to tell you because they're going to boil a frog and which is exactly what's happening so meanwhile speaking of this biology all right do you remember the 90 day Bitcoin bet yeah he's capitulated on it yeah uh so six weeks it was due uh June 17th he bet that Bitcoin would hit a million dollars there'd be a Cascade of bank failures what is the status update on that David biology tweets out I just burned a million to tell you they're printing trillions he really loves his like limericks he loves he's good he's good at it rhyming little like Crips um the million dollar bet is now closed by mutual agreement I made one million dollar improvable on train donations which you can verify half a million to bitcoin core development half million to give directly half a million to Medlock who I think is the winner of the bet uh and then he goes on to explain like why did he do this he's basically saying the whole like bit signal was a marketing stunt that he has paid he just took one million dollars to the face to broadcast that they are going to print a trillion dollars um so that's what he's that's what he said did you watch his video David I watched part of it okay I I watched it was good it was a lot of our our episode with him yeah it actually made me a little bit frustrated it was like apology like you can say things in nine minutes next time we do a podcast can you do something like this please I don't know I enjoy the long form with Biology although although I think we had like uh two and a half hours of content we kind of paired that down to like you know under two hours or something but an hour 40 yeah so I I think the tldr for people include a LinkedIn show notes is um biology says it's still gonna happen it's just not gonna happen in 90 days and he gave the parallels to this is like 2008 uh he said Bernanke said it was fine uh that the economy is fine and then two quarters later we got hit with 2008 major recession and so he draws parallel so that he also draws parallels by the way all of the federal like chair members and everyone else is like the economy is totally sound banking system's fine guys like that same messaging this week yeah he's he basically pulled up press releases in the same time period and then he's like look what Bernanke said we're fine I you know didn't use the exact same terms as as um you know uh kind of the landing the plane term that that Powell uses but basically said we're fine mild no recession it'll be fine two quarters later didn't happen so he's basically saying look at the signals we got debt at astronomical um levels we've got D dollarization happening he's got some charts about that we've got gold buying from central banks all-time highs outside of the US particularly now we have bank failures and runs and so he's basically saying I lost the bet but I still got the word out on the most important thing that's kind of his take on it um which is interesting because he didn't exactly tell us in that conversation we asked him if this was sort of just a marketing stunt he said no it wasn't so I remember I remember thinking about that part uh because he I can't remember the details but I think with there he might have been saying I am not doing this to pump the Bitcoin price to make a profit which I think is different than saying I am doing this as a marketing stunt I also think he is still views that there is a probability that it could happen in 90 days and when we had that conversation with him he was like yeah there's a probability that could happen it's not a certainty all of this is like probabilistic and actually um this is I think worth watching I think we should watch this clip because the question is okay biology if you still think it's going to happen and it's not happening in 90 days now and you're willing to capitulate on that when is it going to happen so this is what he says here and so then of course the question is okay but when everybody wants to know exactly when things are going to happen so I don't have a crystal ball um my guess is 10 months uh 70 years 19 decades one percent centuries okay I can give a case for each of those that when I say 10 months what I'm saying is you know we have some serious crisis in months or 70 I think it happens in years and one way of thinking about this is sort of the you know stay in dollars or exit Spectrum if you think the current status quo of printing can go on for an endless amount of time the U.S establishment de facto believes it can go on for centuries then you stick on one side if you are seeing fire alarms you're seeing claxtons then you exit whatever that means to you personally as I said I'm like 10 months 70 years 90 decades one percent centuries you should figure out what your own percentages are if you think that all of this is totally stupid you know and uh and the US of course has infinite hit points and the FED can print forever then you're at centuries and you should ignore all this but if you have some probability that actually system collapse may happen sooner than people think then you should you know take take appropriate action whatever what do you think of that David so he's giving a much more probabilistic bet here right and this kind of implies you know for him if it's 10 months maybe he has 10 in Fiat for example 10 in the dot in the dollar and that's how he allocates his uh his portfolio sure uh I'm reminded that there's that quote that sometimes there are decades when weeks happen and then sometimes there are weeks when decades happen and I'm also reminded that biology was way ahead of the curve with covid which was an exponential event 2008 was an exponential event the worry that we had with the with the Snowman and what could happen in the future like what we're saying is like there could be an exponential event in the future so it's not like it's not like if Bitcoin goes to a million it's not going to be like at the last second it touches a million and it just gets there and then it comes back down it's gonna be like no like you're like it's skyrockets and it breaks the meter because of an exponential event um 10 is exactly like what he said is an exponential event it's a 10 chance like we live in a time of chaos uh the pendulum of the global order is no longer in the time in the era of stability that was the last four decades it's been shifting towards chaos and it's been shifting that way for a long time now um yeah yeah that's when you break it down here here's what you can do you can um what I love about this sort of thing is you can actually bet whether biology is right or not and you don't it doesn't have to be a binary All or Nothing type of thing you have to be like oh it's it's certain so and it's certain it's going to happen in the next six months therefore I'm going to take all of my Fiat I'm going to convert it to crypto right you could just do a little bit of it or a lot of it depending on where you are in kind of the spectrum but I will say I I do over the long run I will not I'm definitely not betting that biology is is wrong I really like the long time period it's like this seems totally reasonable to me that 10 probability happens in months seventy percent ten percent in months sounds like 10 in 2023. there's a 10 chance that Bitcoin hits one million dollars this year but we and we know David that it's a hundred percent probability that Fiat is going to like Trend towards zero over a long enough time span that's every single Fiat system like go chart it over time Ray dalio does this wonderfully right it's like all of them hit a reset Mark and we're like What 50 years into this experiment with uh you know the 1970s and the US dollar so it's gonna happen at some point it's just a matter of when and I don't think people fully understand that and biology does so I'm glad he's getting that message out did you I don't know if we have it in the agenda but you the conversation of the one trillion dollar coin is back on the menu did you say oh yes I I saw some of this yeah this is um we got some takes later in the show but yeah so the the the establishment has resurfaced the possibility of minting a one trillion dollar coin what does that tell you I mean I'm sure that was a snippet in balaji's uh video too I think he's brought that up actually um well that's that bank failures biology capitulating on his bet but not really he still thinks he's going to be right in the long term David we talk about coinbase for a minute they are going International what does that mean the coinbase International Exchange has launched this is up and running uh offering Bitcoin and ether Perpetual future settled in uscc with up to 5x leverage to institutional clients and people ineligible jurisdictions outside of the US so coinbase enters the international game uh just at a high level Ryan like what do you think about this what's your take I think they're not putting their eggs in the U.S basket anymore not at least not all of them yeah this is smart and the other thing I think is like wow I'm an American and uh if you're in the US if you're American listening to this episode you don't have access to these products because your government won't let you you live in a financial prison that will not allow you it doesn't think that you are able to handle coinbase Bitcoin out of perpetuals yeah and that kind of sounds like big boy toys so this is like this is not an unregulated um Marketplace that they're running this is um you know in the EU uh they can they can offer this sort of thing and so but and they can't do that in America it's sad I think my take on this is this is really bullish for coinbase because we know that they're like the FTX US versus FTX back before we thought it knew it was a fraud FTX uh International dominated in spot revenue and pert's revenue just like it was just a gargantuan so someone's got to step in basically yeah there's a huge void in the market and so like as bullish for coinbase because coinbase gets to step into that market and service that demand that we know is verifiably there and of all the other uh offshore derivatives exchanges that has ever that have all come and gone in the world of crypto this is the first time that we have seen a meaningful entrenched established player that people trust that operates by the rules and operates in the in the light not in the shadows and so it's bullish for coinbase I also think this bullish for this industry because finally we have a legitimate player to fill that void and we have a legitimate player answering towards that demand so so it's bullish for two reasons yeah at some level the uh the crypto exchange game is very much about just outlasting everyone else yeah I mean I throw Kraken in this category too of like just over a decade of servicing crypto and just not necessarily being fastest right but just being the most secure most stable most predictable like doing the core things really well and at the end of the day the FTX is they burn out I mean like being fast is a huge liability in this industry capital I think low and slow game uh plays out real well in crypto yeah the tortoise not here um David there's an entire episode about this with Tom Duff Gordon who's the VP of international policy that we put out you guys will catch that on the feed we'll include a link in the show notes as well also some more news from coinbase uh do you remember they uh they picked a fight with Gary Gensler they they they're bringing the SEC to court what's this tweet say David here's an update on that yeah so they got a response from the court so the third Circuit Court just issued a text only order directing the SEC E2 filed response to our mandamus petition I hate legal talk within 10 days is that how do you pronounce it and what does that mean I no I don't mandamus let's go with that anyway someone can someone the lawyer the SEC has to respond to coinbase's petition that they filed last July in 2022 in the next 10 days because coinbase said they were going to take the SEC to court if they didn't uh and so at the direction of the Court the respondent is ordered to file any answer to the petition within 10 days of the date of this order um so Gary you got nine days from the time that this episode releases if you're hearing us you got nine days to reply to this uh all right David what do we have coming up next a bunch of stuff Ryan we got venmo bringing crypto walls to 60 million Americans we've got eigenlayer stage one main net set to launch we got the sui maynet again pull out the number of the market cap that you think that it is we got an axillar announcement and then also the newest Zak xbt victim just dropped so all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of our fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask who not only makes the show possible but also makes web 3 jargon easy to comprehend so if there's ever a word that Ryan or I use that is a crypto word that is confusing to you metamask has built metamask learn at learn.metamask.io which is a place to get onboarded into the world of web 3 not just for you bankless listener but you builder of a crypto company that needs to onboard your new employees to get them to understand what your other employees are talking about also send them here let's go here for metamask learning about crypto is hard until now now introducing metamask learn an open educational platform about crypto web 3 self-custody wallet management and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto metamask learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand giving you actual practical experience for navigating web 3. the purpose of metamask learn is to teach people the basics of self-custody and wallet Security in a safe environment and while metamask learn always takes the time to Define web 3 specific vocabulary it is still a jargon-free experience for the crypto curious user friendly not scary metamask learn is available in 10 languages with more to be added soon and it's meant to cater to a global web3 audience so are you tired of having to explain crypto Concepts to your friends go to learn.menimask.io and add metamask learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web 3. arbitrim 1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to arborstone Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arboretum.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free David this is absolutely huge no one's talking about it venmo is bringing crypto wallets the gateway to crypto wallets anyway to 20 million Americans do you want to hear the uh Ryan Sean Adams hype tweet about this before we get into what happened straight into my veins all right let's go okay venmo is now allowing its 60 million customers to withdraw directly to a non-custodial crypto wallet exit the banks and go bankless fintech has become a gateway to crypto crypto is quietly eating the world just no one is noticing because it's a bear Market that's the take here there's a lot of words in that tweet that I like man but tell us what really happened ground Us in reality what's what's going on with uh with venmo when we get past the hype tweets here introducing crypto transfers for venmo customers what does that mean the big news here is that venmo's no longer is a place to buy crypto assets but you can now make Ledger updates to these crypto assets because these things are money and you need to make Ledger updates to money because that's how money work uh so you can send your crypto to other venmo users inside of The venmo Ledger the venmo centralized database Ledger but you sidechain also side chain maybe but you can also make a decentralized open permissionless blockchain Ledger update by sending your crypto assets to another wallet this is just basically venmo doing payments so which isn't any surprise but it's a very big company with 60 million users make taking on chain Ledger updates of ether transfers and stablecoin transfers in using our blockchain payment rails and so this is all rolling out to customers May of 2023. I know it's like it's a small deal because yes we can we can now transfer crypto we've all we've already been transferring crypto but now venmo 60 million people are able to transfer crypto using venmo so big I think it's the big thing here is to non-custodial wallets that's the exit right like this is like defy mullet thesis playing out which is basically like fintech provides a user interface for a crypto which is more difficult but it's all built on top of those ledgers The decentralized Ledger of um ethereum Bitcoin other cryptocurrencies and now we can hold our own private keys so our job I think as a crypto Community is to get those 60 million people into bankless wallets that's what we got to go do next we gotta go do that really shut the gates before they shut the gates where they stop letting us David got main net season here who's going to mainnet this week coming up first in a main net season we got eigenlayer so eigenlayer has been extremely hyped this is the topic of restaking I can layer really opened up the door to the concept of restaking and so they are launching their main net stage one stage one main net uh two soon TM they said they've got over 9 000 submissions and with interest between 0.18 and 30 000 eth to all begin doing restaking things to restake for other networks uh and so what is restating stage for people right I'm so glad you asked Ryan restaking is when you stake your East to ethereum and then you stake it again it's a mistake do you have further questions okay so does that mean I get like I could stake it twice in ethereum or am I stinking in somewhere else what does that mean so restaking are you familiar with merge mining I know some listeners aren't so I'll answer the question anyways merge mining is when you have an Asic like a Bitcoin Asic and you use your Asic to mine Bitcoins but you could also mine another Network at the same time that operates on the same hashing algorithm so if you're if you're mining for Bitcoin but you're just doing a shot 250 256 mining algorithm you can also simultaneously mine for another chain because it uses the theme hashing algorithm restaking is the same concept for ethereum proof of state so you've taken for a token exactly either exactly so you stake your ether to ethereum but then instead of also when you stake here ether to ethereum you are signing up for slashing conditions if you propose an invalid block you get slashed if you missed your block slot you get marginally penalized there are certain slashing conditions that come with the responsibility of being an ether holder an ether Staker and restaking unless you sign up for new slashing conditions for new networks completely new networks another layer two uh an oracle Network literally anything and so this is why when I when I just leave it open-ended and like let you stake it again it's apparent it's an intentionally open-ended you can stake it to any network that needs security just by signing on for new slashing conditions for all of this you're not just signing up for new slashing conditions because that doesn't sound too fun you're signing up for rewards as well right getting paid for it exactly and so the risk is the slashing but the reward is basically if you have a 4.5 um APR on ether staked in that protocol you can also take that staked eth and you can use it to secure another protocol now you have some risk there of course but then you get some reward right for that so this is really cool this is like ether is an internet Bond I think we're gonna do entire episodes on this kind concept of restaking the future because it is that big for eth as a monetary unit and also for like the entirety of of cryptocurrency I mean it's going to shake everything up if this is successful I think yeah and if bankless listeners minds are boggled and you have further questions I have great news for you an article that I wrote went out on the bank list newsletter Thursday yesterday or the time of of listening which are kind of the theme is like the big questions that restaking brings to the table that eigenlayer brings to the table and so I explain restaking in further detail and I got I go through what I'm calling the restaking meta this is a this is a big deal by the way I would like to explain my flag and say this is a significant deal and in the same way that like once upon a time we had these Arbitrage Bots and then one of these Arbitrage Bots did something weird by like reordering transactions when they were promoting and then we discovered the world of Mev and like our minds were blown and it's like the entire industry shifted this is like restaking and so the whole like I Justin Drake Dan grad vitalik are all talking about how does restaking change the natural equilibrium of the staking industry because we don't know the answer to that question Mev is a good analogy here because there's some good things about it right and uh it increases you know yield and rates and all sorts of things but there's also some scary things about it in the way they could shake things up and change a protocol incentive so we're doing episodes on this too right in the future so we have uh an episode for you but but that was just the first of a couple of main Nets what's this one David Suey the Stewie network uh I think the uh the sister Network to Aptos I think these are like coming around the same time uh the newest shiniest layer one blockchain on on Main Nets uh so they are boasting a whopping number of 100 globally distributed validators to achieve a peak throughput of 300 000 transactions per second with finality inside of that's a lot of transactions 80 milliseconds so these are the numbers the super Speedy layer one um I have not looked under the hood of this thing but I'm going to classify this as what I would call a juice layer one um Ryan have you come up with your number I already knew the number so it's not fair for me to actually say what that number is but I will say it surprised me when I first learned what the number was the market cap of fully diluted evaluation of sui is coming in at 13 billion dollars 13 billion dollars just launched to mainnet so it went from series a series B launched the main net coming in at 13 billion dollars making it the number 66 crypto asset it's got a market cap of 700 million dollars and I would like to point out the discrepancy between the market cap and the fully diluted evaluation I will also say that some layer twos have this discrepancy as well um 13 billion dollars is a fully diluted valuation 700 million dollars is the market cap that means there are 12.3 billion dollars of tokens locked up that have not been issued to the network that has to be absorbed by sufficient buying pressure to justify a 13 million valuation because the way like sui and coin gecko values market cap is based on the circulating Supply which is very low right now right this is a normal thing at the beginning of all networks but it is also a symptom of a VC chain um interestingly something you have to watch out for because when you're buying a suit like a Tsui token you're actually I think you're totally I always value these things as a fully diluted valuation because this is a long term what it's going to be yeah yeah um the series B uh Ryan do you know who led the sui sui series B uh polychain multi-coin one of the big Layer Two investors you know you know the names am I right no uh FTX Ventures um oh which they were forced to sell their stake for 96 million dollars recently which was probably a fumble because if I don't know how they valued it um they thought they made they had to liquidate for 96 million dollars I don't know what the valuation is but like the series B valuation was two billion dollars and we are currently at a 6.5 x of that uh and so I don't know if that was a fumble or not but um I'm assuming they sold it somewhere between two billion dollars and 13 billion dollars but not 13 billion dollars I guess they didn't want to speculate huh uh all right so we got some more releases that the tone that I just gave about sui was totally biased and definitely negative and I'm totally aware of that and that's my deal wait your deal is being biased and negative yeah towards centralized new layer ones totally why because they have to prove themselves or because you hate them or because you're you're bag biased and you're angry that you didn't uh get on those on this deal why why why is your tone negative uh because I believe in constrained layer ones that are not led by feces we've played we've done this before we've done this before we've seen this game we already know how this works many times you definitely have to prove yourself that's a hefty valuation for just shipping to mainnet for an empty ghost train yeah in there all right um axillar what's what's up with them going to mainnet2 that's number three yeah so Axel R is a network it's a IBC Cosmos Network that connects Cosmos to arbitrome so it's a bridge protocol which previously based has been like dubious about and I'm I'm still not totally sold but something's new about Axel art we did a show with them which is why I know about this um they have this thing called GMP General messaging protocol so instead of Ryan instead of sending tokens cross train they send computation cross chains so the tokens stay on the respective chains but the logic passes through chains so there's that seems totally yeah that I I don't have a problem with that the the challenge with um Bridges is kind of like the security risk so if you expose yourself too yeah token security risk and you're saying it's not you know it's not taking that type of risk it can take that type of risk but it does correct in my opinion the correct order of operations which is it passes data which is less valuable and then once you build a secure messaging protocol and you go to mainnet with that and you and that's what you ship for production and let that beat Battle tested in the wild you can then layer tokens on top of that and like this was like the Breakthrough that I has like wait a second why did all the other cross chain Bridges not do that why do they just skip to the tokens what kind of data like what kind of data is it okay so this part of this announcement is this thing called sommelier which is zachimanian from the cosmos ecosystem we've had in on Bank list that's his project sommelier is like this cross chain urine if you will and manages assets cross trains uh but because of the axillary is able to manage so this is actually plugged into arbitrum so this is an arbitrum axelr Cosmos partnership collaboration where sommelier zaki's defy app is able to reach across chains and manage yield and assets across chains yeah manage yields and assets but not actually transfer them transfer them so you're not actually changing the security profile of the assets themselves yes correct huh yeah that's kind of cool right yeah I mean personally I am I mean we know that bridges are going to be necessary with all these chains we need a lot of bridges yeah I think you're just you're more in favor of kind of like trustless Bridges like Layer Two style bridges rather than having kind of a mesh network of dubious multi-sig Bridges and yeah I think it's kind of inside of a bull market inside of fervors that are like our bridge is totally safe uh yeah oops North Korea's got our money now I'm a big fan of putting logic at risk before putting tokens at risk there you go that seems logical David it does um all right and lastly David we've got a mainnet update this is really cool actually from lens so they just launched a layer three or three I believe tell us what they launched and then uh give us the stats yeah so they renamed the layer three and we weren't able to fit it into last week's Roll-Ups this layer three is called mamoka by lens so stani tweets out seven days later lens has finalized 5.4 000 transactions for a total cost of 4.4 dollars that's wow that's for all of the transactions so the average transaction on momoka is .0008 cents with a peak of 25 000 transactions per second that is awesome he says close to S3 pricing that is uh Amazon AWS data storage pricing I needed you for that one well you know what I think this is awesome this is basically me remember lens of course is a web 3 social protocol so web3 social can be cheap now because we have Broadband yeah that's what's so exciting about this and uh I'm really excited about these use case moving forward now that we have very cheap transactions right and now I will uh remind bankless listeners does that 13 billion dollars do we Network look all that great to you stop love right you said you would stop David did I say I would stop no you didn't you said that is the new you actually yeah that's David's deal now so now I feel like I have to compensate by being nicer to the alternative layer ones I don't think you need just for you no I don't need to bring balance to the universe you need to feel compelled to do that how about this uh newest Zack xpt victim one crypto wallet launched 114 dodgy meme coins in 45 days David what's the story here uh yeah so uh there's just a business model I guess in like spinning up random New Meme coins uh stock says every time stolen funds from the scam are sent are then sent to the same deposit address uh so I'm guessing like some like weird new term uh comes up uh and then some this one person makes a token that is that term and then convinces every people to buy it and then make some profit and then rinses and repeats that uh Zach found him because they were using the same wallet wow look at that graphic that is insane I mean let me just remind you listener because and I'm reminding myself buying a meme coin is a choice nice that's a choice that you are making all right you don't have to do this you don't have to invest quote unquote in crypto this way in fact like I think you're diluting yourself if you're calling an investment you take one percent two percent of your crypto portfolio and you do something like this totally d-gen that's one thing but like I think a lot I I don't understand why people are playing these games David when there's active scammers out there just stealing their money we continue to play them yeah uh David speaking of exhausting um the damn tax or is that damn tax I don't know it feels like a damn tax the Dame tax making crypto miners pay for costs they impose on others this is from the White House Biden Administration is proposing a 30 tax on crypto proof of work mining what's your take on this uh negative um because in the same way that I do not think that we should politicize our banking sector I also think that we should not politicize our public infrastructure our energy grids grids who should and can access energy should be not governed by politics and so my take is that if you are deeming some consumption of energy as some reasons to consume energy as legitimate and others illegitimate that is bad and we should not have that involved with our government our government should not be able to dictate who can access energy energy it's real important and so yes it's easy to harp on crypto miners no one likes crypto miners except for the crypto industry and not honestly not even all the crypto industry and so it's really easy to go after crypto miners to pay for the cost that they impose on others quote unquote but it's also not saying that hey anytime you consume electricity for any reason you are increasing the prices for everyone else because there's only so much electricity to go around and that's how Grizz work and so my take on this is this is politicizing our public infrastructure to say that some things are good and some things are bad and that is not the role of government is my take I think that's a controversial take in in some places because they'll say David are you ignoring the um energy problem are you are you ignoring climate change are you doing that sort of thing I I think I agree with your take too uh with one kind of uh caveat or addendum I think you were also saying this is when you're saying uh you don't think we should politicize our energy grid some people will point out well David it's already politicized all right like we regulate solar and wind farms and dirty coal and all of these things and my take is it's different when you regulate the supply versus regulating the Demand right the demand part of things is where I think you get into particular trouble who is the government to decide how energy should be used based on anything right like that seems to be a slippery slope let's say you know the Grinch gets elected as president in 2024 and the Grinch just hates Christmas and puts a 40 tax on Christmas lights right I mean like and bitcoiners make this argument all the time um Christmas lights actually cost more energy to the grid then Bitcoin mining and and so like um you get into the slippery slope of creating kind of like politicizing the demand I would say the demand side of the energy grid and that's where I think you get in trouble but that's also a controversial opinion because people say David you're you're ignoring climate change but I'm not I don't know that you're saying that I think you'd probably be in favor of like no regulating dirty coal plants output of energy producers that's a simple answer there there you go well that's what's happening Biden Administration unfriendly to crypto for sure we got your jobs of the week even in a bear Market crypto companies crypto protocols everybody's hiring I've got a lot of jobs on the board why don't you tell them about the first one in investment analyst intern what is this oh I'd be happy to Ryan uh bankless Ventures has an investment analyst intern job yes bankless Ventures Ryan and I if you have not heard are starting a VC firm with our good friend Ben lakeoff and we need an intern uh I think this is probably one of the sickest jobs that exists in the crypto world so if you are interested in interning for BBC Bank list Ventures uh click the link in the show notes go to or go to bankless.palot.com jobs and I'll be talking a little bit more about Banco centers uh and what I am bullish about and I'm perhaps bullish on vehicles Ventures there you go uh coinbase needs a staff blockchain engineer as well and a staff smart contract engineer a software engineer for mobile and a software engineer front end at Phantom David's dancing now you know he's excited about Premia the web 3 product management architect lead role dinera smart contract engineer uniswap hiring a ton back-end engineer product designer senior mobile engineer we got a whole bunch more over the bankless job boards it's feeling a little bullish on the job boards right now Talent is firing this is a good time to get a job in crypto guys we got a lot coming up David why don't you tell them coming up we got the takes from the week we got some good ones Eric Voorhees on fire this week uh we also got some questions for the nation got three questions from the nation we're going to run through and then we're gonna go to what David and Ryan are excited about hold your breath you'll never guess but first come on let's talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible you know uniswap it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over 1.4 trillion dollars in

contract Wallets on ethereum back with the questions for the week the first one from Scotty how bullish is 4844 for eigen layer it must be referring to eip4844 explain that and tell Scotty why or if it's bullish for eigenlayer okay so eip4844 makes this thing called blob space instead of block space you got blob space which is first class blob space that is just for layer twos to put call data on it's it's layer two blocks it's Layer Two block block space we call it blob space because we're weird um and when we have 4844 layer twos can use all that block space and they can go super fast and so it's it takes off the brakes for layer twos so our current layer twos get better we have more room for more layer twos overall 4844 is bullish for the layer 2 ecosystem it makes ethereum turn the idea and the whole vertical of layer twos into something that's just way better eigenlayer I explained it earlier uh it is not these two things are not directly coupled they are inside of the same sector and so they experience bullishness because both grow but there's no intimate relationship between 4844 in eigenlayer eigenlayer can secure more layer twos it can secure types of layer twos there's a layer 2 Network out there called mantle that's using eigenlayer for data availability but there's no intimate connection between eigen layer and 4844 so it's just like bullish for the sector at large and gives eigenlayer more opportunity but there's another unrelated they're kind of orthogonal then there are eigen layers is like actually just like they're only completely unrelated you're saying they're they're in parallel with each other they're going towards the same goal but eigenlayer is not like waiting for baited breath on 4844 or anything like that got it eigenlayer of course is restaking which we were talking about earlier in this episode um David here's another uh question this one is from jakara here they go my smart friend a smart friend everyone my smart friend said that in 24 months every Visa credit card will have an Associated four three three seven wallet attached to it what is four three three seven and how would that happen by the way I love bankless the bank list Nation given us precise EIP numbers in their question okay these are Advanced questions thank you for these questions the ip4337 first remind everyone the ip4337 Ryan it's not what is this ERC he got me yeah got me it's in ethereum request for comment awesome experience of what these things are extreme Improvement proposal 4844 is dank sharding also a crazy name God no wonder but the difference okay industry but the difference between an EIP which is an ethereum improvement request is it's going to take some code deployed to get it working and an ERC is just let's all agree on a standard yes it doesn't actually require a part a fork a change in the code an underlying protocol so EIP versus ERC that's the difference here VIP hey let's put this bit of code into ethereum ERC is like let's agree that this is the standard that we use add the smart contract layer so yeah yeah like erc20s right famous ERC let's all agree that this is the way we do tokens top top three ERC top three ERC sure yeah I would also put erc4337 in there just since we're going down this Ravel that wasn't asked erc4337 could turn into an EIP I don't think it would be called the ip4337 but like you could take the guts and turn it into an EIP how a bill becomes a law yeah I don't know yeah okay anyway so return to the question my smart friend said in 24 months every Visa credit card will have an Associated for 337 wall attached to it what is 4337 how could that happen four three three seven is account abstraction it's a smart contract wallet uh the uh your smart friend is smart they are paying attention uh so Visa with the leadership of Kai Sheffield has done like primary research and Innovation into smart contract wallets using 4337 on Visa they are applying they're building out a smart contract implementation standard so that they can use it for reoccurring and subscription payments on the Visa Network um I don't know about the idea of every Visa credit card having a smart contract wallet Associated to it but two years is a long time Visa is directly pioneering this effort and that conclusion would make sense I don't have any further information beyond that but we know that Visa is pioneering into the world of smart contract wallets that's what 4337 is so your smart friend is connecting some dots and perhaps know something your smart friend is smart don't know about that timeline but this is a decent prediction it's based in some realities here it's technically possible David you ready to get some takes of the week love it uh we got three uh number one why don't you read this yeah because you don't want to read your own tweet Ryan Sean Adams says you'll never get a country to adopt ether's money in quotes we don't need a country to adopt eth as a money he says we need an economy to adopt eth the largest economy in the world will be built by AI agents oh yeah it's an AI tweet it's an aid yeah it's an AI they'll prefer a digitally native money unencumbered by nation states eth is machine money tell us about that's it that's it I mean the Tweet speaks for itself I I think that uh we have created a program money system that AIS are going to use and AI agents are going to be called become major economic players like AI agents are the future um associations and non-profits and uh corporations they are the a in autonomous remember daos digital autonomous organizations well we needed the a part this is the A Part this is the autonomous party p a i O's basically wow do we just create something here I like so I I am actually less I think it's less important to get America to put eth in a central bank balance sheet because um the robots are going the AIS are going to prefer a programmable money system that has no string that has no Geographic boundaries has no strings attached you don't have to file in Delaware for this thing you spin up private keys in a multi-sig and you've got a dow cooking right like robots aren't going to be able to get bank accounts they can on ethereum all right now hopefully that this all goes well for us David I know we've been talking about AI alignments don't do it not gonna do it eth is machine money though and by the way when I said this um people like you're changing the narrative already I thought it was ultrasound money and people were like oh this is you know World computer to eat this machine money narrative switch I will remind people again like like the internet they all go together like the internet there are many use cases of the internet the internet's just email the internet is like just e-commerce I mean how like of course these are all narratives of the Internet it's like ethereum has many narratives of course it would it has many use cases that's a strength uh and by the way each being machine money makes it even more freaking ultrasound okay that means ultrasound AI money to pay for computation on the ethereum world computer why is that hard so hard to understand I don't know why it's difficult but anyway uh that that's the take David um let's get to another one this is yours can I read it yeah this is just Ryan and David read their own features wow wow we've gotten uh you know but my friends we're just reading our tweets okay no problem David Hoffman uh goes we should create an Anon account so I can read your tweets without really reading your trades open Money systems are public goods the unit of account of money is a public utility when EIP 1559 Burns eth it's growing the value of a very widely distributed public good eip1559 is a public goods mechanism man your brain was thinking about money as well this week uh what do you mean by this hang on you gotta read the other two tweets oh there's more yeah normalized thinking of money systems as public goods we easily understand what happens when money systems break down due to currency devaluing we should understand that increasing the value of money is something universally beneficial to the money system how much investment and reinvestment has ethereum received from eth appreciation how much has been donated to public goods because Heath went from 80 to 4K how many startups and jobs have been created due to the ethereum wealth effect eth is the most important public good so this uh it was inspired by Hayden Adams recent tweet about how we should redirect EIP 1559 East burning away from burning East to public goods and I'm like Hayden no don't do that we've already hey we've already had that discussion B stop thinking that it's not already doing that burning eth is the most credibly neutral thing to do and it's also contributing to public goods the money that invests in this entire economy so that's my thing I get it I get it good take here's a take from Eric Voorhees on a headline that he's reading from a news publication saying a trillion dollar platinum coin could save the US from economic catastrophe in less than a month it would be fast legal and no bigger than a regular coin he goes Eric goes this thank God it would be no bigger than a regular coin what does that even mean what is this headline a trillion dollar platinum coin this is a real thing and it would be fast legal and no bigger than a regular coin yeah just the idea of like it's really important that people know that it wouldn't be bigger like and and we're not going to waste any more metal printing this one trillion dollar wow what would I guess people are thinking it's like you know like a dinner plate size right because it's worth a trillion dollars do you need multiple people to hold ten dollars how heavy is it what's it made out of oh it's made out of platinum it is you're really trying to make this out of platinum what's the point of using a precious metal because like what is the point unforgeable David you can't forge it why not you can print it's not print out a paper this is this is a real conversation so what is the context of the trillion dollar platinum coin that's arising again isn't it right it's because we need a trillion dollars to backstop the banking crisis like this is why this conversation's happening it's the isn't it the um the debt ceiling in Congress again have you been following this David no it's raising its head again again for the I don't know 110th billion it's like a part of our regular Cadence yeah yeah so we're like well rather than have Congress kind of raise the debt ceiling well let's just um have treasury mint a trillion dollar platinum coin that's why this is coming up again right uh I will so for bankless listeners there is a Moment of Zen which is Eric Voorhees being a stand-up comedian unintentionally that is a very logical continuation of this conversation so stay tuned for the very end of the episode for that you can enjoy that all right David what do you bullish on this week I am bullish on bankless Ventures Ryan and I and Ben lakoff are raising a fund Bank list Ventures 30 million early stage fund the the line that I like to get is bankless Media the podcast you're listening to right now teaches you how to explore the frontier and then bankless Ventures gives you the money you need to establish a settlement out there on the frontier uh and so we talked about this a while ago when coindust broke the news before we were really able to like talk about it now but I wrote an article on Bank list banklist.com you can find it it's called why we are launching Bank close Ventures put some of the back story and the ideas and the thesis behind banco's Ventures um people are asking me like okay like what what's the what's the thesis behind banquet centers like what's the deal and the thesis is that Ryan and I have really good deal flow and we're putting it all into bakeless VC there's certain sectors that we of course are looking at um who's going to buy all the layer two block space like we need startups to buy the layer 2 block space uh account abstraction uh the inevitable AI meets crypto intersection like all these things are things that we're looking at but really the idea is because of the position of bankless media we were at the center of crypto put all the friend that we get from the the media Network that we've created into bankless VC so if you're interested in learning more about banklit Ventures and also the inevitable conflicts of interest section which I'm sure some people are curious about uh that is available as a link in the shows yeah and we've got some cool advisors Justin Drake uh coming aboard for this Anthony sassano and I heard you uh pitch in startups to come contact us as well if you're building something really cool in crypto get in touch yeah uh we are mostly full lots of fun but if you are interested in being an LP that window is still open true credit investor all that yes Gary made us do that part the accredited investor part I know sad it's sad it is sad uh Ryan what do you bullish on I am bullish on another accumulation opportunity for uh ether that asset we've been talking a lot about in the show um it's low I think eth the price of eth is low relative to its value maybe it's kind of like fair market value yeah I mean I was just looking you know that website that lists all the um the assets like worldwide assets do you know uh Home Depot the company is worth more than all the Ethan existence that's not right David is Home Depot stock ultrasound is it learning okay like is it like the Cornerstone of the internet Financial system can Home Depot stock be restaked to secure other decentralized I'm just like it's silly when you zoom out and you look at this context and um yeah etha's in one of those places again it's pretty close I I'm not going to say it's exactly how I felt about this asset in like um 20 I would say 2019 end of 2019 and early 2020 where it's just like oh we're definitely coming back we're a debt like look at all the stuff that's being built and we went on kind of basically like a a rampage of like eth is undervalued ethos like it's undervalued hello it's undervalued I'm not quite there but I'm getting closer I mean Home Depot David all right the when Ryan in 8 to 20 years when Home Depot stock becomes a security token on ethereum and also collider until the wagon layer I'm gonna come back and be like actually you can restake Home Depot yeah you know what though what's cool is um these there's accumulation opportunities where other people get a chance to get on board into crypto and I'm so glad we had we have these it's like it's you have the opportunity to be a seller not a tourist when other people aren't looking you're doing your research you're seeing what's going on here you're bullish on it you could take a very risky bet um I think eth is kind of like that right now and uh it's a good time to buy in my opinion not Financial advice David we gotta meme of the week what are we looking at uh I mean uh the week here we go so this I think was a great uh illustration of the AI alignment problem and so that particular one yeah you sent this to me Ryan so uh this is the AR alignment problem uh so that little there's this okay for the podcast listeners there is this I don't even know what you call it a monster a lovecraftians like it's spaghetti like Monster with teeth and then all of these tentacles are converging to like put up this puppet face so that it's making this face because that's what you want to interact with that's like Chad GPT so like the interface that you need to like talk to this monster of like tentacles and eyeballs and sensors and all that stuff and then he makes a face and then the face outputs this like little nugget which is like your input into chat gpg it's like hey uh what is like you know information that I want and then it spits out exactly what you want behind the scenes there's this like Cthulhu that is making that happen and it's unsupervised learning unto like the in the back in the Black Box you don't know what the hell's going on and then you have this face that it's making because we trained it to make that face but the face is just like a puppet of Cthulhu and then it spits out this little nugget which is exactly a little bit of gold it's like here no happy smiley face oh happy smiley face here you go it's uh RL HF so reinforcement learning with human feedback is how it kind of learns that's a smiley face right uh David I thought memes were supposed to be funny this is making me sad this wasn't a meme this was a rug pull this was uh education about the alignment okay yeah this is nice I mean it's into an alignment podcast I hope this is not true is the bottom line right I hope this is just an artist rendition and we need to work to make it not true but the truth is the truth is from everything that we've done so far in this AI alignment series is we have no idea the nature of this back there thing that we've built we don't know if it's a lovecraftian Monster yeah or if it's just a friendly unicorn or if it's a zombie that we can kind of like train it to do what we want or whether it's some kind of like an early stage Consciousness like we have no idea and that is the scary all of the above yeah so around here at um uh Montenegro I've done two AI conversations right now uh which I'm gonna uh throw over the podcast editors and underhand to you um the line that has stuck with me which I did a full-length podcast with this guy where the reason why AI alignment problem is an issue is because it is simply a reflection of human alignment as in when we look into that black box of AI we don't understand what's going on and then people see doom and people see misalignment is because it's actually not a black box it's a mirror and we are looking back at ourselves and be like man that's a human problem which the monster is us the monster is us which does not make me feel any better on that note we should get to the Moment of Zen much more yeah tee this up for this is Eric Voorhees giving a speech as part of a debate a classic speech from 2018 I think you're gonna enjoy this gotta let you know before we fade into that risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot next let's discuss why Fiat is bad money why should we care about cryptocurrencies and their attributes when we already have Fiat feel works pretty well right it's got pyramids and government buildings printed on it so you know it's valuable also it is backed by paper paper can be burned if you're cold in the winter there's its intrinsic value try that with gold but a skeptical Observer should know that Fiat money is an absolute scam and something altogether inappropriate for an ethical market-based society as I like to say you cannot have a free market when the most important good money itself is centrally planned and controlled Fiat money in a market economy are mutually exclusive Concepts like oil and water they can certainly be mixed up together when force is applied but they will naturally separate and dispel one another over time indeed the average lifespan of Fiat is less than 50 years the US dollar only became Fiat in 1971. that's less than the length of William Shatner's career and as it happened last week he announced that he has started to mine Bitcoins as well [Laughter] [Applause] regardless when examining its specific properties as money most ways Fiat is unimpressive first is not scarce it is systematically created out of thin air with no limit on Supply nor can supply even be known Fiat is willed into existence by politicians and Banks because printing money enriches the printer at the expense of the public who holds the previously printed money the phenomenon is known as inflation inflation or currency debasement Fiat also struggles with durability your Fiat will only last so long as your bank permits and even then it slowly loses its value your bank can destroy your Fiat with the click of a button ask a cypriot ask an Argentinian how durable Fiat is with Fiat you are ever dependent on a third party with your wealth is that an attribute of money that you find attractive some people are comfortable with it because they trust their government but requiring trust in politicians seems a poor Foundation upon which to build a prosperous Society finally Fiat is not nearly as portable as Bitcoin try to send an international wire right now you can't because it's after five o'clock how quaint is that you can try tomorrow morning as long as it's not Sunday because apparently God doesn't want you to use the financial system on the Sabbath but even when successful you'll Discover it takes three to five days for your wire to arrive you often have to physically go to the bank to do this you have to fill out a form on paper while someone making 15 an hour takes that info and types it back into a computer why do people put up with this nonsense indeed it is faster to stretch strap cash to an anvil and fed exit to Tokyo than it is to send an international wire do you really think that that system is going to out-compete Bitcoin in an Open Marketplace and you can only send Fiat if you have permission try to send it to a family member in Russia you'll be censored want to donate to relief effort perhaps in Venezuela Too bad you'll be censored are you sending a suspicious amount your payment will be blocked and you better get ready for questioning or outright confiscation yep The orwellian Nanny state is alive and well and fiat currency is one of its most Insidious tentacles Fiat has these poor monetary attributes because it is a tool and appendage of the state it exists to serve the state not to exist Market participants its attributes as money are intentionally constrained and inferior so as to siphon wealth to the state through debasement and to surveil and control the behavior of the king's subjects remember that Fiat means value by decree not by Merit
