it's like going from the nation-state environment of uh who can command and control the best going to a digital nation-state environment which is who has the best carrots uh and which has got to be a sense and respond like who can sense the needs of their constituents the best and respond to the needs of their constituents the best welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero i'm talking with tracheopteryx he has been on a number of podcasts talking about very big cerebral topics about dowse dow coordination um how dao coordination mimics nature and this is all stuff that just really gets my mind going and i just love all of these very just like far out subjects as you can tell if you've been listening to the layer zero podcast so we talk about how the one of the most underappreciated lens for viewing this crypto industry is one of biology how dows will have biomimicry in their organizational structure and how just uh computers will become part of humans as we know like we're building out a.i but it's not going to be external to us it's going to be a part of us like our dows and so we are just creating these technologically enabled futures these technologically enabled humans uh with ai but also with daos and dao's being one of these stories we talk about how uh daos can help change society from being one of command and control to one of being sense and respond and how does that change culture when our organizations our institutions don't have this scarcity mentality of resource competition but instead have this competition of how best can they sense the needs of their constituents and respond to the needs of their constituents with the best possible carrot there's so many different angles of this conversation that i thoroughly enjoyed with tracheopteryx so i think you will also enjoy this conversation as well so let's go ahead and get right into this conversation but first a moment to talk about some of these

how's it going good man how are you oh fantastic fantastic uh you've been on the uh the podcast circuit lately uh and i think everyone is uh realizing that you have a lot of interesting things to say uh and so i'm bringing you on this podcast because i think i can do it better let's do it that's great thank you i've said it a few times on the show before but i think the most under appreciated lens for viewing this industry is biology uh and that's why i appreciate your takes the most is because we're looking towards nature for guidance more than just trying to you know top down architects you know create this thing without any you know kind of feeling around in the dark right like crypto it's a new frontier we don't really know what we're doing here we get some semblance of an idea but i think looking to nature is one of the best guiding guiding lights that we have in this industry i'm wondering your thoughts on that to kick this conversation going absolutely and just in general i i'm i'm always looking at ways to expand my perspective and like step back and see things from another another angle and i think you know we can get so caught up in what we're doing it's just everything's within this one little space and becomes tautological or something and it's all just in here and then you know biology is one bigger lens we can look at and there's many many others to step back and you know reframe the context of what we're doing do you remember uh like a first early moment or aha moment where you were like hey this crypto thing relates to nature pretty well do you remember the first realization you had with that uh yeah let's see um i think it was basically right right away like i um um i've always been interested in you know developmental psychology and and bio and physics and various sciences and i tend to like see echoes of things everywhere and so i think um you know one of the things that really drew me to to crypto is dowse that was the thing that really from the beginning that that idea and to me that was always part of a kind of i guess biological framing like at least how i how it resonated with me and was it strictly like the org structure of daos or how how dao's coordinate you thought was going to be like nature mimicking nature in some way or or what was the angle well i guess just i've never really agreed with this idea that we're different than other things you know like like it's all like okay so we have computers and we have technology but really that's just another extension of the phenotype that's another part of of this organism um it's all kind of where you draw the circle and how you draw a boundary around something what you define the self like it gets very confusing you look at bees or at ant colonies or at sophophores or all of these different or the bacteria in your gut or whatever and this notion of identity really melts away as soon as you kind of interrogate it and so um yeah like the human condition of of of trying to create things and working together like i i ran up started a bunch of companies and ran teams and things like that and and to me it's always very much about that interpersonal piece and um that always felt like part of some expanding mammal brought set or something you know it's always just some like piece of turbulence and so you know the idea that a dao could put put this structure together that can hold these types of interpersonal dynamics and this creative energies you know was the kind of the the first thing i thought when i saw them yeah um i can't i can't remember where i heard this first but uh if you if you look like a at a beehive or an ant colony and you're looking at like the bees and the ants the organism itself isn't the individual ant or the individual bee it's the hive itself like uh it's it's which it makes it intangible which is kind of cool like there is no actual center of a beehive of the organism it's just like the whole many many individual moving parts uh and when you talk about the self like you can even get into the human body and talk about our individual cells like we have our body which is our container but our cells come and go our brain cells come and go uh and like and you alluded to it like your your gut microbiome which is a very critical part of who you are literally is not part of you uh and how have you extended this concept of what is alive to daos like what is alive with a doubt well you it's you can very easily get into kind of like semantic corruption here by by stretching that the definition now but let's not worry about that for a second and just play with it and so you can think about like the dao within you can think that just like you say like it's a little bit more obvious when you look at a beehive but it's the same problem when you look at a human being you know there's a notion of cellular psychology or you know and the bacteria and all of these different pieces that that create this colony that is me um and that has a lot of the same kind of relationships dynamics as a organization has and you can look at a a company like apple or you know and you can you can think of that as a life form you really you really can the definition of life is pretty flexible and you can at least it's worth you know the curious thought experiment of thinking about it that way and think about what it if you draw the boundary of life around that organism what does that do and how does that function and then around a dow and just keep drawing different circles and seeing how they they compare yeah the the way that i'd try and like understand uh if something is alive or not is is uh if it is self-interested in its own well-being right and so apple certainly self-interested in its own well-being right and will take both defensive and aggressive moves in order to make sure that it stays alive and so like you know if it's self-interested and it's actionable uh it is alive like whether it's like a cell or a company uh or a dow uh and and i think like when when life begins like when some sort of life form forms like you we started off as singular cellular organisms but then we started depending on like newer structures onto these cells that could sense the the world around it right like receive inputs and allow it to process data uh and so i think what a lot of like what your work has been doing over at coordinate is like building out like one of the first appendages that allows dows to like receive inputs to make sure that the dao can know about the information that it needs to know in order to self-perpetuate its own ideas into the future how do you feel about this yeah i love it i mean whenever i'm building things i'm thinking about biology and science fiction and [ __ ] spirits and all the different weird things you know like like that's the the terrain i'm i'm i'm walking and um so like with with coordinate yeah i think of it like that like an organ you know um and particularly like i love this idea of sense and respond which i i think i heard from zach anderson first who's a co-founder of coordinate which is a totally different kind of modality for operating you know rather than um just command and control this this kind of dichotomy is one i often use like where most corporations and nations about come in and control this idea that wait we can actually work in a different way which is like listen and react you know sense and respond and like what did what do tools look like what do apps look like that are designed in that way and to support that kind of interpersonal anti-rival risk behavior do you have any just thoughts about like what society looks like when it migrates from a command and control dominated version of coordination versus a sense and respond like version of coordination like if we all if we all shift on the spectrum from commanding control to a sensory response like how would society be different well i think the first thing is that we won't like there's we won't all do that right and like there's always just a super heterogeneous diverse population of people there's always going to be people that are in a rival risk mentality there's always going to be people that um you know are in scarcity ideas and and that's okay i think it's but to the to the point of your question i think there it does become a threshold where there's enough people that are starting to work in this sense and respond uh abundance mindset um that things really do start to change and um and i really like uh one of my you know favorite thinkers ken wilber talks about you know in the in the 60s there was a similar kind of big mindset change uh the counter-cultural movement you know which he looks at as being this kind of developmental tear this kind of pluralistic intelligence or the sensitive uh intelligence and um and because about like you know 10 of the world around that time started to have this level of of development it created these huge systemic changes and i think we're at a similar you know not just me a lot of uh people i've read and others think that we're at a kind of similar fulcrum right now and that this new level of development this new intelligent kind of integral or sense and respond or non-rivalrous is starting to get enough there's enough people with running this operating system you know that things like you know the dows and the that we work in happen uh you you indicated that like the whole command and control type of uh uh modality is uh one of the scarcity mindset is that is that true or or like could you go into that why why is command and control a scarcity mindset and why is censored in spawn abundance yeah that's a good question so i can't say that they are both like synonymous but i think they tend to align more so like what's the point right like it kind of goes back to that just that question what's the point um what what world view are we operating from you know if you're operating from a world view where you're going to die unless you take this other dude's [ __ ] um you know a command and control like program makes a little bit more sense it's like let me control all the variables make sure that i'm safe you know create a strategy that i can then execute to get the reward and then i'm good and the thing about those strategies first is that they're really closed it's like in my little brain my little view of things like i can control all the variables and like probabilistically i'm going to get the thing that i want and that's going to be good like when i get that scarce resource now i've won but we know that that's never really the case you just want another scarce resource and another scarcity and that doesn't actually solve the problem you're trying to save so you come from a different world view um one that's more about the journey than the destination sense and respond makes a lot more sense um and i think it tends i have to think about this more but i i think you could use sense and respond in a scarcity dynamic as a type of strategy um but um i think it's more natural fit for different kinds yeah a sense and respond organism whether it's like something as small as a bee or us humans or as something as large as like an organization corporation or nation state sense and respond seems to have connotations of like empathy and yes cooperation uh and certainly certainly i think it would be i think i could say without without you know too much evidence that people the culture of today uh is we are looking for institutions and corporations that have more empathy i think it's something that a lot of like perhaps the left but like has really nailed down but i think we're all kind of looking for it is that like these ultra capitalists like late stage capitalist uh large corporations are all lacking empathy right and maybe it's because they're all operating on this command and control paradigm and they don't have the sense and respond paradigm uh so there's a thought if you have any reflections on that one go ahead yeah um go for it yeah yeah i think that's very true and there's a lot of ways to look at that um first of all it can be strategically advantageous advantageous to like numb your own empathy if you're in a really hostile environment so like there's nothing wrong first is like you know if people haven't developed empathy or they're functioning in a kind of low empathy environment like they don't want to cast any blame or shame they're like that that can be the best thing you that that person needs to do um and you know i think a lot of the systemic issues in the world do come from a lack of empathy i mean what are we talking we're talking about coordination issues how do we how do we share resources together and if you if you know if we're playing the resource game resource war game you know then um you know we're really depleting the resources on the planet too fast and i think um you know it also goes to notions of divine masculine and feminine and i don't mean female sex male sex i mean you know the idea of you know recepting and transmitting and listening and speaking and um and the world has been really dominated by a kind of masculine energy for the past long time i don't know 1000 years or something and that's manifested through nations conquest and corporations conquest and command and control are both these very like you know emissive like controlling ideas of subjugating uh you know things um whereas sensing is more receptive it's more more the divine feminine and also just more the feminine energy that each of us can source within ourselves that the world is in kind of dire need for which also tends to be more empathic because you're you're listening uh do you know if we've ever had a paradigm of sense and respond before uh you alluded to like the counterculture revolution in the 60s and how that became you know a came a very strong component of society but i don't think it necessarily resulted in a complete phase shift from command and control to sense and respond do you know if we've ever had a society of that was dominated by sense and respond it's a really good question i mean i think um from the little i've read about you know tribal communities um i think there's some examples in those types of of networks where it is much more like you know you have a really strong matriarchy and a really strong patriarchy and they both have different roles in the community and then you have shaman and you have outliers and you know all together the tribe becomes this kind of organism that can work in balance with the world so sense and response is much more about balance like um so much of the command and control stuff that's happened has been about the opposite of balance about conquest you know expansion by all means cancerous growth by all means um but that's part of that you know critical operating system change is to get into a mode of balance with the environment in each other right so uh if you're if i'm interpreting your answer correctly you just said like we haven't had like a strong dominance of sense and response since we were hunter-gatherers which was you know many many many thousands of years ago is basically before we invented any meaningful amount of technology right like the first version of technology we really invented was the agricultural revolution and it's been command and control ever since it's been concrete it's been a resource game has been playing the resource game aggressively ever since then yeah that's i mean i certainly don't have a comprehensive knowledge of everything here but that sounds right in a lot of ways and you know i was thinking about this the other day talking to kevin owaki like um that um you know from from the moment of agriculture like there's some interesting research showing that like when agriculture was developed we stopped being hunter-gatherers we started having uh you know need to be rooted in certain areas and then all of a sudden this notion of paternity certainty became important whereas before there was much more kind of free love and and families like raise the children's tribes raise the children's together all of a sudden now you have property and you need to staff that property and you staff that property with your children and so you need to know who your children are you know all of a sudden there's the notion of labor in a workforce right at the beginning and i think you maybe we can like look there's this kind of you know all of a sudden masculine imbalance that emerges oh that's super interesting right okay so going from hunter-gatherers to agricultural revolution is we stopped moving around this society and the action of stopping and like planting ourselves into one place on the earth because that's where we would need to grow food right like you can't move your farm so all of a sudden we stopped being nomadic and we stopped we started being fixed and that allowed people to have more things uh because uh then we didn't have to move with them we could just keep them you know in our huts in our houses uh and then we established property uh and then that turned the resource game into like the next level right where it's it's more than the things we can carry on our backs it's like the things around us uh and then all of a sudden that kicked off a much more uh aggressive and less holistically coordinated uh version of society is is this the right conclusion to to be tracking on let's go with this because i think this there's a lot of far out ideas that come from this so we can say that there's been this kind of arc in in history that has started from that transmission transition to agriculture where all of a sudden you're like locked in a location all the way to let's say even 2020 where i love this thing bellagi wrote which was that 2020 was the first year that we became digital first citizens you know yeah and i think that that was this kind of germination event of of um of kova that forced us all to like move into this new territory of the digital network and the crazy thing is it is that that starts to change that constraint of place because we've been really stuck into this notion of place and property for ten thousand years um and so if we wanted like let's say that that's the arc that we've just come to the end of a ten thousand year arc in human evolution and now there's this opportunity to move around more you know like but move around in this digital space which has totally new properties and you know when i think about this comes kind of goes back to dao's dows you know this idea of cloud nations too that will be able to create these digital societies and like look there's lots of questions about that but we're already creating them but one cool thing is a kind of modular politics where um you know if daos or digital communities can start to intermediate uh between governance a legacy government like nation states and corporations and start to take more power and hold more power which i think they will because they can out compete financially in many ways then we'll be able to have this ability to choose our allegiance very easily without moving our physical location which is like actually goes back to this interesting idea i learned about a number of years ago seasteading by patrick friedman was this really i the idea of the kind of modular politics that the reason that we're [ __ ] is that you know we can't move very easily the cost of moving is so high so you can't change your politics but if everybody would live on a boat and we just tied the boats up into a giant island in the ocean then you could just sail your boat to a different political island if you wanted to to like you know but we don't have to have boats we can just do it on on blockchain right right yeah the uh every single dow or every single like nation state in the cloud is inherently opt-in right like nothing can force you to become a part of it this is something that's also in the in the sovereign individual where all these nation states compete on monopolies of violence as in like who can have the strongest armies because if you have the strongest army then you control the world uh and something i actually got out of bitcoiners in their reaction to their very very strong reaction to covid is that like a lot of countries started like locking in their citizens like you couldn't leave australia for for like two years almost uh without like a lot of friction and really the only people that could leave australia are the wealthy or the people that are wealthy enough to afford it you know being able to like lock themselves into a hotel for two weeks because that was a quarantine protocol and australia wasn't the only one that was like a lot of countries like that uh and like as the arc of nation states comes to an end they get more aggro with controlling their property and one of their nation state properties is there humans that live inside of them like that's where they get their tax money from and so the arc of nation states is as they kind of come to the end of their lifespan they start to clamp down harder and harder and harder on taxes and on their citizens uh meanwhile and i think we all kind of feel like we're coming towards the end of the nation's sake art nation state arc meanwhile we're creating these digital nation states which are inherently opt-in which we can choose to align with based on our own personal values and one of my talks at denver was about how web 3 protocols are going to compete for our love because of this opt-in forcing function they can only compete with our love for our love because they don't have any uh they only have carrots they don't have any sticks right and so it's inherently uh a sense and respond competitive environment it's like going from the nation-state environment of who can command and control the best going to a digital nation-state environment which is who has the best carrots uh and which has got to be a sense and respond like who can sense the needs of their constituents the best and respond to the needs of their constituents the best yeah i mean it's a much more sovereign kind of place to be right and um i think you know you can look back and you can see this kind of trajectory of these different dominant coordination methodologies basically like or phenomena like religion for a long time was the dominant coordination story on the planet like most of the human interpersonal relationships were mediated through that fiction religion um but that didn't go away when the nation state started to rise to dominance like just it started to take some of that coordination function into its sphere and then the same thing happened with the privatization of so many services through corporations you know private prisons and private services everything like that and i think we're gonna start to see the same thing now with uh on with web three and for instance privatization of governance and politics and public goods uh can all be better you know coordinated through these substrates it's a really big claim right and and i i love the idea that makes sense to me if we zoom out and look at this industry from the 100-year time frame it's like oh yeah dallas will eventually be able to coordinate global resources and coordinate governance way better than nation states but then it feels like one of those things where it's like you know step one create a dow step two question mark question marks question mark step three uh we control the world like this this is the step two thing i'm really confused about don't worry about the details man we got this [Music] okay do you have any ideas that's like what is like the first few steps we need in order to actually unbundle the role of the nation state yeah i mean i have some ideas and i think um i think important thing is like we're really early right like so we're having all these grand ideas and that's great you know that's that's it's inspiring make podcasts yeah like like people are asking me to talk about this stuff i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm saying i'm just sounding [ __ ] and like there's all these beautiful sci-fi fantasy ideas and like those are great those are let's not forget about the value of those and look why are they coming up because we're seeing some like some hook some anchor in this stuff that we don't know [ __ ] about yet but we're like maybe maybe maybe right um but now i think one of the things that i'm starting to do this work with a couple people now is to really look at um the um the problems like in in really really really high detail like um like daniel schmuckton booker berger's work in jordan hall on the metacrisis and so working with those guys and like like can we define um the nature of the kind of systemic product because it's so con it's so hard to figure out like um we that's a long rabbit hole but just defining what the problems are and then what the design constraints are for solving them and then seeing like hey do dows like can we provably say that daos have the mechanisms or can they have they shown um potential for solving these problems because we're stuck in this um you know bad nash equilibrium right now where you know in this nation state you know resource war corporate world that we can't get out of do dow's really fundamentally change that equilibrium um and we have to actually do the work of proving that so okay we're like it's still kool-aid time that's fine not gonna knock it it's great i drink it too and we have to like really drill down now right right um i'm gonna ask you the same question like where do we start like what is the first thing that we do with that what's the first w that dao's have that's going to like wake up the rest of the world to be like okay that's a real thing now let's see um well i think we're already starting to see some of them you know like um like these massive kind of flash dows that coordinate to buy historical relics and and other things like that i think that's that's interesting but that's just like kind of like one little like oh wow what's that um and we're seeing these you know defy dows that are you know doing these incredibly financial things they're creative it's like oh that's interesting um but you know we're not solving major governance problems yet right and i wouldn't suggest that you apply a dow to the actual governance of a political territory yet but um i think we're going to start seeing some uh some impact there like you could imagine some cases where you use dao's or web3 coordination to start to become part of it not just through like donating to ukraine but like through some type of decision making or some type of public policy sense-making um i think that potentially one way that we start to really see more provable goods yeah i was talking with uh tyrone on layer zero and he had the idea that um the the first way we do this is actually through the financial industry uh so like um financial industries all lawyers and contracts so like you put money into the financial industry it goes through a lawyer written contract and then it goes out and turns into finance right like all finance is is the combination of contracts and money that's why smart contracts are really cool that's how defy exists but importantly like a lot of uh he he talks about how like a lot of the financial industry can be unbundled and like um uh put on and and start to use like crypto rails and not and i'm not talking about just creating defy like like disintermediating wall street what i'm talking about is like some certain like financial contracts need to have the price of something in the in the contract right and so the price of something could be in that contract could reference something like a uniswap oracle right and then it's the uniswap oracle that becomes the arbiter of truth uh and we can start to like you know expand on this and all of a sudden the financial industry is being made easier because it's tapping into the truth of defy rather than just like hard-coding it into their manually inputted smart contract uh and then all of a sudden the the financial industry back end starts to become whatever this date on ethereum is and then and then we kind of go from there what are your thoughts on that yeah so i mean kind of like the disruptive innovation model where like it just we're starting to do work in this space that you know isn't the same territory that the traditional model has has taken and it all of a sudden becomes useful and it's a better product and they start to use it for things and all of a sudden eats away at the whole system i can see that happening sure yeah well your talk at east denver was really interesting because you you gave a bunch of like um i don't know what like like it felt like like a scan of an organism right and uh like really unbundled and you could see the different parts of the organism and the functioning roles and you map that out into like a metaphor it's like well this part of the organism is like this part of the dao right and this part of the organism is like this part of the dao uh and one thing i think that we're seeing is that like daos are kind of a little bit of the the epicenter for a lot of things in crypto like first we had d5 protocols and then separately we had dows and then all of a sudden in like the uh the defy summer what that really was was the smashing of these two particles together it was like let's put the d5 protocol into the dow and like have this same thing right and we're actually seeing element finance do that right now so they just launched their token uh so now the element defy application is now being put together with the element dao but they're also pending on an nft project and so now like what is element is it really a d5 project because now it's also a dao but it also has its own nft ecosystem and so now like this dao has like three appendages like it's got the prefrontal cortex which is the dao that's the decision making uh then you've got like the the digestive system which is how the dowgus energy which is the defy app uh then you have like the the cultural expression which is like the nft thing uh and so like these are the three things and and i think like for every single thing that we invent in this crypto space like the dow will be at the epicenter and we'll just keep on like appending all of these things into how and then boom we have an organism that is like a sense and feel and respond type organism uh yeah that's thoughts on that and you can can you also kind of just give listeners who haven't listened to your uh your east denver talk just like a taste of what that was about yeah i was talking a lot about different like biological models for decision making and mines basically like um like you can look at so the amazing thing about web3 is we have this like kind of unconstrained networks like you can all these different people can come together and work on things in whatever way you want in a much much more free and open topography than we're used to in a corporation let's say uh was very strict often roles and reporting and everything but now is everybody swarming together and do something and so like what type of nature of mind does this create like you know you can look at the corporate uh kind of model for a mind and i kind of uh use the metaphor of a robot there where you have like a sensor processing unit and you have sensors that send information up the direct report to the processor makes decisions and then sends electrical impulses to the actuators that then execute it exactly versus like a slime mold which is more like a dow or just everything is sensing and responding and and moving and making decisions based on whatever it's seeing around it and then there's things in between two like um the i think the thing you're referencing was the sephonifor which is a colonial organism it looks like a kind of jellyfish but it has like four or five different species that are all in a really strongly coupled symbiotic relationship together so that they fit together like one organism which is just wild um which to me a lot like like dao's yeah yeah whoa can you just elaborate on that just tell us tell me more about that how's that yeah i actually have different organisms i don't know that much more about it uh sadly um but like i've imagined a lot about it so i can speculate a lot about it but um all i know like factually is that it is a like column it's a a colonial organism they call it which is made up of multiple different species but that all function together as a team as one that looks and acts like one animal but you know you could say that about the human being in a sense you say that you got bacteria right but this is a little bit like more far out because you can like see each different animal and they're all kind of like fitting together um to like float around like a like a little guy um that was nuts how many like so the these things all have to be like born around each other so that they can find each other like how does that process work do you know about it i mean can we get an expert on to help us with this because i i have the same questions okay fair enough but i think the the model to extrapolate this to dao's is that like um there's a lot of overlapping dowels these days like bankless style very tapped into meta factory dao which is like and and so like is it is this kind of the idea we're just like we're actually going to thrive not by solo dallas doing well for each other but just by absolutely sharing resources and sharing capabilities and just hooking into each other well i think that the whole like kind of um physics and friction of the work decentralized of the work space changes with blockchain and with web3 right and um you know jack derose wrote beautifully about this talking about the uh coast art 1937 article the nature of the firm in which this you know economist defines like why vertical integration basically is a good idea at that time it's because of the overhead and you know you benefit from centralization why don't just a bunch of independent actors work together at that time there was no open public goods infrastructure to allow for that to happen so you had these monopolies arise but now we have this open public goods infrastructure that can allow for decentralized work to and where independent sovereign agents can come together and do stuff and like as we're starting to like skate out onto this new ice we don't really understand it so what you see is a lot of um corporations on the blockchain for for lack of a better term they're just you know repeating the same model that we know but doing this new space but there's also ones that are trying lots of new weird things um and what we're seeing is that the idea of like a corporate entity kind of doesn't make much sense anymore at least like what i'm seeing more is these permeable networks where you have like the urine protocol and the coordinate protocol and the curve protocol and the bankless style protocols and but there's people that are in all of them kind of working together and working for multiple at the same time and the dows are collaborating together they're often you know directly interacting between the protocols so it's this kind of big open mess um and like the uh the kind of nature of work change the work group the boundaries the surface tension changes instead of being this big hard boundary around a ten thir thousand person company and it can't be the same as this other one now it's his little one non-complete clauses yeah yeah like like you can only work for one corporation at a time blah blah blah doesn't matter anymore yeah right and the coolest thing too is like you know it it does i believe that it does become anti-rivalrous in that um a better strategy in this environment is to be composable and open and collaborative than competitive and closed like you will make more money and have a more successful project product if you take that strategy yeah and you can actually see that uh concretely in that a lot of dow discords have channels in them that hook straight into other dao's discords right like these are actually hard-coded bridges that we have in our communication coordination tools which is what discord is it's basically down coordination i was i was kind of blown away with that when i first joined yearn like a couple years ago and like the main like chat at that time you know there were leaders of like 10 of the other top protocols and i was like wow this is like the headquarters and like it's people from all over defy in here all together wow this is wild yeah um uh i wrote an article i all the way back in like 2019 i think that was uh called uh i can't remember what it was called uh it's basically arguing that d5 is not just one thing like you don't have the uniswap app you don't have the uh urine didn't even exist at the time uh you don't have just make or dial you don't have just compound but like over time the composability of these things like die from maker goes into uniswap allowing you to go and you can also get like c tokens out of compound and all of a sudden like it's not just one defy app at a time it's one d5 superstructure like these are all composability means all these things are coming together and if you actually are not composable then you're left out and if you're not composable like there's an insane amount of value and economic activity going on in the superstructure so if you're not part of the superstructure you're just not going to make it right because you it's advantageous to be a part of the superstructure to contribute your value to this superstructure so that you can pull some of that value back out and so you can start to be part of this like positive feedback loop of composability and i think what we're seeing is the same thing with is going to work with dallas where daos are just going to become one sort of massive superstructure of taos we're all going to support each other like kind of individually taos won't work like they're too messy they're too chaotic but when you put 50 dowels on the same spot and you have a lot of overlapping talent and labor people can start to like meld these things together and bootstrap themselves yeah and i it goes to the question of like what are we doing here anyways like i think we've all gotten really gaslit into this idea that you're supposed to work hard every day and make the product and make the money and like serve the boss and like why like yes we need food we need uh to pick up trash and things like this like all those things still exist and are real and it doesn't require that logic of like um conquest really you know and like we have to i have to make my [ __ ] so other people can't take it and i have to build the walls and i'm gonna like have my business plan and sign an nda and like no that's not the only way to be productive creative and happy in the world like this the logic of blockchain and of open source software and the internet creates a really different environment to thrive in which corresponds to a change in global consciousness that's in the same way right right now this is this is the layer zero like as soon as we have enough dowels to if not accept everyone as laborers but to accept everyone as at least consumers of whatever the dow's got to give uh the id the idea is that it flips people it inverts people's mental models as to like how they exist on this world it's like don't you know you don't gotta work for your nine to five you just gotta give the protocol what it wants and if you don't like giving that protocol what you what it wants find a different one and keep doing that until you find your place and all of a sudden boom you're in web 3. and what's what's magic about this it's like it's really profound that change really and it's really new for a lot of people like um and it can be really confronting for a lot of people too because a lot of us only have this experience of like our parents or our bosses or our society telling us what's good and what we're supposed to do and then you have this ladder that's consensual and you climb it and you you check the boxes and now you've done a good job good boy right but now we don't have that really as much and all of a sudden we have to say well why am i doing any of this anyways and that's like profoundly valuable for personal and ecological development maker dow is the og d5 protocol the maker dao produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint die directly with maker the power to mint new money is in your hands the maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced dows in existence they've been here since the beginning they've seen it all and so you can mint die with the assurance that your collateral is safe soon maker will be present on all chains and l2s so minting dye can take place on oasis.app xerion zapper or any other d5 protocol that you use follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence [Music] ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows

the wallet icon to get started we've hashed this out a little bit but i want to go back to it there's always the conversations with technology is like you know uh right technology wrong time like maybe we're too early what indications about the current state of the world uh would you say that is indicative of like oh yeah the world really wants this new like dow paradigm like this new web three like what about the world is like really really ready for this hmm well i can think of so many things but it's hard to tell if there's like a kind of causal or just correlative relationships i mean you can never really know but um you know the anti-work movement you know like all of all of these people that are so that are so mistreated by the corporate paradigm and getting paid the lat the minimum wage being solo comparatively historically um then there's a really fascinating thing that happened like in with russia where um there is a massive network effect at play in you know where it wasn't just that the eu and the us and some western countries um sanctioned russia it was all these businesses pulled out too and that wasn't um something that you could like control from one hierarchical position right that was a network effect which is kind of like a dao and it turns out that the at least from some analysis that that network effect of all of these different agents kind of autonomously deciding to retract their business services like create a much bigger impact and a much bigger uh stick you know for for that behavior and so it's like look like the world is trying to form into these networks anyways and and dows and web3 are like the perfect kind of like network substrate for that activity so it seems there's that and then there's also yeah just the you know global consciousness change of people wanting to be whole beings and confronting this like our parents generation of like um you know working hard for the system and the the death of the american dream and um seeing how you know that often doesn't work and and really wanting something different wanting to be a whole being uh you know with the with the people we work with and not just have a a work mask like these things have all been developing independently of of web 3 but they all kind of fit together to support it what do you think are the um the biggest fallacies that we're making right now like one thing i'm worried about is like one of the reasons why so many people can work for daos these days whatever that means for that particular dao was like well i mean 2021 was really bullish for crypto prices like a lot of people are sitting on a pile of savings that they perhaps didn't expect to have like maybe when these savings run out maybe working for a dow isn't so glorious anymore like what are our follow-ups here what are what are we tripping up on well i think we're making a ton of assumptions is the first time but also think that that's okay like i i think to assume that we're going to have everything figured out and if like not all the line items are properly annotated then like this isn't going to work is silly like we're at the beginning of a really gigantic change like we do not have it figured out that's fine we can make some assumptions as long as we do it lightly um so i think the fallacy is one that it's all figured out or that it's not going to work both of those are you know suitably they're similarly wrong um and we don't really know what the financial you know support is going to be like if there's we don't know the future of the market or the macro global situation like who knows a lot of those things could put like crypto is not going to be absolutely definitely turn over the world in the next five years like a lot of us believe that but there's a lot of ways that nation states could um stop that and we'll slow it down at least i mean you can stop it by killing everybody um which could happen work yeah at least it'll delay it for i mean if you think of i tend to think of of crypto really as a developmental like from a biological perspective it is a is it a a force it's a part of the force of the development of the universe uh right not something that like one guy is going to figure out um right so in that sense you can never stop it because it's always the next tier for any civilization but it can certainly be delayed or stopped for thousands of years yeah um it's a frequent trope in this crypto space is that like oh yeah we're trying to onboard like the next one billion people into crypto right like this dao is going to abort a billion people or my products is going on board a billion people and every time i hear that like everyone loves to say that just because like it's a it's a fun like we all want to onboard a billion people but i'm also at the same time like bruh like we do not have the infrastructure to onboard a billion people man like every single blockchain would break solana would break arbitrary would break like avalanche would break there we literally do not have the block space capacity to onboard a billion people uh and definitely with dows like no you can't just go work for a dow there's not that much room in daos in its current state of things like we just do not have that capacity and so like one of the reasons why i think a lot of like there's the nft haters out there there's like the gamers that hate the play to earn gaming revolution and they just hate all the things that crypto is infiltrating in their industries like oh it crypto's infrastructure culture and i hate it and crypto's infiltrating games and i hate it and i think just one of the reasons why they hate it is because it's a natural organic reaction saying hey your guys aren't ready for me yet like your blockchains have high fees and your games are boring and your nfts are are shitty uh so what they're really saying is yo crypto go figure your [ __ ] out and then i'll and then come back for me and i think it's like this natural balancing act of like we cannot on board a billion people because we do not have the capacity for them but we could onboard like i don't know the next thousand in the next month or so and then maybe the next three thousand two months later uh and then they're gonna help build out some of this stuff uh and then you know maybe the next month after that we'll get five thousand uh but then it starts to like perpetuate and roll out uh and and so how do you feel about like this model for like uh this natural reaction of just like people hate crypto and that's why they're not coming over to us but it's really just them giving us feedback that like we haven't built out the solutions for them yet yeah i think that that's true and i think it's okay like as much as we all or many of us really want to see total open equal access to all these tools and to onboard everybody and and bring dow technology to underserved communities and and change government we want to do all these things and it's also okay to realize that maybe not all these things are ready you know the the world is full of all different types of people coming from all different perspectives and we are very privileged and that we've had the education the opportunity maybe the the support the the finances um to engage in this new like space it reminds me of the often used william gibson reference like the future is here it's just unequally distributed and like we're in the future now but most of the world's not and that's normal that's the way it works and they will if this space is as promising and fruitful as we think it is it will expand and more people will join us here over time as the meeting from both top down and bottom up as as people grow and develop to be able to handle this way of of being and as the tools become more sophisticated better ux more open right do you have a so we're trying to build out these new organizations that sense and respond like sense our uh our needs and respond to them appropriately uh like i say our web feed protocols are here to compete for our love not to force us into paying them taxes uh do you have just like basic do's and don'ts for dow builders out there like hey if you're if we're building out this dow ecosystem and to be an actual new paradigm not just a recreation of the old paradigm do you have any just like basic do's and don'ts for the dow builders out there yeah i think the the biggest one is um just like take a breath and and when you when it you want to get something done the um the the driving force will be to take something that you know from the corporate legacy kind of coordination system and just bring that in and apply that to the dao and be like look maybe maybe this dow's not efficient enough so let's implement some direct reports you know or you know what this dial is not moving fast enough it needs a strong leader like if you like if if you want to do that form of coordination you can uh you can create a company um what i would say is like like be open to the possibility that there are other alternative ways to work and to be and dows are really suitable for that but it is going to be confronting and it is going to be messy at times and it's not all figured out you don't have to do that but like the opportunity is there to try new things and to relate to people in a new way and to allow for the timeline to be a little bit messier and the product to take a little longer or whatever else happens you know in these spaces i was doing a show with treasure dow uh yesterday and they have like they're one of the projects that came out of the loo ecosystem uh and they have like i'm pretty insane first off their community is extremely energetic so you know so i know they're doing something right uh and then i was as i was unpacking their their organization i was like okay there's a lot of labor and talent here being coordinated how do you guys coordinate everything as a dow and they said like oh yeah we've actually brought in like a lot of like web 2 project managers like leaders into the dao is that is that like the old mentality or like where how do you think about like top-down project management inside of dao's is that uh antithetical or like how does this feel like how does this fit in like how does this become a component of dallas well i think dows are a big tent and like they transcend and include the corporations so you can it's totally legitimate to do a web 2 style business in a dow vehicle that's fine you can do that nothing wrong with that um and you see that happening and that can be really successful and can provide a lot of good and i think the the the thing that we're all figuring out is there's also this new other web three native way to work and it's different and new and not as efficient sometimes because we're still learning it and that's i think like the most exciting and interesting place for me and that's where i've tried to spend all my effort but you know teach their own everyone you meet people where they're at and different things are going to work in different times do you think there's like the possibility of uh when you when you say slime mold thou i'm thinking of something with absolutely zero epicenter there's no center point and it's every and to me that's actually the original version of a dao dao has in my mind is misappropriately named in this modern day and age like we really have digital organizations rather than decentralized autonomous organizations the only true like decentralized autonomous organization that i really think is out there if you want to be a massive purist it would be bitcoin um ethereum comes second but there is still some central control uh uniswap comes to mind where it's code at the center and humans at the periphery but like there but then if we wanted to get into like the dao model that we kind of know of today of people in a discord making and doing and contributing do you think that's actually possible to create a structure of a dow where there is no actual central processing unit and is just slime mold as in like there's only labor at the margins there's only people at the periphery without any rules without any structure but the dow somehow exists and thrives and grows from the collective labor of its like a beehive right beehive without the queen like is that even possible do you think that's possible i think it is i think it is and i'm not sure i think it's going to be one one of the different shapes that emerges and there's going to be value in all the different shapes so like the thing i often think about with this is like what is the governance scope you know what is this organism doing what is the what what type of and so like slime world is good at certain tasks and a human being is good at certain tasks and those are different spaces of tasks right so like you know bitcoin is really good at certain tasks and i loved vitalik's article on uh april 1st because like he made some really good arguments for why you know and and they weren't jokes to me those were good arguments um and like that's great and that's one way for what it does that's the right thing but if you're trying to let's say govern a complex group of many different individuals doing different types of work like we don't have any way to make that an immutable smart contract right now you can governing an immutable smart contract like uniswap v2 protocol for instance like there's a defined set of function calls that can be made you can create an on-chain voting system with on-chain execution and have a single-channel decision-making system which is a kind of mind and you can have this big swarm of people that operate it but that's not the same as uniswaplabs which is a group of creative workers organizing together to create a work product that has a different governance method i actually don't know how much about how unit swap labs works but a lot of these types of central development companies corporations work like normal companies where there's a leader and a hierarchy and that's fine the opportunity in the place that i've spent my time is trying to figure out how do you govern in a decentralized way these groups of creative workers and we like have some this fascinating potential there because once you figure that out it breaks all of the limitations like it becomes that like beehive network you know where actually with yeah uh some alpha leak we're working on something like this but eventually like it's not ready for disclosure yeah um it it allows you to scale like the prop the opportunity and the promise for like real decentralized work is i i call it like the party bike like you know a party bike it's like you know like 10 people can sit on it and you can pedal as much as you want you can drink a beer you know one person steers maybe they get bored steering somebody else steers and you get somewhere cool it's like like imagine that for work like anybody can work as much as they want they get the value out of it um there needs to be a whole new set of uh structures and decision making processes in order to enable that and support that yeah uh i actually intended on asking this next question before you talked about the little alpha leak so for the record uh there's like been an explosion of like dow tooling startups in the last like six months like and everyone is building something relatively similar to each other a few differentiation points um but like the number of of these projects is like through the roof i'm thinking i'm thinking like there's over like 20 of these like dow tooling startups going on at least after like what what does what is missing in the dow tooling landscape that after like the dust settles with all these dow tooling startups what is the real problems that's getting solved like what what is the project the thing that dow tooling is trying to get and get done right what's the next step for dow tooling well man there's a lot of stuff um i think a lot of the doubt tooling that we're seeing and i know a lot of the people working on these things and a lot of the projects and i think they're awesome like there's some really great stuff but like to going back to the thing we're talking before like a lot of it is taking processes that we know about from web 2 or the normal traditional corporate world and making ways to do them easily on chain in for decentralized communities and that's great but the un the the blue ocean the the the undiscovered country is what are the real web 3 native ways to work um and there's very few tools that are really being made for that understandably it's very very new and like self-shilling a bit like i think coordinate is one of them coordinate is is uh the only form of doing descent fully decentralized compensation that i know of and like understanding compensation is a huge challenge for really decentralized creative work um like how do you get paid how do you share resources how do you make those decisions and and the other side of that is the decision making space itself right so we have on chain coin wait uh token weighted voting right and we have snapshot and things like that these things are great but they're just single channel decision making it's like one thing you put a proposal up you people vote on it but there's so many other types of computational social choice mechanics that are available and really important because there's all different types of decisions that need to be made in decentralized ways but also with the balance of centralization is good for some things permissioning is good for some things and decentralized and permissionless is good for other things and to create tools that allow for a fluid movement you know with it that's accountable and transparent to create these structures like there's not really any tools to do that yet what's the um what's the role of data when it comes to dows uh a lot of dao workers are individuals who have their own skill sets and their own like resume in working in web three and taos from from as far as i can tell don't have a way of sensing the makeup of an individual worker uh how do you think about this problem in the dow space i think this is going to be a huge unlock and i think ceramic network is amazing i don't know if you've talked to those guys like this idea the dataverse where you know basically a blockchain for rich data and what that allows for is like way more composable and uh easy to start front ends like you know you you go to one dap and you put in your profile and your your your picture and whatever and all of that is stored in ipfs through like um you know these kind of shared data structures um that then you know you open another dap and your stuff automatically populates um or you know you open a kanban board at dwork uh which is an amazing like project productivity tool uh startup and you put in a bunch of tasks and then you go to clarity which is another awesome tool and those same tasks are there because they're both being stored through ceramic network on ipfs like that type of data availability for rich data for dao workers is going to be like massively massively expansive for the system and and fits right into the theme of uh dao sensing and responding right like dallas can you can sense sense their own needs and then also sense who are the candidates that are best equipped for the dow to give the dow those needs uh and then i think they respond appropriately i think this is actually one of the big pain points like um in a lot of dow's we talk to a lot of daos um that they have the same the same problems how do you uh surface needed work how do you create bounties how do you um know who's done what how do you keep people accountable how do you do off-boarding like all of these everybody has these same questions and i think part of the problem is that without that data layer that data blockchain um you kind of have you can't create there's not a good enough shelling point for this stuff like you could create there's a bunch of these different bounty systems but because they don't interoperate um and you don't have it all moving down to one data layer like none of them is really gaining enough traction but once we do have that then it's gonna explode and that's pretty soon okay so this data layer is like a inter dial communication layer is that a way to frame it i think you could think of it that way sure or like it's a public good and sense for for data that many you know front ends can bloom from and you can have like this is what will beat facebook right like you can't beat facebook because of the network effect but when every new profile can get stored in the same data structure that's open you know and uh public good then all of a sudden it's just gonna start growing you know and then you don't have to have the one front end that you know beats them all you can have a thousand of them uh drake you you go out and and go to real life crypto events you're at east denver i saw you at mcon i think you've been to a few others that i haven't been uh and i believe if i'm remembering uh your bio correctly you also came from like a web 2 startup world i think maybe i might be wrong about that not web 2 but i not web 2 tried trad 5 tried something i was an artist and designer artist okay okay anyways same question uh just the culture of the people that you in engage with and interact with at these crypto events what about the culture these these like web three enabled individuals uh what about the culture in these in real life events stands out to you as unique and compelling well it's it's it's great it's um at least the there's a bunch of different cultures in crypto right there's like finance culture there's uh investor culture there's builder culture there's dow culture and like i didn't know anything about finance before i i was an i was an engineer in built code and engineering various engineering projects but finance i didn't know anything about that's not really my people in a way not that there aren't plenty of them that i resonate with but the people i really vibe with and that when i go to these conferences i feel like i you know coming home in a sense is that there's people making doubts you know that are that are trying to figure out really how human beings can collaborate and this is something i've cared about my entire life and this is like the most important thing that we can figure out on the planet because that is what makes or breaks like our ability as a civilization to thrive and they're not coming from there it's very new thinking you know like very lots of polymaths and people with all the different information bringing it to share and work together and it's very open you know it's very welcoming and not competitive very collaborative and it's that overwhelming nature of collaborative and open spirit that like yeah i'm a sucker for that any day why does this industry have all of these types of characters like what what about this industry attracts that type yeah so i think it it this goes to my kind of like developmental theory of organizations where you know before blockchain um you know like a human being has these different levels of intelligence we have like um survival instinct you know we have sexual instinct we have um power we have heart we have our voice you know we have our intelligence our cognitive ability all these different layers they all build on top of each other in the same way organizations and societies has that too and so it's like where are the jewels kept are the jewels safe and that's the first thing that we all need to think about am i safe and you know before blockchain you had to trust the government and you had to trust the banks you know for that personal security and that's not a very good trust situation so everyone's kind of starting scared you're all starting kind of scared and so you can only go so far but when you have blockchain you have this trustless coordination system to keep your jewels safe and now obviously there's ways that they're not safe but it's a lot better than we had before and so what i noticed is that from that much stronger foundation like the other stuff can bloom and like people how many like handshake deals like i'll send you some eath like send me the tokens later like that happens all the time like i was an entrepreneur i started a bunch of companies everything was papered everything was contracts lawyers everywhere it's like this we're way more because of this trustless infrastructure we're way more trusting because like the jewels are safe and that's profound you know that's that's that's changes everything yeah um i think a lot of this world depends on the assurances right um we have like models of governments where we have slow medium and fast versions of government executive is the fast congress or the legislative is the medium uh and then the judicial the supreme court is the slow and the slow government is the hardest one to change right so when the supreme court says this is the the new version of the law this is the new law uh businesses and people have the mac like the strongest level of assurances that that is going to be the law moving forward getting something overturned by the supreme court is like the hardest thing you can do in a country and so that gives businesses the assurances that they can operate on those laws and they can build around them and give us like startup founders assurances that they're not going to get rug pulled because the supreme court determined that this is the law uh and i think what i what i heard from you there is that like private keys give you just a new level of assurances over your assets that you've never been able to have before uh and then like smart contracts give you assurances and so you know uh and and i don't think that like i'll be randomly sending somebody some ether and telling them to just send me the tokens later probably in 2040 when all of society's onboarded and but it's like the this colonel this er in these these first adopters who got attracted by this technology is probably a little bit more conducive to that but i do take your point that like smart contracts and private keys and these assurances allow for the trustless base allows for a trusting structure like a trustless foundation allows for trust to be exhibited by the world at large because we don't have to for like you said rely on the banks rely on the governments or rely on the courts to get things right because even the courts can be gamed like the courts is a gameable system where ethereum is not uh and so that that imbues whatever gets built on top of ethereum as a more uh creative playground for trust to be exhibited absolutely and it doesn't mean that we need to be we should be naive and not you know care about opsec or key management you have to have that piece too and you have to know that there are sharks out there and it isn't there are like it's really important to know what playing field you're on are you in an adversarial space are you in a collaborative space you're in a creative space you're trusted space what level is that and then operate you know in that way dude after after emcon this is this uh stood out to me so much uh after mcon last september i think in denver september 2021 uh a bunch of us went out to just like a bunch of airbnbs out in like the colorado countryside just for like the weekend just to get away the sunlight just walk around just go on some hikes uh and everyone kind of converged on one airbnb airbnb as the meeting place like the biggest one and everyone had their stuff like their backpacks with their laptops and their ledgers and so everyone just dumped their backpack into this airbnb and we all started going on a hike everyone had their ledgers in their backpacks and everyone just left all of their ledgers in the backpack and just in the airbnb and no one thought twice about it and i only knew about like fifty percent of the people in that group but it was the meta factory it was like half of them was the meta factory bros and ladies uh and i was like yeah like no [ __ ] way would any of these people like go into my backpack and try and find my ledger like that's not going to happen and again wouldn't do that in 2030 probably but like with the particular people that meta factory of a particular dao has created and just like the collaborative yes and culture of that of that community and others it just felt so i like no one thought twice about how like there is like millions and millions of dollars like collectively on these backpacks that are like laid on the ground yeah it's amazing and i think you're right like part of that is still early and part of it is that you know there are high reputation people in this space that understand the substrate that we're working on and and are able to trust each other which you know that notion of trust is one that i think about a lot which is like there's the impetus in the space often you see like everything needs to be trustless everything needs to be trustless and i think that's a great goal in many ways but it's not reality because you can't like there is still a hugely important space for interpersonal trust and and like that is where the like third mind the mind between minds like really emerges you know in the collective intelligences between these interpersonal relationships and yes like those can be broken and yes that's okay uh i'm gonna tell i want to tell a quick story and it might actually be completely irrelevant but i think your brain might pick up on something anyway so i'm gonna go and see what happens um my first job out of school was working at a mental health agency for uh kids that were deemed by the state to be unsafe to themselves unsafe to others or just like not functioning enough to be able to take care of themselves like schizophrenic or whatever um uh and then so this working worked at this company for a while we had a workshop like a weekend optional workshop where we would be able to go and work with um just like hang around uh traumatized horses and horses are extremely emotional animals right uh if you like walk quickly towards a horse it'll get scared and run away from you but if you walk uh you know passively and and like you know calmly and not at a direct line to a horse but like adjacently and then you go and walk adjacently again you get closer then the horse is calmer and it responds to you and so uh they were the the people that were leading these workshops were uh getting us to like okay you're going to grab a horse and you're gonna uh lead it right you're going to walk with it and the horse is going to determine whether it's going to follow you or not based on your body language based on like the vibe that you give off and i was watching one of the therapists that was that was with us in this organization who was like kind of a timid guy uh not not really too like you know confident he would go up to the horse and like grab the reins and be like uh come on horse like we're gonna go now and the horse is like what are we doing here like yeah [ __ ] off bro like i'm not going anywhere uh and like he couldn't get the horse to walk uh and so like i was watching this happen and uh i was like okay well that's not what you do and so when i did it i went up and i grabbed the reins i didn't look at the horse i just like looked elsewhere and started walking and the horses immediately started going it's like oh okay i guess we're going this way now and the horse has started following me um and then uh just since i'm going into the story uh this this was a kind of a chaotic workplace so some of these kids were like conduct disorder like uh not right not really able to control themselves and sometimes they would just like aggressively act out and they were like between the ages of like 13 and 17. there's this one kid who uh was having an act out moment and like starting to get a little violent uh and there was a moment where like i was engaging with him and i needed to like de-escalate the environment and but he was violent he was being aggressive being violent like trying to hit us and i like i can't remember what i said but i basically just turned or turned around and walked the other way to disengage but i'm turning my head away from this kid so i don't know what he's going to do next and so i turned away and started to walk away and in the back of my head i'm like he's going to hit me he's going to hit me he's going to hit me but because i acted as if i trusted this kid and i acted as if i didn't think that he was going to hit me and i confidently turned away and walked away to disengage and he didn't hit me i was like whoa that guy it didn't hit me and so like it's a lot of like our um what we communicate is how we perceive the world is embodied in our actions right and so when we have a bunch of people in a colorado countryside airbnb and they're all leaving their ledgers on the ground we're all indicating to ourselves like hey like this is this is the vibe like this is the culture this is the emotional like uh state that i'm going to express that i think that we are in and because i'm expressing that everyone else also thinks that is true reflections on that yes yeah i i think we we um we create our own reality right like like i think if i um i'm acting from a place of of confidence and uh openness and um you know clear direction and integrity it tends to create more of that in the world around me and if i'm operating with a hidden fear in my system that i won't look at that i'm gonna get hit i'm gonna hit get hit i'm gonna i'm gonna make that reality happen and somebody's gonna hit me um because we tend to this goes to like spirituality and psychology and all these different wisdom traditions that we tend to recreate the same patterns in our lives over and over again and you know there's this idea that you know the world is this concrete thing that has these specific rules and you know there's an order to it and it's kind of yes and no you know like really like reality is this kind of psychedelic experience that each of us is manifesting in our own way and um and we can have the ones that are full of suffering and the ones that are full of of less suffering and each of those is just what we happen to need at that time i'm not sure that's where you were going with that story but no there was no i was going nowhere with it but um uh how do how do do you think dao's are dallas like an amplification tool for this kind of like behavior where if we if the daos just assume that they trust us and we assume that we trust the dao like do you think dao's can be like an amplification of just uh the values that we want to see in the world i think that they really are and i think this is like this development is going in concert like at the same time as these collective super organisms are are developing so too are the parts you know within it like each individual also has to develop and so um that's one of the things that's like super exciting to me about it like working in a dow that's not you know a company on the blockchain even a company in the blockchain is going to push you in some areas but working in a dow that's you know really trying to push down us forward um each person is going to be like their their development gets amplified i think and and you you get these lessons and these um signals that help you orient to this new way it's like one of the biggest you know risk factors for being obese is having a lot of obese friends yeah it's like we we do we garbage in garbage out like what's around us becomes us and so if you put yourself in a space with all these sovereign beings that are you know acting in these more developed ways like you will take those traits on and you will grow and you'll become more like them endows become like a shelling point for that type of consciousness trey if we uh zoom forward to like 20 50 20 60 20 70 and we're got gray hair and old and dows are infinite at this point uh what do you hope your legacy is you as an individual yeah i mean i i just hope i help you know all right and we're done yeah yeah i just i i i love working on this stuff like i love solving these problems and sharing them with people that i care about and um and co-creating this thing together and being part of this kind of movement it's like it weaves together all of these things in my life that i care about and i didn't even realize i didn't plan to get into crypto like i kind of got sucked in in 2020 um and it's because of all these different things like this psycho the psychology the spirituality of it the technology of it the you know the revolutionary aspects like um it's it's so compelling and so just to if my legacy is just you know someone that added some good to that system that's that's all i want um trick you said you were an artist uh what were you an artist about like what would you create um interactive sculpture so i used i used technology so my training was in human computer interaction i used to invent new types of computer interfaces physical interfaces mostly using like mechanical engineering and electrical engineering and industrial design and software and i did that in research for a while trying to reinvent you know computers basically and then i started using it to make art i'd always made different forms of art in my life but then i used that same material but as an artist so i made um sculpture that's really cool that just opened up a whole other can of worms so when gary kasparov lost to deep blue i think or yeah uh people thought i was like oh the chess is over like the computers are one like the art of chess is lost what actually ended up happening is that the new frontier of chess came uh with the grand masters of the world the gary kasparovs of the world finding their preferred chess ai and then competing with other grand masters who have their chess ai and so it started to become a human computer cyborg and that it was the new frontier and we've also seen this in online poker too uh it's gone from just individuals on a table playing poker to online poker where like the new meta is like how computer enabled can you be like you have scripts running to tell you about like probabilities and then you have to make the gut choice using that data uh and i think there's a conversation to be had about this with dallas too uh where dows are like the cyborg side of us that are doing like the smart contract basic stuff but it's still humans at the periphery um do you have any thoughts about like the future trajectory of humans and the the digital side of the world that we're creating yes many and i think yeah um i think um technology is a part of the human organism right there's this idea and there's been this kind of misconception i think that it's something external you know and that and that when we're building these like we need to build an ai that's outside of us and it's a mirror of us but really the the progress the the procession of technology is of of identity creation and and like every the phone becomes an extension of the mind it's like a cognitive coprocessor and you know just because it's not inside my skull doesn't make it any less me you know and i think you people can feel that you lose your phone for a while and you feel a huge sense of loss um there's a pho there's a phobia word for this i don't know what it is but there's a phobia word for if you do or without your phone yeah and you know i was talking to meta dreamer about this the other day actually and uh like maybe what we're doing in dao's is we're creating an agi artificial general intelligence because um if you think a lot of the the progress in strong ai you know has been around constructing these logical systems like it started marvin minsky gave a you know famously gave one of his uh summer uh students like the job of general computer vision in like the 60s like they figured that they'd be able to solve that in you know a summer in like the 60s um but as realize that you know it is not this divorced logical system that can work on its own it's really a part of the human matrix and for then ai developers started to they realize that it needs to be an embodied intelligence they made robots and they thought that robot body is going to but again this is outside of the human and now you see like gpd3 and whatever they're really synthesis of human beings because they take all the human output and they weave it together statistically into a new output right in these kind of limited domains but what are dows other than you know these aligning mechanisms for human output that can scale and function more rapidly than any other human coordination system before so eventually it might be that all of these different human actions are getting woven together through the technology of the dao um to become a real intelligence you know operating maybe not in a realm that we can directly communicate with but taking action on this same realm the same planet with us um because that question it's not outside you know it is extension of us and there's oh gosh there's so many different directions to go in but uh we talked about the um the digital like metaverse nomadic lifestyle that is now being enabled via daos yeah and really just like this whole concept of crypto is always about freedom like the the the layers here of crypto's freedom like if crypto is here to do anything is to help us become more free like bitcoin and its 21 million hard cap is freedom from tyrannical monetary policy ethereum and smart contracts is freedom from like the the capturing a financial system uh and then like nfts is a freedom from just like uh i don't know licensing and uh like labels and people that try to to own the music industry in a corporate sense it all sets you free uh and and it's and that's really what technology has always been about is like how do we get how does technology allow us to access the things that we want more and that's always been what technology is and really i'm just seeing like dows as being just like another instantiation of ones and zeros that allow us to get what we want out of life even more um and so we have these ai developers that are building out these ais and i i love that what you said where they're trying to build it externally which is like naive because how can you build something external when you are the one actually building it in the first place like your biases your values your culture is being built into the thing that you are building so there is no even if you try to makes it maximally external you just can't pull the human out of the out of the technology because it's the human that built it in the first place that's why we have a layer zero podcast to talk about these subjects uh and so like can you talk about just like the importance of self-reflection about who we are as we build out these technologies and how our own persons get in like imbued into the technologies we create oh yeah i mean the most important question to ask is just what am i to start you know who am i what am i and and understand understand the nature of the reality that we are in more and more and then you know see that it's all a piece you know it is it's divine uh wisdom life force energy flowing out into the into the into manifestation and it's flowing through all we're all a piece of that same thing of god of this you know the the you know the polarity of the universe and the in the unity of it all and that is going to flow through us into technology it's going to flow through us into everything that we that we make and you know it reminds me um a lot of people sometimes think like i could think of it like the vulcan fallacy or the spock fallacy that you can have this purely logical take on the world divorce from your emotions and um the reality is if you look at studies of split brain patients like if you don't have access to your emotional system then you cannot make any decisions you know there is no not just logic without emotion like it all flows from that same creative force and it flows up through all these different layers so it's the same thing as thinking you could create like this a a that's ai that's outside of the human organism because it's like saying it's outside of life and without life it's just dead it's just concept um which is a part of experience but not all of experience and experience cannot is irreducible to concept and vice versa so um seeing it all is just just this divine expression of the universe in action um i think really helps to better contextualize what it is that we're [ __ ] doing in the first place uh trek i think this is a good place to wrap it up man thank you for coming
