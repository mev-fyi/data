[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast focusing on the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero we're talking with cami russo the chief s of the defiant and cami i think has one of the most interesting stories and interesting backgrounds that i've heard so far she has a very just logical process uh we talked about this a logical process of like who she is is definitely a an a plus b equals c conclusion out of her parents and her family uh she's got that entrepreneurial spirit she's got a drive to create she's got an intrinsic interest in in journalism and uh it it kind of has like logically concluded with where she is at now which is at the defiant um but we start at the very beginning we start at her her time as a child in chile her when she moved again as a young kid to miami then back to chile for a degree in journalism uh and then moving into her time at bloomberg and it was overall just a fascinating story and i'm having a ton of fun doing these these layer zeros because i just get to sit back for an hour and a half and hear story time from each of these individual guests and i think cami's story has been one of my favorites so far we definitely tap on the differences at the very end uh between bankless and the defiant uh so that was a fun little thing to hear and we also talk about um i i share my perception as to how cami's book that she wrote changed the course of ethereum for the for the much much better uh so i hope you enjoy this conversation with kami russo one of the best leaders in this space uh but first before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors

cammy how's it going hi david all good we were just talking before we uh hit record as two people who both have their own youtubes and then also consume other people's youtubes i had to ask you the questions like wait have have we talked before or have we not talked before like it's actually kind of hard after like two years of making and also consuming content to remember if we've actually been into the same zoom but we've decided that no this is actually the first time yeah and it's so so great to finally do it absolutely absolutely um so congratulations with everything you've built at the defiant and i definitely want to hear about that story but i think i want to get there in the second half and so the first half i want to hear just a little bit more about your background and um what about your you know your you know your younger years that cause you to become the person that that you are today um so let's let's go all the way back cammy where were you raised i was raised in santiago chile um south america yeah um where where in chile santiago the capital right right right okay and that's like uh right in the middle right yeah it's right in the center of chile in the middle of the mountain so yeah it's a nice nice city um one of it it used to be one of the most stable and like i don't know like one of the few places that just like worked in south america so it was it's funny like growing up um i didn't have a lot of the the issues that a lot of other people in south america had to deal with uh like didn't hear about inflation or like currency controls or like um scarcity of goods or anything like that uh chile's like actually really close or has been uh historically very close to the us so it has like a bunch of like um like uh trade deals everywhere and it's like pretty open um so you know like that's i grew up in in this like bubble within uh south america where everything was fine everything worked like you didn't have that like crazy instability um but then later on i moved to argentina and that's where i got a taste of all that uh all that craziness so it's that right the argentinian stories the story that you hear a lot of right amariano conti tells this story a lot uh patricio tells a story a lot of uh exactly what you just described right uh and that's kind of been the kind of like crypto rallying cries like oh look at the capital controls and the inflation going on in argentina it's interesting that like literally right next door uh is a country that didn't have that history um how would you describe the chilean economy growing up like where's their like uh for for what i'm familiar with argentina it's very big in like you know beef and agriculture and also tech uh wha what were you surrounded by uh growing up in chile um well and and before i go into that the yeah that the economy is so interesting because actually when my parents were growing up in chile it was the other way around that even more so like my grandparents argentina was like the big like stable or not stable but just like growing economic force uh in kind of the southern cone of south america and tila was just like this really like poor like struggling country and then the role is like really really kind of like two generations so it's it's it's like it's really interesting to see that how that happened um and it's all because of just like very populous policies implemented in argentina well there were more like free market policies implemented in in chile um but yeah like the tila's main export is copper so very much a commodity led um economy uh but um my parents were both pretty um entrepreneurial uh my whole my whole family is so um so that's where you get it from yeah i i have a really great example set uh with with my family so yeah my dad is an engineer uh my um mom studied art advertising but never really she was like she started um a actually a toy importer in in chile so like when when she had me she was looking for general educational toys for kids and she couldn't find like any quality toys that didn't have like you know harmful like materials and stuff like that um and so she started importing fisher price toys into chile was like one of the first or like the first person to do that so she and my dad set up a toy store which was very convenient for me growing up wow the kid the kid with the parents that have a toy store you must have been a hit yeah that's pretty funny um so in growing up were you uh were you exposed to any like things that you have been able to like repurpose now like um uh when did you get uh like your access to your first computer uh when did like what was did you ever have like an entrepreneurial experience or anything with computer science like anything that is like now related to crypto what was like the earliest part of your like your childhood or growing up phase where you actually was like oh yeah so i was doing this as a kid and now i do this as an adult oh attention question um well like just like a computer access i think is pretty similar to what any like kid in the u.s had you know like i don't know like i i had my computer room growing up like had um just like got like a like a facebook account very early on and um remember like transitioning from uh like um floppy days to like cds and like all that like yeah you can i'm dating myself for sure i'm an older millennial here um so all of that i don't think is is like too different um i think maybe like some of the influences like i said it's just like all of my family is somewhat uh um my brother my younger brother he's three years younger than me he never actually he never had an actual job like unlike me who like i went in a more traditional direction uh going into bloomberg uh after studying journalism and university uh and it took me like you know almost over ten years to actually start uh like quit and start my own company my brother never never had like a full-time job like he's always been a full-time entrepreneur he he uh he started this kind of like yelp like early version of yelp in chile for restaurants in in santiago then he had this like instagram for pets uh called poof and he he was actually part of um tech stars which is like a big incubator and he uh he lived in new york before i did for tech stars um and now he has a liquor company called candela um and he got the idea of the liquor company in a trip to their dominican republic uh and i was there when he got the idea like we went up to the bar in in the resort and uh the that we were like okay give us like the what what you drink like we don't like pina coladas and stuff and and so he he uh made us try mama juana which was like it's like the local rum like a spiced rum that they drink in the dominican republic and we loved it and so my brother was like i can't believe like they don't sell this outside of the dr and so that's you know what he does now like he's now based in in miami and how he has his own kind of liquor company so i have like that example my parents example and um so i always thought it was like like feasible to quit everything and start your own thing like if that was like actually like a career path that didn't seem so outlandish to me growing up because i had like all these different examples of people who did it um and then from like the journalism side um i i always i've always loved writing um so i i moved to miami for a brief period when i was growing up i lived there for three years and um i was nine years old and when i moved my grandmother gave me a journal and she's like you're gonna want to write everything down and i think that's kind of what what started it because i i got to miami and was like you know dealing with all these different experiences and emotions and like missing home but also learning too much and having a good time and like all this stuff and so i started just like writing everything down on on this journal and from then on like i had i always kept journals and it just like i don't know i think it made me like writing um ever since so um and then my mom was editor-in-chief for a conde nest for a bunch of like uh spanish versions of like big magazines like glamour vogue uh discover like a lot of content as magazines she helped run um so like i just grew up in like the editorial and publishing world like i i i loved going with my mom over the weekend to the office like making sure that everything was closed like i saw just like the printouts of like magazine covers and i just love that whole world so uh that kind of writing plus that experience really just made me want to be a journalist and yeah here i am that's a that's such an easy story to have like all right like a plus b equals c right so like you know uh cammy uh daughter of a very entrepreneur entrepreneurial family entrepreneurial brother grandma gives you a journal come to america which is like a very transitional moment like you're going moving from a to b anywhere and then you are given a journal to help you know deal with the emotions of you know a change and then all of a sudden we have cami the entrepreneurial journalist writer operating the defiant it's just such a very logical conclusion right of like the rest of your family yeah um there's a quote uh and actually my brother said it at my wedding um and it always sticks with me it's like the it's always easy to connect the dots looking backwards so now now it makes sense right um but you know at the time i had no idea i would end up living in new york uh running my own media company you know it's like i never imagined that when i went into uh journalism in the first place yeah that's fantastic where did you go for journalism what university um university in chile university like one of one of the good ones in chile um then i worked at a newspaper there in mercurio it's like one of the bigger or the biggest newspaper newspaper in chile and um yeah so i was like working in ed mercurio and i had this uh woman next to me who she's amazing i love her um but you know she had been there i think like at that same desk for 30 years and because it's like you get to in mercury and you don't move it's like it's an institution in chile like everyone beats it um so i was like okay i'm already here like i don't want to be here in like the next 30 years like what what should i do next uh and and you know having the experience of having lived in the us uh when when i was growing up um again like it didn't it it felt like okay like maybe i should look beyond tilan and see what's out there um and so i applied to different journalism schools here with always like the the goal of getting a big like a job at a big us media company that was like my my end goal and so to do that i i realized that i i needed a degree from a us school because nobody would look at my degree from university of catholic and be like sure yeah come join the new york times so uh so yeah applied to different schools and got into northwestern um and from there i uh i got into bloomberg until like the bloomberg internship so throughout that process when you were writing either at your job or practicing for your job what was the subject matter that you were focused on because we're not at the crypto part of this story right like we're we're still pre-crypto so like what what captured your attention while you were a writer um i think let's see well in en mercurio i i was in the international news section and i think you know that's something i i enjoyed um it's funny like before uh getting to northwestern on bloomberg i never really looked at financial markets or anything close to crypto um and like i got into journalism play i like writing and it's like i like the more i don't know like i i never i never saw myself as a like numbers person um so yeah i gravitated more towards like politics you know uh stories um it's funny in in mercury they initially wanted me to do um like the social pages and so they called me up and they were like okay yeah you you you're in uh your first job is going to be in the social pages and that's been like you know like following like local celebrities around and i like i turned it down i was like no and they're like what you're turning down a job and then my video i'm like yeah no i i don't want to do that and then they came back and we're like fine you can uncover international politics that was a big improvement um so yeah that's that's kind of what i did and then in northwestern i had the i had to choose between different kind of um topics for the reporting class and there was like politics um business like environment and art or something and i thought you know like i'm paying a bunch of money to be here like i i took a loan to uh go go to northwestern so it's like this better pay off or else you know um and so i thought you know i i need to make this a worthwhile and learn something i don't actually know so i thought like going into like the business reporting class would be the most useful because i had no idea about anything about business um and i discovered that i actually really like uh reporting like you know writing about money like reporting about like you know markets um because of me it it it was nice to find a more objective way of telling stories right like in politics it's like always one side versus the other and he said she said and you don't have like like a fact that you can present and be like this is what's happening and it's pretty kind of hard to dispute and with with like markets and business stories you know there's like different ways to interpret numbers but in the end a stock is going up and it's going up and it's going down and it's going down and if like countries bond yields actually are like a really good way of representing how thousands of people think about one country you know so i just thought that was really interesting and and and just like a very like truthful way of uh seeing the world and presenting the world so i was really excited by this discovery and um and i just uh yeah i decided to just like focus on that on like business and market reporting and then we had this like field trip to the bloomberg office in chicago because northwestern is in chicago um and i was like blown away by the power of the bloomberg terminal like this there's this like black box that just like gets you all the data you could possibly want um and it's just like connected to all the like decision makers of the world and all of these you know big brains are consuming your your news and your stories and i'm like okay this is where i i want to be so that led me to apply to the internship there so is all of your like um your understanding of like money business economics done like on the is like on the job training like you you had to do like you never took you still never took a class so you only ever learned about this this um just by teaching yourself yeah it was it was crazy um um right like i i i had this like business journalism class from northwestern which i mean they did like teach the basics of like economics but that was pretty much it like that was my background going into bloomberg and yeah you learn everything on the job and you have you know this amazing tool that the like professional like fund managers and uh like central bank economists all over the world use but and and you're just like starting out as you know the first job as a journalist and you have the same tool so it's like it like really forces you to to understand things like oh like what is the bond yield and writing about all that stuff um yeah it's like i learned really quickly that i just had to lose the fear of asking dumb questions because you know it's like i had to get get a story out at the end of the day and um and i had to at least like i had to understand it obviously you write it so i would like get on the phone and just like ask ask like everything like explain what why the stock is you know um and like literally it was like because like i started like calling sources and then they would and and reporters like more senior reporters would help me out and just like write out questions that they needed for their stories um and then i remember like having these conversations where i would just like go down the list of questions and i had no idea what like what the person was answering like what the answer was so i could like do couldn't do any follow-up couldn't like follow the conversation so then i just like started like asking my own questions and was like okay but what do you mean by that yeah and that's that's really how how i learned everything i know about uh finance and markets um eight years at bloomberg when you started asking your own questions did that like was that really just you trying to educate yourself or is that you learning to be a reporter of your own style and because for me um sometimes i try and i try and find the question that other people want me to ask but then there's always like okay well if that's not the question that i truly want to ask maybe the question that i truly want to ask is also the same question that other people have too yeah can you reflect on that for a moment yeah um and by the way i think you're you're you're an awesome interviewer oh thank you yeah man like all these questions i don't think i've i've heard them before so yeah uh well that's hopefully why people tune in to the layer zeros that's what they're meant for no really great um it was definitely both like i was trying to to learn and understand what the story was about so i could i write it um but yeah i was i was learning to be a journalist as well as learning about uh finance and on market so um you know it's like once you get a taste of having a scoop of like having a really well-read story of like i don't know getting like a really uh like cool and important source uh it's really addictive you know so it's like okay like you get that taste and you wanna you wanna do it again um so you try to like uh get something out of your interviewer that nobody nobody has and um and i think yeah it's like that dopamine of like the the views and and like just like i'm covering things that that haven't been been said before it's kind of what what starts to drive you as a journalist yeah can you go into that a little more i think i think i find that extremely fascinating like the dopamine hit of like discovering a scoop can you do you have a story where you like got a scoop and what are you just like furiously typing trying to get the scoop out the door as fast as possible you have a story like that yeah yeah um so okay the first one that comes to mind uh in argentina um there was this period of time where everyone or it seemed like everyone was leaving argentina just like running out the door because the president christina fernandez had turned like just even even more anti uh like international companies and anti-free market so like there was like a bunch of stories breaking everywhere about like this fund was leaving or this company was leading and um and there was like a source that i about like i started from a a pretty big hedge fund uh based there and they were like really big in in argentina like they they they were like big really big investors in argentine bonds and unstopped and so you always call this guy and i remember there was like one week where i called him and he just like wasn't picking up and then i called again um no answer then i called like not his direct phone but like the the like general number nobody was picking up so i was like i wonder like maybe these guys are all like have also left and so like i remember like going through like different ways to try to confirm and so i think i asked him directly but like he didn't say um and then i there was like one one of the fun and guys was based in london and i had like chatted with him a couple of times so i i called him up and i was like hey so um i asked a question in a way that assumed that they had left argentina so like hey so like um when are you like when's your last day in argentina i don't remember what i asked but like it was like a question like that it was like a clever framing is that is that the gist yeah okay cool like it assumed like the question assumed that they had left so um but yeah yeah he and he answered something like oh yeah like we we're we're like tomorrow's our last day or something like he answered the question kind of like basically confirming that they were leaving and so i was like okay um so i'm just wondering like is is the reason you're leaving because of argent like argentina's really really bad like unfriendly policies oh yeah totally like they they suck whatever i don't that's not the actual quote but sure and meaning is there but quote's not there but meaning is there sure yeah yeah so like oh my god like i got this scoop like this big fund is leaving argentina um wrote that up like big headlines like thumbs up hits and then i got like this enraged call from from the guy who gave me the quote and he's like i thought you were like i didn't come like i don't know he like and i record everything and so i had i had the thing and he complained he complained to my boss he's like i i didn't mean for that to be the news and whatever like you know i called i asked you this is what you said i have the recording i have the quote like and and there was this whole thing like my editor had to like look at my notes and my recording and they were like nope camilla's right like it is like is this false like are you not leaving they were like well yeah actually he confirms it twice that's awesome okay so um what motivates the scoop is it like the thrill uh is it like the the possibility of like fame and prowess is it just like becoming a better journalist like what motivates the scoop um i don't it's i don't know it's it's a it's a mix of all of that you know it's like it's fun it's fun to uncover stuff you know it's like you feel like a detective um right um and and really like if if your your job is to just you know report on what's happening i mean what better way to do it if you're reporting something that nobody else has reported it's like you know the ultimate reporting um so yeah it's fun finding berry treasure yeah yeah it's fun it's fun um though i'll say like scoops aren't really kind of my my specialty like i love like getting them um but i i think i enjoy even more um just like the the feature type of story you know uh like having long interviews uh going on on site to see things and just like be able to like build a narrative around that and um and it it can still be kind of school b you know it can be like a story that nobody else has has reported um but i i like the the more like uh feature kind of analytical um type of story that just like oh like this this happened right right right the the longer forms the the stories not the not the breaking news yeah yeah yeah yeah i think um at this point in your uh we we kind of went on a a side quest to talk about scoops but uh where we were was you were working at bloomberg being a journalist and had just gotten into into markets and business and finance and all that stuff and i think what comes next is the ethereum side of things is that right no not quite um let's see uh okay so first comes uh before ethereum actually comes bitcoin in my in my timeline so um in argentina i was this was 2013 and um i was reporting on like inflation and currency control and like all the different ways the investors had to um you know protect themselves against against this and you know i i've told this story before but it's it's really like what has shaped my my view of the world and why i think crypto is so so valuable and it's my own experience with inflation and currency controls because i was earning argentine pesos as a bloomberg reporter in argentina so i really felt um you know the the impact of what inflation can do to your savings you know it's like 25 inflation at the time that i was there meant um you know keeping any any pesos in the bank uh meant looks losing out on on my savings and my money so um like as soon as i got to argentina the first thing i was told was you need to convert your pesos to dollars and that's how everyone thinks like everyone thinks in dollars and if you ask any like anyone on the street they'll tell you the exact dollar rate that day like it's just like very kind of ingrained in argentine culture um and so to to have like the president one day announce you can't buy dollars anymore it was just like a huge shock like how how could it be that uh like the government can one day tell me what i can and can't do with the money that i earned and that's in like my bank account um so that like really shook me um like i literally like after the announcement i i still had some like argentine pesos in my bank account and before i like i had a peso account and a dollar account and there was just like this very easy way of transferring money from one account to another and then after the announcement like i went to to my bank and the option just like wasn't there anymore like just like wasn't there so i'm like stuck in pesos for like whatever amount i had got robbed yeah rocked by the argentine government um so so yeah so then like i i somebody um actually like an argentine bloomberg reporter who was based in spain told me there's this bitcoin thing that's really gaining steam in argentina like i have like bunch of friends talking about it's going to meetups and stuff so i i looked into it and had to convince my editors of bloomberg that this was actually kind of worth reporting um and and that's kind of the first story i wrote about crypto ever in 2013. um and then from there i was just like really interested i was like okay this is really valuable it's a currency that's independent that doesn't have any central banks or you know can't be censored and so on so that was kind of my first look um at crypto that story that you wrote um in 2013 right after you uh experienced capital controls you said you wrote that was the first story that you wrote was it a story about people using bitcoin as a result of the capital controls or was it more just a story about bitcoin itself and the only thing that it was the capital control story that motivated the story what was the actual story yeah no it was a story about you know there's there's always inflation uh there's capital controls and there's this like growing community in argentina that they are is is using bitcoin to protect themselves against inflation and so there's the story looked at that like uh interviewed a couple of people in argentina who were like uh buying bitcoin i think and um and then just like gave context oh like bitcoin this year surpassed a thousand dollars for the first time you know so i i made the uh naive mistake of assuming that you started off with uh ethereum somehow uh because i always thought that like you uh had gotten into uh writing for bloomberg and then and then learned about this ethereum thing and then wanted to write about ethereum i actually didn't know that you actually had such an early history with bitcoin all the way back in in 2013. yeah but it was like that one story um after that like i just like kept writing market stories about argentina um and then i moved to to madrid uh i was there for uh two and a half years uh writing about european stocks like like didn't think about crypto very much at all at the time so the bitcoin brain virus didn't make it into your head no it's just like something like oh like this is interesting uh this is like really cool um but no it didn't like totally consume me like it didn't go down like this like a rabbit hole that like dragged me in and then like didn't let me out no like it was like okay this is interesting this is valuable i see that crypto is cool um but then i just like kept on with with my life unfortunately i didn't even buy bitcoin so yeah and and then yeah like i kept you know writing just like regular trad 5 market stories and until i moved back to new york with bloomberg in in 2017 and at the time i was with this theme called market flight which just blogged about a like real time market move uh for for the bloomberg terminal and it was cool because like we had the flexibility of writing about whatever was interesting in the market and it was just like like quick blog post like maybe like two like two graphs and like on that chart or something um and so 2017 obviously huge year for crypto and because i was already like i knew something about it i had kind of like kept er just like informed about the space um and so i just like kept writing like uh blogs blog posts for markets live and then my editor for actually um interested in me covering crypto for for like elsewhere in bloomberg because there was just like huge demand and interest for crypto that year like anything with bitcoin on the headline would jump to the most red on the bloomberg terminal and there just like weren't any like dedicated crypto journalists um at bloomberg and since i had an interest they were like can you cover this thing so i i started to have this like like second job which was to cover the crypto market um and that that's when i i learned about ethereum and because like a lot of the story that year was icos right so i wrote the first like ico story for bloomberg and trying to like understand like it was just like very strange to me like oh like all these different coins like where do they come from like what are they like does every single one pump right everything is green um it's yeah it was it was really strange and then i realized oh like all of these coins come from this like mega coin like ethereum i have never heard i've never heard ethereum be called the mega coin yet that's awesome yeah like this is the origin of like all these coins is this this thing oh it's like oh that's interesting um and and yeah that's that's kind of how i started like really writing about about crypto and just like never stopped writing since uh 2017 that really just like fascinated me and consumed me and then end of 2017 i i pitched to write um a book on ethereum and and yeah and yeah like writing for the infinite machine that like really um it was like ethereum was like all i i heard about for like two years why did ethereum uh consume you in a way that bitcoin didn't um you know like i think the truth is i i just thought the stories um behind ethereum were were more interesting um just like the people uh behind ethereum um i mean on one hand like the story of bitcoin had pretty much you know had had been told um and i don't like you you didn't find as much activity then uh even then like of course like now it's it's self-evident um how much more activity there is on on bitcoin than on on ethereum than on bitcoin but even then it was like pretty clear you know like all of this um all of all of the like craziness and like weirdness of like the 2017 bubble like so much of it came from from ethereum like from from icos and like all these like crazy projects um and yeah you can you can like you know we don't look down on them and whatever but of course like so many good things came came out of that time like a lot of the top d5 projects came out from from that big boom so i don't know i think i think icos get an unfairly bad reputation i think actually a lot of good came came out with that boom um but anyways i think that that's what really kind of um captured my attention just like all of these like crazy dreams like crazy idealist like just like all the the the people uh building stuff or like just like even even the scammers you know just like um like all those stories i thought it was just like super interesting and just like from um like like from going going back to the tech uh i thought you know okay so bitcoin was this was the first cryptocurrency and it wanted to be peer-to-peer money and that's what it does but then ethereum like when i started to really kind of understand what it does so ethereum wants to be a programmable version of bitcoin and it wants to allow for peer-to-peer everything not just period of your money so that to me just like felt like a fundamental step forward in blockchain history and that was just like worth documenting like i i thought you know even if ethereum doesn't make it um it was still the first blockchain to do this so it's worth telling the story like it was worth like spending all the time to to write a book about it was there a specific moment that you remember where you were like oh yeah i'm all in on this thing now like i i let bitcoin come and go just because it is what it is but i'm not letting this ethereum thing come and go or this defy thing come and go is there is there like a moment that you had where like oh i don't want i'm i'm now completely focused on crypto i think it was very gradual it was just like okay so i at bloomberg i started writing about crypto and to me that was just like the most interesting story in markets and finance period like you know um it going going back to any other market would have been extremely boring so i i did not want to do that like crypto was my space um and so yeah i was like writing about crypto every day and for a while like i didn't see myself ever leaving bloomberg like okay so i even pitched bloomberg's for i i wanted to be the crypto team leader and i i i thought okay maybe that's kind of my path you know like i build out the crypto team at bloomberg um they didn't listen to me uh back then and now they're they're building their crypto team i really wanna we're gonna put a pin on that one and come back to that one later but but keep going yeah so it was yeah it was gradual i was like started writing about crypto then um thought it was really you know it was really a a good opportunity to write a book on the history of ethereum um and then like writing the infinite machine i i really made a like i really wanted to immerse myself in the ethereum community because i i think what's important about ethereum is that like it's it's it's it's strength you know the it's the ethereum community is ethereum's strength you know like other other blockchains can claim to have faster tech or whatever but ethereum is still leading because it has like all these all these people uh building on top of it so i wanted to like see this community so i went to like all the conferences and hackathons and um and so that's when i i realized you know these guys and and gals are building something real you know this is different from icos like this stuff is actually working it has users and volume um and to me that was just like incredible you know like when i started seeing that in in 2019 it's like this actually looks like a like a parallel financial system and we're watching it grow from from the ground up like it's emerging in front of our eyes and i was like this is incredible like how is nobody seeing this like this is such a huge story um it's so important like this this is making like we're making history like this is this will change the world so to me like just that um when i realized that i'm like this is such such a huge opportunity to be here at this time like and it just like didn't make sense to to be a bloomberg reporter uh like writing about any other market anymore it's like no like this is huge like this is where i need to be who was the first like big ethereum person that you met when you were going to these conferences and getting introduced into the community um the first let's see i mean my first like interview with an ethereum co-founder was charles hoskinson this is for the book yeah yeah i had actually interviewed him for bloomberg for like a separate story i don't know i don't know why like i don't know why for some i i can't remember for some reason i i got his contact um and of course like at the time 2017 reported i had i didn't know like the backstory or anything um and cardano was really like just still just like a project um at the time like an idea legendary but i thought it was a project but i'll keep that to myself i didn't say that that was me yeah so um yeah i don't know so obviously you see ethereum co-founder i'm like oh like this guy's a big deal and so i interviewed him for a story of bloomberg and um and i remember that story went viral it was like he was like yeah this thing is a bubble and at the time like you didn't really like crypto people didn't really say that you know at like before the like the the peak and so the headline was like ethereum co-founder says crypto is a bubble and that story just like went nuts because that's exactly what a lot of bloomberg readers wanted to hear so anyway so i had that that um contact uh made with him and so for like at the time of the book i i interviewed him first to just like start like making my initial initial outline and then um another uh a an interesting story on how i met one and another ethereum co-founder is how i met amir chatrid and he's like one of the lesser known uh ethereum co-founders of the original kind of eighth um and i don't know like i i think like i had researched him online like he doesn't have he's not on social social media like he there's not like an official like company or fund or anything like there's like there was like no no way of getting to it i was like i don't know how i'm gonna interview this guy and then uh this was like consensus 2018 or 2017 it was like maybe like consensus invest 2018 or something like may march i don't well something around there and i was getting coffee um at like i don't know one of like the side booths and then like this guy comes up to me and just like starts like chatting like hey like uh how are you finding the conference i'm like oh i'm good i'm i'm here reporting i'm writing a book on ethereum and then the the guy's friend like starts cracking up he's like ah oh you're gonna wanna speak to this time like why like who are you and and amir was like no no no no like no don't it's exactly what i would expect his reaction to be yeah and the friend was like no no really like you you need to talk to this guy and sorry i first and he's like fine like i'm one of the girls or like the friend told me he's like you know he's like one of the three co-founders and that's like what i'm looking like that was so lucky yeah i don't know hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with cami thus far we're going to get into the second half of the show very shortly here where we talk about cami's book her building the defiant where the vision for the defiant came from and where it's going to go so all of that and more right after we take a short moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbetrom you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many d5 applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitram and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite device apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space okay so uh we got a little bit ahead of ourselves i want to go back and uh uh you you had to pitch someone that they needed to fund this book that you were going to write about ethereum right like uh i've never written a book so i don't know what this process is like um can you can you tell us the story of the genesis of the idea for the ethereum book and what you had to do to actually turn this idea into reality um sure yeah that was um so how what happened um i was reading the spider network by um [Music] oh my god i'm blanking on david er early early i'm not sure how you pronounce david early um and i i looked them up like i was reading the spider network and it's exactly the kind of book that i always wanted to write the kind of like michael lewis type book you know it's like uh like nonfiction but told in a narrative way so that it it seems like a fiction novel and it was like written like really perfectly and like with so much reporting behind it and i'm like this is the book this is like this but for ethereum and so i looked him up and saw that he was in new york and uh i asked him if he could get coffee and he graciously said yes so i was like yeah just i i want to write the kind of book you did how did he do it and what what should i do um and he put me in touch with his agent and um and then yeah just like the email was probably like hey i want to write a book about crypto thinking about the story of ethereum and agent was like yeah wow do it wow yes that was that was really that was really lucky yeah were you surprised that it was immediate yes yeah i was really surprised because i like obviously google like how to like write a book and i've heard um you know like so many horror stories about being rejected by 20 agents and you know so yeah no that was i was really lucky to just like reach out to uh to david and and he put me in touch with uh with my agent and um and then my agent was like instantly like into a crypto book um so yeah i met with with dan mandel and uh told him my idea for this book uh which you know from the start was it was meant to be a non-technical book about the history of ethereum just like the people behind it the founding story the like challenges the funny thing met how they overcame that it was just like more like a people story um about ethereum and and he he really liked the idea and so uh i had to write this like very like complicated uh book proposal complicated in the sense of like why did it have to include it it was really like um almost like like a like a business model a provost um like a business pitch uh it was okay so what what's this book why me why now um a sample chapter like i had to write out a chapter i had to write out the outline of the book with like chapter by chapter um like summaries like each chapter has had like uh a couple of paragraphs summary so just like this huge document like what other like like the competitive analysis like what other similar books are there um out there how did they do it's just like this whole thing like it took a like a while to put together and then with that uh dan sent that a pitch out to a bunch of editorials and and that process was like it was so nerve-wracking uh we had like the tier one uh editorials so i started like hearing back from penguin and like i don't know like the other big ones and some of them were like just really mean like no we don't like her writing like oh and that like really kind of like oh right wow right right to the heart wow right to the heart yeah or like no crypto is dumb you know that doesn't hurt that much because you know it's not true but like i don't know if like my writing is actually but you know um so but finally you know um harpercollins like one of the the bigger ones that yes like the third they're interested um yeah that was like one of the best days um getting that email like harper is interested um did you think there was a chance that uh no one was gonna say yes oh yeah i mean i thought maybe you know like maybe i would i would i would still publish the book like i would self-publish i would find that way like i i never thought that the book wouldn't get written like i was totally convinced this would get done but yeah i i didn't know like who would be interested i was like completely bored to find that um that harbor colonies was and then um yeah then it was like they're interested uh they made an offer like uh for um an advance on the book and then the next step was like meeting with with the editor and seeing if they like me uh because apparently like you need to like sell yourself as an author too so that was yeah um so yeah that was a really fun interesting process like i i i i don't know i i was like painting myself throughout that whole thing just like going down to harper collins office in like downtown manhattan and like this huge like high rise and amazing offices and just like meeting this like badass editor of like she um she's uh my daughter was the uh the head of like the business section for for harpercollin um so that was amazing and and then like she she was just like really like an amazing editor like she had like really good um comments on like of the book that was like one of my my like concerns going into the process because i know like i had the experience of bloomberg editors and they are brutal like they just like take your stuff apart and you know it's like um constant like revisions and stuff um so i assumed it would be the same with with this book and maybe i would have to like make compromises on what i i wanted to say um but no hollis uh my editor was amazing like she all of her like input was on point and like when when i said no i actually want to keep this she was like fine uh she yeah so i i had i had such a good experience with that um i will say though like the next book i write which i hope to write a second book i really want to do it the um this intermediate way you know self-publish uh advanced from the community uh nfc cover whatever like i i had my my my you know my my time with editors and editorials and publishers and it was great but i think we have the tools now that i don't i don't need them anymore story polish i i really like you but you know well when you are literally writing about a decentralized financial ecosystem it makes sense that you can find a way to decentralize the in a decentralized manner finance a book especially when you already have the record of having this book under your belt as well yeah yeah i hope so i hope that's okay i've been like thinking about it for for some time and yeah i think i think it would be a really cool project i i as soon as i find the time which i don't know when but at some point i'll find the time to do that yeah that's the funny thing about working in crypto is no one really seems to have any time anymore no but uh cammy i do have to give you all the praise that you deserve because you talk about you talked about how um the thing that really set ethereum apart is its community and i mean this was certainly true all the way back to almost perhaps even the genesis of ethereum and but it's only become more and more true as time has gone on and i think um as a quick little history lesson of people that weren't around in ethereum in 2017 versus where it is now in 2017 the developers of ethereum and and the investors in ethereum and then also like the whole ico side of things those are all very separate communities they weren't very cohered at all and slowly over those three years that community of developers investors users builders became more and more into the same like canonical ethereum community and i really think it was your book the infamous infinite machine that we can credit a lot of that too because for me an individual who came in in 2017 like i didn't i didn't know half of the things that you discovered in in the book and we needed that like documentation as like a hey this is actually how this happened like this happened two years ago no one's documented it because like this space moves so incredibly fast so like for me the reading that book there was a very much just like a zero to one moment for understanding where we are in ethereum history and and my place in it as somebody that came in in 2017 and where we're going now and so like the books like that book in particular i think did a fantastic job actually allowing the broader ethereum community to identify itself and really like cohere around a shared vision and so thank you for for that invaluable contribution oh david thank you so much no i really appreciate you saying that um i i mean i i did not think that would be like that wasn't my my goal um going into writing this book but i i'm so glad that's that's been the case for for a lot of people like i it's in incredible to me to just see a lot of the the reactions to to my book and just like hear from people who would tell me you know the reason i i got into ethereum was because of your book or or i i decided that i i wanted to you know start building on ethereum because of your book like that sort of feedback just i don't know is makes like the whole experience uh so worth it and it's kind of what what makes me want to do it again because like you you make an actual impact on on people like you you you really you know can um contain people's lives a little bit or just like help them like find find their way so yeah no thank you oh of course no you you deserve all of it and like you know ethereum will pull people in it'll it'll pull like the investors in because of its reasons it'll pull the tech builders in for its reasons but if we're going to pull everyone in like it's going to be through stories stories or stories are how we're going to scale this whole entire thing out to literally everyone who can't figure out like why should i care about this whole ethereum thing and like if they're not investors and they don't know how to code like what really is it in in it for them and i think in order to pitch it to them like stories have to be like the last mile to get everyone into this whole entire like movement it's so true and you know i i think um that's where communicators like like you uh and and myself and like so many great uh content creators in this space uh come in um and i i think you know ethereum and and and just like blockchain uh the blockchain space in general has this kind of disadvantage that because it's it's tech um all of the early people in it are you know developers and developers aren't great at communicating they speak different they're they're a different breed yeah i mean they're they're their thing is like building stuff so they're not there i mean it's not their job to to do that like they're you know they're busy creating this stuff so um i i think it's it's so key to have communicators out there representing um you know hope like holding up a window for for people who are not in this space into uh what what what um like all the activity and the potential that there is here so yeah i i do believe that uh stories uh and and like stories about the people is is what it brings people in but also just like the growing um number of use cases uh i think you know that's been really interesting to see this year uh so before i think like the main use case for for ethereum and crypto was um just like investing and financial right like buying and selling tokens and trading um but this year with with nfts we we really kind of have seen this like new wave of users that come in like there's creators now and like musicians and artists um leveraging this tech to connect with their audience to to monetize their their um their art in ways that they couldn't before and and so you know it's like yes like part of it is um communicators amplifying this message and and communicating what's what's happening but um but part of it is just like this this technology will continue to grow to enable new use cases that will bring different sectors of society in and you know it was like started with finance we're seeing uh artists now and you know i think we'll we'll we'll continue seeing other other use cases and and other like sectors of society coming to crypto that way 100 100 um cammy i said earlier that we were going to stick a pin in something and i i think i think it's time to go back to that um when did the motivations to start the divine income uh well that's like pretty much um i mean that's related to what i said before it's just like writing the infinite machine being immersed in the ethereum community and seeing defy emerge um i just thought you know like there's a huge opportunity here to uh to tell this story um nobody was doing it like at the time when i started the in 2019 there were no uh d5 focused newsletters like i asked around i was like how like like again like how is nobody seeing this like even like crypto media like coined this on the block they weren't covering d5 of course like mainstream media wasn't covering d5 but like okay like this is like the biggest revolution in finance like in i don't know how long and nobody's covering it um and so that's what it felt like to be an ethereum in 2019. everyone who cared about aetherium and d5 was like am i crazy or is it like what is going on here why are people care about this thing yeah yeah it's it was insane and and so um you know i thought i had already i left bloomberg in january of 2019 because i wanted to uh finish the infinite machine in the best way possible and i didn't feel i could do that while at bloomberg and i also thought eight years at the same place was enough time and i just wanted to be my initial um plan was to become an independent journalist and just like freelance and write about crypto and fintech or whatever but then yeah like i started seeing d5 and like the huge opportunity there was and so i thought you know i would be a freelance writer and have this d5 newsletter on the side and um as soon as i turned in uh my first draft of the infinite machine i um i sent out the first uh defined newsletter a week later on june 11 of 2019 um and so yeah i thought you know this this is gonna be something that i do on the side you know in the afternoon like after my freelance work and and maybe like i mean i obviously had seen how other writers were um were using substance to turn on subscriptions i was like maybe this would be a good a good way to like like supplement my my freelance income which i didn't expect to be so so big so yeah that was the whole plan with the defiance um but then obviously like i i saw it was there was a potential for or something a lot bigger than just like a tiny newsletter totally yeah yeah you said when you were at uh the defying you said you wanted to lead uh the crypto team right or excuse me at bloomberg you wanted to leave the uh the crypto team and they're like yeah now crypto it's it's that weird thing we don't need that which is like the the greatest thing about crypto is that like we generally don't get any help externally as an industry like no one no one outside of crypto helps us we have to learn how to help ourselves uh and so the uh the crypto native we have to make our own institutions like bloomberg's not going to write defy stuff on our behalf and so we need to do it ourselves uh and so like you know the the media has to come from inside the industry uh and so all right you started the defiant it was just going to be a side gig newsletter to you know put some excess time into um but that's not what what it is now it's something much larger so when did you realize that the define could be something much more than a newsletter yeah so i started writing it and first of all like just like keeping up with d5 was a full-time job you know like um i was spending so much time between i was like writing um still writing my book during the day and then i would start writing the defiance like in the afternoon and i would go like really late into the night like to just like get it out the next morning and just like keeping up with all the news um yeah it was a lot so i i realized okay it's it's not so easy to like run a daily newsletter um and then you know it really started to like gain a lot of traction like people were subscribing i like i didn't i didn't really have any gold strategy or anything which was like my own twitter i i was sharing the defined that way and like people were sharing it and it just like started to grow so i i just like saw interest there for what i was doing and people were just like kept giving me amazing feedback um and then i decided to test whether you know people were willing to pay for that content so um i think it was like maybe november october uh i i i set up like the the paid version of the defiant which is basically you know i just like uh i had two versions and one version had more content and than the other and and like i realized people were willing to pay for the content i was producing and that was like that was mind-blowing to me because just like putting the defiant out there under like my own name without the bloomberg brand without like a dozen editors like looking after my stories that was like that was really scary um to start out with and then like to see not only like i can do this and like and and get readers and get people interested but like people are willing to pay for it for this content so that was like kind of the first sign that okay maybe there's something here um and then i started getting um like d5 projects on companies who wanted to sponsor the newsletter so i started just like getting emails being like hey like how much is the sponsorship and i wasn't offering sponsorships at the time so like not like no no was that a conscious choice is it like no i don't want sponsors i was like oh i forgot that i could sponsor this like the second one the second one yes i mean yeah um like i didn't i didn't think about it um and and at first it was also like i wonder like having sponsors will um you know affect like my journalism like that was also a concern so i was like i wasn't sure about the whole like sponsorship thing but that like at least i knew that people were interested in in paying for the defined like paying to be featured and paying to read it so i realized okay there's there's a business here and i decided to go all in and forget about freelancing and uh yeah just like make sure like that i could build it out into something bigger where'd the name defiant come from um uh i don't know i think it was like looking for variations of d5 yeah so like i think i have i have the notebook where i put down like all the different names like if i weekly d5 daily d5 standard whatever but then like um and my husband chris helped me out within it so i need to give him credit uh for that we were both like thinking about i think like on a plane um i don't like planes are such good good places to like brainstorm stuff like what else are you gonna do you really can focus yeah so i think it was on a plane that we were like both like going over this notebook of names and then i thought you know i don't want it to be so obvious like defy something um so it was like with that idea in mind like i wanted like yeah the sense of like defying um but and not have like like the actual name d5 and yeah but not not actually d5 but close enough close enough yeah i remember in uh it might have been 2018 so this might have been settled by then but i definitely think it went into 2019 there was a time where me eric connor ryan sean adams we were like defy is a shitty name like open fi oh open finance is better were you were you watching us have that those conversations on twitter and you're like i hope these guys like stop doing this i think so i think so um i know yeah i don't know if it's a great name i but whatever you know i think like it is what it is like at this point at this point it's absolutely stuck yeah and the define is a fantastic name it exudes so much of crypto values in a single word which i think is fantastic thank you yeah i know i i really love it and then like yeah i designed the logo on on canva myself you'll need to get like an actual designer right yeah no this is the same thing at bankless i just i i picked out the font drew a red line under the word bankless and then boom that's been our logo since day one and it works it's awesome okay so uh when did you hire your first employee at the defiant who was that ah good question um well hmm so employee different from contributor right so i had paid labor who was the first paid labor yeah uh who was it you know it it might have been lucas who's adventless now oh no way really seriously i think so that's funny yeah he i don't know if he was at first it was definitely one of the first there was i don't know how to say it in in english but this guy is seva from argentina he was also writing for the defiant and then cooper right he was also one of the first writers so yeah i had kind of a bad plan um when did the vision change from just a newsletter that you realized that you could monetize to a much more grand media company was it where is there ever an like aha moment or was that just kind of a slow transition it was also a slow transition it was um like okay i had the daily newsletter then i decided i wanted to have a weekly interview and with the weekly interview it was already recording it so i was like might as well have a podcast so that happened and then robin uh reached out because uh he had interviewed me for a documentary while he was at harmony and he said we are looking to like reach the defy audience so can i make videos for the defiant and like harmony appears as a sponsor uh but like we just like make videos about deepak and like as long as like we don't have to talk about harmony that's fine like um and so he started uh like he started the defiance youtube channel um at first just like doing this like kind of joint partnership with harmony and and then i brought him on full-time um and so yeah that was like suddenly i had a lot of content because i had a bunch of contributors writing stories for the newsletter i had the podcast and i had the videos um and so it just like it didn't make sense like the define just like started to look like like more of like a like a media company than a newsletter because we had like all these like these different types of content um and it just like didn't fit in the newsletter anymore like it didn't make sense to have like all those stories it just like was getting too like unwieldy so um so i i made a wordpress uh website um together with with a designer and i just started like you know publishing on the website primarily and then the newsletter was uh the summary of done um elsewhere um and with that then like when when all those pieces started uh to to emerge then is like i started to have like like a bigger vision uh for the defiant this was yeah probably um early last last year um i started to see you know there's there's something bigger here um and you know with my background at bloomberg to me information is content and data like you you know it's like you need uh both of them because you know it's like you you you you tell stories um you you write and you know you you communicate stories uh but you also need to provide the data for people to um you know see see what's happening in the market and on chain themselves yeah without the data it's just subjective stories which is what you wanted to get away from way back exactly exactly yeah um and i thought you know nobody's doing the data uh part right you know like i i think the d5 data space is really fragmented um i think you know that you have like different trackers and websites doing very specific things but you don't have like one place to get all of the definite defi data that you you could need um and you know there's also you you just like can't get the same user experience you can with a bloomberg terminal so i was just like really missing that um that ability of just like this like magical black box that i described earlier you know like okay you you get to this place you you start typing up something and it comes up and you can chart it and compare it with other other things and other metrics you just don't have that um and it's so needed so um yeah i decided you know this is what the define should be it should be the bloomberg of d5 so we become the most trusted uh like journalistic new source for d5 and we provide the data to track and and analyze its face um and that's kind of when the big vision formed and it became clear to me this is what i need to do like this is the big vision and this is what's like really needed in this space so the the you recently launched that data platform so this just is almost going back to what we were saying at the very beginning where like who you are seems to be a very logical combination of like all the components of your family and so this also seems to be that what the define turning is turning into it seems to be a large a very logical conclusion of your history as a journalist right like love journalism but you love journalism even more when it's grounded in objective facts that no one can argue with right uh and and so like the define is turning into this one one and a half um one half story one half information and one half data to back that up and you're doing that all in house and so you are trying to be like um yeah both both the story the story behind the data and then also the data simultaneously in in all the same spots yeah yeah exactly so we we we have the platform um to to get all the insights that you need from from deepline and we have the writers to like take those insights and put it into words and into context and and tell those stories do you do um where where does the where does narrative come into this or does it at all like more subjective more um uh you know yeah more more subjective less concrete like visions of like because everyone has like visions of what the future of crypto right it will be right like it's completely unwritten you know bitcoin is only only 12 years old but you know ethereum's only six years old d5 is only two and a half years old so there's a a bunch of competing narratives as to what the future of d5 looks like where does where does uh narrative fit into into the defiant or does it at all no i think that's frankly's job yeah yeah seriously yeah no i think um i think the defiance you know there is some level of subjectiveness like so our editorial point of view is that dfi is the future you know like we we believe in web 3 we believe the world will be increasingly decentralized we believe d5 will become finance but um how that happens on what chain you know who wins whatever like all of that we leave it to our readers to do our job is to report on the space objectively and you know to to tell the stories that are that are happening in the way that they're happening in a very kind of data backed way um and then the reader can decide for themselves what what they think is right or wrong or you know where they want to trade or or what you know they can make their own uh their own narrative um so of course there's like there's space for for opinion and we do have uh you know guest writers and we have of our beds and and i think robin is is uh pretty opinionated in in his coverage um so there there's room for that but i don't think the i mean the the main purpose of the defiant isn't that isn't to to like deliver a like a shaped narrative but it's to give people the tools to discover you know what their own narrative is to make to make up their own mind i i love that answer that's that's fantastic cami if uh the defiant is maximally successful what does it look like in five years ah okay so um i would i would love for for the defiance to be uh you know the the place where people can find um all of the well let's see i want to define to be the most trusted uh source of information for d5 um i wanted to illuminate the space uh for for people just like just coming in so like it's for it to be an education source for newcomers and for it to be a very powerful tool tool for insiders as well um but i also want to make a change in in journalism in general so you know of course um being in web 3. uh we are looking uh for ways we're looking at how uh media looks like in in web3 so you you guys at bankwest have done an amazing job in decentralizing uh banklet um i'm also looking at you know how that looks like for for like a news company for a media company because you know i i do want to open up the defiant um and i want to do it in a way that stays true to our mission of providing like trusted information so you know there's like it is it is a bit of a challenge there because you need to retain some level of control to have that kind of just like standards and and like quality for like news um but i think i think there's a way to do that in in a more decentralized way so yeah um i want i want the define to be the most trusted information source for d5 and i also want wanted to just like push boundaries on of what media looks like in web 3. and what the the ultimate goal that i that i want the defiance to help shape is it's just like a better version of journalism like what if like the web 3 media model improves uh like traditional journalism you know right right now investigative journalism is basically dead what if we can reshape media in a way that we can find new funding mechanisms and and and you know new ways to organize community so that we we can create uh we can revive investigative journalism um and and we can what if this like new media model uh makes it so that you know the the bigger stories come from just like a whip with three native uh community um so that's that's kind of the ambition that's that's still kind of not fully formed but that's really exciting and and inspiring for for me and like where i want to take the define going forward well we all know that this whole web 3 phenomenon is a place to tinker with incentives and where uh web 2 generally all incentives and alignments is kindly broken down and like in the world of journalism it's exactly what you said where there's no more investigative journalism there's only there's only stories and narratives left uh in in the web 2 world in my opinion um and and so that that is a very bullish uh outlook for the world of media and i i definitely hope that something definitely fulfills this vision of re-orchestrate uh incentives with regards to journalism i think we have such a big opportunity here like i think i think we're all gonna make it nice nice um just a last few quick questions um what's it like to be in crypto in new york oh it's awesome um yeah uh actually like i i am i am launching this co-working space in in brooklyn um so uh it's cool like there's like uh lots of projects and people um based here um i think you know the city is coming alive again with with meetups and and parties and um just like you know just random meetings uh that i think it's it's like when in the middle of the pandemic we kind of forgot how useful those things were it's like okay like we can do everything uh from from our apartment on zoom but like those like just like random conversations and meetings and and meetups are you know you can't really replace them so it's good to be in a city that just like has that community and and those opportunities so that's that's something i want to enable in the defiance covering space colony so well i missed going to your uh office launch event last time i was in new york but maybe i will be able to see you for nft nyc oh yeah you should drop by yeah yeah absolutely okay yeah i'd love to have you here and i think we're we're doing there's going to be like an nft scavenger hunt um that means but that sounds like a ton of fun yeah yeah and i think one of the spots will be the defiant office so you can also get an nfc out of your trip awesome well we all love nfts cammy one one last question for you are you a pessimist or an optimist absolutely an optimist yeah what about the world makes you optimistic i mean look at where like look at where we're what we're doing like we're we're changing the world we're changing finance we're changing you know how people organize um yeah i'm i'm hugely optimistic that um that this this technology uh is going to change things for the better like i just think it's inherently uh better more efficient it's you know literally cuts out intermediaries so make things faster and better so at its core it's it's better tech and so that means that we we have the the opportunity of improving how things work i think that's that's hugely bullish and uh makes me super optimistic about the future um and also just very grateful to be to be part of it to be here well cami i'm grateful for you coming on and spending an hour half with me so
