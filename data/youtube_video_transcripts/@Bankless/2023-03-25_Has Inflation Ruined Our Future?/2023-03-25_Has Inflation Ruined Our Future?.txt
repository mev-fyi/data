America is the new Argentina there's new rampant inflation I would say it's not just America this is the whole Fiat banking system because while America is the worst example of this it's in Europe it's in China it's in everywhere everybody said I'm gonna borrow from the future to fund stuff today because that gets me elected that was the game everybody played the game Future's over unless we're gonna discover some new sorts of energy that's extremely dense then we got to pay this debt right and it's going to come in the form of inflation and zero to no growth for a very very long time so the answer to the question who's taking the L is not just the US dollar but it's the entire Fiat regime exactly
