all right welcome everyone to the chess for publix goods tournament this is the first ever chess four public goods tournament that we are kicking off git coin round eight celebrating public goods celebrating chess but also having a chance for the greater world of ethereum of crypto to come together and for once do something that's not about crypto or ethereum so this is a time to celebrate i think that public goods is something to celebrate i also think chess is something to celebrate and i also think that corralling a bunch of community members to engage in some sort of game is a really worthwhile thing to do the tournament is going to get started here in just over a minute the way that this works is that there are going to be five minute games five minutes aside and so each player gets five minutes to make their moves and so if the time is exhausted the maximum amount of time a game can last is 10 minutes the way there's gonna be this is gonna be split into two phases where everyone plays everyone else it's just a mosh pit winners get points losers don't get points and you are constantly cycling through other players as you tally up points that is going to go on for 90 minutes the top four scorers are going to move on to the championship bracket if you can win two games after that point you are the git coin round eight chess champion uh the time controls for the brackets are going to uh get extended the first game of the four of these four total games will be 10 minutes aside so we're doubling the time and then the second game the second set of the championship game will be 15 minutes aside and so the the way that this stream works is i have my window up on the left i have the a different window up on the right i am going to do my best to play chess stream chess and commentate on chess all at the same time and then meanwhile on the right side i will be cycling through some of the games we have players in the zoom stream as well so thank you everyone for joining and i think it's ready to rumble it's time let's get going guys i'm gonna have to figure out the uh how to get oh here we go all right alpha fan and jabel the two highest scorers getting ready to go and let's see if i can oh i'm playing a leighton lincoln cusack of uh of pool together leighton it's good to see you on the chess stream my two sons are playing each other yeah we got a family as well oh leighton you dirty dog oh man i close a tab i think i just missed the first round oh you should be you should hop into a game if there's somebody waiting you'll hop into that one or you yes you'll have to wait for a loser or a winner oh someone's already got two points stream oh we had we had plenty of conversation at the start and then all of a sudden the chest starts playing and everyone focuses up yeah i blundered already i mean i'll i'll give i'll give the commentary yeah who are who are you joseph i am jay charizzi and oh there we are okay we got you here you're on the right side of my screen yeah this is trash opening look at this bishop's way over here go back go back go back home yeah i'm in control can't get out of here kevin coming in at the last possible minute are you in the chess lobby kevin no um i don't think i have a google calendar invite so oh they're just wandering aimlessly uh all right chess lobby then the link plus tournament link okay i hope i get matched against joseph joe you beat me at east denver last year two games uh yeah i'm pretty sure i'd beat you more than once yeah two two games out of three i'm pretty sure i beat you the year before too if i remember correctly [Music] leave my talk on the chessboard joe i mean i'm gonna do that too oh yeah yeah yeah i am already in trouble damn it laden yeah this is gonna be a long game why can't you guys play fast games i think i'm not them there's leighton hey what up man what am i playing right now i just did playing me bro best stuff ever yeah that was ridiculous i don't even know what i did there you're by the way lightning your game's on the stream fun fact what is that because you're playing me and so i i'm you know you know essence as the owner of the stream streaming my game nice well anyone in here milky way milky way 20 also the second lowest ranked player playing me the lowest ranked player in the tournament joe do you have rich pizza from youtube i'm orion1992 it's a very old name i i made this chess name before i made trustless date so that's why you don't recognize it fun fact who am i playing gczy oh this is gonna be such a slow game i play three-minute games on chess.com i'm very much into yolo chess i'm the exact opposite really sounds yeah this is too fast for me five minute games is actually where i find myself playing the most amount of games is that is that why you made the tournament five minute games oh wow it just happened oh there we go uh yes that's exactly well it was it was also about the right time um maybe they could have been a little bit faster i thought this might be you this is usually where games go though usually i am winning and then something happens yeah i'm a little bit under uh coordination pressure at the moment and so that's partly my excuse exactly i'm actually trading right now all right this is actually the right place to ask this question i just got airdropped badger tokens oh yeah uh what what do they do or do you sell them those are different on unislops for wrapped bitcoin thinking protected exactly they're trying to make d5 tools available for btc on ethereum that's that's their deal [Music] so is that different from tbdc or wbtc uh they're not trying to do tokenized bitcoin they are trying to make tokenized bitcoin services okay this is not a fun position for me right now let's try my second hmm uh you uh olaki what's your name milwaukee underscore bitcoin okay i'll i'll go to you next i don't know knows isn't it wow such yes such uh you can choose where you buy that personal brand i know i i've talked about the stream who i put on the stream oh nice nice nice oh i'm getting wrecked why am i so bad at this instead of not doing that what's happening i don't like it so predictable god damn it goodbye leighton oh wait what that was an extremely dumb move oh no i'm not on the stream yet am i david uh no you oh i'm about to put you on i just got checkmated well okay i'll put you on your next game did you get a second chance there's definitely a couple people here who are really good yeah for sure i mean i just made some dumb mistakes i've got 26 people that's a pretty good uh pretty good showing wait is there a link for the live stream i want to send to my team uh yeah it's in the let's see if i can i think it's in the telegram group did i put it in there yes oh that was a cry a victory not a oh not an answer to my question yeah i'll put a uh i'll put a link in there as well oh yeah good attendance i think i see it there it is all right who am i playing patty patta here we go david remind me what the tournament rules are because i already lost a game uh we play for 90 minutes uh you get points for every game you win each game has five minute time controls at the end of 90 minutes the top four scores we will do a bracket for okay if you do not score in the top four scores by the end of 90 minutes you are not playing chess anymore in the tournament forever kevin do it do it get the horse take it so am i am i on the stream no no you're not sorry i can figure it out and i have a game to play does the next game just start uh yeah so at once you hit the uh go back to tournament button once the game your game is over and then you are put in a lobby and if you are not immediately put into another game you just sit in the lobby until there's a game available for you to hop into it'll auto it'll automatically do it cool yeah i didn't realize that i had to hit because like i think when you resigned it paused my game and then like i had to like do something to get back i lost as well what happens when you draw uh you guys both get zero points nice what draws your zeros yes i believe draws are zeros yeah well the tournament faq page said that there were halves ah well since i you read it and i didn't i'm gonna go with you i just won because white didn't move or something listen winning by default is how i've made it through life rejoin do i have this join button i think if you i think if you go off the screen because i was like checking my bachelor to try and sell it and i think it like equipped me [Laughter] uh okay so are you are you not in the tournament right now badger is like going no i got back in but i just fyi if you like i think if you go off the screen it's probably an anti-cheating thing oh interesting but like my badger's crashing in price so i just trying to get on wrecked by badger twice oh when we're in the lobby what happens somebody pairs us or we just kind of sit here uh yeah the machine pairs you okay it's an algorithm it's very advantageous to play the most amount of games possible so you really want to get back in the game yeah yeah but if you're losing all of them it doesn't help then you just keep getting negative you get it negative for losing or you do you just go but you're giving away four one wins two losses of zero i need another game it means i gotta get back in the game i'm like there's a bunch of us spectating i don't know why it's not matching anyone maybe wait i got matched right away who's milky way 34 they're about the same as me i don't want to get distracted tim are you playing yes i'm playing he's playing jobble hmm oh that was a mistake your boy's getting some blunders in so much pressure right now i've never used lie chest and i like accidentally pre-moved twice without realizing it yeah i managed to pull out a draw but i was like i had no idea that i like pre-moved like my queen twice i stopped when when david sent out the invite i i switched from chess.com to lychee so i could practice nice yeah i'm still not being matched i'm just kind of sitting in the lobby how long has it been it's been like five minutes oh really that's weird is it is it telling you that is it telling you something about um waiting it says standby pairing players get ready yeah i have the same thing i've had that for a while too maybe it's because you and i just just played i think maybe it we'll make uh yeah but there says there's five p are are the spectators all playing or is that not people that are playing i think i don't think anyone can be a spectator and not be a player because i haven't like publicized the link yeah it's weird that it's not pairing us i don't know am i playing maybe it's running on solana hello [Laughter] oh and then i'm in good woo who am i playing milky way god it's bad who's the milky way i don't particularly like this happening at the opening no no no i do not like i really want to draw ah well i am leading the tournament in losses nice job david oh there we go all right all right panic let's do this playing yeah you're playing me is there a lead for amount of games yet for someone who's played the most i think there's only been people who haven't no one's completed a third game yet [Music] well someone someone has played three games yeah somebody with five points oh all right that's just happened panic moving his queen out very early how do you like that panic just got me on a on a stalemate like with three seconds left on the clock oh man that's brutal weirdly enough it didn't like why didn't it let us go all the way to zero seconds like i didn't quite understand that you did my guy's pretty dead one other thing you all should know about recess tournaments is um when you look in the lobby if someone has a little fire next to their name then they've won so many in a row and if they continue winning that those wins will be worth double i think i turned that feature off i'm going to turn that off is that called berserk no that's not the zerk is splitting your time in half so you win double points ah okay it says you're not allowed man i am just really just doing a fantastic job right now huh very interesting [Laughter] is anyone on the zoom channel winning one draw one win by default problem right now maybe um you're on the run man [Music] there we go gg oh crap what it's a tournament i thought i'd give it back to you but it's a tournament brother no that's that's fine that was uh that was a miss is it a misclick after i was doing so well too that was a miss click yeah it was kind of right sorry man but i'm taking those points and running it's okay i would expect nothing less oh that i was doing so well too that was a huge blonder yeah i'm going to resign too i'll give you this one what i think i might have just given it to you oh you're playing me yeah very surprised i get a free point i'm playing my son uh make uh ouch put me up again oh that blunder was the worst that's a pretty bad one yeah that's pretty bad but is this that does this just go for two hours 90 minutes or nine minutes and you do as many games as you get into run through games as long as as many games as possible yeah so it actually does incentivize being like a little bit like risky and definitely incentivizes risk because you want you want to win games and you want to win them quickly and is there a winner like what's or is like yeah so the whoever scored the top four scorers after the last 90 of the after 90 minutes of play is completed we'll go into a bracket and there'll be two more games after that my brother and my dad you'll get a chance and how many bits there are this is such a nasty game just like really bad players including myself dang it did i just freaking ugh um [Laughter] oh man who's milky way speak for yourself i'm such a bad in the game because it's looking pretty dark for you bro yeah those there's up there there's derrick toast yeah i got it just got it to check me there's a little white flag icon over there where is that at it's on the right hand side next to the um kevin's just guiding him into some points yeah yeah like here's here's how you do it yeah i just got my queen there and got wrecked i just just playing too fast uh i can't believe i just did that let me think about that for the rest of the weekend yeah well just how bad i just screwed that game up sorry it's just a game secretary public goods or something all right it's me and pitta at the top number one verse number two huh yeah he's probably gonna win it looks like i don't know we'll see his ratings much higher than mine is embaler in here that's me wait who oh that's you mike that's me yeah yeah i don't know who that is are they in the are they in the zoom pita first time one game won't change much kevin's so quick to talk i ever saw you about my chest strategy no david uh getting their heads yeah so basically i'm not that great of a chess player but i can multitask i can like talk yeah yeah damn we were just trading pieces yeah i played that person we had a really messy game too it's like not it wasn't like good it's fun i mean that's what he likes about speed chess you just got to be decisive yeah damn this guy's just trying to trade city he ended up he ended up beating me which is frustrating i don't know i can't read his name okay i'm getting bad this is a dumb move don't move and bailey you had some good moves there thanks man when i don't give up my queen like in the first five moves it turned out okay just even yeah it's easy yeah i always find it easier to play when there's less pieces on the board like yeah at this point the thing is i don't want to there's a good chance i could end up drawing you by is that game that's game yeah that's game click questions then their timer will go out oh boy uh anyone else have that afternoon coffee right now nothing like it you're on the east coast right leighton yeah um and david it was so i saw um like that uh i don't know the royale guy or rael or whatever like the like investor dude i saw you in his video it was really cool oh raul paul yeah yeah yeah the that guy documentary yeah random person are they like they're like hedge fund famous or something who are they sorry i'm a software engineer i don't know anything about finance uh it's it's like a it's a media company uh about finance and global economics and he's making really big moves into the world of crypto um yeah i saw that video that you posted or with him like two weeks ago or something yeah well it's really done by like alex saunders uh who has a good relationship with real vision but yeah dude they did such a good job god damn it all right resigning for the third time um they did such a good job just like reaching out to everyone who can speak well about ethereum and just like putting it all into like a coherent documentary that's awesome oh kevin's on fire uh street what am i doing i know this is the fifth grade chess champion of campbellsville elementary school david oh boy oh boy so you know who you are i was the elementary school chess champion too i was homeschooled so i guess i was also the champion yeah i don't even know why i did that i had to make my homeschooler joke i can't multitask i'm so dumb why did i do that now you're just gonna wreck all my pawn structures [Music] kevin you're on the stream now i lost time for some reason you have a knack for switching to me when david [Laughter] [Music] nice job milky way get him wow 90 minutes is a long chest ceremony i did not realize that yeah i guess yeah it's like a long time usually the lead chest once they organize are only 30 minutes should i bump it down to 60 minutes yes yes is that a yes wait a minute don't do it [Music] no that's a funny name no but that's uh uh no i'm not even close i just made a stupid mistake who's that he's going to kill me that's it i'm out yes off the fan space

best thanks for teaching me how to throw he's an idiot today i am wow it's 20 20 man you can't admit you lost gotta wait until the uh and rubicon's a sneaky one you don't think they're gonna be good and then they're good can we recount my lawsuit only the legal moves man too much let's go talk about politics on public no it's just a good meme it's now a meme it's out of the realm of politics and into the world of memes i don't deserve to be like streaming my own game right now based on my performance i don't i don't deserve that privileged position of having every single game on the stream how many people are watching the stream now david no joe i got three i have youtube and some more on periscope too joe i was playing panic too he got that was the one with the like a minute second left before he was just moving his king around he's not gonna resign rick hmm kind of a absurd lack of self-awareness to put a username with 3k isn't it here's four there's four right there this is crypto man self-awareness there's no oracle for that i'm in the lobby chilling if anybody wants to uh move on from their game yeah you should watch our game you cannot just let your timer just just sit out that's number one is playing number three so one of them is going to lose their streak who's that maddie an alpha fan um come on yeah i didn't do that it was javel dabble is the highest rated player i don't know super sloppy glenn you're crushing me right now oh no yeah who are you i want to gloat i want to go because it's secure all right i'm done plenty one just realized i was on mute for like 15 minutes talking to myself good game who's he's the super rated man yeah but who is this poor woman i'm climbing down the ranks oh it's the rematch of the century kevin let's get it let's get it [Music] oh i'm gonna win by default again flappy moves just flossing a free move i might be someone someone who panic wait am i playing you right now is that the person who's going to lose you are you gonna listen quentin is one of the guys on the zoo um i'm talking about the oh there they moved with the kkk guy that was weird whoa whoa let's not let's not label him that yeah i think my internet just timed out oh sad oh that's bad joe i'm gonna get you man does he see it i just want you to know hopefully whoever is i'm playing against is not in the zoom because i definitely encourage you to try you or do not there is no try oh he didn't see it that's he could have uh pretty even so far so the last two guys i played were very yolo just like trading all the time and so i'm glad to be playing with someone who's is being a little bit more studied about it [Music] oh my god every single time yeah wow who's milky way again is that one of you wow i don't know how but from complete losing i got into a known position i know you have to also no you always switch me when i'm losing  i'm in such trouble um how do i get out of this you know maybe we play again another time you know trent looks like we got about 13 games going simultaneously i'm probably about 12. we got kevin owaki in fourth jabil in third we have we have three people tied for second actually and all three of them are on fire and one and two of them are playing each other wolf.ethe and jabel there's truly gabe kevin oh wait oh kevin should i give you that opening on on my east side uh you still have more points than me though because you won two in a row oh it has like a streak multiplier or something yeah yes yes you have you got a two a two a four and a four and i got a one a two a two zero three and two if it was regular i would be winning but it's not oh victor you're right ahead of me you also have a streak david are you um so this half button over here this is like double or nothing or something no the half button that's a drop oh sorry familiarizing with all the important ones sorry there's no flash loans you can't uh [Music] leverage a game a flashlight you could create a hundred queens as long as you lose them within the same the same turn [Music] which we had a map of who was who um from a from a username perspective i want to know who i'm playing yes it's a lot it's it's very few players so a lot of us will end up playing each other over again oh um hey but i gotta run in um 15 minutes i hope that doesn't mess up the tournament no not at all accidentally double booked myself just messes up your ability to win the tournament i get this guy's strategy like four moves in he's offering a draw and like nothing's been determined in the game [Laughter] what kind of mic you got there man snowball right i got it at the university bookstore i think it's a blue yeti snowball i think that's what that is it looks like it that's a weird pretty weird looking mic i'll tell you that kind of losing position into a draw that's nice [Music] oh no the reaper comes it's not good sportsmanship can just resign and move on right you guys ever played bug house before yes it's a lot of fun yes one of my it's my favorite type of speed chest i like it it's nice i think it's really bad you think it's really bad victor doesn't like it i like it i don't mind crazy oh this game is a draw offer this game is such a mess what you're doing now panic i don't know man i'm so bad all right get out of here gobble gobble yo why can't i move oh no [Music] all right pablo oh that was terrible i like the strategy at the beginning though i totally got my queen and then they went downhill oh yeah panic that really just fell apart on you right there yeah i'm trying to how can you resign like i keep trying to resign you got that flag button below the game twice oh wow both of my points both my wins have gone against panic julian bc comparison i beat him i think i lost him [Music] josh somebody in the youtube chat it says joshua at 18th why did i hire him that's good the john powell yeah it could be jon it's pawn in brooklyn he's running out of time i kissed my king

hitting my system and just stress is going through the roof somebody else this has been a tournament full of blunders at least from my point of view it's the glory of speeches [Music] wait clinton

username so i tried to figure out what letter to put ahead of it and i went with f for fox because nice nice uh your boy's got a little fire icon by his name coming from behind nice job let's go let's go [Laughter] this is exactly what happened last week we played everyone i gotta run all right thanks for coming thank you kevin better kevin i'm just going over this from uh git coin it's a grants

coder yeah well i wish i could work there me too man me too fade out git coin the new commercial um and get some coins exactly where this is gonna be i still don't remember who coined him is that's one of us i'll take your oh that's not what i wanted to do well okay i'll take you with this picture oh no my battery's running out oh that's a bummer bad way to lose his dress tournament i don't want to run to get it because then i'll lose a match [Music] well let's see whoever finishes first are you playing upon in brooklyn still i think i'm beating him don't say that it might become true i was thinking of all these different moves and i just thought i could take your rook oh bishop too you've been really getting smoked yeah you got fourth place now you're in first place wait i miscalculated what did you want to do exchanges [Music] oh great decent okay are you good extra points if you streak yeah mm-hmm that's why i got placed with one winner yeah it's really cool when that happens i wouldn't know the feeling [Laughter] i just stay in fourth place for another 32 minutes okay now i'm playing panic with a lot of k's i i resigned that's how bad i am this is an interesting start we're going for it oh i'm pinned oh oh that's just fantastic wow who's swift i'm pinned oh this this is bankless yeah what up we don't use we don't use banking things yeah nice i missed that joke witty look at my points oh wow alpha fan in the lead with 20 points oh no no jable in the lead with 22 points oh and they're playing each other oh that's oh we have the number one in number two right now i want to play one of them just see how bad i get crushed i just lost the alpha fan and i thought i was holding up pretty well and i think i was until you know a blender you know i'm not in last place anymore so i'm pretty happy oh i'm playing a reverse um all right guys we got 30 minutes left of play wow i really impressive end game there bad investment who's playing me who's darren quits oh no i dropped out of the top 10. born swift all right let's do this oh somebody just wanted to make to me somebody just won that whatever yeah i'm fourth place again 18 points okay [Music] yeah sure oh watch with my gameplay if you if you see start move for me okay how can i move for you i don't know what you're gonna do where's your charger i don't know i actually have a yiddish word for what you're doing yeah take your butt patty at the beginning i feel like i've gotten progressively stupider yeah mental fatigue 90 minutes of chest is not a small amount of time god that's dumb yeah i keep pondering exactly usually don't blunder this much but apparently today's the day oh that was another blunder yes yeah that was dumb i just kind of threw it at the end there i watched our vehicles [Music] it's probably time to resign you only have 20 seconds to play the first move otherwise you lose ah okay i hope he gives up really hopefully why i really need another point hey they need to be close to me trying to catch up with me whatever i do i do not want to play you again if i win this game i'll be next to jabba again for some reason i'm feeling if i win this game that's you did a really strange opening for me i didn't know how to play it from there actually i think i didn't think he's gonna give up because i just took i didn't know mute this [Music] so eighteen points to be in the top ten or top four that's a lot of points that's more points than i have because these guys are on fire yeah i got 12 right now i don't know why but i'm beating by oh wow 20 22 20. i'm looking there quickly yeah it's true if i won this game a lot 22. really yeah how much time do we have left in the whole tournament and got 25 more minutes in regular play 25 minutes yeah you got like four or five more games i need this player to give up [Music] i gotta do something crazy to throw him off this game i beat him on the last one yeah he's beautiful oh man showing some cracks he's super easy i don't know why or no actually wait i think he's one of the guys i lost too all right it's hard to remember i just remember having his name on the screen [Music] oh no he yeah he gave up he rage quit um he went too sacrificial and like all out attacking and made a mistake nice so you still need a chance um [Music] oh my god god damn it oh what happened he resigned never mind i blundered but i was going to wait because i had no time those are the best let's do this and this alpha fan jbl game is a nail biter looks like javelin's gonna win on time if you're playing jable that's a good sign that you're playing well oh god so bad so bad oh shhh in this tournament yeah the last five games or so but by the way so i drew i have 20 points that means yeah so you made it into the brackets far in fourth place with 20 points i drew the second place [Music] yeah uh sure alibi and youtube here's the uh the rankings right now are you still watching a movie i'm ranked number 23 and i just got

play oh joshua you're in the number one game right now no pressure or anything oh my gosh the draw he does not oh that was fun oh i blundered and he didn't catch it foreign i just did it again oh man we'll eat beat me with 10 seconds left not fair this game is rigged took the count exactly [Music] all right let's do this what's the point we're all gonna pull up anyway so you're doing the same thing you did last time it's my opening better opening last time you kind of screwed up i think because you uh yeah you you did the you did the variant of the opening that i don't like it that people do hate when people do things i don't like move down just before the brackets how many minutes left dude 13 more minutes to play at the top i see well also play ends at 1 30. fun fact get out of here leighton [Music] quinyan he's easy i feel like it's definitely resign time but i'm gonna make him finish it okay lost my strength maybe i just do this hey somebody's beating jebel though yes except jebel already has 32 points 11 minutes well it's time for like two games i'm disconnecting bye panic born swift oh why did you let him win papa like who win uh mr whatever his name is he beat me [Laughter] kids he was humiliating my kid chest though so what did you all say about wolf dodies um he beat me with him got a cool username all right he was very very very infuriating it's very aggressive what happens if you're in a game when the timer goes off uh you everyone gets to finish their games but it doesn't count for the tournament it does or it doesn't i thought it did count on the score i mean it should yeah i think everyone gets a chance to i mean i could be wrong somebody more informed would is better better place to speak but i think you get to finish whatever games you're in just no new games get to start excellent [Music] coin the wife's offering the kids ice cream things about to get real let's go man speed it up giving kids ice cream sounds like a contact sport my son doesn't like ice cream so we're very lucky oh that's pretty duh duh i'm playing david ah bad moves i'm in first place in first how many make it four what we'll just win again got him david oh that wasn't a blender i thought it was a blunder [Laughter] i don't blame you for thinking that time to resign mr swift [Music] yes 18 points but it doesn't mean anything right you need a lot more than that yeah you need 22. do i have you oh wait [Music] that's really annoying do you have a chance to play another game do you think yeah seven minutes i'm not sure if that does it for me i'm six places well just try unless i win yeah damn it that's really really annoying what i i had layton but it turns out i didn't all right dude come on there we go okay damn i'm not gonna make it to the top four all right that felt good that's that's the one game i needed to to not have this be a complete disaster all right i think we're people watching the stream there we go i don't think we can right i know i i no we got five more minutes to get into a game we'll probably play one more oh yeah i guess maybe yeah i was thinking for some reason i think it takes ten minutes well no it does the game yeah but the games don't need to finish the only at in five minutes game new games will stop happening oh i gotcha [Music] it's okay you can win one more just for fun for fame and glory this is being streamed to one of the most prestigious yeah the degenerate gamblers of the internet we don't win anything though maybe there's gonna be a surprise airdrop yeah there may be some nfts in the back pocket there should at least be participation trophies participation nfts participation ids yeah that's called the therma support nfts sorry does dharma support nfts i don't know i have not experimented with that i'll find out because i sent it for my dharma account i've actually never tried out that wallet oh my goodness armor is a cool wallet i like it yeah oh whoops these are too high though but everything is in slippage fees notice that you got me in the back rank wow job over there with two queens i made it you might didn't get so far ahead peppa why did you do that now i can't get at the top how many times is that for us coinyin can't get it to the top what okay well time to resign station i'm not gonna draw you're crazy yeah somebody offered me a draw when i was clearly winning and after i declined their draw they immediately resigned and i'm like what you gotta do oh there was you gotta ask but uh i think that was clem yeah yeah he calculated that he wouldn't be able to win uh into the bracket and pulled out he just gave me a free rook and offered me a draw supposed to offer the job before you get free it never hurts to ask no it doesn't you do not get what you do not ask for or as michael scott would quote wayne gretzky yeah you miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take michael squat and scott quote there we go oh man i think i'm done that put me in number eight i gotta get on a phone call all right good plan leighton thank you thanks for coming yeah catch you guys later cheers is there no the tournament pairings are closed oh sad that's not fair there's time left don't make the rules i know you relegated trust too if i ever won my next one did you make it i had a shot at 26 because i was on fire likely not in the top four definitely not that sucks who's cornyn again it's none of us right now i give away my queen it's going from bad to worse yeah that's a lot of chess man i had to get paired with javel twice playing fourth place poor glory well so the live chess doesn't know about the bracket logic it only knows about um right the mosh i think we should do top eight top eight we can definitely have a third place a loser's bracket for sure all right is that it all right congratulations and including wolf.eth who made it into the top four all right as soon as i'm done with with my game we'll set up the bracket i beat two of the top four um jabil and paddy want to get into a 10-minute game and julian and wolfe also want to get into a 10-minute game if you guys know how to um set up a set up a game with an invite friend link and then put that in the telegram group hopefully everyone's in the telegram group yeah my best one is against wolf.eth mine was alpha i drew alpha fan i nice wow black had more wins than white that's crazy so i i beat two of the top four and lost the number one twice oh no okay uh jabil and pata uh pat is here right but jabel's not i think that's right who's pata second place no no i mean who who is it who is it is that you pedro i wish that was prot prot i don't think we played what was your name i'm fox joshua no we never played i'm looking for you yeah i found you had it only lost to rubicon d5 and d5 only lost to pata wolfe.eth and derek how did derek do we could just call the tournament with the with the uh with the points on the screen since that is a nice little bookend how do you get four points joseph winning winning on a streak is the answer to it that although with when you lose you don't get one point are they playing in a place that we can watch their game uh yeah i think they will coordinate uh we'll coordinate in the telegram oh so they haven't started yet no um alex who is jabel javel yes alex is jbl and he says let's start in 15 minutes so i guess we're going to take a 50 minute break i'm going to stop the stream yeah it's like i need a break that was 90 minutes of pure fun ladies and gentlemen all right thanks everyone for tuning in to the stream that will conclude the first part of the gatecoin chess republican
