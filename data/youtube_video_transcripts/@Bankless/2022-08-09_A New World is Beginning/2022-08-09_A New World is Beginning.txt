we've got inflation there's a war in Europe protests over food and energy increasing distrust in our institutions our election process our central banks there's this increasing rise of populism that has just trended upwards is there a common denominator yeah so many other people have talked about this but the ending of the post-war order or arguably the extension after 1991 with the end of the Cold War and at the same time the rise of the internet and an industrial revolution that you know with Automation and thrives of crypto and the rise of China and the rise of India and the relative decline of the West so yeah I think like that older world is ending and a new world is beginning the 70-something-year-old presidents and the geriatric Congress and all this stuff is sort of an attempt to kind of cling to the past as it's kind of slipping away and people don't have a vision yet for a positive future
