[Music] the banquet state the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in defy and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stable coin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well we're also brought to you by monolith monolith is your cool new defy account your d5 savings account your d5 checking account except the cool thing about the monolith defy account is that it gets software updates right you actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time so here are some of the features monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know defy and what it is you can you can add money to it you can put that money to work uh in compound and accessing yield uh but you can and you can also swap through uniswap what was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your smart monolith smart contract wallet on ethereum so it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a a savings account that gets software updates so this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world but you can still do real world things with you know real money and like buy your groceries so that's just fantastic coming soon to monolith actually already here to monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly right so it's also being an on-ramp so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like coinbase or gemini or wherever you can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz all right bankless nation we are back to talk about the q3 d5 token report and we are joined by lucas campbell who is a bankless editor and analyst on our team puts out these fantastic reports every quarter lucas how you doing man i'm doing great thank you guys for having me oh well it's great it's great to have you my friend so uh we want to dig into this this token report um and of course uh aside from yourself the other party that really made this this possible is our token report sponsored diversify which is a killer decentralized exchange for serious traders it's private transactions instant settlement all the bankless way they're doing some really cool stuff with layer two particularly starkware to make all of this really fast with solutions like diversify i feel like you don't even need a central uh crypto exchange anymore we will include a link to diversify where you can start trading on it in the show notes and just want to thank them for making this report possible one of the first companies to really get onto a layer 2 up and running and i i use their exchange like really quickly when they first like launched and like the ui was pretty pretty pretty simple pretty pretty easy to use uh but then it's all already like so become so polished over the last like two three four weeks so big time to diversify you can't even tell they're they're a decentralized exchange there was a time where you could like tell oh my god this is a decentralized exchange like you know brace yourself for a clunky user experience it's not like that anymore um all right lucas we've got the report open we want to talk about some of the highlights man that you saw so this is the the uh report that we issued on bank list we've got it of course in a web version but also this cool institutional wall street grade uh pdf version and you've called this report lucas the rise of the ownership economy can we dig into that name so why why'd you call it that yeah i mean i think that's a great question so you guys talked about this a lot last week with jesse walden in the ownership economy but really the name came from this mania this yield farming mania that happened in q3 where the core idea was give ownership to the users right so it would be like the equivalent of like let's say uber distributing equity to anyone that gave a gave or took an uber ride or let's say like google giving out shares to anyone that used that search engine so like the equivalent of this in d5 is how compound gave comp tokens which you know pretty much kick-started the whole the whole mania they gave comp tokens to anyone that provided liquidity or borrowed assets from the from the protocol and that pretty much just kick-started this insane insane quarter that we can kind of just see in the data but uh yeah i mean the rise of the ownership economy is really just this core notion of giving ownership to the users and making them um you know the stewards of the protocol over the long term all right and it was an insane quarter you know what let's let's just get right to the quarter i want to come back to the shift uh from price to earnings pe to price to sales because i think that's important just you know as far as a takeaway but let's get into this insane quarter that we saw and here's kind of like the you know the money headline here but um we saw a quarter to quarter revenue increase for these d5 tokens we call them capital assets because they're similar to stocks and their ability to potentially in the future uh produce cash flows they can be valued as such but the revenue increase was 26 x from last quarter right so this is this is the graph these are all quarters here q1 q2 q3 q4 and then oh my god here's q3 it's like massive so we went from 3.9 million in revenue created by these d5 protocol tokens to 108 million revenue created by these d5 tokens in q3 is that the the ownership economy the yield farming mania that you were talking about is as much of the growth as a result of that yeah i mean definitely it was a lot of that i mean unisop was like a big contributor to that so a lot of people were you know trading d5 tokens were swapping in and out of tokens you know a lot of the yield farming protocols like featured uniswap lp tokens so like uniswap is obviously the biggest contributor with 67 million dollars in that quarter alone distributed to uh liquidity providers wow wow okay and then who are the big token winners uh for the quarter i guess uh is this a graph of this is still graph of quarterly uh revenues is this a change from previous quarter or is this just you know injured yeah so that is the d5 price perform or the token price per performance throughout the quarter so between july 1st um and september 30th ave was the biggest gainer with 300 percent increase um i will caveat that with saying that yfi was probably the real gainer but it effectively went from zero to you know a billion so it's like an infinite gain so i couldn't put that on the graph but um yeah ajave kept kind of um kept its lead it had a really awesome quarter in q2 as well um and it just kind of kept going off the back of the avenomics upgrade which is like this major overhaul to the token economics and introducing decentralized governance and some yield farming mechanisms and a whole bunch of other stuff so ave again with 300 um revenue growth in their in their d5 pro token what were a couple of the others so there's there's two more that are above a hundred percent growth what what what are they yeah so the other second biggest one was loop ring which i think a lot of um d5 investors were kind of getting tired of the gas fees on ethereum and we're definitely looking towards like layer two solutions so like i think another notable one that wasn't necessarily uh depicted on the graph was uh like omisco omg had a really awesome quarter from what i remember um so i think like a lot of d5 investors were looking towards later too it's like an opportunity to like capitalize on like the increase in gas fees and just like the lack of usability for ethereum during that time period i don't know if you guys remember that but like you're paying you know hundreds of dollars in gas fees to get in and out of like you know different yield farms um absolutely the last one was uh synthetics there with 155 percent gain and um i mean synthetics is always just pushing out new stuff they're constantly up you know releasing upgrades they were the best performing token last year in 2019 they've had like you know a meteoric rise and they're just kind of um piggybacking off that momentum and keeping keeping the keeping the train rolling here and also one of the first apps to also leverage layer 2 as well right so like loopering it itself is a layer 2 but synthetics is an application but is now kind of pushing the envelope with getting applications onto layer twos so interesting to see like you know no one's gonna no one's gonna point at some price increase in synthetics and say that's not because of exactly what synthetics deserves but also what they deserve is you know because they they are the ones that push the envelopes and move really fast and get onto l2s as fast as possible when it's necessary so you know tip of the hat to those guys yeah i mean they're they're definitely testing the optimism test net right now um and you can stake on it right now and they're incentivizing it the whole work so um definitely check that out and see if you're eligible it does feel like the tokens that are building more are doing better in general like ave that team just like always building always releasing things so same with synthetics so i mean the builders have really won over the past year um really quick before we kind of talk about eth as a defy asset as well and then break it down these d5 tokens by by segment um let's talk about the shift from price to earnings to um price to sales and what that sort of means right so when you you're evaluating capital asset like a stock investors tend to use this price to earnings ratio which basically tells you how much you are paying when you buy that stock for every dollar of earnings so a netflix might be around 80 80 price earnings ratio that means you're paying it around 80 for one dollar of earnings so you're anticipating that it's going to continue to grow in order to justify a price to earnings ratio of 80. and uh we've done a lot of work in the past kind of looking at these d5 tokens from that lens because it can be evaluated from that lens how much money are you paying for every one dollar earned in um by the ave protocol for instance right and that can be a relative valuation metric that's useful but there is kind of an asterisk there in that a lot of what we're looking at is not like bottom line earnings like profit but when we're talking about revenue for these d5 tokens we're actually looking at top line revenue actually their their sales revenue so that's sort of the lens it's not so much price to earnings it's really priced to top line sales because there can be other costs uh you know before you get to sort of the bottom line revenue um is that a good way to summarize it lucas or like what would you add on that concept here yeah i mean exactly um i would say like i think the best way to think about it is like price to earnings is the profit that is accrued to the protocols token whereas price of sales is really just the revenue generated from like usage of the protocol right so i think like a really good um example of this is kyber um so the liquidity protocol uh you know generated i think it was like 10 million dollars in revenue off of like a 0.2 trading fee and right now governance dictates that 73 percent give or take is accrued to knc holders via like each dividends and then a small amount of it's burned um whereas the remaining 26.5 uh is distributed to like reserves which are kind of like their kybers like liquidity providers almost um so you kind of see that distinction whereas like kyber's price of sales is 21 whereas their price earnings is a little bit higher because only 73 of that revenue is accrued to the token so the price of earnings is 29. that makes perfect sense right so um but but but on that so like we've got a price to earnings of 29 a price of sales of 21 a little bit lower but price earnings of 29. by the way um that just seems super low right like high-flying tech companies right now on the nasdaq are going for pe ratios of like you know 80 amazon's like 160 170 i don't know what zoom is what's zoom lucas these days from a price to earnings perspective um like probably 11 right now 411 right now that's that's the the you know the zoom stock that we're using zoom so fantastic um for them but that's a pretty high valuation metric using using their product to tell the to tell them that their valuation is really high right well the product could be great but the you know stock price could be high relative to uh to what it's worth um but anyway are are we seeing a lot of very low price to earnings ratios like like kyber i mean um just that seems super cheap still for the potential growth of d5s is that the case um yeah i mean i would say so um i would like there's a couple that are like a little bit more nuanced like uni swap and compound and like you know a few others aren't actually generating any earnings for um token holders it's all revenue um with that like maker was another notable one where right now they're generating like you know eighty thousand dollars per day and they don't have the dsr on so they don't have that die savings rate so all of those revenues are being allocated or directed to mkr burns right so i think i in the report it was like you know they're at a new low of a pe ratio of like 30 or something um so you're definitely seeing like the protocols that do accrue value to token holders that have like that mechanism you know they're definitely hitting you know new lows or they're on the lower end you know especially when we're looking at some of these other tech stocks that are you know valued at like sky-high evaluations you know was there a place in the report lucas where the p e ratios are that we could see here the price to sales ratios um there was a priceless sales ratio i did not do one on the price earnings just because it was like a lot more nuanced too where's the price of sales what page should be let's see scroll up it was in that first section like the d5 overview ah must have missed it okay so so what does that mean i'll scroll up to find it but what does that mean for a token like like you to swap for instance it's almost like a uniswap is um clearly there's value there but it's almost like pre-revenue it's almost like facebook while it was building network effect and acquiring users but it hadn't yet turned on its ad modules and started making money um is that kind of how you'd think about it it just all it needs to do is sort of flick a switch and then you know they could start channeling some of the the uh fees to users and then it could be a capital asset that's generating actual earnings yeah so uni swap is actually a really interesting example because if you remember uh uni swap v2 introduced this protocol charge with like an on off switch which is governed at the time with some like ambiguous governance thing and now it's like oh it's governed by uni holders right so the protocol charge is switched on the point three percent uh swappy uh zero point zero five percent of that so quarter quarter basis point or point two five percent and then point zero five is directed to um a protocol treasury so really what that money can be used for is really up in the air right that right now at the current earnings or the current revenue is about 45 million dollars in annualized revenue to that treasury if the protocol fee was switched on um and you could use that in theory to burn or like distribute dividends or whatever you wanted to do you could you know accrue that that capital to the token holders um but that's not necessarily what's in like that social contract i think like a lot of it's going to be used to like fund um and incentivize like community contributions and the long-term development and growth of like uni swap at large but what's interesting is like uh uh kyber almost set a precedent there where like it did distribute over 70 percent it is distributing over 70 to actual um knc owners right i wonder if uniswap will follow a similar path they'd at least have to be competitive with some of these other protocols in terms of what they uh distribute here's the price to sales by the way that i was missing earlier and uniswap right now is a 12 price to sales uh ratio um which is absolutely crazy when you think of a zoom at uh 411 um not quite apples to apples but like kind of close that's crazy all right guys we're about to get into the world of dexes and see what happened with things like uniswap and curve in q3 2020 we all know that dexes absolutely blew up in q3 but first before we get to that subject we're going to take a moment to talk about some of the fantastic bankless sponsors that make this show possible unstoppable domains has two products that's helping make the crypto world feel like the old world that we're familiar with but with these new cryptoeconomic protocols under the hood and that is human readable crypto addresses as well as uncensorable domains so i've got my unstoppable domains account open here and i've got my domains registered and so i've got davidhoffman.crypt right and i have my one of my ethereum addresses pointed to it and i'm also going to be able to add my bitcoin address here as well because this is a blockchain agnostic product any wallet that has unstoppable domains integrated will allow you to type in davidhoffman.crypto and if you're sending bitcoin or if you're sending eth or litecoin or hell even ripple it will send it to the address that i've associated on my account so i'm going to pull up my ether wallet here and i've loaded up an address with a small amount of eth and i'm going to send a little bit of eth to myself at davidhoffman.crypto it's going to populate with the ethereum address that it has but it's also linked to my twitter account because in unstoppable domains i've linked my twitter account to all of the addresses that i've plugged in and so chain link is actually associating my twitter account with my ethereum address and you know these are the web 2 platforms that we have today but think about what happens when decentralized identity becomes more of a thing i'm sure unstoppable domains is going to use decentralized identity solutions like bright id or circles to associate addresses with people in a extremely self-sovereign way unstoppable domains also allows you to spin up uncensorable websites which is i think going to become increasingly important in the world ahead of us using unstoppable domains you can purchase a website and use decentralized storage providers to host it as well meaning that no nation state can take down your website there is no canceling in unstoppable domains world they even have templates ready to go to help you build out your first unstoppable domain so go to unstoppabledomains.com register your crypto addresses with a human readable name and maybe launch your uncensorable website today zapper is this new tool that i use to check out all of my assets in defy as you guys have known defau has absolutely exploded recently and so managing your assets is getting harder and harder because there's so many different places and so many different assets that it could be so i'm going to put my ethereum address in here and zapper is going to tell me where all of my assets are across ethereum right so here are all of the assets in this wallet there's there's a decent amount of them and it's also going to tell me where i've deposited assets into various defy protocols right so there's some yield farming going on there's some liquidity pooling going on we can also look more granularly at this specific protocols that it's involved with in this explore feature so it's got some assets deposited into uniswap it's got some assets deposited into balancer and also with zapper you can just exchange straight from the zapper interface right so this is just another layer on top of unit swap or other exchanges on ethereum that allow you to swap assets right so check them out at zapper.fi it'll give you a nice clean portal to invest your assets in defy and you can also connect to multiple wallets if you use multiple wallets all at once and it'll give you an aggregate of every single wallet that you own check them out at zapper.fi also this is definitely not my wallet um all right well let's break this down by sector a little bit lucas so um maybe we'll we'll come to ethan at the end if we have time but um decentralized exchanges how did how did they do i guess what are the the sections that you outlined in this report and then maybe let's start with decentralized exchanges but like that's the first what are the other sections you got like derivatives and something else right right yeah so we did uh dex's lending derivatives and then we did some like miscellaneous highlights um namely wi-fi and the nexus mutual okay so in terms of like the dex sector pretty much led the charge right in q3 um i think overall the deck sector aggregated over 40 billion dollars in volume in q3 with unit swap you know comprising of like 25 billion of it so a really solid portion of the rev and early volume in q3 was from uniswap i think like curve was in second with 8 billion and then balancer with 2.7 billion dollars in quarterly volume um so the debt sector really led the charge they killed it a lot of the revenue is attributed uh you know a lot of the d5 revenue at large is attributed to the deck sector um i can't remember what the specific number was yeah 91 million dollars of like the 108 was from dexes so wow they crushed it um do you want me to keep going on the on the dexes here um yeah anything else on texas before we pop the lending um we kind of talked about the unit swap stuff so that was kind of like my sector highlight which was talking about union swap and how that protocol fee can be allocated towards like um accruing earnings for token holders um so that was really the majority of it balancer had a really awesome quarter i think they generated like 16 to 18 to 18 million dollars in revenue to lps which given the launch back in like march april you know spring of 2020 now that's pretty uh pretty impressive given the short time span um but yeah i mean dex is crushed at this quarter you just swap in balancer and so it seems like even in the deck sector it was automated market makers that really dominated in terms of exactly very cool all right let's jump to lending um yeah lending what had a comeback quarter here um so let's see compound i will say that like compound ave the way that the token terminal who's the people that provided the data the way they calculate um the revenue is the interest accrued to suppliers right so it's it's kind of a nuanced thing where a lot of the um the revenue is really just going to people that supplied assets to the protocol you know through interest um you know with that said there's obviously a uh an earnings mechanism that could be implemented there where like a portion of that interest is crude to token holders right of ave token holders or comp token holders that's not the case right now but i think that was just an important nuance to kind of understand about lending revenues with that i think maker was kind of the biggest highlight um they ended up turning on the stability fee after multiple months following like black thursday of zero zero percent stability fee not earning anything mkr was diluted you know it was a top past couple months for mkr but you know they're back on track now there's nearly a billion dollars of dye um in circulation right now they're earning you know somewhere around 70 to 80 000 per day with the entirety of that being accrued to mkr holders right because the dsr is not online so all of that is going to earnings or mkr's kind of you know back on track to say the least which is which is a good sign david just on that do you remember when we had mariano conte on a few months ago this is back in april or so and he made the bold crazy prediction that dai would hit 1 million or 1 billion excuse me in circulation this year and that seemed absolutely outlandish and crazy right and now here we are here we are well we're not we're not there yet but we are so close you can you can taste it right it's so close and i do want to make that distinction between maker and the rest of the d5 protocols you know the d5 yield farming it was really a thing because of token issuance right and you know while there is revenue going through these protocols the reason why there was this d5 mania was that because like there was just a lot of issuance of valuable tokens right uh and i think what was going to come is a lot of those tokens as lucas just kind of alluded to a lot of those tokens don't capture the revenue of the protocol a lot of the revenue like like the unisop versus kyber example like uniswap captures a lot of revenue and then redirects it to liquidity providers not necessarily to the uni token and maker had their token economics knocked from like day one where like revenue from the protocol went into the token itself and it's really exciting to see that get turned back on so like maker as like a leader of the protocol that is both generating revenue and also it accruing to the token which it's supposed to be designed for is like the exemplar model that i think a lot of other d5 protocols are either going to get to this point or not go anywhere at all yeah it's got like two to three years of maturity on these other uh tokens and you can kind of see that with it's going through its own cycles i will rip on maker for a second though like i feel like their token economics is a little outdated like they don't they didn't yeah i feel like you they could improve a lot on it right like they could be implementing mkr rebates for paying stability fees kind of like that yield farming mechanism for opening a die cdp um i feel like the auction like the mkr auction for burning is like kind of not great i feel like if they had a uni swap with a ton of liquidity like implanting open market buybacks and stuff like that would be like much more effective but that's just like my personal opinion and like i would love to see interest rates being set algorithmically rather than by mkr governance so they're they're definitely killing it but all good points yeah they are taking this conservative approach at the same time all right let's talk about derivatives who are not traditionally conservative types of assets so what happened here um yes so the derivative sector just in terms of the data that we had was largely almost entirely synthetics which they made a comeback their previous record of 1.9 million dollars in quarterly revenue was kind of um disproportionately reported due to like front-running issues yeah but they fixed that back in q2 which is why you see that huge dip and now they're kind of back on track they almost exceeded that previous record almost all organically um and with that like you saw like a pretty substantial increase in the outstanding s usd which is syntax's native crypto dollar um but yeah i mean synthetics pretty much killed it i will say like augur v2 launched um and then uma has been doing pretty well we don't have the data on that but um just from what i've seen personally like um has been um definitely doing some interesting stuff out of that out of that camp yeah i wonder how uh uma token uma token looks from a revenue perspective there's a few other things that i hope we get more data on the future with token terminal which is like mcdex which they did something uh last quarter uh and they they have their their token as well and then also i kind of wonder what uh dydx would look like if they actually had a token that accrued some of the value of their derivatives platform because they're definitely doing a a large amount of volume so maybe we'll see dydx uh i feel like antonio may be hinted about that on our ama with him david but um yeah we'll we'll see when when these other new derivatives platforms get added how synthetics shapes up because right now it's just dominating everything yeah we'll put a pin on the dydx thing uh i have a feeling they'll come out with something but we'll see all right so now we've got uh yield aggregators of course we just gotta talk about wi-fi they just had a killer quarter some of those data are not in the data set that we were looking at but what do you want to touch on with wi-fi yeah i mean wi-fi pretty much had this meteoric rise in d5 pretty much went from nothing in terms of like token value to over a billion dollars in less than two months um was pretty wild to say the least um and i think the most notable thing out of that was it kind of kick-started or built upon the fair launch movement which we talked about in a newsletter post um before but it's essentially this token distribution mechanism where you're kind of just building off the altruism of satoshi nakamoto and b and bitcoin and where everyone just has equal opportunity to earn the tokens like there's no founder allocation there's no vcs there's no no there's really no um favorable you know token token allocation it's really just equal opportunity for everyone and i think that um that fair launch movement kind of got kick-started and you kind of saw like em finance and all these other fair launches where there was just you know equal opportunity for everyone to kind of um get a portion of that token supply and so yfi is definitely a capital asset we don't have the numbers in this specific report but it is printing money basically and i can't wait to see as those numbers get incorporated how much revenue it's actually throwing off to its uh to its holders basically um all right uh the last one is nxm so this is nexus mutual so they had a massive quarter in terms of premiums paid that graph is up and to the right yeah yeah nexus mutual killed it it was actually interesting because like right at the beginning of q3 like on like july 2nd or 3rd the launch pulled staking which was like this new way for nxm holders to stake against contracts and earn those premiums that are depicted on that graph and that had this you know um transformational effect on nexus mutual um and kind of what you saw was this massive you know run up in active covers and premiums paid i think one of the interesting takeaways from that is nexus mutual right now has earned over two million dollars in premiums from selling like insurance um and it's only paid out 35 000 in claims right so like that is insurance right there at its finest if you were like wondering how how the hell like insurance companies make money like this is the map right here like millions of dollars made only a few thousand dollars paid out in claims um and i think that's really interesting a really interesting um takeaway when you're looking at nexus mutual yeah that's going to be exciting protocol to watch i'm pretty bullish about its future specifically having talked to hugh carp who's the founder of nexus a few podcasts ago all right so there's also a number of untokenized protocols and applications we mentioned dydx but there's also instadap which doesn't have a token open set zapper zurion what do you think over under on whether some of these protocols are going to launch tokens yes or no what do you think lucas um i would say i'll take a while i mean do we count index for set protocol i do i think so i would set launched a token in queue right so we can cross files on the list one already has um i would assume dydx would i would put it like a sure bet i'm not going to say that but i would i i would strongly you know think that bydx would put out a token just to get competitive just because he lost a lot of other market share in q3 to like uni swap and all these other dexes um i'm interested to see how the asset management platforms kind of play out like insta dab zap or xerion like there's not like some sort of set model token model for them yet so i'm very interested to see what happens there and then open we'll see we'll see it's basically like to be competitive a token needs to be part of the incentive mechanism it seems like uh that's what q3 really showed us um conclusions okay so killer quarter absolutely phenomenal quarter but now we're down 50 on d5 assets exactly um so people people are like oh it was a mania as a one-time thing bubble burst bye-bye d5 and now we're really excited about bitcoin and everything else and again d5 for a while is uh did the bubble pop lucas or this d5 kind of did it do its thing and now it's dead i will say what i will say and i kind of outlined this in the report is that this is a multi-year market cycle um ethereum in the last market cycle had you know over half a dozen thirty forty percent 50 drawdowns um d5 has only had one so far after this massive run-up so i would say that if you are you know if you subscribe to that thesis of that were you know at the beginning of a bull run um i think d5 has like pretty much cemented itself that it's going to be you know a critical part of this bull run um you know that said you just never know um i think there's a lot of you know profound and valuable mechanisms and distribution stuff like as we talked about at the beginning the rise of this ownership economy i think will have you know profound effects beyond just d5 and um crypto at large so i think this is just the first drawdown uh of many to come after multiple multiple run-ups so we'll see very good lucas well you crushed on this report my friend um this i think is one of the best reports if not the best reports on defy in the space right now it is institutional level so you could send this to you know your investor friend who's tinkering with stocks and they should be able to understand the terminology uh once again you can get it on bank list just type in bank list q3 token report in google and bagless.substack.com lucas thanks a lot for for walking us through that my friend of course this is uh this is awesome to do so thank you guys for having me on i appreciate it looking forward to q4 alright appreciate it guys thank you
