[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs and we are back for part two of the episode we began last week with the one and only john rogers john thank you for coming back on overpriced jpegs thanks for having me again week two in a row gm week two part two we promised it last time we said oh gosh we haven't gotten everything so we're gonna have to record a second episode and here we are recording a second episode of part two we're gonna get into all sorts of good stuff today i would say i actually am glad that we had to break this into two parts because there have been some later late breaking news and announcements coming out of nftnyc most conferences big announcements are made the first two days in the conference it seems in web 3 we like to make announcements on days 4 and 5 of our conferences so it's good that we're able to kind of recap again it is we will go through some of those later updates there's some really interesting things happening on the hardware side of web3 that i think it's important people be aware of and we we're going to break down i don't think people have been paying enough attention to this doodles update and then we will close here with a whole breakdown of what's happening in the yugos ecosystem and um what's going on with this lawsuit john i think you have done a lot of diligence on exactly what this lawsuit is and we're gonna we're gonna talk about it before we get to any of this though we are going to hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors immutablex is the layer 2 platform for crypto

sign up at coinshift.xyz bankless all right john when you're talking about new news coming out of nftnyc what are you taught what are you thinking of well there are a couple things um you know there were announcements from solana about um a mobile phone and more importantly a software development kit for mobile devices um which i think is is really important in terms of making web3 a mobile experience well we talk a bit more in that a second um the other was an announcement from feature regarding um their streaming device their streaming utility um which will bring web3 to the couch which is really i think for those of us focused on the entertainment storytelling side of nfts and web three a huge step forward when that when that comes okay this feature thing let's talk about this we should say for full disclosure you are an advisor for future i've had them on the show before so we're both uh fans of feature but i'm you know truly a fan out of being a fan you know i have no no stake in this horse other than i think they're doing a horse stake in this horse is that well whatever we're going with that expression um other than i think they're doing really interesting things and i don't think this announcement has been getting enough attention can you really break down what this is my understanding is it's like roku for web3 web3 content exactly that that's exactly right now this is the very early days it's a it's a pre-announcement so there's not a lot that i can say other than that it is a streaming device it is a device that you'll plug into your tv that will bring web 3 to the couch you can stream content most importantly it has an enhanced gpu to allow better graphics and engagement but think about being able to connect your wallet to your your tv and the things that you can do think about token gating so if a filmmaker is making a movie financed on web3 that say with nfts or with a dow and that film is streamed where the people who invested are able to stream it and watch it through this device you can check the gate the wallet token gate it and watch it so it opens up a whole new possibility for and facilitating film financing it opens up possibilities of facilitating film and entertainment distribution it opens up new opportunities for communities uh such as say dead fellas or board apes to engage their community with content um so it's it's really an exciting step forward and i'm hoping to share more soon and i will add my two cents to this and then you can tell me if i've overstepped and we need to cut it out because i i also have met with the team in the past and part of what excites me about this too is just that interactivity between phone and tv and the ways you can imagine kind of upping the ante on your viewing experience if like you have nfts at stake for example you know and like like one of your nfts could be connected to something that's happening on the screen as you're watching and it could be impacting what's happening to the nft in your wallet and i think though as we live in this adrenaline junkie we need to be more violent more sexualized more whatever we need to keep upping the ante in our content to like get the same level of excitement i feel like uh this just adds a whole new level of i don't know adrenaline rushes to the way our content could be experienced precisely that is possible so imagine if you had a uh let's say you're watching the olympics and you had an nft that represented each of the runners uh in the the final 100 yard dash and the runner who wins your nft is minted to your wallet but if the rent you have a woman an nft that represents a runner who's lost it gets burned so imagine it there's a gambling aspect to that so that's certainly not a possibility but has to be illegal wherever that's occurring um so it does open up all kinds of possibilities of interaction with the nfts in the wallet or perhaps the nfts can be updated based on an outcome of a sporting event or of a show of a storyline or think about being able to pool your nft as a part with other nft with other owners and create an object as a group kind of as a group and that object becomes a part of the storytelling but the next time you engage the content a different group becomes a different object and so it's a way to make that content interactive and customized um to to the viewer and so all of this is possible and it feels like one of these things where i'm like hitting boomer status where i'm like i don't know tv works fine for me you know but i'm like aware of this generation coming up below me and beneath me for whom i mean they can't you know it's like all they want to watch is tic tocs they can't handle anything that's longer than 30 seconds because it doesn't keep their attention but if they had something at stake if they're somehow interacting with it if they can be on their phone while they're watching tv which is what they want to do anyway like it it it feels like a no-brainer and there's a little bit of squinting to see the future here in my opinion which which we see in all of the space but like it's the future's getting closer like i'm squinting a little less as i hear about what they're thinking i mean i as you were saying that just i was just thinking well what if you meant your tick tock so what if they tick-tock like a hit tick tock uh charlie charlie d'amato i think she's like the largest tick talkers i can't charge amelia charlie so i'm terrible with names so if we imagine if charlie decides to offer some of her hit tick tock videos as to be minted and you can collect them um and creates opportunity economic opportunities which i think takes partnered with immutable x and they were doing like tick-tock moments so they were doing a certain level of like minting you know tick-tock's been somewhat on it um with some of that but yeah like instantly and you know you're watching it on your tv but i'm glad you brought that up because think of it that was actually fairly centralized that was tick tock picking specific influencers to partner with and then representing them almost like an agent to do that but this is imagined an opportunity where any tick tock uh influencer can do it no matter how big you are you don't the possibilities are there it's just so now you're decentralizing it even further yeah i'm i'm really excited about this and this may be like segues us to the the solana announcement that you mentioned that's also in in sort of the hardware space like i really love that we're entering the phase of this technology where we're actually seeing like devices be built and that takes it to a whole new level in my opinion beyond just you know the smart contracts and some of that yeah yeah yeah absolutely there's a couple things here with this so first of all they're clearly their play and their intent is to go with more on the software to build it have it built into devices the the the like is it are the sdks or basically yeah is it being built for google in particular or is it android it's for android that's what i thought yep yeah it's for android um i think there obviously android has a much larger install base than than iphone does i'm guessing like 80 to 20 perhaps it might even be the ratio um so it's a bigger market it's an easier market because android is a more open platform imagine trying to get a web 3 a web 3 platform through apple's software review process it's just not going to happen so i i think they're smart and focusing on android to begin with very very smart in that regard probably not not a hard decision to make um and i think the reason to actually create a physical phone because being a device manufacturer and trying to compete with um samsung and apple and htc and it's never going to happen so i think the phone is a there this is an acquisition play right i think they're trying to like build technology a lot of quiet that'll get acquired i don't know i think it's more of an investment in the ecosystem i think it's if they can build this and get it adopted by the device manufacturers it's a support and growth strategy for solana blockchain blockchain so because the hardware business for them is not gonna it's gonna be so it's gonna be a loss leader it's not gonna be a profitable business for them it's just a way to have a proof of concept to actually get devices in hands let people play with it and experience it and improve to the other device manufacturers you want to build with the software development kit so so walk me through the the point of them building hardware in the first place and not just building the software kit that can be plugged into their android devices yeah yeah my belief is it's really a a strategy to get adoption from an acceptance from the o from the equipment from the hardware manufacturers that okay trying to go around and pitch htc or samsung or any one of the nothing phone which was just announced was actually kind of cool um going around and pitching these device manufacturers to you want to build with this sdk and put web3 into your phone is going to be a really hard sell so i believe now i just looking at it that this is really a loss leader strategy to get devices out in the world to show that it works to show what's possible and then once there's adoption from the samsungs of the world or or the htc's um then i'm guessing they would step back from that hardware business but i could be wrong it could be that they want to start got it it's just a credit it's just to build credibility for them yeah exactly it's the software development kit i was thinking they were trying to build something that could get acquired down the line but i'm totally with you that this is just about integrating the solana ecosystem places and i think it's really smart i think they seem to be aware that there's a non-ideal mobile experience for people in web3 i mean i think they made some comment about like how you've got like friends on dates like or you've got like people on dates like whipping out computers to to mint nfts uh which i laughed at because i've told this story before but like when i minted my v friends it corresponded with a brunch that i had to go to a birthday brunch i had to go to so i'm at this like birthday brunch with a bunch of like lovely women who are very like not into ffts and like their sun dresses and i'm in the corner with my laptop like you know whipping it out to mint my nfts and looking like an idiot so i i resonated with that particular pain point that they were describing and um you know really trying to build better experiences for people to be able to mint and interact mobily which we desperately need yeah the very first nft i tried to purchase uh was on the metamask mobile wallet and i just didn't know be careful of minting on a mobile app i was so new and sure enough it didn't work lost my money not a lot it was like 80 bucks in gas or something like that so i'd look chalk that up as a learning a learning investment but um never used a mobile app again on web3 it'll come and i think it has to go to mobile there's so many devices in the world especially developing countries that it's you only have a mobile device that it has to go there for the adoption that we want and it's just the technology needs to kind of catch up with the reality i also imagine that apple will eventually get on board here i i it struck me that um i was hearkening back to a story that justin waldron who was one of the co-founders of zynga told me which was you know it was zynga that convinced the app store to allow in-app purchases and that the app store you know app developers were really opposed to like in-app purchases and zynga was proving the concept of like in-game purchases on on facebook through like you know poke their poker game and things and um when they turned it into an app version that they they were the ones who finally persuaded apple to give it a try and it worked and so i think apple has this history of being sort of slow to adopt these things but then ultimately we'll we'll you know get on board so who knows what the catalyst will be here but i i do imagine apple will will play ball eventually and and catch on with well i am certain of it so i'm certain of it they will they will not be their early leader on it but i'm certain they'll join in eventually um there's also it seems like probably an international savvy international play here of just you know i know like the mobile game market for example like the game on the game side is like super you know internationally driven you know globally speaking people play a ton of mobile games far more than we play just like here in the west or here in the united states and you also i think they mentioned this solana mentioned this in this announcement or one of the spokespeople did like just the number of people globally who use their mobile phones uh for for everything i mean you know people's banking i think africa there's a lot of banking that happens on mobile you know and um depositing withdrawing you know just transferring funds and so they're tapping into i think a huge way that people will end up using web3 at the end of the day yeah i remember i can riff on that for a second i remember when i was working at matter labs um we were talking about layer twos and what the impact that layer twos could have in developing countries or in countries that don't really have stable a stable reserve currency or a stable government in fact when you look at the world population 80 of the world population lives in a country that lacks either a stable currency or a a reserve current a stable government and so there were places where people like literally life and death is being on your mobile device and being able to move uh bitcoin in that case across borders um so i imagine a phone built native to web3 and with web3 capabilities built in really attractive and developing nations because you can you can acquire eth or or bitcoin or any cryptocurrency and you can move it across borders easier and you can save and protect it easier than say in your local banking system and you have trust in it more than certainly more than your government so i think there's definitely a huge a huge place for this and i'm excited that it's gonna a step forward has come absolutely totally agree all right bullish on hardware happy it's happening uh let's talk these acquisitions these announcements also came out i know you're you were sort of putting some of these on my radar ebay acquired known origin origin um ebay acquired known origin the the nft platform and uh and then unit swap acquired genie well where do you want to start yeah well it's i think the easier one the stuff i want to talk through is ebay so let's start with that one um so two acquisitions and i think the bigger take here is that acquisitions are coming and you know a few months ago um openc acquired gem.xyz which is another aggregator marketplace so i think um there's a couple things happening here activities picking up in the marketplace space both with launches and with m a activity and i think there's a slot of excitement around these aggregator marketplaces which actually all my purchasing is now on an aggregator marketplace for nfts i'm i'm looking at um and then ebay coming in so let's begin with ebay ebay coming in it makes sense for them to be in the space they're when it comes to digital marketplaces they're the 800 pound gorilla so it makes a lot of sense for the move into the space what's interesting here is that known origin was the their acquisition target because at known origin is a curated marketplace so it's not an open marketplace so it's it's interesting they went for curated um because i don't think that that would necessarily work with ebay's model for a long term so this might be more about acquiring the technology and then building something else on top of it i know what you think about it yeah that's no it's it's i i agree it seems ironic you know like a marketplace that's like an advantage has been sort of not being curational and has been anybody can come and sell their old used whatever on this marketplace it feels deeply ironic that they would acquire a a curated uh place in in this space so i'm with you i think it's probably a technology play and an acquiring the team play and uh and they they may end up pivoting it in some capacity uh i also um one last note on ebay i also would think that for the current market is the ebay brand really going to attract a lot of nft buyers and sellers right now and the answer is probably no no they'll keep the known origin brand on it so that'll stay but my guess is this is ebay taking a baby step into a future that is still six or seven years to come but they're taking their first steps knowing that they have to start getting some learnings and some some talent they have to do something yeah it's if you're not paying attention if you're not taking those baby steps if you're not dipping your toe in you're you're gonna be doomed you know so so it's good they're doing something uh and uh yeah i mean i applaud them i'm glad they're they're looking at the space it it seems like a no-brainer that they should be at least exploring it in a variety of ways um the genie thing i think this also feels like a no-brainer i think it's interesting that it's uniswap um which obviously tends to play more in just the the d5 token swapping space so they're now dipping their toes on into the nft side of things you know aggregators haven't really worked in defy like there's been some attempts at that kind of thing and it just doesn't make sense again when you're talking like fungible tokens but these aggregators have been super popular and valuable and just seeing a ton of you know uh activity in the nft and for the non-fungible side of things so um so interesting play that you have eunice pop kind of tipping their toe and then seeming to get onto into the nft side of things yeah and i would add on the uniswap their reputation is is stellar that the it's got a great team they're you know defy space is taking some some some bruising right now but they you know swap is standing strong and um i think this is a good play for them and the brand the brand pedigree somebody corrected me on this the other day where i was like you know it's really not d5 that's taking a hit it's c5 and you know maybe that's bleeding into d5 a bit but the all the the the f ups are happening on the the centralized finance side and they're you know leveraging blockchain technology but they're these are very centralized entities that are collapsing before our eyes and taking the ecosystem down with them so d5 is coming out looking pretty good on you know relatively relative to the their counterparts no doubt did you know that you can buy crypto directly on almost any blockchain using metamask we all use metamask on ethereum but did you know you can buy all the popular assets across all the popular trains straight from the metamask mobile wallet did you know that you could do this from over 260 available regions so now you know that metamask helps you buy over 90 cryptocurrencies using bank cards credit cards apple pay google pay for whenever you need some quick crypto whether you're stranded without gas or you just need that nft or you want to tinker with some new application metamask saves you time and gas costs by buying your favorite crypto asset straight from the mobile wallet so check it out at metamask dot io buy hyphen crypto there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets all right hypermint want to talk about doodles yeah hypermint doodles i feel like this is uh somewhat connected you you kick us off with hypermint and then i'll do my doodles take all right so so hypermint was announced uh during nftnyc as a minting as a service business um they announced with launch partners um fox caa universal death row records uh which snoop um as per some other launch partners and what they announced that their goal was and this is what really caught my attention on it was that they're trying to build a solution to i'm gonna read this quote building a solution for hundreds of millions of nfts per day hundreds of millions of nfts per day and what got my attention there was a couple of things first of all having some studio partners in this launch gave me some hope that studios are now beginning to look at self-publishing as a way forward um which is kind of us i've argued in the past on this on this podcast that that really is the the long-term solution the ideal long-term play for the studios is self-publishing just you have more control you have better outcome better engagement with your community more capture of the economics um not to say there isn't a place for licensing too but i think that self-publishing is where the action is gonna going to be and the studios are now beginning to take some steps there the other part that got my attention about this announcement was that um hundreds of millions of nfts a day where can they build that who what blockchain has the throughput or the capability to do that right now it definitely isn't ethereum layer one and so what i'm wondering is if they're building as a layer two on ethereum or if they're building on maybe solana or flow i'm it's not clear yet but i'm curious to see hear more about where they're gonna build that that solution and this will totally take us into doodles because it seems like it's emerged that doodle's gonna be building on flow but we'll get to that in just a minute uh i i don't know did if you mentioned this but it's a it's a moon pay this is a moon pay product it's like a moon pay minting solution it's moonpay who's partnered up with fox and all these big players in moonpay of course has like been the buying solution i use that in quotes because i'm about to say the buying solution for celebrities though i think many of these celebrities haven't necessarily actually been paying for their own board apes for example but um moonpay clearly has the hollywood connects and so they seem to facilitated this set of partners to come in and build the solution i yeah if you've been listening to this show i think you've picked up on the fact that john has been pushing for self-publishing for a long time but i will emphasize it because you know he's been in my ear behind the scenes talking about this just what a mistake it's been for so many of these big studios to license their content out and have their first foray into nfts with this like these iconic intellectual properties like looney tunes or you know whatever star tracker on and on be licensing agreements as opposed to agreements that the studios themselves own where they really have full control over the the nfts so um sounds like somebody's been listening john and they're uh they're finally they're finally hearing you not screaming into a void um fox also had an interesting announcement while we're on this um the creator of rick and morty's i forget his name i don't know if you saw this is they're launching an animated television series or an animated series that's going to be uh have nft blockchain tie-ins and they're putting like 100 million dollars behind it and this is fox so they're touting it as like the first i think they're probably using some sort of like sneaky verbiage to claim that they're the first because obviously you've had stoner cats and things so i'm sure they're they're finding some little distinction to claim but it's something like you know we're the first animated blockchain blah blah blah um so fox is diving in yeah yeah so a little bit on that so fox started up a group uh it's kind of a joint venture is the way i'd characterize it i believe it is mostly controlled and owned by fox called blockchain creative labs and so they've done some work so far they they did some things with dolly parton dipping their toe masked singer was another project they launched so kind of higher level dipping their toe in the water but it feels like this next project is where they're going to take kind of go deeper down the rabbit hole and i believe justin roiland is the name of the creator at uh rick and morty who they're partnering with um but uh yeah so it's it's gonna be interesting i'm looking forward to that and i love rick and morty i'm looking forward to actually watching this new animation too so um i'll definitely participate be participating in in the project the rick and morty animation style is so well suited for this like djinn crowd like the the creeps project whose animation i don't love like there were i know people there were people who loved creeps nfts or who still love creeps nfts because they love the art and the art is very rick and morty to me it's that you know it's i feel like it leans mail it's very djan uh and the my like the rick and morty style of humor and it's i mean it's an incredibly intelligent show i don't happen to love it but like i i respect the hell out of it because i think it's um i recognize that it's super smart it does feel like it'll play very well with um with an nft style crowd so i'll be excited to see what happens there your dots are connecting for me when you say that fox is buying blockchain creative labs that there was an nfd nyc event that they threw that um and it was sort of aware of and interested in and it's all it's all coming together okay doodles doodles exciting stuff totally flow yes i i don't know exciting or not so this is this is connected to this this hyper-mint piece because again doodles has been very open for a while about the fact that they want to onboard millions of people into this space they made it very clear during nft nyc julian their new um ceo you know during his presentation was very clear like we're trying to onboard millions of people into our ecosystem and it's been weird because there was a thread that came out that said they were moving to flow though i have been trying to find like an official announcement from doodles about that and i can't find it i i have also looked for that official announcement and have not found it either i believe i believe the information is correct um given the source of it but i believe it may have been a little premature to saying that it was on flow i don't know so this is a long thread by degentra land on twitter we'll link to it below really laying out essentially i think why he's bullish on doodles and saying that basically they're they're doing this like three pronged approach to an nft brand and phase one was to establish yourself as this really you know fantastic blue chip web three brand phase two is onboarding yes check to that first phase phase two is then onboarding millions of people into your ecosystem and into your fandom fan base and then step three is really monetizing that you know intellectual property fandom that you've built out et cetera and uh and creating like a a top tier entertainment brand did i get those right i don't have them in front of you you got them perfectly right so um essentially step one done step two starting step three is to come um i suggest everyone read the chat it's 57 tweets but it's it's really good he's very bullish he's bet he claims he's good friends with the ceo of of doodles he's probably connected in some way but not speaking so i couldn't tell if that was a joke because he's like my best friend julian holgwin or what you know the the the now ceo of doodles and then later he says my second best friend alexis ohanian so i couldn't tell if this was like tongue-in-cheek and he was just like pretending he's like bffs with all these people i don't know if you have intel on who this person actually is but it was sort of a funny all i know is he's an ex ex goldman sachs uh finance banker type who's now web 3d gen so i don't care who knows so i have to say i am not as excited about this as he is so the premise that they need to onboard millions of people and the premise that you should be bullish on doodles like i'm 100 on board with because i think doodle i have said this consistently i think doodles has is the only project that has just consistently i can't point to a misstep really in my opinion by doodles i think they have just executed pretty flawlessly at this point and i think he makes a point in here that was not really the central point of the whole piece and the whole thread but that actually stood out to me as one of the better points which is you know yuga labs which you know obviously big rival in terms of the the top blue chips they're a little bit uh spread thin like sort of fashion sort of events gaming like what really is sort of their the heart of yooka i think it's hard to say i think doodles has been pretty consistent that they're clearly like an entertainment company they're clearly going for a disney like play where it's amazing irl activations experiences and then it's you know it's um media and that that's what they're building to be and they clearly have the art and the ip to be mass appealing in that capacity in that world yeah yeah exactly i think you got spot on that they're definitely you guys definitely stretch thin across a lot of places and they just don't haven't declared like what's our home where do we really want to build um where doodles has been pretty more laser focused might be a little bit of a stretch but far more focused on they want to be a media company they want to be an immediate play spot just perfect execution on all their irl events just brand activations and i like that they've done brand activations that just aren't having big blob parties with famous musicians and that spend our treasury on that that they're actually having experiences at places like south by southwest um so i so there's a lot there like where they can go with it entertainment i have some some questions artwork is beautiful it's fun it reminds me more of hello kitty like seeing it develop like a hello kitty type brand that it does saying this is going to become the next great animated series on morning tv or on a streaming service like a netflix it could go there but i think it's gonna be more like a hello kitty just permeating pop culture um kind of everywhere in you know fashion and so i'll be curious to see how they develop it and where they take it but yeah definitely bullish on doodles so i said bullish on doodles but then i i clearly set that up to say that there was a caveat i said i wasn't as excited as as um to gentleland is here so this is what i'll say on the on the other side this is this great debate that we are all getting to watch play out real in real time which is what chain or chains are going to come out on top and for a while i feel like i had this view that was like of course we're going to live in an omni chain world and there's going to be all these different chains and i think sure like i don't think there's going to literally be one chain but i'm i'm entering a phase in my life where i'm actually a little bit more feeling like there's going to be a really dominant winner and it'll probably be ethereum because i'm quite bullish on ethereum's scaling solutions with layer twos layer threes i've been diving into the imx ecosystem i know you've been pretty deep in the zk sync matter labs ecosystem in the past so both of us you know have to have dove into sort of the zk roll up l2 stuff and i'm quite bullish on that um quite bullish on sharding uh dedrenchland makes a point here about why sharding is not good from a developer perspective and and again there's there's more to for me to learn on all of this but i do think the network effects and fundamentally what that turns into translates into which is like liquidity that i think we're going to be able to get on ethereum with l2s is really really powerful and it it then in turn makes me less bullish on some of these other chains so to to me the question that these projects maybe need to ask themselves or that i'm asking myself as i assess the landscape is like which do i think comes first or which do i think comes easily or which do i think is possible which is that l2s develop really awesome onboarding and on-ramp experiences more like what flow has in terms of there being custodial options in terms of there being the ability to use credit cards and um and have it feel really natural and native for maybe a non-web3 person does that come first does that come more easily or does the ability for these other chains to like easily and securely which is the big question bridge to ethereum does that come more naturally or easily because it strikes me this is the last piece i'll say and then john i'll get your reaction like if if doodles goes on to flow i totally understand the argument that they get you know top shot on flow on board at a million users like clearly that is the leading chain when it comes to just wanting to optimize for get a lot of new people to be able to use it because it's super consumer consumer-friendly but what you what doodles will then be doing is sort of bifurcating their ecosystems where they have like some other ecosystem on ethereum and they have some of their ecosystem on flow and they're they don't really talk to them each other super easily and there's been issues with flow getting your funds out for example like you know flows there's challenges on the flow side and so are is this a little bit premature and they're doing this because they want to start rushing in their plan of getting all these new users on board and so they need to use something like a flow whereas if you just wait a little bit this might be something that could happen on an l2 on ethereum the positive onboarding experience and now you get to stay in the ethereum ecosystem and leverage that liquidity and that talking to your you know talking to each other uh systems okay rant freaking over john what do you think yeah i i think that they're they're trying to build for right now and for them they see that the the easy custodial wallet the easy onboarding you can use a credit card on on flow that that is the better way to go they're trying they're looking at those consumers who aren't yet in the space and they're they're making their their investment in in that area i long term in more bullish and on on more the ethereum layer 2 and layer 3 approach just because of the the liquidity that's on the chain that inherits the security of ethereum layer 1 one the tools while they're not in existence currently and that's the hard part you know zk sync is just about to roll out what they call zk sync 2.0 which is really their their mass user solution for layer two um so it's not quite out yet and so it's hard for a team that's developers to say we need to build today but what can we build on um i think we saw this with d diddex dydx just announced yes they're going absolutely to cosmos into cosmos leaving um ethereum uh because just for what is offered today on the layer two is just doesn't solve their their needs and the feeling is i heard somebody's take on that anthony cesano went on bank list and said he thought that this was actually a regulatory like a preemptive regulatory move that dydx was making and that i i i don't i don't know his logic entirely but he was basically i think they're being disingenuous they're acting like they don't want to build on layer two because it's not as good for them as developers but he was like i actually think it's like a regulatory thing that they're doing to to prevent uh like regulatory scrutiny or something along those lines i know bankless did a recent episode with um the founder of dydax i haven't i haven't listened to it yet but to kind of break down that move a little bit more so you say you seem to share my belief in the long-term viability of ethereum does that mean you think doodles is making a mistake by going with flow right now i mean if i had are you gonna put me in a corner and say i have to say yes or no putting you in a corner yeah what's your what's your gut level reaction it's not where i would go if i were a decision maker um you know i'm looking at uh palm the palm chain just announced that there and this was one thing that at ft nyc that i saw which didn't get much attention i don't know if this is new news or old news but the palm chain is going to move to becoming an ethereum layer too oh wow so and you know i wasn't tracking that yeah palm chain is the home of candy which has the mlb license it's the home of nifties which has a warner brothers license um it's the home of palm nft studio kind of a little confusing but who also has a warner brothers license and a couple of others so paul moving over to ethereum layer two is uh it's kind of like where we look at vv with uh on ethereum layer two using the stark uh x solution um or in immutable x so i think that's a good sign polygon is moving and kind of this is why i call about building the ship while at sea from below the water line but polygon is moving and transitioning to becoming an ethereum layer two zk roll up which i think people think it already is it's a side chain folks polygon is a side chain which means it does not inherit the security of ethereum layer one and people like treat it like it's the same you're like no it's actually not and look i like polygon um but uh it is building out their layer two solutions so it will be a proper layer too where it actually does inherit the the ethereum security exactly and the one with so i'm looking at these chains that are kind of out there now moving over to becoming ethereum layer twos and doing i mean that's gotta be technically impossible task to try to do and they could they can do it and i i've talked about with you about this privately and i've talked to a lot of kind of my clients and other friends about this but i have this theory this hypothesis that we're about to enter a period that i call the ecosystem wars and when i look at all of these different chains out there flow polygon ethereum all looking to build and bring users and to bring eyeballs during a bear market that it's going to become it's going to become bloody it's going to become a fight to try to get people to want to come to those chains and how do you do that well defy and c5 isn't really doing it right now so what does culture creators do nft creators storytellers artists brings those attention and so when i talk about these ecosystem wars my hypothesis is that we're going to start seeing teams bid on projects saying hey imagine larval labs the creator the original creators of um imagine if they were to come out with our next project and say okay everyone our next project is coming in six months would you like it on college or flow or avalanche or ethereum won't play this game but so which of you would like it and how much is it worth to you um i'm already aware of projects that are talking about going out and making those pitches saying hey we've got this big project coming this is what it is we have pedigree so you know we're a good team and we have good projects been successful how much is it worth for us to build on polygon how much is it worth for us to build an avalanche and they're looking for a check and so those ecosystem wars are about to happen and i think didn't uh mila kunis just announced that one of her projects is not going to be on ethereum it's going on to uh you know like an alt layer one yeah i believe it's called armored kingdom um it's going to an alt one layer one i forget the name of it right now it's a smaller one and it's a partnership with storytelling a studio of some kind out of india developing um amazing source of mythology and storytelling so i think strategically partnering with partners in india and bringing that storytelling to the market is just an amazing place to be an exciting place to be this clearly to be in that place with that chain that had to be a we're going to invest in we're the investors in this and we're going to support this pay you we as the chain are going to pay you yeah i mean yeah you're describing basically these these chains gasping for breath with in this bear market they're not getting the same their coins aren't worth nearly as much as they once were and so their native tokens and the the the how are we going to save ourselves play is with the with the last you know they still have millions of dollars whatever in in their their treasuries and it's like we're just gonna pay people to come and hope that that saves our chain um and some of these obviously will last and survive and etc yeah i'll make an entertainment kind of comparison think of like when like the film markets at um a toronto film festival or a sundance film festival filmmakers will bring independent projects there and then there's a market where bitter studios will bid for the rights to that movie and that's how actually apple acquired um their academy award-winning movie this year i forget what the name of it was um oh but a lot of the cat going to bug me yeah i know what you're talking about it was a big deal that apple like became the first streaming to win the academy awards and like they were like such a recent entrance into into streaming yeah i should i remember this i think it was called away but anyhow so this film markets occur and they'll say okay we've got this film who's going to bid on it and the studio is getting bidding wars of we'll give you x dollars and x terms for that project i believe that that's what's about to happen with some of the the better and bigger teams working in the space are about to get into those kinds of conversations with these these chains and you mentioned to me earlier that vitalik i think had tweeted at one point that is going to be very hard to really effectively bridge different l1s together that let you know like having a more seamless experience between an l2 and l1 we're gonna get there that's pretty simple but you know bridging a flow or an avalanche or a solana to an ethereum really securely and and seamlessly and whatever like that's uh gonna be much more difficult which you know i'm not of dev myself so i'm sort of reliant on the people that i trust and vitalik is one of those voices which is why i end up feeling like it feels like it's going to be easier for layer twos to solve the easy consumer onboarding problem than it is for other alt layer ones to solve their liquidity problem uh and to you know share liquidity with ethereum for example which is where still the vast majority of energy is and i don't think that's going away um and yeah so that tweet came out about four months ago and uh got a lot of attention at the time yep i i think that is an important tweet because i think that is that is true i i mean to go back to bring this back to full circle to doodles and since you put me in the corner of what i wouldn't it's not what i would have done um what so what would i have done i would have been looking at building a layer three on top of you know zk sync or or stark and having a dedicated doodles kind of app and experience and marketplace even um and knowing you've previously advocated for that for disney uh on on a podcast you said disney should fork zk sync and um yeah i uh yeah i i you know i just did an interview with robbie ferguson who's the ceo of imax and we talked a little bit about layer threes and and so for folks who aren't aware i think it is something to look into i just think it's important if you own a bunch of ethereum you know if you own more ethereum than you own of other you know cryptocurrencies which i do like you you you should start understanding this stuff because this is the this is what you're betting on as the future is layer threes which will roll up to layer twos or roll up and settle on ethereum and that's how this will scale and that's how we'll get millions and hundreds of millions of nfts traded on ethereum uh and so which is where this does need to move to so that that high-level thesis that degentral land is laying out and doodles and it's like i totally agree that's where we want to move to the question is where do you do it and do you do it on flow or do you do it on ethereum and i will say this it may be it may be telling that we haven't heard this from doodles themselves yet i know that jordan apparently said in a twitter space he would prefer to settle on ethereum so i don't think this is the doodle team is is is very bright you know like i think they're they're incredibly good at what they do so i do trust if they're going to flow they have a plan and they they understand the implication of it very fully um but it is it does run counter to sort of where my head is these days okay we are going to break this second part into a two-parter in and of itself so coming hot on your feed right after this will be a yuga lab special where it is john and i really breaking down our feelings around the rider rips board api club scandal as well as breaking down the lawsuit that board apes has filed thank you so much for listening here to this episode and
