have a history of agency i have a history of creating things in the world that change things so when i think about that at a very very high level of strategy okay what are the levers that we could move on and i want to bring out a particular point of where we are now we're conscious of money up until relatively recently money was sort of perceived by almost everyone but it wasn't something that we took as being a subject of our intentional design obviously if you're involved at all in the crypto universe you're on the other side of that conception right it's obvious at this point that we humans design the money if we're actually just able to look at the underlying landscape and consider making choices on the landscape itself this is a qualitatively different circumstance so it sounds like the agency over these problems is sort of like a key inflection point for humanity is that multiple people can sense make if they're not at the federal reserve they had no agency over these problems but now with open source money you can program your values into your money you can sense make about how to build the more game b system and you've got a better starting position
