news time david oh boy are we ready to get into this here it's a lot this is going to be a mess let's do it what do we even talk about what did we call this how do we even start this is like um would you call this a d5 scandal uh yes i think if i hubbub but it's scandals layered on top of scandals um we're invoking an older scandal because uh we it it's coming relevant again to talk about this defy scandal okay let's set the stage a little bit um we have to talk about um danny sesta golly danny sesta on twitter who is a d5 builder very talented d5 builder as well um some people have compared him to like andre cronier he's like the andre cronier of you know 2022. andre of course you know built wi-fi tons of fantastic protocols in in 2020 and um like i guess that's some background on him he's got a guy behind the magic internet money wonderland time spell like abracadabra whatever all the all this like my uh d5 mafia he's got quite a following too so like how would you describe like the tone and uh tenor of how danny operates on twitter and kind of messaging that sort of thing uh very very populist his his following is very aggressive of which i personally discovered uh you've been on the brunswick have been on the front end of this yeah yeah um uh and uh it's a very like working for the people anti-suits uh i work for you kind of big frog army leader uh he i think in his like twitter bio he's like uh like c-f-o-c-o-o something something of the second army something it's the frog army yeah of the frog nation uh and so like very much like a 4chan populist type and the projects are interesting too because he has a tendency to like you know ship fast very fast forking things taking whatever got it gotta appease the frogs right yeah right so uh abracadabra and he's made a lot of people a lot of money yes i would say is some of the context like token price has gone up abracadabra.money is a make your fork actually that um takes some of the the guardrails off of maker i would say makes it a little bit more risky a little bit more some people say interesting conservativism out of maker dow yeah yes and wonderland is a more recent project um time the time token is part of that it's kind of an olympus fork and that's on avalanche okay so that's danny that's who he is um we got a first revelation this week and this is um you know twitter confirmed so it's somewhat unconfirmed but you know it seems like it could be the case what was this first revelation david yeah so the in the bear market a lot of the quote unquote bear market especially in the last week a lot of the his projects are based on collateral and collateralization and when the value of collateral goes down bad things happen uh and so uh there's been a thread from jack nielwald that like i i don't follow his projects too closely and that's why i got the brunt of the frog army um but like we'll go ahead and read this thread uh time is the largest own fork by market cap olympus dow forked by market cap right if you just cool down um and it's been used as a playground by den uh danielle i think is is how danny uh vc's ambitions and more creative ideas it's offered uh five figure apyces takers but now as a result of the price crashes trading at its below its treasury value abracadabra money which is the spell token is a lending platform that lets users take out positions against crypto collateral and yield generating positions this allows users to take out loans that pay themselves off these loans charge interest and get liquidated and fees go to the spell holders danny and other team members have also taken out loans against their wrapped memo one of the one of the tokens using spell meaning they can cash out without actually selling so using their tokens as collateral to borrow against so they don't actually sell their tokens but they can get the value out of them but if those positions get liquidated they have all the money and it's basically for selling like they didn't press the sell button but somebody did um and so people talked about how this strategy would be uh perhaps exposed or liquidated if the value of these collaterals went down too much so they borrow all the money that they can against it and if it goes down then everything gets liquidated and like that you have a cascading liquidation so this strategy was talked about on twitter causing time to crash below the value of the assets in the treasury possibly triggering a liquidation event buybacks were supposed to be in place to keep the token price at the treasury value no matter what but this didn't happen and the devs were silent leading to accusations of a soft rug danny locked his twitter account during all this drama um but fired back with an admission that time buybacks were not working as expected and a plan to fix time and bolster spell came out simultaneously and and so that was kind of like the start of this whole thing and what is this idea of a soft rug that's an interesting term what do you think that means yeah that's just talking about how like he's not he's not like capitulating his own assets he's just putting his assets into a collateralized position borrowing as much money as possible on that and then if the value of those things go down and then there is a liquidation event like it doesn't matter because he bought he borrowed all the money anyways so it's like a roundabout way to exit without actually pressing the sell button i got it and that's the charge again uh somewhat unconfirmed and that was just the the the first part of it we if that alone happened we probably wouldn't be talking about it right now but something was added to that which is the second revelation and uh this is going to be this is unrelated actually so same person same projects but a completely different bit of drama going on okay so what is this this bit of drama um because it's yeah it's it is unrelated but it's kind of related to the entire you know scandal story actually before before we get in into that it is tbd about whether uh danny would and uh some of the other big leaders of the of the projects were doing the soft rug that is an accusation uh they also could be using that same money to pump to bolster the time price uh that is what i think danny has stated he was intending to do with that uh in order to prevent a cascading liquidation so like there this is not this still kind of unraveling uh and we're still kind of figuring figuring this out but in the meantime in the meantime uh there is a bunch of other drama that that came about uh so are we ready to go into this yeah let's go into this and there's some backstory here so i guess maybe the the high level is that a former quadriga co-founder uh just emerged and apparently he's been the right-hand man right-hand person of danny managing a lot of the money behind the time treasuries and on the most individual yes on the multisig this individual michael uh patron has an incredibly shady past um how should we best explain this like who is michael patron what what is this shady pass what is quadriga do you want to tell some of the story here david yeah well michael's patron has been off the radar off the grid for a very long time uh but this individual zack xbtc uh xbt uh tweeted out private dms in telegram with danny and he says to danny i came across something rather odd about um about ox sifu which is one of the multisig signers on the projects and and he goes i i've discovered something about sifu uh and danny goes what's up uh and zerox uh zac xbt says well he's the quadringa guy uh the the quadringa guy that was a convicted felon for uh identity fraud and and has been off the grid for a while uh and danny goes i cannot confirm but i have thought a lot about that and uh he responds dangerous to be working with him sir uh and that's one tweet and um uh he then that's that's basically that uh and so he tweets out this needs to be shared xerox sifu is the co-founder of quadringa cx michael patron if you are unfamiliar with that it's the canadian exchange that collapsed in 2019 after founder gerald cotton disappeared with 169 million dollars i've confirmed with this about with danny over messages uh and so this is a really big deal uh because this is an individual with a very shady past uh and is discovered to be a multi-sig signer on this uh uh d5 protocol on avalanche that has a ton of tvl uh and so managing millions of dollars millions of dollars of people's money dollars of a protocol and like what's what's uh uh egregious about this is that uh danny knew about this for about a month without raising the alarm about the significance of this individual so there's this fantastic summarizing article that we're gonna read some of the things uh uh about it just because it summarizes so well um after all this came out after uh xerox bt said uh uh revealed this uh danny if you wanna scroll down a little bit ron uh danny posted on twitter today allegations about our team member xerox sifu will circulate i want everyone to know that i'm aware of this and have decided that the past of an individual does not determine their future i choose to value the time we spend together without knowing his past more than anything danny also issued an official statement reiterating his beliefs in the second chances and reassuring everyone that all the funds are safe even though a convicted felon is watching over the treasury i found out about this one month ago and i am of the opinion of giving second chances as i've mentioned on twitter i've seen the community very divided about my choice of maintaining him as the treasury manager after finding out who he was in his past he added that patreon patron uh will step down from his position at wonderland and there will be a vote as to whether or not he rejoins the team that vote is ongoing at the time of recording wonderland has uh has the say to who manages the treasury not me or the rest of the wonderland team says danny um yes also uh this is where this is of just again fun and backstory on this michael guy michael patrin is former convicted felon omar dhanani who legally changed his name to cover up his criminal past patron left quadringa in early 2016 after he and cotton allegedly had a quarrel in split ways prior to founding cuadringa patron was one of 28 people arrested in connection to operating an identity theft ring called shadow crew he pulled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in u.s federal prison upon his release he was sent back to canada where he went right back to doing the thing he was always doing all along which was moving money uh and so that's kind of the story uh the the take at the very bottom of this article has a take of uh on this individual he says uh patreon is a one-trick pony he's not clever enough to reinvent himself and his hubris makes it impossible for him to simply disappear and go quiet and enjoy a life somewhere kind of pointing out he's like a serial shenaniganizer okay all right so just i i wonder if like so just to follow this large d5 protocol managing lots of money with a very esteemed builder d5 builder in the community danny the community finds out that the person that danny set in charge of the multi-sigs and this community treasury is a convicted felon super shady individual various individuals yeah nefarious individual probably many in the community would say should not be trusted with money and furthermore that danny knew about this for a month didn't disclose this to the community and so and then uh it was interesting because danny decided to double down and say hey you know second chances i believe in giving people second chances before then going back to the community and say what do you want to do with this individual should he still be managing the the funds or not and so this created quite a um a stir on twitter i would say right you know back and forth people are disappointed with danny but the kind of the lack of transparency disappointed with um you know the project and in some of the statements um michael patron made a statement as well do you want to get into that or skip that david yeah it's more or less like hey i've had a fantastic time uh working on wonderland i'm sad that i'm going to have to go i understand why i have to go uh but i'm i'm leaving and i love all of you uh and then a bunch of emojis from the community in discord you can uh we'll put the tweet in the show notes yeah so here i get some takes that i have early on first first of all we reached out to danny actually and he's gonna come on the podcast i think hopefully next week and uh talk about this so give him a chance to kind of explain hopefully his actions i've given him my calendly link before and he hasn't clicked on it hopefully he comes on the pod fingers crossed and that's what he publicly committed to jenny we are very fair and we are very fair and rational individuals so we can we can do this yes at least david is i'm not so much but um takeaways for for me like this is a very bad look for d5 this is kind of the the fodder that elizabeth warren wants to bring to a senate committee like if she found out about this right so like you've got a conflicted convicted felon managing millions of dollars of investors capital without them knowing about it oh what's her answer to that regulation more regulation in the space so you know one take from me is like sorry i'm sorry to cut you off this is a shadowy super coder yes that's who this is this is like this is like oh yeah i told you so and we'd have to be we'd have to say okay elizabeth in this specific case you're right uh and here's the take i guess if we don't regulate ourselves they'll regulate us yeah okay and i i think this is why um the original poster uh for this was it zach um xbt is doing god's work in surfacing this taking a big risk because like a risk yeah because this through the frog army is not something that you want to mess with and this is going to be where he's going for threats david i'm sure he's gotten threatened for people in his dm's i'm sure it's like you know even legal threats all sorts of things um but an individual whistleblower shedding a light on this is more of what defy needs in order to keep itself clean yes zach xbt nice job well done nice job thanks for having the courage to surface this um and i guess my last takeaway on this is just in general we have to be very careful of trusting people in d5 okay like trusting people in crypto in general or especially it's a red flag for me whenever someone asks you to trust them okay like the takeaway here is never trust anyone in crypto that demands that you trust them and people who are continuously saying no it's fine like i've got the multi-sigs just like just like trust me uh i have your best interest at heart that always sends red flags and shivers up my back because the whole philosophy is crypto of crypto is verify don't trust you shouldn't have to trust people we have systems in place to make this entire space trustless and um we don't want to depend on trusting a small set of individuals it's not reputational trust in the space it shouldn't be anyway those are some of my takeaways what what do you have on developers are always a hairy topic because like it's good overall but also i'm happy that people are able to be anon in this industry if they so choose but also the combination of anons on multisigs is a little bit rough because reputation is a fantastic piece of collateral to have to hold someone accountable and if you are an anon like you remove the that option from the community to hold you accountable because of how you're in on this guy this guy uh michael literally changed his name yes right literally changed his name how much to cover up the past right to cover up the past how much easier is that to do on the internet where you could just you know change beneath the dress create a new you know online reputation and start from scratch uh yeah so it's something that we have to work on here are some takes from around the community this is andre cronier who works very very closely with danny yeah once you read this this is just the uh it's so tiresome meme it's also tiresome and andre says i just want to code uh and he has some commentary further down as well where he says i still support danny still planning on working hit with him but there are lines a history of consent consistent fraud theft and malicious behavior isn't a mistake that's intent having sifu manage funds especially user funds can be argued as negligence that's all i have danny knew for a month and in that time sifu was handling funds i don't know what psyops i don't know what's going on i want to get off willy wonka's magical ride there you go from from andre uh a similar kind of builder in the field uh what's the stake david yeah so danny danny wrote somewhere that he said like i thought i could fix him like oh i thought i could fix this this convicted felon person uh which is a brunt of some jokes on crypto twitter uh and then simona pop who's a fantastic uh female community leader in the space goes the female urge to know that that never works yeah i can't fix them and i think look i think the important thing here was uh transparency and disclosure right it's like if the community had known who this individual was managing their funds then they could have gotten ahead of this and voted on it and they're in the process of voting now and i expect they will not reinstate this individual as the manager of their millions of dollars in treasury we would show the snapshot but it's got the feature of it the votes are being hidden so we don't actually know like who's winning or who's losing uh this phone so probably it'll probably be available by the time you guys listen to this anyway ends january 28th at 9 00 pm uh pacific time i think yeah yeah hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills
