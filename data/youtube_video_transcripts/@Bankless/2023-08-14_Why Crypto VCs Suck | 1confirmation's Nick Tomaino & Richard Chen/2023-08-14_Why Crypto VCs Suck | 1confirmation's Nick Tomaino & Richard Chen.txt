five years crypto prices are going to be much higher and crypto products are going to be widely used but we've been in a video game the past five years where you have these NPCs that are trying to suck Us in and kill us and you have SBF who's Shilling mainstream crypto narrative or you have three arrows Capital showing alt L ones you have dokwon Shilling stable coins you have all of these NPCs and if you can manage your greed you can stick to authentic products that are pushing the space forward in new ways then you're going to be well positioned and you're going to win the game welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this how to get started how to get better how to front on the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless the topic today why VCS suck with some people who would actually know we have crypto VC's Nick and Richard from one confirmation on the episode you might ask why would we have VCS on a podcast and then talk about why VCS suck my answer would be who better to tell us the shenanigans behind the scenes than the actual the people on the inside that's right and I think retail crypto investors and VCS have long had this adversarial relationship and this episode gets into the why and how to protect yourself from becoming their exit liquidity in the final parts of the episode we talk about the coming bull market what theme are Nick and Richard most excited about are we finally going to build a crypto product that gets used by billions of users this was just a no BS conversation that I thoroughly enjoyed David what was the significance of this episode for you we'll say this in the intro but we had Nick and Richard from one confirmation on 2 two and a half years ago I think it was they were some of our first feces on bankless way back when in early March 2021 and that's how episode was titled authenticity in crypto and it was about a similar subject matter like how to pierce through narratives and Richard really took a front and center seat because he was a very early Doom boards analytics wizard before Dune really even blew up into the thing that it is today and so we were trying to unpack how to pierce through narratives with data with on-chained data which is this new tool that we have to navigate the crypto space and now the crypto industry is two three years more mature has two to three years of experience behind it and there's also been two to three years of adversarial relationships between VCS and Retail investors and so there's been some shenanigans that have gone on uh not just with VCS but people like hedge funds like three hours capital and Traders and so I think just going and getting a snapshot halfway through 2023 about how how and why these incentives are created that separate retail from both Founders and VCS and understanding why what are the ingredients that cause this relationship to exist can help equip you bankless listener to help navigate this bull market and make sure that when you see some VCS on Twitter that have big prowesses and spend a bunch of narratives that you actually can start to pierce through what they are exactly doing and why they are doing it so I think this episode will be helpful for that yeah I can't wait to talk to you more about that during the debrief which of course is our episode after the episode bankless citizens can access that now on the premium feed David and I I forgot so Richard remind me that's that episode his was one of the first tweets that actually lit the match for the downfall of SBF and I have that tweet up I want to talk to you more about that during the debrief because I remember it well so we're going to get to the guests in a second but first we disclose we had VCS in the podcast and as with any VC I think you should expect that they have biases a project called polymarket was mentioned they're investors they also mentioned two projects one called Pimlico the other called friends both David and I have exposure to both of these one is angels and the other as bankless Ventures we're long-term investors not

excited to introduce you once again to Richard Chen and Nick tomato they are GPS at one confirmation a crypto focused VC fund that's definitely seen a thing or two if you're a dune board connoisseur you might know Richard from his work on the many Dune boards that he's created we use them on the weekly Roll-Ups all of the time and we've had Nick and Richard back on the show I think the last time was March 2021 during the heat of the bull run that was hot now we're bringing them back full circle to talk about maybe everything we learned or didn't learn Richard Nick it's great to have you back how you doing I'm great how are you guys fantastic good I think I'm good actually I was just talking to David about this uh recently and I feel like we are entering the Goldilocks zone of of kind of the cycle so let me just kind of like Define that for you guys and see if it resonates or what you think what part of the cycle we're in my favorite part of the cycle is when we get through all of the dumpage and kind of like all of the pain and we're out on the other side of that and we're heads down building and you see kind of the fundamentals starting to to stack up uh and kind of no Market reaction to those fundamentals but the builders are are building and it's still quiet so the market hasn't yet gotten stupid and uh the tourists have left the settlers are here and we're in kind of this like quiet phase of growth and I feel like that's what August of 2023 is for me and uh I don't know it's just a feeling uh what do you guys think what part of the cycle are we in does any of that resonate to uh to you what do you think Nick a little bit yeah I mean it's it's always hard timing is always hard uh for me I mean that's part of why we started one confirmation as a venture fund because I have a really high degree of conviction that in five years um you know crypto is going to be broadly used in the world and crypto prices are going to be much higher and crypto products are going to be widely used but it's hard to time things so one of the things I've been thinking about I I feel like we are in a we're playing a video game um I think a lot of crypto people this may resonate with it's like we've been in a video game the past uh you know five years where you have these NPCs that are trying to suck Us in and kill us right and you have SPF who's Shilling uh you know mainstream crypto narrative or you have three arrows Capital showing alt L ones you have dokwon Shilling stable coins you have all of these NPCs that are trying to suck Us in and kill us and if you can manage your greed um you can stick to authentic products that are pushing the space forward in new ways then you're going to be real well positioned and you're going to win the game so that's more the feeling I have and I don't know if all of the NPCs of this cycle are necessarily dead right there might be most of them are gone right and have blown up which is a good thing but I don't know there's there's a few still out there so you have to wait till they all die Nick or can we just like move on and just realize we're just gonna stack some NPCs every cycle no I mean I don't I don't know it it depends how um how big of a bad guy they are and sometimes it's hard to know but um but I do think you're right um you know a lot of the um you know these NPCs have been fleshed out and um there is a lot of great stuff happening and um it's not happening on a mainstream level where everyone's paying attention then that does tend to be a good time to lean in right Richard what do you what do you think about the cycle I mean do you resonate like uh if we're playing a video game what what video game are we playing and like what part of the cycle are we in well with the cycle um I'm not a Trader myself so like it's I really can't time markets and know you know when the next Bull Market's gonna start if we've bottomed or anything um I mean the game I always compare crypto to is like RuneScape um like this was really like true when you know back in 2020 like yield farming started um and you know there's like so many parallels between like item things you do in RuneScape and things you do in crypto um and there's definitely a strong subculture community in crypto with RuneScape um and of course you know you have bad guys um I try to like the the I think the long term in crypto um it's important to be Lindy and just like survive and like don't fly too close to the Sun and feel like you're invincible and like use leverage and blow up you know fall for really aggressive marketing and like people who try to play God on Twitter um just you know stay level-headed and don't don't be too greedy I think one part of the cycle that you guys might be more tapped into more than like the the price cycle would be the signal cycle um right like Ryan said like we're in this I I totally resonate with what Ryan saying we're in this like Goldilocks zone Goldilocks era of crypto where if you were going to leave you would have left by now and also the NPCs that Nick was talking about were all like in jail or have fled uh and so we're in this like MPC NPC free zone where all the homies are hanging out on crypto Twitter and we're all kind of just like in this Calm before the storm and I'm wondering how that relates to how this Goldilocks era of crypto also relates to the signal that you guys are seeing in startups and what they are building on and what they are focusing on so like Nick you said like five year long uh five-year time Horizons you start to have a pretty strong confidence and you know that's what startups are building for and the noise cycle of startups is also a cycle goal uh that that exists inside the crypto space like people are building things in the top of the bull market that are kind of just make no sense but only make no sense in hindsight where would you see how would you describe maybe the last two years of noise to Signal ratio and the startup landscape and how do you how do you see where we are now Nick I'll throw that one to you well there's always a lot more noise um and this is not necessarily a bad thing it's one of the beneficial things about crypto but um you know there's more noise in a bull market of course which begets more noise which gets more noise and things go crazy and get too overextended and so that's happened now five or so times that I've seen since I've been in crypto or you or you have these extreme bull markets um and and during those extreme bull markets I mean what we see is a lot of of Builders right but um a lot of the builders are only there because of the money and because of the attention and they don't really um understand crypto uh deeply we talk about this idea of we try to invest in things that are at the intersection of purist and tourist right so the purist is um the person that steeped in historical knowledge and context on like the history of the the thing the product um the Taurus is someone that doesn't give a about all that they just want to build something that resonates with users um and so in kind of a bull market um you see Taurus and the Taurus can look really especially from a Founder perspective these tourists can look really good on paper right they've worked at Facebook or Google or whatever they have really compelling resumes they talk a really good game um but they don't get the history they don't get the context they don't get crypto deeply um so you know those those came out a lot in the past two years um and what we try to find again is the intersection of Puris and Taurus and I think now the builders you seem more purists right and being too purist also isn't great right because you're never going to connect with a mainstream audience so now I think you know we're seeing a lot of purists which we'd rather we tend to skew a little purists um maybe too much so in some cases but um but really you know in terms of of the signal now it's a lot of kind of purist Founders that really appreciate and understand crypto and are building things for a crypto native audience and in those times what we we want to do is make sure that those types of Founders have a little Taurus in them right because again I think to really win big in crypto you need to be at the intersection of purus and Taurus and I would argue that's what ethereum has that's what coinbase has that's what openc has um and those are those are what we found uh to be the best investments that's a really interesting mental model so the intersection between tourists and and PRS and by the way that that wasn't that wasn't original for me um the the creator of this idea um is a a designer who passed away um in the past year and a half his name's Virgil ablo and he's a very famous um designer that worked for Louis Vuitton and a bunch of big designer Brands he had a brand named off-white as well and he that was his mental model that he applied to how he designs clothing and furniture and things like that and I um I got to meet him once um and I basically watched all his YouTube content and everything and um and I kind of found that and I was like wow that's exactly kind of how we think about crypto investing so so in 2021 you know kind of peak of the cycle you saw a lot of tourist types of Founders and you you wish they would maybe skew a bit more purist right and now 2023 where we only have kind of the the tourists have left so we only have we call them big list the settlers and these would be sort of the purists and now you're looking for kind of Founders and Builders who are purists because they're still here obviously everyone is still here is probably a purist at some level but they have a bit of tourists in them in that they're not just building for the existing crypto audience they're building for like the next cohort that we want to bring into crypto is that sort of what you're saying Nick exactly exactly Richard what would you add to that what's uh you know what about that mental model speaks to you yeah um the terminal terminology I like to use is missionary versus mercenary um and I think a lot of mistakes that VCS made during the bull market is they saw a lot of Founders who have really polished resumes like they went to Stanford worked at Google Facebook uh were like a founding engineer at a startup and then now there's going to be a great executor in crypto and what Eminem happening is like when crypto prices drop 90 um I think the people who are the most talented are also the first people to bail and pivot to AI or something else because uh they have a lot of opportunities so there's um nothing that's intrinsically motivating them to stick around in crypto if they could succeed just as well in AI um I think I really saw this a lot with the Solano ecosystem so uh I think a lot of VCS made the mistake of like there's so much talent if developers going to Solana but from talking to like a lot of these so-called Blue Chip teams in Solana um it just felt like a lot of mercenary Founders that weren't going to stick around when crypto prices crashed and you know fast forward like two years after the all ll1 like the peak of the L1 cycle like we're seeing a lot of big names Solana projects like wind down or pivot um so is one other thing to add is um like while Silicon Valley archetype Founders might be like the worst type of Founders to back in Bull markets I think they're probably some of the best type of Founders to back in Bear markets because this is just kind of speaking in generalization like Silicon Valley type Founders are generally better executors than kind of your random open source Indie hacker uh from like someplace else in the world so you know in a bear Market when there's um sort of an emerging category say like account abstraction I I think the the Silicon Valley Founders that are that do have the conviction to build in the bear markets are just going to out execute you know all their wallet competitors uh other projects building in the AAA spaces one example so the same founder archetype can provide two totally different signals to you depending on when you meet them in the market cycle um yeah more or less let's um there's probably more to talk about with respect to kind of investing at this part of the cycle and and different Founders and teams but also I'm very interested in themes right because a big question I think for crypto right now is hey crypto you guys going to stay a niche or are you actually going to expand to like billions of users and that has always been sort of the promise so maybe we'll talk about that later but before we do I want to talk about this uh thing that Richard was talking about for for a minute it's like mistakes VCS make okay so VCS it turns out make mistakes and I think I've seen you Nick be actually you know one of the most critical voices of uh about VCS specifically in crypto that that I've seen which is interesting because like obviously you guys are also VCS right so this is VCS talking about why VC suck I'll read out a few tweets all right venture capital is the dumb money in crypto this from January of this year that was a Nick tweet NPC VCS are a Vibe so calling VCS NPCs as well good at raising money from Hollow and institutions and deploying it to hot Trends never distributed cash to LPS you go on but I'll flip to another tweet venture capital is the fakest industry on the on the planet in what other industry can you be objectively bad at your job but create narratives that make you appear great to the outside world for years all right so some harsh boutiques and before we get into this discussion of like maybe why VC suck let me let me frame this because I bet there are a lot of bankless listeners out there and obviously um you know we don't skew VC we have VCS that listen to our podcasts but this is basically like we're all crypto investors on the journey right Bank list so we're talking to like what people might call a bunch of retail users or actually actual crypto users some of those crypto natives some of those settlers who stayed and they were hearing me read those tweets and they were like probably you know standing up and clapping like standing ovation like go get them Nick right like there's this battle or this dichotomy in crypto that I think is unique it doesn't so much exist in other Venture Capital right right because the markets take longer to go public it does exist to some extent but not like crypto where it's sort of like yeah the VCS are going to dump on retail they're going to like invest a um in an asset uh take a position early well you know unaccredited investors don't get access to it and they're going to wait for it to release a token and then they're gonna dump their bags on you and this has played out over and over and over again so I think a lot of bankless listeners are probably like standing up and and cheering you on and yet I think there's some you know subtlety here because you guys are obviously VCS so I imagine you think you're doing the right thing here but let's talk about this why do VCS suck why do you why do you seem to hate VCS Nick Well I obviously like some VCS right I don't hate all VCS or anything like that but I do really dislike Venture Capital culture particularly in Silicon Valley um and there's a few reasons why the main one is just the lack of transparency on performance um so in in if you're an NBA shooting guard right you uh are objectively measured on your performance right points per game how many points did you score in a game if you're a boxer you're objectively measured on what's your win loss record um and Venture Capital doesn't have that um you know there is a metric right which is distributions to paid in capital right you take LP money and then you return it and the job of a VC is to make good Investments and generate a high distributions to paid in capital DPI but it's not talked about publicly so that aspect of of venture capital culture and it's not just crypto it's it's broad um I think really I don't like it uh and I don't I don't think it's it's optimal for people for the masses right um it's it's almost more like an industry like politics right where you're competing on perception rather than how you're how good you are at your actual job and so that's what leads to things like uh you know thread Boys on Twitter um or you know these massive wait what's a threat boy so I think it explains itself yeah is that somebody there just publishes a bunch of threads like for narrative's sake and you know it's not yeah what's that what's the implication there no you you know exactly what it is I'm sure most of your listeners do um but so you have you have people that are competing for perception to be perceived as really smart or to um you know be perceived as having a lot of money or something like that um when that doesn't really matter it's it's not um it's not part of the job the job is to be a good investor and return funds so I would really love to see a culture where just like again NBA where people are talking about DPI and irr and these metrics that really matter that you know behind the scenes all you know the LPS and these funds care about and are looking at but that's not what's happening now and I think that's that's a big part of why um you know people I think a lot of people your listeners and others can sense this and why there is this negative sentiment towards VCS because it does feel very fake you have these people you know Shilling fake narratives and you know trying to generate a lot of attention um when that's actually not not the name of the game so that's that's the first thing um the second thing is and this isn't unique to venture but there's a lot of greed uh in crypto right everyone is greedy um that's human nature but I think in crypto VC as well um there's a lot of short-term greed focus and what I specifically mean by this is you guys know this and probably part of your list most of your listeners do also but as a venture fund you make money two ways right you make it with management fees um and that's just an annual fee that you collect on funds raised and you make it in Cary and that's um a a fee at the end when you return the money plus some you get it you get usually 20 of that right so typical you know fees for Venture is is two and twenty so Nick that means if you have a hundred million dollar fund right and we're talking a management fees of two percent then two million dollars just for having the fund in existence goes to kind of management fees that's the one agnostic of performance agnostic of performance yep and then the 20 is the performance bonus exactly and so because of the these incentive structures um most people are just trying to raise as much money as possible right um so the example I like to use is you could have a 50 million dollar fund that is 20x at the at the end of the 10 years right that's one of that'd be one of the best Venture funds of all time um and in that case you'll make uh 200 million right you'll make uh roughly um you know 190 million my math is right on uh Carey and 10 million on management fees and your LPS are very happy exactly so that's that's one example the other example is you could have a billion dollar fund um and you're gonna make two and you could lose everything um theoretically at the at the end of the fund not return anything um and you could still make 200 million you're collecting a two percent management fee annually so that's the reason that you see these massive funds right because it's it's um you know if you're just looking at it from a pure pure uh you know how much money you're going to make perspective it's the the rational thing to do is just to raise as much as possible in a bull market and so that's why you see so much you know Capital um and so many people that probably have no business raising billion dollar funds that have them but doesn't that problem get fixed Nick because if I'm not returning a capital to my LPS and they're not going to give me Capital the next go around when I try to raise the next fund but Ventures along so that that'll play out over a 10-year period so um 13 years old 10 years or more right so you're not um you know there's there's a long feedback cycle for venture to know if you're good or not um so so that's that's a problem right the reason this is a problem this explains FTX right FTX you have Prestige brand name funds that are giving FTX hundreds of millions of dollars right why well because they have massive funds they need to deploy it and what they see as big opportunities and they don't uh do their homework and actually look at what's really going on they look at it as a surface level and say oh SPF is a great executor right he um is getting all this media attention he's you know working with Regulators he's he's such a good executor that was that was the narrative from these funds that gave hundreds of millions to to SPF and it's soulless greed right it's they have these massive funds they have huge management fees um and and they invest in projects that that make no sense that are either you know an Aptos or a sui or something like that or an FTX so either it's you know one of the worst frauds in history or it's a um you know a token that um they then dump on retail to to your point um so that's I guess that was long-winded uh Richard probably has other thoughts but those are two reasons why um I take issue with a lot of what I see in uh Venture Capital today yeah Richard what do you want to add to here yeah is on the topic of perception of VCS uh do you guys remember back in 2021 there was that like spreadsheet uh floating around on crypto Twitter like ranking all like the VCS by Tears like oh yeah vaguely I can't remember what the purpose of that species I think it was around the time of the sushi treasury diversification and then like and like there are all these like VCS like proposing themselves as like hey we should uh buy some sushi tokens at a discount like the funniest thing about this spreadsheet is like you know looking back in hindsight two years later is like on every single ranking like Alameda three arrows were like always at the top of the list um and like it's like pretty true that like there's a very strong inverse relationship between like who's killing it on crypto Twitter and like what their performance like what's actually going on behind the scenes and it's almost like like if you're killing it on Twitter it's because you have something bad you want to hide uh so you try to create this narrative that other people think that you're still good when you're trying to mask some shitty stuff that you're doing um so like another thing that happened during the bull market is um you had all these trading shops that were starting to invest in like private deals and they probably could like not give two shits about like what the founder is building but like as soon as the founder mentions the word token like they're just like in immediately and it's clear because they want to get into the private sale and then dump as soon as the tokens live and like uh there's no lock up um so like with that said like you know not all VCS are created equal and you know a lot of Founders mistakenly went with these uh trading shops uh when they were fundraising the bull market because you know it was like the easiest money to raise like you could go to three arrows have a 30 minute call almost no due diligence as as long as you say the word token and like that's the easiest way to fundraise uh but you know if you're thinking long term obviously that money comes with strings attached and you know a lot of those Founders have left the space uh because they learned the hard way of you know getting dumped on by their quote unquote VCS I I know David's gonna jump in with something but can I just say I am loving this real talk all right this is so refreshing to my soul um yes these are the games that are being played aren't they and I want to try and unpack why crypto is conducive to these games like there are some ingredients in really to understand the Dynamics about why these things are the way that they are why the incentive structures are the way that they are why there's this real negative relationship between uh VC and Retail because I think we can the more that we diagnose this stuff the more we can actually be like navigate it and understand it and so uh I think we're doing a great job and I want to I want to continue because I think there's a one more uh part of this conversation Nick you alluded to it with your uh threadboy comment so much of crypto lives in the future because so much of it is like it's perceived it's like we can imagine a crypto future uh we can all like and think about what this might be like in the future but a lot of crypto is left to be built and so that leaves a void there for imaginative thread boys perhaps to fill it with something and I think that's another component as to like why there is this weird toxic relationship between VCS who are quote unquote getting in early at cheap discounts and then the actual manifestation of things in Market reality which is the public markets which is where retail plays in so so Nick maybe you can kind of like uh carry this conversation forward what or the void of reality in crypto why is it so strong like what why does crypto allow for some of this stuff to manifest well it's part of what makes it so fun right and what makes us us all love it and uh you know live it every day it's like everything is happening in the open uh you know everything's open source the culture of crypto does tend to be very transparent um where you know people are talking about stuff online people are seeing things on chain um and that's why it's there's a kind of a culture Clash right you have like Venture Capital which lacks a lot of transparency and you have crypto which actually does tend to be very transparent right and I always I always think like the reason you know it was not um Regulators it was not the media that took down FTX right it was crypto it was the crypto Community it was actually Richard's uh tweet on October 13th was one of the things that really kicked it off it was a whole bunch of other people as well obviously but Richard what did you tweet oh it's about the dccpa bill uh basically SPF was lobbying behind the scenes to get the dcpa bill yeah I that's what happened now and we're calling okay so I saw I want to talk about this by the way oh my God you know why it's because that whole period of time is a blur David that's the tweet I actually saw it was I think previously yeah and I messaged you about it Richard and I was like are you serious so uh the bill was called dccpa right digital Commodities currency protection house or something like that yes this is what led us to invite SPF yes it was it was because so Richard uh shot out this flare a whole bunch of people across crypto Twitter as far as I knew were saying that hey this bill is is okay for crypto yeah it's got some compromises but like it's all gonna be okay and then you shot out this flare and he said this is not okay they're talking about banning D5 front ends in the United States requiring like AML kyc type of rules money transmitter laws to apply to D5 front ends that's not okay and you said something to the effect of like an SPF is behind this so I was like what that's not squaring with what I'm hearing and then there was a some some debate I think um I participated in one of uh you know the Tweet threads with with SBF where he was kind of Defending we were attacking that that led to a conversation with SBF and Eric Voorhees on the bankless podcast a whole debate about this and it kind of blew up from there I've forgotten that you were the source of that Richard oh yeah it's it's pretty cool um and again that's that's what's great about crypto is like just you know some random dude can tweet something get it out in the open and the community reacts and it leads to a month later FTX was dead it's really crazy um and I think you know if if in an industry in a different industry that wasn't as transparent and open um you know FTX would have gone on to be the the JP Morgan of the industry right and we don't know the the true history of like how JP Morgan got to be that but my guess is there's some shady there that that the public doesn't know about right so to answer your question this is kind of a tangent David I guess but I I mean the the reason why um you have so much wild happening in crypto and anyone can you know tweet anything and it's a really cool fun thing as well because it's the culture of crypto is very very open and transparent um but the problem is you know everyone has their own bias there's extreme greed there's extreme bias and you know what I always say is I I don't think it's a problem to be biased um if you're biased and right right but the problem is there's a lot of people that are biased and badly wrong um and loud about it and and that's where you know problems can arise from but um but yeah the kind of open nature of of crypto culture which you guys are obviously very well aware of and also have you know contributed a great deal to is is one of the uh the best things about it if you had to uh give a sweeping grade to crypto VCS as a whole good ones lumped in with the bad ones and the mid ones in there too how would you how would you audit crypto VCS um um maybe like a c oof okay all right why what's what's the main Mark what's the main uh curse that crypto VCC well I just think I I think what I've talked about I think it's greed um and I think particularly when it comes to like hurting retail right um like you have a lot of these coins that give 50 plus of their allocation to team investors and then dump on retail and this is something that I can't believe it's not more talked about right but like the the token distribution is something that everyone investing in a token should be well aware of right so like what what's Bitcoin what what percentage of the coin of the coin did um did Satoshi give to team and investors zero of course zero what was ethereum do you guys know ethereum's 12 and a half I think it was not that's close I think it was like 9.9 in terms of Team investors early developers um do you know solanas it's like 50 not great um and and you I guess worse than that I'm sure yeah I mean you know isn't this also partly a Founder project issue as well as in the founders create a deal that is highly conducive to VCS and the founders these VCS have like okay you build this project and you're giving a large share in it I'll promote it and then we'll dump on retail which in like a perfect harmony world it would be a three-way partnership between project VC and Retail where everyone feels good at the end of it uh but there's there's like Founders can also be severely culpable about this too a hundred percent and again this speaks to the culture clash between ventric Silicon Valley Adventure capital and crypto right because in traditional Silicon Valley venture capital Founders see the VCS as like the king makers right and so famously like you know there's there's massive products that you know people believe Were King made because the VC gave one of them 100 million and not the other or something like that and so I think a lot of the traditional Silicon Valley Founders see these VCS as king makers um and that's why they're willing to do these deals when the truth in crypto is that's not the case of the VCS aren't King makers right look at the the top three cryptocurrencies right um which makes up about 70 of the total market cap of of cryptocurrencies uh Bitcoin eth and tether they didn't raise Venture Capital right you there's the the idea that VCS are King makers um in crypto I think is uh not accurate and so that I think is um it but that's the reason that a lot of these Founders I think do these deals would you say it's accurate that um retail never had a voice in Silicon Valley Web 2 startup founder VC relationships because they were stuck behind the walls of public listings on this Don the NASDAQ and stock exchanges and and so now there's this conflict because For the First Time In crypto retail actually does have a voice and all these players that you know Founders and VCS that existed before crypto are now having to deal with this new variable which are the voices of retail who are ultimately the buyers of these tokens and that's where a source of the conflict comes from for the first time in crypto retail actually has a voice and it can make demands and produce market pressures would you say that's a conclusion of this yeah not not just a voice but I mean retail is a direct competitor with the VCS right um so certainly um there's the users of these products are owners and have a loud voice and also are direct competitors so I think you know I gave I gave a c grade um I'm obviously biased because we're doing as well because we're doing things a certain way but we the way we uh you know run a venture fund is to really act like users first and foremost um and to be aligned with um you know the users um of products because we are users ourselves um and so we generally aren't participating in any of these big um you know pre-sales and you know we we have made exceptions um which I'm sure people will call out um like World coin is the one that people like to call out the most um but so we do make exceptions but I mean even World coin um do you know how much worldcon obviously gets a ton of  do you know the supply of 20 25 25. so um it's not close to you know some of these others can I I want to come back to that idea in a little bit because uh you know another mental model unlock I think for us um you know the first was like an intersection between purists and tourists another is this idea I've heard you guys talk about the idea of a user Capital versus venture capital and how you want to be more on the kind of the user Capital side of things which is like actually using the tools and being kind of informed at that level I think that's important but before we do still on this topic of like VC sharks versus retail all right one second I don't want to let retail completely off the hook here okay and and and here's here's kind of why so the um the expected value the EV game that you're talking about where like founder and VC conspire in kind of a dark room and like they're going to release this token and they construct a narrative and they you know push it out on the world and they sell it to kind of hapless VC I I want to say yeah like that's the story here except except that that play has been played so many freaking times and it seems like retail never learns and so the reason they keep running the playback is because it works every damn time and I want it to stop working I want retail to like wake up and be like huh why am I buying the latest threadboy shill of this new token and guess what they're gonna do it again next cycle and like we know they're gonna do it again next cycle and that's why Venture capitalists and founders come up with these new tokens and these new pushes where they keep 50 because it works it's because they see a high expected value return if it stopped working then it would no longer be profitable do you like first of all let me just say I'm totally I I totally I know we're slamming VCS here and like as well we we should we're slamming the nerves what role does uh retail play in this and actually like being smart can we should we expect them to be smarter than this or is this just like what retail is you're right I mean you're 100 right and I think you know it what the great thing about a free market is that you know you can get hurt and then hopefully learn and I do think as time has gone on people are getting smarter um but obviously not as smart as quickly as we'd hope and I think you're absolutely right it's going to happen again and you know more new people will get hurt but I think that the overall trend is probably a good one uh in terms of learning and people getting smarter but I do think VCS you know the ones that are raising the money there is a responsibility as well and the answer oh you know these people retail needs to smarten up um it's it feels like a weak one to me um but that's my my Approach what do you think about this combat I mean like to be honest like retail all they can do is like dollar cost average into eth and then like the dirty secret of that is if you were to DCA into each like you would outperform the vast majority of VC funds wait really this is this is yeah this is like looking at uh like VC performance data oh and like the cool thing about institutional LPS is like they like survey like 150 so funds uh and then they create cohorts of like fun performance data so it's uh broken down by vintage so like if you were starting in 2017 18 19 so on so forth and then you see like the quartile so like what the return is for the top quartile uh the second quartile third fourth and also the top performing fund um and it's really fascinating like going through that data then benchmarking that to DCA into Bitcoin or ease um and like quite honestly like a lot a lot of retail like if you were just disciplined and patient and dca'd into would have done pretty well yeah that's a good point the other thing Ryan I I you you went hard on retail um there's also a lot of smart retail out there that you know the SEC deemed not smart enough uh to invest in a startup but they participated in the ethereum Ico right and outperformed the best brand name Venture funds right so um there's a lot of smart retail out there too um but I I do think um of course there's a lot of dumb retail that needs to learn also yeah I I totally agree and what better what better way to learn than crypto markets ideally you're learning on a smaller amount and you're learning uh young um I I mean I'm just trying trying to get um and I think we have many you know smarts getting smarter uh retail investors like listening to bankless podcasts right and uh so certainly we encourage responsible behavior dollar cost averaging into like you know assets that you have fundamental conviction on um I'm wondering if we could kind of summarize because you guys see behind the scenes at the let's call them the VC games right and the VC shenanigans that are going on I'm trying to um draw kind of a a list of things that um retail investors can really look out for or be cautious of so one is uh you've mentioned earlier the thread boys that kind of like the narrative VCS are always like you know pumping The Narrative and I think we've seen many many characters kind of like be written out of the show in the 2022 cycle and that's a red flag and so bankless listener I hope you heard that watch out for that watch out for that kind of token populism out there um I just want to add yeah I call it a counter signal okay it's like when I I think the people with the deepest conviction in crypto often aren't loud about their conviction I think being really loud about your conviction is actually should be recognization by the public as a counter signal where you don't actually have that conviction you're trying to convince others and especially when you see when you see projects in crypto that are you know consistently trying to get validation from institutions or celebrities it's like the thing that comes to mind for me is like the the uh the FTX Bahamas conference right where he had Bill Clinton and Tom Brady and um you know people like that it's like that's that's a counter signal um that that actually to me signals that a lack of conviction uh about what you're actually doing um so that that should be one of the big lessons and I hope it is of uh the you know the last bull market yeah marvelously will put countersignal that means run in the other direction don't just avoid just it means run in the other direction um yeah the the other the archetype of the driver who drives a big big Hummer they've got a small PP yeah yeah I mean crypto is a mark a microcosm for life right I think there's so many lessons within crypto that uh apply to you know everything in life yeah well you know that's the quality content thankless subscribers subscribe to me thanks for that analogy psychological projection man it's called compensation the the other piece here is uh token distribution right so you said that that can be a red flag and so one thing I don't think enough um crypto investors look at is like um uh you know kind of total uh market cap right so like they look at liquid market cap it you know instead of like total fully diluted yes thank you for the words Richard fully diluted market cap which is what they should be looking at in this market and you know maybe you could say a few more words about distribution like what is a good distribution like look like is there a threshold where it's a certain number and that's like that should be a red flag for uh anyone in retail or like what what are your your further takes on distribution here oh yeah I mean maybe we could talk about the market structure bill that just uh passed through the the Committees in the the house um where they kind of out like specifically outline like what's the threshold uh for a token to be a commodity not a security and there's things like no uh individual or entity can own more than 20 percent of the fully diluted Supply and no one could have more than 20 voting power um there's things about like uh developers uh like having con how much control do developers have over the project um so like the good thing about the bill is like for the first time there's like very tangible like metrics for when is a project considered sufficiently decentralized that it's a commodity um versus like still seeing more as like a like Insider VC founder type token wow so I actually I you know I knew that bill was in in progress but it sounds like you're familiar with kind of the details of it so could we take a quick side quest here so like what what is that bill that you're talking about and you're saying there's some concrete definition of the difference between a commodity and a security and it goes to actually Define you know um your token Supply in the hands of a small group versus you know distributed give us some more context here yeah it's called the fit act um it's basically the market structure bill that conclu concretely like settles the turf more between the SEC and the cftc and just defines what's the security what's a commodity uh when can a security become a commodity when the network is decentralized um so it it it kind of outlines all this like regulatory Clarity that you know we as the industry has been asking for over the last few years and by the way under that under that bill as written Richard I don't know if you've looked at like um besides Bitcoin and ether and you know like you know stable coins that kind of thing what other token assets actually fall under the definition of kind of a commodity per that bill uh I mean well I have to look at like different tokens and like see what their current distribution is but like you know quite a lot of tokens um uh I think it's still unclear like whether or not existing tokens will get grandfathered in um I mean the build is still like very much like a work in progress and like the final draft is made like that goes through the house might be very different than like what the text is uh right now I think just to really nail this point home what we're really talking about are like a legitimacy threshold for centralized ownership of a token creation event and so this well I think Richard why you brought this up is that this bill is actually putting in a number a ratio of distributed to privately owned like publicly held versus privately held that is actually going to give like a legal thumbs up as in like if you give away at least this much of your network you have you are legitimate from the eyes of this bill from this nation state that perhaps Congress approves I don't know if you know what those numbers are Richard but um you know Ryan asks you the question like what what are the red flags and then you you bring up this this bill who's literally trying to draw a line in the sand like what's a red flag versus what's not a red flag do you know the numbers off the top of your head I think it's like 20 uh 20 I mean like does that feel right to you um yeah recently so um I mean like it's still like very much like a draft of work in progress so like all these exact terminologies are still being negotiated what else I would say yeah it's hard to Define exactly what the number should be but to me like anything on over 30 should be a major red flag to retail investors and part of being an investor is you know you have rules but you can break them and so even that I would say you know you you can break that rule if there's a really strong reason to but generally I think that's a good rule to have arbitrum is

victims of that of that exit liquidity but let me just ask you this um just kind of your your personal thoughts should we kill the idea of VCS all together or should we kind of restructure it like what even is a VC I feel like part of this gets into accredited investor laws and then other you know parts of this just get into like pools of capital that are like um very informed about kind of founder risk in particular markets and making bets that way I remember there was a narrative Once Upon a Time this is hearkening back to like the 2016-2017 ethereum Ico days that there's no more need for VCS everybody can be a VC well it hasn't quite played out like that a lot of people called uh called BS on that uh from the very Beginnings but what's your take on this you know eliminating the idea of VCS do we not need it in a fully democratized Finance type of world no I I we obviously don't think that because we are them I mean when we launched one confirmation in 2017 as one of the first crypto Venture funds that was kind of we were able to raise money because we were saying there's this huge Ico boom happening um we think it's mostly we're not really participating but there are really good Founders that are thinking long term about building useful products and so I I think you know a good VC in crypto is making non-obvious bets in early stage products um that may not exist otherwise like that's um what Venture Capital if you look at the you know the history of venture capital you know the early VCS were kind of the Renegades that were crazy and investing in wild ideas that wouldn't have gotten funded otherwise and also being a good partner too the founders uh you know after your your backing so you know working closely and helping them with whatever they need um and to me that's what a good VC is and I think there still is a need for that um like you you could raise an Ico and get um you know a thousand people that have a small skin in the game um but then none of them are really helping you um and none of the none of them are really and really you know if you this is a totally different direction but if you look at Dows um you know a big problem with Dows is you have you know these Dows that have a lot of participants but no one that's really focused on driving the thing and so I think a good VC is someone that has a large ownership and actually skin in the game and cares about helping um so and I I do think they're you know founder there's a need for that still um I think there's way too much capital and a lot of VCS that don't do that but um but I think there are you know a number of them that all that do that and and that's that's helpful for crypto if you can you know if a VC can fund a product that goes and brings in maybe doesn't have a token so isn't getting the Love on uh on crypto Twitter or whatever but it's actually bringing millions of new people to crypto I think that's um a net positive for both crypto uh and the world that's what we try to do yeah I think that's a pretty clear articulation as to why even in the absence of investor accreditation laws you will still have Venture capitalists because some Venture capitalists will a like you said have enough skin in the game and also the skills and means to actually meaningfully move the needle for a startup move for actually truly help a founder and if you just have if you've just bought a token on uniswap and it's you know half a percent to five percent of your total portfolio maybe you just don't feel that same sort of like skin in the game if you're a real retail investor with like one to ten thousand dollars invested but but then Nick that kind of brings me to um what I want to unpack with with one confirmation so we've talked about the archetype for like a toxic negative crypto VC but I want to talk and we've talked about like the game that they play to make their returns which were perhaps the illegitimate um like I said toxic games but what games does one confirmation play how does one conf actually win the deal for VCS for a startup where inside of the start of landscape you have uh Litany of other VCS in this space who they could take the take the checks from why what was your pitch for why they would take one confirmations check and like what do what does one confirmation what game do you guys play in contrast all the toxic feces out there yeah um I say one thing that differentiates us from other VCS the most is we make very few concentrated Investments and as a result of having a small portfolio we're able to spend a lot of time with Founders post investment and like say a Founder um wants to chat about something like I can hop on a call in five minutes and like have a conversation with them just kind of walking through like ideas with them uh and like one thing that we do really well is uh for like new Founders that want to work with us we ask them to like reference check our existing Founders and ask them like rank all the investors on your cap table like where would you rank one confirmation and like not only that for existing portfolio but also uh this is funny it's actually um one founder did this to us recently um whereas he wanted to chat with uh projects that like didn't work out that failed uh because oftentimes when the project is not going well then the the VC founder relationship it like truly gets tested and like even in the cases where the project ended up not working out like we still had a very good relationship with the founder um and like those are also good reference checks to have like not not just the curated uh references that like you know every VC will provide but also kind of the spicier ones where the project didn't succeed but you want to see if the VC behaved badly um and did stuff so what does it take for you to be on the good side of uh one of your guys's uh startups like what what are the things that you think you can really help them with uh I guess for me personally like building Dune dashboards uh that's like that's a really obvious one and like Founders always like appreciate it when like the product goes live or they employ their contract on mainnet and then like a day later like a dune dashboard exists uh and it's like tracking all their top kpis um obviously like you know making intros um to like potential customers um we're like both Nick and I were big like users of like all these crypto products so just like something as simple as using the product and like offering feedback is like you'd be surprised by the number of VCS who don't do that like like one example that they're busy running threads yeah exactly um yeah like one example that comes to mind is like when we invest in super air like we just like interviewed uh the top Super artists and collectors like ask them like what are your feedback on the product what are things that could be better and then like compiles like a Google Docs sheet and then send it to the Super rep Founders and like something as simple as that was like super valuable to the founders when maybe they couldn't as candidly ask like their users um like their honest opinion of the product that actually sounds like you're doing labor which is interesting because VC is of course on the labor at a capital Spectrum it's Capital but it sounds like what you're doing is just like well we'll actually like do some actual lift work some labor for our portfolio uh portfolio companies yeah which I think is like back to my original points like it's only possible when you have a small concentrated portfolio and like you're making you know at most a dozen Investments a year dozen new Investments a year um and like you see VCS there are a lot of VCS that like spray and pray and we'll just like write uh over a hundred checks like 0.5 percent of the fun each like into each company uh and like obviously when you have like that big of a portfolio like you know I I have trouble like managing like I don't know 30 different names and like imagine having to manage like 100 200 different like companies and what's going on so uh those are kind of the telltale signs that Founders could use um if a VC's just like LARPing about being a value-add or do they actually have the resources for it one thing I'm continually Blown Away by is the um the amount of VCS who aren't actually crypto users like D5 users right and this was even worse previously but it's still kind of bad now it's just like um they don't they've never actually run an ethereum like node or they they don't have custody of some of their own personal assets on an actual bankless wallet they barely know how to use metamask they don't do much with like uniswap or any of the kind of the D5 protocols out there and yet these are the VCS that are uh you know deploying cash and like investing these products that never cease to me to amaze me and I actually think there's a lesson for our listeners here and for and for retailers here spend less time reading threads and absorbing narratives and spend more time using products that will already put you ahead of a lot of the VCS deploying capital in the game and that will help teach you what's real and what's not what's a narrative what's a story and what's an actual product that has some functional utility uh some airdrops too yeah yeah well and that's a big that that's really the core thesis of what we do right we only make as Richard said a concentrate number four to six Investments a year call it and we're only investing in products that we understand deeply from a user perspective and that's that's my crypto journey I mean how I got involved in coinbase so I was one of the first 100 users of coinbase I was trying to back in 2012 I was um trying to buy Bitcoin uh I was living in Portland Maine and back then to do that you had to go to a cache uh go to an ATM take out cash uh MoneyGram it over to um like Mount gox and uh it was a just a bad ux and coinbase I saw Brian launch coinbase on Hacker News and it just solved a very simple problem for me like buy Bitcoin with a bank account online um so that's kind of you know that's how we invested in openc we're buying crypto kitties um on the crypto kitties website and they were charging five percent and what's the true value of an nft right it's true ownership and you could you know you should be able to trade it on many different you know venues for cheaper and then we used openc early and then we invested so we're very much uh product first and really only investing in products that we understand deeply from a user perspective and that actually allows us to do what I personally feel is like the most important role of a VC um VCS talk about you know all the different value add um you know whether it's hiring or um you know whatever it is and some of them oversell it some of them really deliver on that I mean Richard like has has built many different products for actual portfolio Founders so I think we've done a good job there but at the end of the day I think the truth is and I know this from my own personal experience the the most important thing an investor in in a Founder can do is instill belief in that founder um and that's what I feel like we're now in a in a positive position to do because we've had success in the past we've seen a lot we know what works it doesn't and just being there you know as a positive light to a founder and help them and still belief um can do wonders to uh you know a Founder's success so that's really what we try to do as well and it's kind of this maybe soft not super tangible thing but I do really think it's the truth and again that I know that from my own personal experience when I got investors in my fund that um I really respected and that really helped Propel me my belief in what I was doing and I think that is a really kind of important thing that any investor can do and I think it's hard to do that if you don't really understand the product and have conviction on like the product in the market so okay that's kind of that's what really we really focus on and I've personally focused on more recently as well it's something you don't really realize early on uh at least I did in in starting one confirmation but um you can and I've I've been guilty of this too you know project your own insecurities on a founder and bring like negativity to them which doesn't help at all right that's that's a net negative and so really doing anything you can to not do that and be kind of a positive light and and project a belief um is I think really a really important role of an investor yeah it's uh you know if you get the work of uh being a Founder is very very very very freaking difficult uh for sure and shout out to all the builders and Founders out there who are making making crypto what it is and what it should be and you mentioned Nick this idea of kind of product first and I want to broaden this out so we talked about um you know like uh what we did wrong in in 2022 and some of the Lessons Learned we talked about why VCS suck and how to do it well I feel like uh we need to now think about preparing for the next cycle or the next wave of adoption or the next like way of building whatever you want to call it and the truth is crypto still hasn't gotten to a billion people yet a billion users and isn't that why we're here isn't that isn't that the promise of crypto and so I want to ask you guys what themes that you're looking at like going into 2023 to onboard the next um cohort of crypto users like where are you looking for the alpha where are the 1 billion users going to actually come from Nick I saw a tweet from you um that said this crypto native products that will reach 1 billion users in the next 10 years and you said prediction markets Dow tools on-chain Messengers decentralized social media decentralized identity I feel like we haven't really seen much uptick in any of those things yet and I'm wondering if if is that your answer for like where the next billion comes from it's it's one of those categories or you think it's something else uh why don't we start with you Nick I think the the that's where I have the highest conviction right the the beautiful thing about crypto is there's uh you know a million different projects being worked on and we don't really know it's really hard to predict what is going to really hit right um I mean we we nailed nfts um I don't think many did right and for a long time most in crypto uh I think we're too big brained for nfts right and they were focused on you know the Deep Tech or the defy or something and really dismissed nfts even though there was there was a small community that was that was using it uh you know the products they were you know dismissed as either D gen or stupid or something I just thought they were like jpegs right click save jpegs at first honestly yeah so that was obviously a surprising one and nfts um arguably have gone more mainstream than anything um so far um so we very much look for products that are serving a small niche of really passionate users that have you know mainstream potential that that's what we do as kind of early stage VCS and yeah I mean the if I had to pick one right now I I would say prediction markets um I think prediction markets they capture the essence of crypto um right which crypto is all about speculation and memes um if you had to right now Define and I think it's going to be much more than that but still in 2023 if you had to define the the essence of crypto I think it's it's speculation in memes and I think prediction markets bring speculation in memes to more people it's not just about coin speculation it's about speculation on um whether the room temperature superconductor paper is real or whether uh Trump is going to be the Republican nominee or um whatever the submarine the recent story of the submarine that brought in like a million dollars of volume inside of like two or three days to Polly Market yep yep so I really like prediction markets as a use case um I think it has a lot of the features um that really um requires a mainstream use case I mean one of the things that I think is unappreciated about prediction markets is it could also be a new business model for creators so I think one of the big reasons nfts broke out right is they made it easy for any Creator to make money and I think soon we're going to see create your own Market type products that allow like any influencer to basically create their own market and then make fees off that um so I think prediction markets if if I were to pick one right now would be the category that I picked on that really quick Nick because the prediction so so much about kind of investing is timing right and so it's like um you know eventually um the idea of a food delivery service uh worked uh internet food delivery service but it but it wasn't web van back in like you know 1999 or 2000 or whatever that was right it was it was something later it was like an Uber manifestation of this um prediction markets have been a crypto use case for like ever one of the first uh ethereum icos was auger I'm sure you guys remember that right which was what was it you know decentralized prediction Market why now like so why have the um the previous attempts at prediction markets in crypto failed and like why is the timing right now in your mind yeah and and again I'm not sure it is but um you know we we've been watching this space closely from the beginning I mean we invested in auger we participated in early auger markets um we were um investors in Vail which was a more centralized version of a prediction Market um that didn't end up working and I mean prediction markets are tough because there's a regulatory component um that makes it hard particularly in the U.S for centralized companies to uh to operate and offer the service to to U.S consumers um and auger tried it in a decentralized way but as you guys know there's often a trade-off between a decentralization in ux so auger went decentralized wasn't able to get a great ux Veil um you know went more centralized couldn't figure out how to operate um you know a a centralized business within the regulatory framework and look I think you need to tip your hat your your cap to Shane and poly Market because they've kind of grinded through dealt with um some challenges in terms of regulatory but have figured out a way to offer a product outside the U.S um and really you know gain gain traction so you know the the honest answer is I don't know for sure that the time is right but it feel it just feels like the way things are going with everyone is becoming an investor the the trend the way that that regulation is going um the more people uh coming online globally memes going more viral there's just a lot of indications that um it could be a good time to to build a prediction Market business one of the uh takes that I've been giving out recently is that a lot of the underlying infrastructure of crypto is ready it is effectively done there's still plenty of domains part of this deep text act that crypto web 3 is built on that definitely we can improve but I don't think that there are any applications that are not accessible to the crypto Tech stack because of how I feel like finished some of our Protocols are maybe we're like one to two years out for this really being true and I'm wondering if that take resonates with you as in our protocols data availability layer two speed and latency and ux all of these things like cross chain composability could definitely get improved but it's on the horizon and I'm just wondering about your take about this take Nick and Richard like I think that uh the full spectrum of user applications is going to be available to crypto to web3 like basically now ish one to two years like where our Protocols are ready to support whatever app that we can develop and I'm wondering if that resonates with you Richard how do you feel about that yeah I mean I I agree with that I actually have a pretty similar hot take uh we're actually uh we're recording this uh August 2023 so like right now at least in the VC world like there's just so much money that's being poured into new infra projects and I think the reason is because um there aren't really net new users in crypto and like people just want to bury their head in the sand and like punt the question of like how are we going to get used in adoption down the road so meanwhile no one wants to do the hug yeah no one wants to do the hard thing about getting used to Meanwhile just build infra and then kind of punt that question later but the problem is then you become one of 50 different infra providers that an application can build on so like we as a fund we generally skew more like consumer application heavy because like I think in the next Bull Run or two like that's where the next million billion users are going to come from some killer app um Nick talks about prediction markets um one thing I've been thinking a lot about is uh web 3 messaging so um you know historically like wallets have been the gatekeeper the front end to crypto is like whenever you want to do some crypto interaction you have to go through a wallet first but like if you think about it like if you look at like your transaction history on ether scan like almost all of those were probably triggered because a friend told you to go Memphis nft or like go do this action so like what if you have messaging like the social layer as the product and the wallet becomes the feature not the product um I think that is like one potential area where the next a wave of crypto users that onboard uh won't have the bias of like existing like wallet products but on board through a messaging app that just has like the wallet built in as a feature not the product do you think part of the reason for for that prediction is that like um we're making progress on account abstraction and like um you know later twos with you know gasless or very low fee block space that kind of thing is is that why or like why now yeah I think I think AAA is like a big unlocker um you know like account obstruction is ideal we've been really bullish on for a long time we actually invested in one of the first AAA wallets called ethereum back in 2019 uh which they ended up pivoting to hot protocol uh but I think with uh with like four through seven going live the entry point contract going live on mainnet uh March of this year I think that's four three three seven the spec is specifically what makes the timing now different and better for account obstruction um and we've actually made a bet um we invested in a Founder his name is Christoph he's one of the actually one of the co-authors of 4337 which is really cool uh and he went from co-authoring the spec to now building Pimlico which is the company that's uh building out the bundlers and pay masters for account extraction mm-hmm so since you guys are our users first what do you guys do when you guys are gonna go do and make a transaction on ethereum or a layer two what kind of activities do you guys like to do what's your not maybe not the Degen activity but if you guys are users how often do you see yourself or what activities you guys see yourself doing the most inside of crypto I guess for me it's like minting nfts like for example with the the base L2 launch uh yesterday like uh I minted like DK emotions nft uh finals cool uh I mean I'm a big fan of DK motions art so it's cool that it was one of the first nfgs on base what about you um lately I'm more I'm increasingly excited by non-financial activity so um forecaster is one um I use forecaster quite a bit I um I really like the community they have um and they recently added a ens which I thought was cool so I you know added my ens name and um you know made some posts on farcaster um messaging is another one I mean I'm increasingly using uh crypto like on-chain Messengers so uh Converse is one that um that I use pretty regularly um have you guys used any on chain products no yeah xmtp is a uh is a protocol that is pretty cool and by the way we're actually not investors in in that one so we're not just showing our our bags but um they built kind of an on-chain uh messaging protocol that um a bunch of products have uh used and so one of the cool things about like Converse and and coinbase wallet has it as well is you can write a message um you can connect your wallet write a message to someone um say you there you know someone owns an ens name that you want you could message them um and the message persists across you know the different messaging applications which is kind of like a crypto native behavior that I think is pretty cool we all know you know juggling Telegram and um and Discord and email WhatsApp and everything else so um and so that's you know an example another one is uh we recently invested in uh a messenger called friends which is taking a a different approach um but that that's an area that I'm increasingly excited about like I I do think it's likely that a speculation related application is going to be the next breakout something like prediction markets but we're also closer than ever to kind of these non-speculation related uh use cases Nick the non-speculation stuff is that web three is that what we're talking about I haven't heard you guys say the term web3 this entire episode web3 is like a made-up Silicon Valley Silicon Valley VCS love using the term like web3 and then like crypto natives just use crypto yeah but but I mean we're effectively talking about some of that right um decentralized yeah social network yeah but I mean crypto connection yeah truthfully it's like web3 was a made-up term to appeal to people in Silicon Valley that looked at crypto and said oh that's scammy that's d-gen or something so it's basically I don't know I don't I don't love it digital assets versus cryptocurrencies yeah yeah no I died I will say there was a conversation I I had with my father sometime in like 2019 where he was like crypto y'all really need a Rebrand because crypto is such a he's a as a boomer of course like crypto such such a negative connotation word and then as soon as web3 came around I was like oh okay great we did it yeah and then we kind of ruined it yeah well guys this has been uh a lot of fun so thank you for uh you know guiding us the world I I think um bankless listeners should come away with this with a with a lot of lessons I get I guess one last question I have to ask you so um l2s let's talk about this l2s versus alternative layer ones what's you guys have any hot takes I know that's not the app layer this is infrastructure but um you know what are you betting on machine we products gotten l2s have been really hot from a narrative perspective and I've tried a bunch of them I you know to try them and stuff like that but most of my the vast majority of my activity is still on ethereum um layer one exactly and um so we haven't done a ton in the L2 space I mean there are a lot of them were again these kind of big VC rounds that we generally don't participate in it's a super hot narrative that um I generally like it right because it I it's it's good for ethereum overall we're uh you know our largest position as a fund is still eth um but in terms of just activity like I'm still mostly on mainnet and um we haven't done a ton we've done some right like hop I think is a great product that Bridges uh assets from mainnet to l2s um but just from and I've used hop quite a bit again just to experiment but there's no product yet on an L2 that I'm using consistently how about you I'm curious yeah what about you guys well on Layer Two nft minting is the main activity yeah really cheap nft minting yeah yeah and then there are some Layer Two native defy apps which I've touched maybe a few times yeah I think both Dave and I probably pretty bullish on layer twos overall how about you Richard that is one hot take I have for l2s I think a lot of projects will launch their own roll up on the op stack because there's a better argument for having a token rather than kind of this pseudo Equity governance fee token is like you're building your own chain and um you have a token that secures the sequencer and um kind of manages the L2 uh so I think we'll probably see a lot of um app specific Roll-Ups in the next year or two that is a thesis that you and I share Richard and if I said anything more bullish about the op sack would be like the fifth time this one well guys thank you so much for joining us on Bank list has been a lot of fun yeah great to see you guys thankless Nation hope you enjoyed that episode one action item for you today uh Richard actually wrote a fantastic post on the current VC landscape we'll include that in the show notes we're not done slamming VCS of course go uh go read up on that some more risks and disclaimers gotta end with this as always crypto is risky you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
