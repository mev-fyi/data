foreign [Music] ition how you doing on the Pod today with Philip sheldrick who is a writer a thinker and educator uh and a moral philosopher who is on this episode we're going to be talking about identity so if you've been following the Pod for a while you know that we've been treating decentralized identity as the key the gate that if we go through it we can unlock lots of positive some games and uh that's what unlocks the regen web3 community and uh Philip was an interesting guest to have on the Pod because we're kind of critiquing web 3 approaches to Identity and how they don't fully represent the identity that we as humans have in our social relationships and how we model ourselves and how we act in the world and so on this podcast we talk a little bit about the differences between social science and computer science studying what works and creating what works in the world we talk about what could go wrong with decentralized identity Chinese social credit scoring stuff uh some of the atrocities that have in World War II due to the fact that the identity Registries happened in the wrong hands and um basically we talk about whether or not markets or Community or other mechanisms other other organizing vehicles are a good way of building Collective identity systems so uh Philip like me is a Doomer optimist so basically someone who is thinking that oh man the trajectory that we're on this acceleration is trajectory with capitalism running up against planetary boundaries means that we're sort of doomed in some ways but we're also optimistic because we have the tools to turn the corner and build a more regenerative crypto economic internet so Philip is one of my favorite guests because I think he really challenges my thinking and and uh causes us to complexify the design space and make sure that we're not missing anything so I think it was a good green pill episode if you're into digital identity so without further Ado I'll give you Philip sheldrick and we're talking about digital identity on this episode enjoy the world has woken up to refi and celo is here for it celo is the layer one for the regenerative Finance movement it's fast

Phillip how's it going very good thanks for inviting me here yeah I have really enjoyed our discussions thus far about digital identity but really a lot of things that are green pill related you wrote this really amazing essay digital identity is not human identity and that matters um and I'm wondering if we could pull the threads of of some things on that piece but uh before we do I just found out that you've been listening to some green pill episodes and uh and you think that this this this piece uh responds to not just the digital identity part but like the whole Doomer optimism solar Punk movement uh I think we'll be in scope for our conversation so where should we start well hey I'm a Dober Optimist that's that's there's there's no doubt about that we find ourselves in a precarious position uh needing to cooperate to coordinate at scale in ways that our species has never had to before and uh Hey wonderful we've got there's a set of digital Technologies just at the point where we might need something unprecedented to see if we can resolve that and so I'm optimistic in that sort of Doom optimism way at the same point thinking there's a clash of paradigms we don't yet have the com the necessary transdisciplinarity to try and resolve this with what cyberneticists refer to as the the requisite variety uh so um yeah um it's it's a hell of a series you're running um and I love the the name green pill and I love the team of optimism I love the solar Punk and this is exactly the conversation we need to be having about web 3's application yeah well maybe I'd love to pull the thread on this meme of dumer optimism so to me that means that uh like we're heading on this trajectory we're resumed we're consuming exponential amounts of resources on a linear materials economy uh we're struggling to transition from the Industrial Age to the information age and all of the problems that come along with that um around trusting people across physical distance um around increasing numbers and become a truly uh global scale civilization so like we're doomed in some ways um and and the optimism comes from the fact that we can actually uh we can actually change it we can actually move towards something that is oh yeah able to meet the need its moment build mechanisms that can meet their moment and build civilizational scale collective intelligence that can govern democratically but also uh responsibly the resources on this planet so that's what dumer optimism means to me I'm curious what it means to you exactly and if anyone's watching this and hasn't seen the two episodes you recorded with Daniel schwartzenberger um hey press pause on this one now and go right because uh he took he sets up the meta crisis as uh two stronger characters there's the many ways in which we could have catastrophe in the world from uh nuclear war to desktop crispr to General artificial intelligence the list is quite long uh and then we have the opportunity within another attractive Basin of the dystopia which is the nation states they're trying to rise up to get control over what could be a catastrophe but then you end up with uh just authoritarian States and that's dystopian so uh the metacris is sort of uh hypothesis is that we need to develop a third attractor together where we can exert the necessary control to avoid the kadash fees but without the concentration of power that leads to those orwellian future Scapes that's great well um so I think that covers the Doomer optimism Point why we're optimistic but why we're Doomer optimists so I mean I I've I've kind of long felt that digital identity is one of the keys to solving this puzzle because you can build more positive some games when you have repeating relationships and you have people that are that are sort of building um their own identities like State on an individual actor level and I think that a lot of your essay is around the uh the pitfalls of that and so I'd really love to get into that part of the discussion now because I think that that's one of the the really important points uh when we're designing mechanisms that are going to get us out of this duper optimism optimism place so uh where should we start with respect to your essay which by the way will be linked in the in the show notes awesome so let's link where we got to a meta crisis and this this third attractor to the question of digital identity because so far uh digital identity and that web one Web Two sort of way was very much um similar to the way in which uh technical information technology is computer scientists have addressed the machines they've addressed machines rather well at global scale and many of them would you couldn't accuse them if you're being a little bit cynical of assuming that they can just now do the same for the eight billion of us human beings but it's not just a technological proclivity that um sort of embeds that as a mindset it's also the history the culture of computer science if you go back to the the uh introduction of computing the very first customers were nation states and large corporations who wanted to make you me your your viewers and Alice as as we often uh refer to the user if we want to try and humanize them and it's fun Charlie yeah we want to make them legible to the system so if you look at Scott's work and sing like a state the state wants to make you legible to the state you are in fact a number when it comes to the state bureaucracy and so uh Computing has developed an approach which is very similar in terms of allowing the system to make the user legible to it so it's all about system legibility it's not about what it means to be human um it's not about living processes it's incredibly reductionist very straightforward what is this user how do we refer to this user again and again and again how do we know it's the same user and uh what rights can we pin on it her him so this is has served us kind of well up until now I would say about 15 years ago which is around about the time in my mind I think we moved from that that state where we were referring to going online right is the point where did the digital became a little bit more pervasive you were never quite disconnected from it obviously interacting with screens is one thing but even just moving around your home moving around your town your city you're interacting with things that are digitalized even if they don't have a screen and so now this this um the living process of being a human being particularly in the development world is very much now digitalized uh people like Floridian Oxford and um uh Brighton who wrote the stack though and has been referred to on the green pill before um just now recognize that we are kind of cyborg not in that sort of Hollywood Way of having a robotic arm or an x-ray eye but more that some of the feedback loops the cybernetic feedback loops that feature in our sense making in our living are digitalized the way we sense the world the way we think about the world and then the way that we act in the world meanwhile yeah we have digital identity and that's very different so I've tried to run into an essay over the summer which is called human identity the number one challenging computer science and it says it's the number one challenging computer science because computer scientists have jaw have joined a very very small group of bureaucrats they are now possibly just alongside lawyers in terms of trying to work out how to code for society how to make Alice legible to the system so they treat identity very much as noun like you and I are things that you can point at refer to consistently throughout our lifetime not just the birth certificate collecting taxes Sunny up for the Armed Forces if needed and then your death um but in every other aspect of bureaucratic life meanwhile if it's not law if it's not computer science all of the other disciplines uh that might be said to have some interest in human flourishing treat identity as a verb like as a process as a capacity for sense making so we have this Clash of paradigms and at the moment um I tried to find a language that uh techies will will resonate with and one of the things Kevin came up with was this idea of backward compatibility making the digital system comply with the Legacy system what's interesting in the uh the field of digital identity is that the Legacy system human identity is so incredibly more highly powered more highly capable than the digital constructs the digital architectures the digital code and protocols that we have today so the key I think in terms of allowing uh the progression of Designing for identity as a sense making capacity uh it that is the that is the key to uh melding this the cyborgian individually in the 21st century into a a member of society a decentralized society that can respond in in in ways that keep those catastrophes at arm's length but don't don't lead us to those authoritarian State outcomes right so I mean I I think that like if I was to sort of say back to you what you just said uh I think the one the that stands out to me is that uh you know we talked about seeing like a state this book in which we talk about how the government wants to make the humans legible to the state so that it can manipulate them or track them or whatever and with digital identity it almost feels like we're building digital systems that aren't really State anchored so let's say like seeing like the internet uh so basically being able to see the actors like the internet and there's this thrash in there between computer science and social science with respect to um you know are we building what's best for the data structures or are we actually building something for for the humans in in this uh in this system and then of course there's there's all the ways that that could go wrong um you know Chinese social credit scoring uh you know authoritarian regimes rounding up people as we saw in World War II and all the things that they could go off the rails there I don't know if that's a fair summary but I'm just trying to say it in another language it's fantastic in fact to use some of the language that I've heard you use on previous episodes of green pill I guess my work is trying to speedrun digital identity I'm trying to identify the flaws now while it why it's relatively cheap to to develop as opposed to when it's out in the world so I've been kind of when teaming it if you like and often that can come down to mindset so let me give you an example um you will see uh around lots of web free slide Stacks web3 websites this idea of sovereignty um and owning your personal data so let's just now before I go into sovereignty and owning your personal data let me just take one step back to talk about this verb like identity because in that instance identity is imminent as in arises out of social relationships and social relationships are imminent they rise out of the exchange of information so you and I have chatted on a couple of instances now and we're both trying to make sense of each other we're trying to figure out how can I help each other how can we coordinate how can we collaborate um where might this gonna be useful who should I introducing to what connections can I make this is all about sense making one's role in this in a social sense and so when I talk about sovereignty I'm again with schwartzenberger who in this consistence project would frame that in terms of a capability of ascensions sensing the world uh capability for cognitive processes thinking that through finding meaning in what you've sensed and then actuation how to behave in the world to contribute uh to your community contrast that with sovereignty as it's often used in in web 3 Communications collateral which can be taken as a synonym for for control for um being supreme ruler of one's life it's as if uh the people who write that kind of read some and Rand novels and kind of stopped there because it's an incredibly reductionist way of looking at mm-hmm how the human species works and so once you once you have um a a complex lens you stop trying to be so reductionist about it you don't you don't come up with an idea such as kyc Dow for example kyc Dow it's classic computer science thinking how can we make eight billion people legible with one universal identity in the world effectively as if it's the human body that counts rather than our intellectual our cognitive abilities so when I say noun like even though the noun like has been adopted by information technologists so you'd think they'd be jaunted some informational qualities you find again and again and again that in the literature of digital identity they're obsessed with the physical the corporeal the animal and the idea of this being one body must therefore mean I am you need one identifier in the digital system um and yet the thing that sets our species apart is uh ability for cognition we have enormous brains compared to other species and the the brain is a biological unit but the mind is informational and it's not contained in here so for example um we are using words and the only reason we can we can have this conversation and people can tune in to watch it and make sense of it is that we're all using a common vocabulary a common semantic we have that ability in common but it doesn't sit in any one brain it's the thing that sets us apart and yet it's nothing to do with the corporeal um so uh for me a a generative identity an approach to the digitalization digitalization of identity that tries to play to the psychology the sociology and the ecology the self the culture and the nature is more likely to play to the sovereignty of the individual defined in terms of their sanctions intelligence and agency than anything that looks like a database identifiers well let me let me pray with that a little bit and by the way like I I guess is it a fair summary to say of everything that you just said that like really the computer science should be trailing the social science not the social science being moving towards the computer science is is that is that true reductionist do you know what that's you say this is why you're in the seat you're a good communicator right you've boiled it down at the end at the end of the day so the social science says because of course there are many have studied for centuries how people work how what the good life is how um to live sustainably um uh generatively and yet that's not the expertise of computer scientists and yet if computer science is going to contribute to that then yes they need to work into the social sciences in a way that I haven't seen yet if you look at any book or paper um on the question of digital identity just go and find the disciplinary basis of the authors and often you will find there might be an economist which I guess is a social science or be it one that tends to keep itself somewhat isolated from the others or or attacking you won't find for some Bonkers reason uh on any digital identity team a psychologist a sociologist an anthropologist an ecologist someone studied in cultural studies or gender studies none these people hardly exist if you see a web 3 job advert you can bet your life it's through Dev and and not for someone who understands the human condition and has made it their lifelong study you know I mean I I almost feel like this is almost like a critique of capitalism in a way because the technology that's going to be built is going to be a function of what's funded and if you look at what's funded it's going to be things that are going to create the most Venture skill return and that's a reason why more Humanity spends its time on Tick Tock uh consuming viral content uh than it does studying the stoic philosophy of what's going to make for a good life and I think that there's sort of a race to the bottom of the brain stem that that results out of that attention economy where the things that grab your attention most uh instead of the things that grab your values or sorry that are reflect your deeper values Upon A you know quiet meditative and inspection is is what the system is going to produce so I know I would back out of that a criticism of our funding infrastructure as much as uh our technology and and you know I guess the question that's on the tip of my tongue is you know how what how might we engineer a uh digital identity system and a regenerative crypto economic internet that that that that pulls people towards their best selves and and towards what they actually value is the question on the tip of my tongue when I when I frame it like that so um you know do you do you agree with that Framing and if so are there any projects that are doing it right that you've seen um you know I'd be curious for your take on that I do I do agree with that that framing um again uh you can see I studied uh your your uh interviewing with with Daniel schmartenberg he just said that we do find problems too narrowly and so that the solution end quote creates other problems and this is well understood in anyone whose domain is a complex domain do you mind if I just hesitate to to pause on this question of complexity I know that uh you know Z did a good job of of defining it but for those who haven't seen that episode yeah you're talking about Michael's argon the episode that we did with Michael's yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely um the weather trying to describe me quite simply is that if you take account a car is complicated because it's made up of lots of separate bits but it's not complex because the definition of complexity is it can demonstrate emergent behaviors that perhaps were not foreseen perhaps they're unintended and by definition you do not want a car to behave in ways that weren't designed right at the same time traffic isn't complicated because it just consists of because but it sure is complex because we've all been stuck in a traffic jam and we're convinced there must be an accident up ahead but sure enough the traffic eventually clears and there's no sign whatsoever of an accident we are that we've evolved to want to see a cause and effect accident therefore Jam complexity doesn't work so um in such a in such a way it's it's and yet at the same time it's the thing we must build so there is um a lot of understanding about complex systems that emerged in one of the traits in the Macy conferences in the 50s and 60s that became called cybernetics and cybernetics if you like is the the science of organizing the science of setting a goal typically you know a a large system and working out how to get yourself there which is exactly what we're talking about in terms of this this third attract two in the meta crisis and I'm gonna put this out of that work the idea of what governing uh was formalized so we've had Governors for for thousands of years um you can't run a steam engine without something to let off the steam right that's called a governor the governor helps the system maintain a stasis for doing productive work but the cybernetic cyberneticians were the first to formalize governments and try and make it a science and this is this is zombies thing right this is this is where it was coming from love the man so the law of requisite variety came out of this work um which I actually prefer when it's slightly reflained reframed as the law of brexit complexity so let me just following that framing because this is perhaps there it is the internal complexity of a system must match the external complexity it confronts in other words the the the the system you build to govern decentralized Society or allow for that governance to emerge must be richer in variety richer in permutations richer impossibilities than the thing that you're confronted with which is why uh we when we uh thinking about design we're thinking about decentralizing because we don't see large scale centralization in nature it's not biomimetic and so when you look at the decentralized society paper um the turn I know you've discussed it again um right uh on on the green pill episode the ambition is absolutely right we cannot get to the third attractor by definition through centralization and yet of course decentralization is Nathan Scheider argues it's just a means it's not an end itself it's not the thing we should be you know it's not the altar we should be worshiping at it's a means to an end and you can have uh um utopian decentralized society and you can have terrifying decentralized Society only if we design in the requisite variety the requisite complexity can we get the outcomes that we were all can we work towards continuously work towards the outcomes that signify a good life a sustainable life living in harmony with the other species we share this planet with such that future Generations can also benefit in exactly the same way now if you look at digital identity projects the world over none that are coming close at the moment to demonstrating the requisite variety the requisite complexity like us not they continue to be xenomorphic um noun like undynamic ways for us to uniquely identify the corporeal as opposed to the the cognitive power that we we need to release to develop nucleotic intelligence and the collective wisdom for for our species going forward damn I've been speaking for a while now I should I should pause and let you uh uh get some direction in there yo you know it'd be fine uh if if we can kind of ping pong back and forth on some of these things so one one of the things that I would like to interject and I actually think it's one of the tensions between my Styles and your your communication style Philip which is um you know maybe a little bit better well no no no the uh there is no absolute better there's only better for better things and and you know one of the things I I spend a lot of time thinking about is you know I have this like complexity part of my brain which loves these complex systems and trying to figure them out because they're so consequential for the world but I also have the momentous part of my brain which is like how can I take this like all of these ideas and boil them down into four words or less or into some visual that will help people understand um the concept and and it comes down to this quote that I heard on Sam Harris's podcast which was Nuance is the enemy of common understanding so Nuance which is the ability to understand complexity is the enemy of common understanding um and that's because we all have short attention spans and we're glued to Twitter and we're glued to um our information Rich abundant environment so our attention has to be very tight about what we put in there and so it feels like there's this tension where we have these we have no capacity for nuance and because of that when things have externalities in them or they're too complex to fit into 280 characters the populace doesn't understand them and it makes it really hard to build a democratic system find that third attractor from there so so I'd love to hear your reaction to not not that critique but uh or I guess that like can yeah that constraints I could see because it's absolutely spoken uh I have developed an expertise to go across the disciplines in order that I can find the bits in between because the disciplines are just an emerging accident right there's no reason why we should have psychology and sociology and computer science and information Sciences they're just emerge right so I I try and find the gaps in between um it's not just multi-disciplinary in terms of getting everybody in a room it's not just interdisciplinary where they're trying to learn each other's phrasing languages it's transdisciplinary way you attend to those gaps and you build new wisdom together in combination with all the stakeholders part and parcel of getting all those stakeholders in the room is participation of awesome communicators such as yourself who have that you know that memetic talent to to to to to help people understand why it's important so yeah you're you exhibit that skill better than I do we all exhibit incredible skills that are needed in the mix none of us um again as a kind of a buyer by the way of a critique of this um worshiping with the self-made man the atomization of the individual that is not how we got here we are social animals we are um more powerful than social groups than we are as individuals and that's exactly the approach we now need to take in terms of pursuing generative identity that's identity pursued for psychological sociological and ecological Health we need to get all those people in the room including people who can convene that room and who are great at translating some of the jargon some of the verified lexicon into something that everybody understands I mean I've tried that in my own little way with rather than trying to convey what the variety of um conceptualizations of identity outside of law outside of computer science rather than try and do that and get everybody in computer science to follow that I've I've found that this categorization of the conceptualizations help if you're developing now like and you're not attending to the verb like then that could be a problem it could be a problem in as much as the more we codify the noun like the more it can be a pollutant it can be valuable in tight application but left to spread and be pervasive in the way that digital technology is enable it will suffocate the verb like and given that I'm saying that the verb like conceptualizations are what it means to be human that's not good news so I'm trying to find the the right language to attract people's attention yeah totally well you know I think what you said about getting people with complementary intelligences in the room uh is is so important and you know maybe I think that one of one of the things that I that I think well I think that we need to create like shelling points where people can have these conversations and Define these things and and and collaborate and maybe trying to do it on Twitter and on Tick Tock and on Facebook is too wide of an audience and we just focus on the change makers for now thinking that those uh that those will Ripple out but I really do Wonder uh when we're building Democratic systems you know some of these trade-offs with verb like identity versus noun like uh identity you know are those things that the common populace has to understand or are they kind of like Downstream from that if we're going to build a democracy then you think you need the consent of the governed for these decisions and that's that's that's the constraint where I I kind of I just worry a lot about it but but you are trying to enable that conversation for those who have the the privilege and the time to attend to that conversation you are trying to bring people into the into the conversation um well I'm always struck actually by the difference between the two disciplines that code for society lawyers and computer guys and gals mostly guys unfortunately it used to be uh 50 50 in the 50s but it's increasingly like 95.5 and that's that in a self is mind-blowingly wrong to write legal code is an incredibly diligent process um that you can participate in if you have many years of training anybody can write lines of code now in a way that's why we all love uh the digital right it's incredibly um it's rich with potential and we're very excited about applying it and we need to apply it in the right way so this is fantastic it is it is all inclusive and I'm not demoting that at all at the same time the people who are writing the digital code that they hope will set us free can only do that at the moment largely from their mono-disciplinary monocultural often mono gendered perspectives they cannot because they do not have the requisite variety get it right so we have to expand this design conversation it is there is no other way in which we can we can go about generative identity yeah very generous let me let me give you an example um so you have Danny on from from from three books of surrounding uh protocol Fame and I have a lot of time for Danny he is what we say in London a diamond Giza right but it is it's worth tuning in to see how three books and many others are approaching this idea of reputation so when he was on on green pill he quoted uh Jonathan Hate's Righteous Mind and hate actually quotes Plato's brother whose name was glaucom I think maybe I'll pronouncing it correctly but where glaucom came to the conclusion that said that um if you [Music] an important principle in designing an ethical Society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time and this has been um uh demonstrated mathematically now if you read the book super Cooperators for example it is in integral it's innate to the human species so this is the case but notice its reputation is always on the line not reputation is always online and some people have confused this and for example with the salt-based tokens idea and uh when you have reputation that can be taken in a non-contextual way universally um mindlessly programmatically then that's very different to the way reputation is operated in community for tens of thousands of years not only is it very different from the biomimetic uh way in which we can understand reputation we might end up building the Chinese social credit system emergingly rather than deliberately and then you have to say well at least the Chinese were honest about what they were building and knew what they were building which is really by accident that's mad so we can't allow seriously lawmakers need to step up and I I understand this design space is going to predict various code bases coming together uh so not just technical software code but also legal code and also social norms uh which are quite stubborn but once they come in in um that stuff and becomes a feature rather than the bug that stuff in this um we're going to we're going to have to resist naive approaches to put um verifiable credentials reputation scores at any kind of non-contextual universal mindless quantification of who I am who you are who Alice is as a person and it's it's it's in the way I described it a reputation panel at uh this year's Taoist meeting in Amsterdam is that if you've got a panel of nuclear physicists together talking about their fissile materials there's not one of them on the stage who would not fully comprehend the dangers of the material they work with I can't say that about um too

right there uh I mean given how important digital identity is um you know it hit in in terms of making people legible to the internet into the state and the upsides and downsides of that um I found that really profound so yeah to finish on that one cabin if I can um but it's just what we're on the topic you had a sunny from lens protocol and lens protocol is going through its thing at the moment everyone's very excited about it and actually you made a point on that episode that you said um The lenses of reaction to web 2 uh the idea of the large-scale uh social graph that Facebook both popularize and uh effectively owned um I would argue that it's numb a reaction to web 2. because all lens does and and similar projects is take the concept of the social graph that Facebook popularized and just put it into a new tech stack we shouldn't if the concept remains unchanged we shouldn't expect it to deliver different consequences and the interesting thing about the the social graph is it was originally known as the sociogram uh and it was a product in the 1930s of a guy called Mourinho if you go back into the history of social graphing and look at the sociogram you find that Mourinho didn't develop a sociogram to just understand the social group but to control it yeah right to influence it is probably a a more appropriate uh phrase and so if we just have this idea of a monolithic singular social graph doesn't matter if it's centralized or decentralized we'll find very much that the consequences will be very similar particularly if and uh I'm not going to talk about all of the the business models associated with putting the social growth on the blockchain but if there is any investor looking for an Roi there's going to be some kind of way in which they will secure their Roi so there's a commercially motivated social graph and that's just the same as web 2. yeah so well I mean so again we just have to we have to just question the fundamental working concepts are these going to serve as well or are we just recoding them yeah I mean I have two reactions to that one is that if it's open source and forkable then like someone like me can go in and change the like mechanism to be a quadratic funding social network and I think that that is powerful like the fact that Builders can build their own values on top of that social graph but I accept your critique that a global social graph is maybe a flawed infrastructure and you know just to just to like paint a picture of Philip you know I think uh for for for an entrepreneur and a software engineer how thin the line that you have to walk when you're building these systems is um and that's not to say that we should take it not take it seriously but you have to compete with the web 2 Giants on your left and then you're you know you're trying to create something that's based on a better moral philosophy um and so that adds more constraints and so like I gave this talk at Devcon about git coin uh passport which is something that I'm sort of I was sort of involved in but basically we designed design for uh Network effects so that people would actually use it and then in order to make it uh ethical we had we had to build in privacy and sovereignty and systemic defensibility and avoiding plutocracy and decentralization and modularity and forkability from the start so you're like you're kind of like fighting the web 2 Giants with one hand behind your back and I guess I'm wondering you know if I'm a builder out there and I have one thing to take away from this conversation or maybe three things to take away from this conversation how do we walk those lines as as Builders do we work it sounds like engaging with the social scientists is is like one thing that you're advocating but like are there any other well a do you accept you know sort of my framing on this and and B you know what kind of practical advice do you have for people damn that's that's uh that's incisive line of questioning all right well we have 15 minutes so I I uh I don't need to unfairly set you up but you know I I do think that I really want build like the audience here is Builders right so I want to come back to like helping them create a more regenerative crypto economic world but also be successful and that's where that's even though it was an incisive line of questioning that's where I'm coming from thank you there are actually relate this to your uh Sterling work on public goods there are aspects of billing in web3 which uh you know the free market if that's a motivation for you if if um if if I'm not against the for-profit approach to organizing absolutely go for your life because wonderful innovation has come out of the for-profit motivation there's no doubt about it however just in the same way that we have public goods versus private Goods uh and obviously common goods in between so to speak um there are some protocols in the mix in terms of digitalizing human society which should not be subject in my opinion to the the motivations of the market um I guess in my work in trying to understand how to affect decentralized social in trying to understand for example how we might apply digital Technologies to the pursuit of the sustainable development comes no matter what problem space particularly the more wicked the problem became the more and more I kept coming across the question of human identity is a sense making capacity as a process so for me the question of a generative identity which is my the phrase I use to indicate that we're going to try and design for identity in this digitalized world to prioritize psychological sociological and ecological concerns um rather than proving that you're old enough to buy beer at the bum is definitely a public good now once we've got once we have a a a suitably inter slash transdisciplinary group working on that problem space trying to engineer the requisite Variety in then that's fantastic Ellie biddler looking at for the profit motive can riff off that in a plurality of ways go for your life but if they're trying to get that um perceived Market advantage of being the ones that Define their protocol in the first place because they think they can somehow if they're fine if if they can move faster break things if they can get to if they can get the first move very Advantage then that's not the way in which I think we're gonna find generative identity I think that's the way to degenerative identity so um at the moment I would say that self-stubbing identity is definitely um reaching its um I would say Peak hype or not I'm sure don't mean that disrespectively I'm just in terms of the you know the adoption curve uh quite clearly it's difficult to build anything in web3 without giving Alice some kind of or allowing Alice to take for herself some consistent constant identifier because no one has yet worked on coding for verbalife identity yeah so whether that continues to be an ethereum address uh an ens or some kind of wallet construct then I would say develop on top of that in a way that doesn't build in the path dependency that would preclude you from swapping that out in the future when the rest of us get our together on the fundamental open public good protocol that is a set of approaches to human identity that can then be fought in a plurality of ways by different societies different cultures around the world to suit their their needs and you know that process is going on at the moment so for example in New Zealand if you look at the the um uh the relationship between the modern New Zealand state and the indigenous people the Maori the more we have an arrangement with their government which says that you know what if there's anything you're trying to do in the digital realm well that's the context of my understanding anyway that goes against the way that our society our culture works then we should have the bandwidth to adapt that to our needs to to put something between us and the system that you're trying to make us legible to and so they have a very fascinating um uh digital identity project that's trying to actually live in many ways of one take on verb-like identity that's corresponds to their particular culture and there are other small projects around the world as you can imagine because there's no money in it in that for-profit way they tend to be slightly less well resourced than those that get the VC money um but it's out there Kevin and we can convene that Insight that indigenous knowledge we can convene uh the knowledge of the sociologists and the psychologists so we can explore what it means to be um to maintain narrative souls in the digital age and we can riff off a wonderful Corpus of work so for example if you take Sherry turkle she's just one of the foremost people who've studied this space by the end of the 90s she was saying the internet's amazing it's an identity Workshop you can be who you want to be here in the 2020s it's like people are struggling to think how can we get civil resistance it's a really hard problem I don't see it like that at all there is no doubt in my mind that by default civil resistance will be air quotes solved by the end of these the twenties by the accretion of many people trying to to work on the project But continuing to do just what they do in the computer science mindset in the reductionist mindset in fact the challenge by the end of this decade will be oh my God how on Earth do we get rid of this civil resistance this is this is this is strangling us this is constraining us this is not what it means to be be human I am this is not my body that I'm bringing to this party it's my mind so just to be careful the answer to your question is keep riffing just don't quite I would say if you get if you have a full potential for profit motivation don't try and do identity and reputation which is um almost um you can't separate the two don't don't don't go in that space let's let's look at that one really digital diligently because that's the only way we're going to get to the third attractor that's the only way we're going to get to decentralize society yeah I mean it feels like you know one thing I might boil down and you know apologies for always trying to take this in a reductivist uh Direction but like don't mention bloody Lego right because if there's one I know you love Lego right seriously there's nothing complex about Lego yeah well no I was gonna say like the knowledge Lego I was going to propose is like first Do no harm when you're developing digital identity the nuclear like we're like music nuclear physicists all LARPing online about how we're going to create the the future of of digital identity and we just have to realize that it could go very poorly if we build it wrong and I think that's one big takeaway for me from your episode and your critique of of some of the other stuff that uh the green pill audience and the green pill guests have been doing yeah I I I'm optimistic I just to bring this right back to where we started I'm a Doomer Optimist and the more in fact actually we are doing what I think is going to be the way in which we continue to do great things together uh let me explain that you and I are having a conversation there is no way uh that our minds can interact over Wi-Fi near field communication Bluetooth cables I know some people are working on it we have to rely on conversation in order to find meaning together and resolve to to to understand the values that we want to live going forward the very definition of autonomy it comes down to conversation there's a not to get too academic but there's a fantastic paper by double e and pangaro from 2015 and we'll stick it in the show notes if if that's okay um and it basically says that if you are a designer and they don't mean that in the sense of Designing a glass but designing something of import like complex adaptive systems then you are into cybernetics the science of organizing the science of setting and then pursuing goals in complex situations if you're into cybernetics then you into second order cybernetics which is kind of reflexive it's applying cybernetics to yourself embedding The Observers out of that plan B way which says let's rise above it and look down as if it's a board game um and if you're into second order cyber genetics then you must necessarily be into conversation not General Chit Chat as we engage in over the garden fence but well designed conversation the benefits uh the pursuit of mutual understanding not necessarily agreement was to disagree but at least we'll understand why each other thinks slightly differently and if again to Jordan Hall and Dan schmittenberg was um conversations with yourself if we can then free up people's attention [Music] away from jobs and doom scrolling to meaningful conversations in their in their social groups in their cultures and their societies such that we can build Mutual understanding we can get away from that webto polarization of community and bring people sort of back roughly to the center again ish still be a distribution but it won't be polarized it will be one of those um what a wonderful thing so to me with with identity defined reciprocally and and um inseparably with relationships and information exchange conversation then designing for conversations about parcel designing for identity um and and we have I believe all the knowledge the know-how we have the know why we just need to guide it and it's the mother of all public goods in our context here yeah um I think those are really profound and beautiful world words to end on but um given that we only have two more minutes before before we have to wrap uh is there anything else that you want to leave the audience with I think for me I I would love to direct the audience to your uh beautiful essay on on web3 identity so we'll put that in the show notes but uh any final words or things that I didn't ask you that you want to say I'm gonna actually uh I would like to give one of your previous guests the last words on this episode and that's clear while I I love what he's trying to to do with decentralized Society uh I look at the cell phone tokens paper not as a manual um actually God forbid that anybody interprets it as a manual but as a a provocation um it seems contradictory in places in as much as in one hand it says we can get civil resistance by correlating souls and then later it says well we shouldn't correlate salt so you know it's it's a bundle of thinking it's like a oh let's get this out there that is thinking out loud and I love that and to be celebrated and he has a um he blobbed I don't know two or three years ago now about something an acronym he called alone and I think it speaks to the the Crux of the matter you and I have discussed today about the reductionist linear stag-based approach of computer science versus the Ecology of social sciences he defines a loan as a o a l o n e uh atomistic liberalism an objectivist naive epistemology I'm already thinking hang a minute you said to me earlier Kevin we shouldn't get uh on the jargon but then he defines it it works that are not jargon at all if you're in the alone mindset then you approach the design challenge as a binary between individuals atomized on one side and then some kind of you know that there's by that atomization it means that they're pre-social you don't even think of them as social animals they're just individual people and and then so the alone mindset is a binary of the individual and then something really big like Society the nation state um uh the modeler God right and he's basically saying in this post that we if you're if you're thinking in that binary as I would say the self-sovereign identity Community does then you're automating away everything in between that beautiful natural awe-inspiring complexity and so if you're in the alone model of the world then in his words you are being wildly naive and inaccurate in your approach here's the complexity my man I love it I think that this uh this is a really important episode in that it generates some pushback and some complexification of the thinking that we've done on the green pill pod so far but unfortunately we're out of time so um we're gonna cut it here Phillip thank you so much for joining and sharing your uh thoughts with us into the audience please check out Philips essay it'll be in the show notes Kevin thank you for doing everything that you do uh you are convening a very important conversation with the green pill thank you yeah all right cheers [Music]
