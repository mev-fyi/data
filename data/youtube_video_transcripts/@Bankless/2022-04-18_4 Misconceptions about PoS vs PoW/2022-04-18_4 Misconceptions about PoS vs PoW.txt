i think it's important when you're looking at this to like separate the the fact versus the opinion and uh you know some of these misconceptions can be refuted just with like hey have you actually thought deeply about this and here here are the facts as we lay them out you wrote a post on bankless this week that dives into four misconceptions about proof of stake versus proof of work and i think this is information that's worth getting out there uh why don't we hit all four of these points david what's the first one yeah the first one is uh the rich do not get richer in proof of stake this is a common critique of proof of stake is that it's a rich get richer system and actually it's completely the opposite the fact that yield is baked into the asset allows everyone in the world to democratize access to the upside so there is no difference in rate of return for somebody that invests 1 billion dollars into ether versus one million dollars into ether versus a thousand dollars everyone gets the same rate of return and actually in proof of work it's actually the that is the actual rich get richer system because of how much complexity and middlemen there are between one dollar of capital and proof of work getting translated into one dollar worth of hash power you gotta invest in the asics you gotta invest in the mining facilities you gotta get the the asics through the supply chains you gotta have relationships with manufacturers you gotta power your facility you have to cool your facility and all of these things have respond to economies of scale and that is ex means that there's significant competition around bitcoin miners which bitcoin is really like but it is actually indoctrinating who can invest more capital into proof of work most so that's a misconception number one the next one is that proof of stake uh is is like equity money and proof of work is commodity money these are mental models but like in terms of actual definitions it's not empirical there are no empirical definitions so i go through this and i actually make the claim that ether has both commodity-like and equity-like characteristics and bitcoin has mostly neither uh and i explained in the article about that so that's number two proof-of-stake does not give governance powers to stakeholders there is a difference between on-chain governance and token vote governance and proof-of-stake these are different things there are systems that are have on-chain governance like tezos and d-cred and tesla's proof of stake decred is a hybrid proof of work proof of stake but the consensus mechanism and on-chain governance are completely different things and ethereum does not have on-chain governance and lastly dealing with 51 attacks how does a proof-of-work system deal with a 51 attack if the time comes basically the answer is if somebody can generate enough hash power to ha 51 attack a proof-of-work network they have enough hash power to do it infinite in forever so if honest miners can't source enough honest hash power to overcome that 51 attack that proof of work chain is dead because the attacker has enough uh hash power to attack it into into infinity this exact opposite thing is true with proof of stake where if somebody is attacking the proof-of-stake network because ether is registered to ethereum unlike asics ether is actually at a specific ethereum address the network can identify who is the attacking address where is the attacking east coming from and we can coordinate around a fork to do something about that whether it's forcibly exiting them from the validator queue or slashing their ether it's just so much easier to discover and route around an attacker in proof of safe than it is proof of work so those are the four big misconceptions i addressed in this article i did my best to make this extremely digestible so i highly encourage everyone to go read it if you are trying to get your learn on about why the hell we're doing this whole proof of sake thing in the first place i think there is a difference between sort of an opinion on proof of stake versus proof of work and which produces a better money i think there can be some variation in opinion there but there's also some fact that i think uh you lay out in these misconceptions right it's like it's a fact that proof of stake is not more rich get richer than proof of work right and it's like empirically a fact that proof of work can lead to economies of scale that help the rich to get richer so i think it's important when you're looking at this to like separate the the fact versus the opinion and uh you know some of these misconceptions can be refuted just with like hey have you actually thought deeply about this and here here are the facts as we lay them out now there are some disadvantages with proof of um proof of stake versus proof of work like weak subjectivity there's like some more uh deeper deeper answers to some of these things but i don't think these misconceptions actually hold up under any scrutiny hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how to free
