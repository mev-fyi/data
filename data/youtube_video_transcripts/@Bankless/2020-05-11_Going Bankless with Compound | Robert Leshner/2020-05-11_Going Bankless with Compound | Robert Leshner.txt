[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we have an absolutely fantastic episode with robert leschner from compound today this is this is going to be an episode on how to go bankless with compound what did you learn from this episode man there were so many topics that got dropped in this episode that i haven't heard anywhere else and so it was really a treat to get robert luscher on and to talk all about compound i really enjoyed learning about the kind of the design ethos and parameters of the compound protocol how it came to be and why some of the decisions were made in the way that they were and so you know robert he's the founder of compound and so he he goes all the way back and kind of explains some of the choices in the compound protocol the the ethos of the system at large and and how and where compound is going to go into the future uh and so robert so a really smart guy sharp as attack really saw the vision for defy i think earlier than most people and he has led compound with that vision and i think he hit that vision that that nail on the head really really well so you know tip of the hat to robert for building something really powerful in this space we touch on topics such as the protocol sync thesis which me and ryan are harping on more and more and more and robert really really resonated with that and so we're gonna we talk about that and we also talk about what it means for a system like compound to be fully autonomous but also governed by you know a set of community stakeholders you know these are topics that we all we always knew were coming in the horizon with compound and it's starting to to look like the the the arrival of these things like like compound governance is just right around the corner so i'm really glad to have recorded this episode with con with robert and and gotten it into uh your guys's ears i even felt like we got some insider information here that's that's actually dropping in this episode about how compound tokens could be distributed in the future so stay tuned for that guys you will not want to miss it but before we get into that david we should talk about our sponsors today so the first is a favorite rocket dollar this is for our us listeners so if you have an ira or a 401k chances are it's inside of a brokerage like a fidelity or a schwab account that means inside the brokerage you don't have good access to crypto if you want to buy crypto you have to pay 5x the price that is crazy you're getting ripped off by doing that what you need to do instead is break your retirement account out of jail we've got a post on how to do this on bankless it's one of our most popular posts i will include that in the show notes but you could go to rocket dollar they could help you get what's known as a self-directed retirement account either an ira or 401k they help you with the paperwork they help you with all of the pain they help you break your retirement account out of jail once it's out of jail you can buy crypto wherever you want on gemini on coinbase in a tax-free account super powerful you could go to rocketdollar.com to check that out use the code bankless to get 50 off that's bankless to get 50 off at rocketdollar.com dydx is one of my favorite d5 applications on ethereum and that's because of just the magnitude of things that you can do on dydx you can spot trade margin trade you can borrow and lend and coming soon are perpetual swaps dydx has originated over 1 billion dollars in loans over the last year and has half a billion dollars in trading volume i personally i i like to use dui dx to it to leverage long when i'm feeling particularly bullish but other people i know in the crypto ecosystem lend out their die inside of dydx to people like me who are borrowing it to go leverage long like many applications on ethereum there are two sides there are the speculators and then there are the people that are lending the funds to those speculators and so dydx can be what you need it to be based on of your own personal finance needs and so if you are bullish you can leverage and if you are looking just to save your diet you can lend and something that's coming new is bringing bitcoin to d5 through perpetual contract markets and so soon you'll be able to have price exposure to bitcoin inside of the dui dx exchange this is launching at the end of this month in may you can sign up for the alpha right now and a special offer for the bankless listeners you can get 10 off of trading fees on dydx if you sign up using the bank list referral link which is trade dot dydx dot exchange slash r slash bank lists it's a long one so it's also in the show notes you can get it there so sign up with that link so you can get 10 off trading fees david we're going to get started with the episode in just a few minutes but first i want to talk about something that that's really just pissed me off uh i found out today there's an article published by by a crypto publication called decrypt that tron is actually getting some taxpayer dollars u.s government taxpayer dollars from the ppp program you know that loan program that was supposed to go to small businesses well the tron a tron subsidiary company based in the us applied for it and they're getting 2.5 million dollars worth of loans from the us government these are forgivable loans like what's up with that what's going on man if this doesn't illustrate why money and value systems should be put onto public utility systems like bitcoin and ethereum then i don't know i don't know what's what the money printer just went fur there's a bunch of money being handed out for small businesses but because money and money value transfer systems are inherently political people like tron can you know pay their accountants over time with their trx that they also just printed out of nowhere to fill out the forms faster than all the small businesses who are struggling to pay their employees and have other things that they need to tackle so once those accountants filled out those forms super fast and get them submitted the tron foundation can get those money printer bucks so if this doesn't illustrate why we are trying to be a bankless system turning money and value transfer and value management systems into public utilities that are credibly neutral and inherently apolitical then i don't know what will so so for those of you who are not familiar with with tron it is a copy and paste of ethereum it's run by a self-obsessed marketing guru named justin's son i mean really we never talk about it on bank list because i'm there's no reason for you to really know much about it and we don't like tarnishing the bankless movement with projects like tron they're just not worth your time but this one uh infuriated me enough that i thought we had to talk about it because it's more of an example of you know being in the money spigot and getting access to government funds when there's a fiat system and it's set up to distribute funds it's not set up in a credibly neutral fair way and whoever is closest to the money spigot as you're saying david whoever has the banking relationships they're the ones that are going to get the funds the funds aren't even going to the small businesses necessarily public companies are getting them in some cases and uh you know tron companies like organizations like tron which are complete scam projects are getting them in other cases the the the super ironic thing about this is that tron could can print their own money too like they also have their own trx money printer so like they're going to the other money printer and just collecting those funds but they could have printed their own trx anyways and so like the and the other thing that i think we should all really just be aware of is like the federal government and the political organization behind the us dollar money printer couldn't identify that maybe perhaps tron wasn't a viable candidate to receive these funds like we're not vetting people enough to to identify that maybe tron doesn't tron the owner of their own money printer doesn't need funds uh from the federal government that could have been you know much more suited to other small businesses there are there are thousands hundreds of thousands of small businesses throughout the united states that actually are desperate for funds there's a a story i heard on planet money which is a fantastic legacy podcast about a local business that i'm very familiar with called molly moons it's a local ice cream shop here in seattle and they interviewed the founder who applied for a 300 000 uh business loan through this program and because they ran out of money they gave they gave her a loan for 15 000 and when she when she got that notice she said on the podcast that she just opened that up and laughed because fifteen thousand dollars would do her absolutely nothing she had she has multiple chain multiple employees and and it's just it's laughable and then meanwhile tron this this this chain run by this self-aggrandizing like like borderline scam artist is getting money from the federal government like maybe perhaps this whole federal government controlling the central the money of the united states isn't working the way that we hoped yeah i'm i'm kind of with ben hunt from the epsilon theory newsletter he says burn it the f down like that's how that's how i feel when i see stuff like this and i think the reason there aren't protests in the street is because most people don't know that this kind of thing is what's going on they don't know that their government fiat system is basically getting looted by organizations like this and by those that are printing money and it's not even that you know the fed or the bankers who who gave these funds are the ones necessarily at fault i mean they're all part of a system that incentivizes and leads to this outcome so guys i mean that's why we're on the the bankless mission is because there should be a separation between money and state because we think there is a need for credibly neutral protocols to play a role in our financial system we think that fair finance and fair money should be accessible to anyone with an internet connection just another reminder of that let's talk about something different david because i know you have some opinions on this so we talked about the maker protocol in episode nine a little bit how to go bankless with the maker protocol and that time we talked about some collateral that was used to back die a collateral the primary collateral is eth and you know was ethan still is eth and other tokens as well but a new token has just been added recently called wbtc so that is a wrapped um custodial version of bitcoin so it's not as trustless of course as something like ethereum not even close it's actually custodied by a crypto bank of sorts a bitco sort of a a custodian provider that is custodying the assets it's not very trustless what's your take on this david is this a good thing or a bad thing for maker and is it a good thing or a bad thing for d5 so i think we should all take a step back and look at the fact that there is now bitcoin inside of maker dow and when we view the crypto industry and especially the defy industry from bird's eye view like that's incredible that's a really incr incredible like innovation we finally got bitcoin inside of maker dow is this the final form of bitcoin in maker dow probably not definitely not i hope not and so is this a good thing absolutely it's a good thing for today's version of d5 uh if this is still the way that it is in two years five years ten years then definitely not um it's it the truth is that centralized centralization makes things go faster and so you know wbtc wrapped bitcoin by bitco inside of of d5 is not necessarily the trustless uh crypto economic protocol future that we're envisioning but how else are we going to get there if not you know dipping our toes in experimental ways by using centralized uh centralized mechanisms first uh and so you know and at the end of the day people people at the end of the day like we need to realize that this is a journey that we're going on and not the final destination doesn't happen tomorrow in fact the final destination never actually ever happens it's defy is always going to get better and improve and get stronger and this is just the first step of many to this maximally successful maker dial protocol okay david so so now like 80 of dye is is still backed by eth right but let's say you know two percent maybe five percent uh maybe even 10 at some point in time starts getting backed by these more trusted assets what does that do to the banklessness of die in your mind yeah this is this is a really good question um so you know dye that's backed by ether is like the the most pristine most trustless version of dye um but i wouldn't say that and now and then right now there's 99 million die that's backed by ether there is 12 million die that's backed by usdc half a million die from bat and a hundred thousand uh die backed from wbtc so it's it's r yeah like it's largely ether but you know this this trend is trending away from ether now i think people need to remember what the whole point of maker dow is uh the maker dow protocol is a risk filtration system as in you put assets in and then make or dow takes the risk from those assets and it puts it into mkr and then the remainder is what you get is die so with dye you get no upside you get complete stability and you get no risk you'll get minimal risk and then all that risk is put into mkr and that if the maker dow system is working well then die should be as risk free as possible risk is something that you can engineer out of a token and that's what happens with die and so when we talk about you know dyes issued by the centralized asset wbtc that can be burned as as seen fit by the bitco system or same thing with usdc then people are saying look well then this this these characteristics of the collateral are then exemplified in dye that's not true it's exemplified in mkr that's where those centralization risk is mkr holds all the risks from all the collateral inside of its system and the whole point of mkr of of maker dow is to appropriately manage risks with the skin in the game which is the mkr token and so when people say that you know mk dye is now centralized what they really should be saying is mkr is now centralized uh and it's it's taking all of the centralization risk and putting it into mkr and so if you don't want if you don't like that centralization risk the answer isn't to not buy die i think the answer is to not buy mkr because you are saying you're you're making an opinion that the the centralization risk is bad and so i you don't want that risk and so then don't buy mkr but die should still be okay diet should still have the qualities of a a risk-free stable asset i suppose with with dye if you know one of those assets got got c's for example um bitco decides to seize all of the bitcoin and the value of that decreases to zero then what's going to happen is maker holders pay the price right because maker gets inflated so as you're saying it does sort of shift that risk um you know back over to to maker and not necessarily in the the hands of a die holder that that said you know we talked about it so often here david that this is sort of a i mean this is going to be a darwinistic survival of the fittest emergent ecosystem of stable coins and assets uh i do think that it's going to open the possibility for a more a single collateral completely trustless maybe more muddy robot maybe less governance type of stable coin on ethereum at some point i'm not sure what way shape or form that takes i'm aware of a few projects that are kind of working on something but what will happen is another asset will emerge that that might be a bit more trustless than die and those assets will kind of battle it out and i think net net the bankless community wins from these experiments being pursued from multiple vantage points and in multiple ways so that's a good thing yeah i definitely agree like there seems to be this really strong demand for this maximally decentralized maximally trustless version of dye i would remind everyone that the black friday or the black thursday events that occurred happened very much because dye was only backed by ether i mean there were there was some die from be it from bat but a negligible negligible amount and so this trustless and decentralized total maximally decentralized version of dye comes with its drawbacks comes with its weaknesses you know a die that can be backed by real estate wbtc usdc basic attention token you know realty tokens hopefully in the future that version of dye is going to be far more liquid and far more stable which is the whole point of die in the first place you know die is first and foremost supposed to be stable money and stable money is liquid money you need to have liquidity in order to be good money and the die that has a large set of distributed collaterals uh will always have less risk and more stability than any other uh stablecoin and it's also it's also worth noting that like say die has like they say die has like 10 15 50 100 different centralized assets inside of the maker dial protocol that's backing it well if they're all centralized they're all going to be centralized in a different way and so the centralization risk from one doesn't bleed into the other and this kind of kind of goes with like the oracle system right like if coinbase the centralized company coinbase has an oracle and then the centralized company binance has an oracle and then the centralized company circle has an oracle the oracles are themselves decentralized even though they're propped up by a bunch of centralized actors the same phenomenon works in dye if dye is propped up by you know a thousand different centralized um uh collaterals well then die still decentralized because that that's it isn't just this one single homogeneous centralization risk right it's you don't get to add those things together those are separate centralization risks which makes them somewhat decentralized yeah absolutely and whatever happens i am looking forward to seeing the uh stablecoin asset wars in the coming years i think it'll be a net benefit for the community hey maybe even compound might through its governance process might through throw a hat in the ring there we'll have to see all right we're going to get into our episode with robert but first we got to talk about our sponsor monolith monolith gives you the ability to spend die wherever visa is accepted all over the world the defy card by monolith allows you to have die in a smart contract wallet but then be able to swipe your card at any store and then spend that die in the real world it allows you to have a little bit of the ethereum network in your pocket as you go about and do your daily your daily business you know crypto it's not really the the most intuitive platform it's not really that something that's very easy to use but things like the monolith defy card make ethereum very tangible and very integrated into the world at large this way you can live a bankless life without having to compromise with the tools that you use so you can download the app at monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today and start putting some of the economic activity of the world on ethereum with your monolithic visa card another bankless tool you absolutely have to check out is ave ave is a sponsor of the podcast and they are a lending and borrowing critical on ethereum similar to compound in some ways because you could lend to it you can put your dye into it it will take that dye it will transform that dye into an interest bearing asset that you can carry around with you you can do that with dye you can do that with ether other erc20 protocols as well you can also borrow from ave now when you borrow from ave you can select an option to convert your variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan so you know exactly what you're paying on a given time interval developers you've got to check out their flash loan protocol that's being incorporated in all sorts of developer tools uh right now and in all sorts of other interfaces go to ave.com and deposit your crypto to start earning and borrowing that's ave a a v e dot com and check it out all right guys let's go ahead and get right into the episode with robert lechner of compound welcome to episode 11. dave and i are really excited about this we've got robert lesner who is the founder of the compound protocol one of the big three king protocols d5 protocols as we've called them in the series robert welcome to bankless glad to be here you know robert i think it would be super useful if you just give our listeners an overview of how you got into the common uh the compound project like why'd you start it what was the the need that you saw and the interest that you had well it's funny that you asked the interest that i had um when i looked around at the space one of the things that i saw and this was in 2017 was that everybody was focused on the speculative and trading sides of crypto focused on the price of given assets and there was less of a focus on how those assets would be used exchanged and transferred over time and interest when you boil it down is the ability to use an asset in a capital efficient way to use it for a productive purpose and an interest rate is really the you know price between two different counterparties and how they each value its usage over time and we saw everyone focused on the spot or the current value of an asset and very little on the future value of the asset and using the asset and so we decided to build an interest rate protocol because we saw it as a very important missing building block in this space um and three years later we're finally at the point now where they're starting to become this concept of you know crypto assets having interest rates and being able to participate either as a supplier of the asset or a borrower of the asset very frictionlessly so robert you wanted to create essentially you saw i need to create sort of a we we might call it a money lego but a money lego uh for interest then and you know you didn't see that need being fulfilled maybe we could just level set for our listeners too on you know just some compound 101. so what can people actually do with compounds so if i'm somebody who's interested in going bankless i have a ethereum wallet what can i actually do with the compound protocol today so compound creates a short-term interest rate for different crypto assets so if you have ether or the stable coin die or a token like basic attention token or 0x you can supply it to the compound protocol to earn an interest rate now this is not a loan and there's no duration um of this interest rate you're earning a short term variable interest rate so as supply and demand in the market change if there's more people trying to earn interest or there's more people borrowing the interest rate available to you changes as well so what you are receiving as a user is a variable interest rate that you can participate in whenever you want and for as long as you want so this variable interest rate how is the interest rate for any two assets decided for a given asset the interest rate is set based on an interest rate model which is an algorithmic approach to coming up with the appropriate interest rate the alternative approach that some systems may use as an order book where people essentially negotiate through trading on what they find uh to be an efficient price compound doesn't work that way there's a model the first models for the different assets were originally designed for by our team and over time these models are going to be um increasingly generated by the community but there's basically a model that runs each interest rate for each asset the interest rate on ether is different than the interest rate on the stablecoin die which is different from the interest rate on a different asset and these models take into account really just two things supply and demand it's similar in some ways to how you know the federal reserve uh takes into account the supply and demand for money in an economy when they set the interest rate in this case though it's just a math formula and it uh runs completely autonomously and every 15 seconds which is an ethereum block in which the conditions in one of these compound markets changes the interest rate will change ever so slightly so robert you said autonomous and you said that users are actually interacting with a smart contract some code rather than with an order book almost interacting with a money robot robot and we we talked about this in episode 10 with uniswap but i'm noticing sort of a trend across our big three d5 protocols you know maker and uniswap and now compound that none of these are actually order book type protocols it's all sort of an interaction with some sort of a money robot interaction with some code is that really the killer app for d5 why is that why does that seem to always rise to the top and be so successful yeah so i think one of the reasons why we're seeing this succeed is that it works in what i would call single player mode you know if the system is built and the money robot is coded correctly it doesn't necessarily require the participation of many other users for you to be able to have the financial service that you would like it allows you to sort of play on your own to see the service being offered and to interact with it it doesn't you know necessitate other users with the exact opposite view at the exact opposite time coming in to match with you in any way so it's significantly more efficient um for you know the level of defy that we're at today the way i viewed this is uh a that defy has definitely settled on a a peer-to-contract model as opposed to a peer-to-peer model and back way back when all the way back in 2018 there was dharma which was going for a peer-to-peer model of lending where two parties would find each other with an exact agreement of the exact inverse agreement so you know one person was lending at three percent and other somebody else was borrowing at three percent and those people would get matched and we found that that dharma that was just not in a very efficient model and so it seems to be that the peer-to-contract model where there's one person as you as you i really like the single player illustration one single person interacts with a contract and that contract to me is operating as mr market right mr market comes every single day and knocks on your door and says this is the uh rate that i have for you today uh take it or leave it uh is it is that the way that you view it yeah that's exactly right i think you summarized it well the the contract you know aggregates a lot of market activity from many different users and standardizes it into a format by which a single user or participant can interact with it instantaneously right away where the second the ethereum transaction is mined the interaction with the system is effective you don't have to sit around waiting for anybody else so that's a really efficient model because not having to wait for a counterparty to take your trade just means that you can get your get your trades executed instantly but at ultimately at the end of the day a human does have to be in the process somewhere right and this is true for for maker dow and for uniswap as well so even though that the algorithm for determining the rates is autonomous and runs autonomously designing that algorithm is a human-based endeavor and so can you talk about some of the decision-making that goes into designing the algorithm to and and what would what what makes a good algorithm versus a bad one yeah that's a great question so you know the compound uh algorithm itself hasn't really changed too much over the last couple years at its heart it's relatively primitive where there's a very basic concept where when there's more demand to borrow an asset the interest rate goes up and when there's less demands to borrow an interest rate an asset the interest rate goes down um that's at its heart what it does the design of this you know to get to something so simple was actually quite a lot of work um you know earlier you know visions of how the compound would work we're actually significantly more complicated uh but what we found was that you know over time we're able to strip away everything except the most basic you know simple formula which is essentially a straight line um where interest rates increase as a function of demand so robert it was it's funny that david mentioned dharma because now dharma is actually building a smart contract wallet and they're they're leveraging compound in order to to do that they're almost a onboarding service to the compound protocol is that is that by design are you guys making compounds so that other protocols and other money legos can plug into it and like what are the most interesting i guess projects that you've seen being built on compound yeah that's a great question so when i think about who the user of compound is i actually don't you know visualize you know a person with an ethereum wallet you know sitting at home at their you know office computer you know interacting directly with the protocol we envisioned that the users of compound are actually other developers and people building applications themselves um one of the great things about smart contracts is the users can be people or other smart contracts or other applications or other financial products and you know compound when you boil it down it's just an interest rate and it's a series of interest rates and anyone can incorporate those we think that the best you know products are ones that developers can build on that simple concept take the compound interest rate and build it into a larger smoother better product for a consumer and we're starting to see that with applications like dharma we're starting to see that with people building compound into other tools and other services where it's just an interest rate we're seeing it wind up in automated market makers like curve we're seeing this interest rate evolve from being something that you as an individual access to directly to something that you access indirectly through other products and that's really exciting since day one that's always been our vision is that you know the primary users of compound would be developers would you say that that was the motivation behind the c tokens where you know in compound v1 if you wanted to get interest on your die you would submit it to compound but now with v2 and the introduction of c tokens which are compound tokens which are tokenized versions of what is in the compound contracts you can instead of depositing die and getting interest rates you can just buy c die and then that's basically using compound but as a token is that kind of the design motivation or is there something else with that as well that's exactly right so what's really funny is you know as a developer um you know compound version one which did not have c tokens and compound version two which does have c tokens are functionally very similar it's just that c tokens make the programmatic um ability to transfer and manipulate balances easier it makes it easier to understand and easier to visualize you could always you know build an application on top of compound that had complex routing of balances c tokens just make it easier in a lot of ways you know when you squint you say wow compound you know v2 is totally different because you've tokenized balances it's almost no different at all um you know you could always manipulate balances this just makes it simpler and easier to understand and it's exactly why we designed c tokens um we wanted it to be easier to transfer and program the balances inside compound so that you know it could be more easily adapted as a building block in other people's products so just so listeners are understanding this who might not be familiar as familiar with c tokens right so if you take a you could take a token like ether take a token like die you deposit it in compound and you get back the c token which is the exact same asset it's an ether a die only it's now interest bearing so it's got that interest money robot that you've been talking about robert it's got that feature attached to it so as long as you're holding the asset you're always occurring interest you know to to me this is kind of like a paradigm shift because in the traditional banking system outside of programmable money and outside of crypto money systems it doesn't work like that at all so if i have a uh savings account at wells fargo you know and maybe i'm receiving i don't know point point one interest uh a point one percent interest rate sadly because interest rates are so low but my savings account is tethered to wells fargo like that interest rate is very much tethered to my account my relationship with wells fargo it's not composable i can't take that interest rate and that asset out and you know move it somewhere else is that the killer feature of all of this programmable money stuff i think it's one of many killer features um you know if you know other developers and startups were able to you know program and manipulate your wells fargo balance you might see some radically interesting new financial products emerge but it's just too difficult um to do that you know you'd have to first withdraw it to another account you know potentially belonging to you know the software developers or you know their new product in order to manipulate the balance you know c tokens just it's a great analogy it's like as if your bank account balance was able to be used by other applications more easily so wells fargo is a place that receives deposits from users and then gives them an interest rate and then it also allows people to take credit and then it charges them an interest rate and in in some way some of the some of the credit or some of the interest being charged upon people taking out a loan is paying people that are depositing their money inside of wells fargo however with my credit card i'm paying you know 24 uh apr and then on my bank account i'm receiving 0.1 percent and like there are other loans that aren't so agreed just like a credit card like you know a small a small business loan that's four to eight percent but the point is like wells fargo has this insane discrepancy between the payments being laid uh being paid to the depositors versus the payments being paid or charged to the uh to the people that are borrowing uh and so compound i see as this uh this it's a money market right so it's connecting borrowers and lenders directly with a protocol uh and it's totally being it's uh intermediate um disintermediating this whole system cutting out the middleman and just connecting borrowers and and lenders directly in this bankless system is that right in a lot of ways uh there's a couple other differences that sort of explain you know why there's not like a 20 spread between you know what somebody's paying to borrow an asset and what someone is earning to supply to the market um the first one is that there's you know unlike a credit card loan there's lower or no expectation of defaults so with a credit card loan you know uh there's a lot of risk involved in the borrower um you know making sure that they you know continue to have a job and are able to meet all of their payments there's always an expectation of losses the borrowing that occurs in compound is actually in some ways some of the safest borrowing that we were able to design so there's the way it works is you can borrow any asset from the compound protocol as long as you supply and maintain more collateral than what you've borrowed and this allows people to interact with compounds very quickly very easily and in a very standardized format there's extremely low risk of default because the users are maintaining more value in the system than what they're taking out and so the interest rates don't have to be punitive because they don't have to accommodate you know the expectations of defaults and losses in the same way as lending to a consumer you know in the same way that the interest rates on mortgages which are secured by houses which are great collateral are significantly lower than unsecured loans so you know having great collateral that's extremely liquid and accessible is the first thing that brings down cost the second is really the automation a money robot as you guys say is replacing all of the operations real estate processes and costs of you know other approaches to borrowing assets um it's completely programmatic it's completely automated and it's completely standardized and it's instant so the cost is essentially zero to you know facilitate somebody borrowing from the protocol and those are the things that really you know start to disintermediate existing processes so robert you mentioned something in there i want to zone in on because i think we're going to spend some time later talking about the the comp token and governance and that sort of thing but you use the phrase uh good collateral right so what what makes good collateral for compound so good collateral is one where there's a transparent value everyone generally agrees on what it's worth two there's liquidity if the protocol has to you know incentivize people to seize the collateral then it's able to be sold it should be relatively liquid and lastly it should be relatively stable an asset that doesn't move in price that much is significantly better collateral than an asset whose price you know jumps around in extreme fashions so those are the three things that make good collateral um right now in terms of ethereum and what's occurring on chain and d5 you know ether is currently in a lot of ways the best collateral it's very liquid it's very easy to agree on what the price is and um it's a standard that everyone can sort of agree on um and so you know that's the best collateral we have today over time as more assets become tokenized on ethereum there's going to be other assets that might be just as good if not better collateral um we see stable coins rapidly emerging you know they also meet the criteria of you know being transparent being liquid and having a price that's actually quite stable we might see more traditional assets and securities over time emerge on chain we might see you know bonds and you know equities emerge on chain those things are also great collateral um i think we're going to be surprised by all the things that wind up being able to be accessed by a protocol like compound as collateral and so you know this is going to evolve over time i think the assets we have today will not be the assets we're using in 10 years and as long as something meets those criteria of being transparent liquid and stable it's great collateral very interesting i want to earmark that to come to come back to it when we talk about governance because i know governors of the compound the comp tokens specifically have a role in actually selecting what collateral goes into the system so let's bookmark that and come back to it later but we're kind of tying this off for folks that are just you know learning about compound there's maybe two other systems uh i i'd like for you to compare it to robert so we talked a little bit about traditional banks and wells fargo and how compound is different there i think listeners probably grasp that but we've also talked in uh a couple episodes episode nine about the the maker protocol and there is borrowing and lending of course with maker what are the differences between maker and and compound yeah it's a great question so the key difference comes down to actually the name of their protocol uh maker so they're actually making an asset that doesn't otherwise exist and they're making the stable coin die this is sort of created by the protocol out of thin air and this is the superpower of maker it doesn't have to already exist in order for their protocol to lend it out to a user so in maker a user provides collateral and then the maker protocol creates dye using the collateral as something to ensure that the dye is repaid over time in compounds we're not actually making an asset there's no new asset that doesn't exist because of compounds it simply facilitates liquidity for all of the assets that already exist in the world one of which is the stablecoin die in compound in order for an asset to be borrowed somebody else or many other people or thousands of them are supplying the assets of the protocol as liquidity and so that's the biggest difference is that you know makers creating an entirely new asset whereas compound facilitates an interest rate for assets that have already been created so if we were kind of stacking the the money legos you'd say maker is more it's really the the money lego of die of stability right and the way it gets there is through you know credit and and um borrowing and lending and those sort of functions and that's different than compound the heart of compound the money leg of compound is really interest right um and so that's that's how they're different there's there's no asset that's being produced in compound as you say but what about um folks might be familiar with we call them crypto banks on on bankless as part of the program but these are like centralized exchanges um and centralized third parties that take custody of your assets and also provide interest as a function um so like a block fi comes to mind or a celsius or even a crypto.com how is compound different from those crypto borrowing and lending services yeah that's another great question so compound is run entirely on a blockchain everything inside is automated through smart contracts and the entire system is transparent you can very easily go on compound's website you can very easily go on the ethereum blockchain and you can see every transaction that's ever occurred you can see the state of all of the markets you can see exactly how much the protocol is holding and how much has been borrowed by other users it's basically radically transparent um a crypto bank or centralized business facilitates a lot of the same activity the biggest difference is it's not run on a blockchain using a smart contract is run with the traditional business in some ways this is spreadsheets and custom software it's you know it's facilitating this off chain in a lot of ways and the economic functions are very similar you can go to one of them and earn an interest rate and you can also go to them and borrow an asset using crypto's collateral the biggest difference is automation and transparency yeah i really want to hammer this home for listeners because you know folks in the bankless community ask ask us all the time like what like what is the difference between a block fi or a celsius or a crypto.com and you don't have to tell them is like i don't really know you know of course they each have a reputation and i might trust one more than another with my assets but the reality is once i deposit my crypto in those crypto bank lending services it's a black box to me i really can't see the assets on chain that are that are backing um the loan that i've just provided that i've that i've lent out i have no transparency as to what their risk management functions are essentially i have to trust the chief investment officer and the compliance team not to screw things up whereas with compound i get to see everything on chain i see all of the assets that that that back each of the loans that i provide i see even the liquidation process which is a which is a function in compound it's all completely transparent it's like having the the view source capability of a of a banking system and that to me is is the magic and that to me is like the paradigm shift of this whole open finance system would you agree with that oh i agree completely i think you know one of the superpowers of any crypto asset whether that's you know bitcoin or ethereum or compound you know the advantage is transparency the advantage is inspectability auditability you know it provides a level of comfort if you know how it works that you'll never get from a traditional business that you'll never get from a bank or a crypto bank because that's just not the way they work and you know this leads to i think radically different uh outcomes i think it makes it significantly safer to build your own business on top of compound or your own application on top of compound then on top of a system that you don't know how it works or where the money is or whether or not you know it's solving um it should facilitate you know a significantly better experience to build on top of so let's talk a little bit more about how new collateral is included in compound because i think this gets to the heart of some really interesting features that the compound protocol is rolling out around governance so there is now a token a governance token a voting token if i'm understanding it correctly called comp that can be used by comp holders to actually vote on collateral that goes in the system or not there are other voting features as well there are proposals that can be voted on but can you sort of describe what comp is and some of the new governance features you guys are rolling out and how that intersects with you know new collateral that might be added to the system yeah absolutely so there's two long-term principles that we have in mind as we create a new governance framework for the protocol the first is that we want the protocol to be able to run forever what this means is that the likelihood that any one party can take down the system approaches zero you know in bitcoin circles they call that censorship resistance we want compound to be able to run forever and this is good for users and this is good for developers that are building on top of the protocol the easiest way to do that is to remove power from ourselves you know to reduce the likelihood that you know anything can go wrong if you know keys are mishandled et cetera so that's the first piece is reducing risk of someone screwing up the system the second is increasing the upgrade ability of the protocol and this is making it easier for new assets to be added to the protocol or new functionality to be added to the protocol a centralized team has limited resources limited bandwidth and limited focus if you can design a framework for the community to be able to upgrade the protocol instead of you know one team being able to upgrade compound you have a thousand teams being able to upgrade compound and this is also great for users that want to interact with the protocol and applications built on top it allows an application built on top of compound to improve the protocol that it's built on so we see this as an extremely important virtue as well and we've designed compound governance to achieve both of those things one is reducing the risk that a mistake is made intentionally or accidentally by a team if you have one private key that runs the entire protocol it's very easy for something to go wrong and the second is we want upgradeability to be in more hands so we've designed a governance system which is now running the protocol called compound governance the way it works is relatively simple we've created 10 million comp tokens and instead of a hundred percent of the comp tokens being held by one address which could lead to the first issue we're distributing those 10 million tokens over many many many addresses um first to a group of stakeholders that's about you know 60 stakeholders who originally built the protocol and later to all users of compounds there's going to be 20 30 000 users think of this as like the largest multi-signature wallet in the world and with comp in the hands of tens of thousands of stakeholders then these stakeholders can come together to both approve changes to the protocol and upgrade the protocol so the way it works is you can vote your own comp or you can delegate it to anybody else we see this is a very powerful feature because it you know enables you to have a more you know liquid democracy if you want to participate directly great i think very few people want to stay up all night learning about compound mechanics and you know spending time thinking about how they're going to vote on protocol changes there's a small group of people that are wildly fanatical and i think this is exciting for and there's a lot of people that don't and so by delegating your tokens you can pick somebody else to represent you to vote for you in protocol decisions and this can be an expert in the community you know you can delegate your tokens to ryan adams this could be an application built on top of the protocol that you trust to make good decisions for the protocol you could delegate your tokens to dharma or this could be your own address you know whether it's you know a hot wallet that you use for you know interacting with experimental new systems or it could be you know any other address that you choose and this is the basic interaction you can vote or let someone else vote for you and from there proposals are then created by the community anyone with meaningful support in the community who's not a stranger who has a meaningful number of comp votes delegated to them can propose an upgrade and then the rest of the community is able to vote on it and this allows you know going back to the two points one a massively reduced realm of error and ability for any one party to destroy or corrupt the protocol and two upgradeability by a much larger audience and we're starting to see the very first interactions in compound governance go live we had our first two proposals last week and i think we're going to see a lot more activity over the coming weeks and months part of these blockchain crypto economic systems starting with bitcoin and then also moving into things like maker dow and uniswap all these things have tokens with them right so uniswap for every exchange it has a token bitcoin has its token and bitcoin's token was issued via this immaculate conception story and then after that it's uh been issued on this competitive senior age basis and that's been considered very fair uh the maker dao mkr uh token issuance has had its criticisms of its lack of fairness and and in my opinion fairness goes down to the very essence of the the beginnings of every single blockchain crypto economic protocol compound being one of those protocols and if if the comp token is issued you know fifty percent to you know a million people and fifty percent to one person the fairness is obviously questioned uh and and it breaks down what it turns a compound into something that could be a public utility into something that is like a private for-profit entity and so how are you guys thinking about the token distribution and fairness ensuring that compound is something closer to a public utility rather than like a for-profit application yeah that's a great question so this goes to the design goals of the system we want to make it where you know no one address can you know let's say destroy the protocol intentionally or unintentionally and that the protocol is upgradable by a large number of people you know fairness really comes down to those things ensuring that it runs forever and that it's upgradable beyond that you know we don't really have any other design goals and so the way we're structuring this is we're you know ensuring that about half of the voting authority is broken up amongst many independent stakeholders and the other half is distributed to the users and we think that over time it's going to achieve both of those objectives you know and from there the comp token holders can evolve they can change they can upgrade the protocol in an entirely new direction that hasn't been conceived of yet but you know the company that originally built compound is going to retain zero of the tokens and the protocol is hopefully going to run forever so robert i've actually um had the opportunity to vote in the first two proposals that that you mentioned and uh it was really seamless and it was really fun um we could you know talk about what those proposals uh are and kind of the outcomes whether you're surprised or not but you know first i want to ask a question that's probably on listeners mind right now is like many folks that are in the bankless community use compound how can they get compound tokens how can they get comp tokens you talked about distribution to the you know tens of thousands of of users is that is that distribution in place yet is it coming soon what plans do you have i think a lot of folks are going to be interested in participating they just want to know how that's a great question so we haven't announced the exact mechanism yet it's still in the building auditing and testing phase but the basic premise is that we want all of the users of the protocol to wind up becoming stakeholders in the protocol um you know i don't want to tease you guys but that's as far as we can go with this question today but over the next couple weeks i think there's going to be a lot more information that starts to come out and i think it's going to be very exciting for the users of the project so in compound's current form where it's centralized around like a specific team a specific set of people i'm sure you guys have hired people that are more more knowledgeable than the average person when it comes to designing a protocol uh you know gearing up the economics to fit right how do you uh trust or how do you think that the this distributed network of you know hundreds of people across hundred thousands of people across the world actually have the competency to understand compound at a deep technical level and make adequate and appropriate changes that are in the best interest of the protocol yeah that's a great question so i think in a lot of ways this is going to evolve rapidly but it's the responsibility of those who have you know compound governance rights to ensure that the protocol is upgraded in responsible ways i actually think that based on some of the design decisions we've made it's going to lead to slow governance i think one of the absolute best things about both bitcoin and ethereum is that they move relatively slowly it's easy to understand you know how they work and that they're not going to radically change without a whole bunch of people knowing about them and a lot of the actual governance mechanisms are in place so it's very easy to say no to proposals it's designed to be hard to get something through compound governance and you know i'm gonna hope that the community over time you know helps enforce you know strict standards for the protocol demands that you know meaningful changes are audited demands that they've been analyzed from an economic perspective et cetera i know that i'll personally vote against proposals that don't meet those criteria i hope that others you know take a similar perspective and over time i do think it's going to lead to slow governance um hopefully it looks like bitcoin where there's a couple major changes over years and not you know a cadence of weekly updates but we'll see and one of the things that can also change through governance is actually how governance works so if it needs to evolve you know further to slow things down that's a possibility too so robert you know given sort of what what you see so the community gets um comp tokens and they have the ability to either vote themselves or delegate their vote to knowledgeable experts do you see sort of the the rise of what we might call uh protocol politicians that kind of aggregate uh votes and they they get delegates on board and they sort of vote almost like party platforms is is that going to be the end state here yeah i think there's a lot of different phrases for this protocol politician is a great one i think of them more as protocol you know members of a board of directors but i do think there's going to be professionals who are skilled at understanding suggested proposals and changes to the protocol and representing a wider audience you know we see this all the time in you know traditional corporate governance you know every shareholder can vote you know in a annual meeting of a publicly traded company yet few do in general there's experts involved and it winds up you know with people that spend a lot of time thinking through proposals where you get to this best of both worlds where you always have the right to participate on your own anyone who has com tokens can vote anyone can research it anyone can make their voices heard and for those that don't want to put in the time they're going to want to find experts whether you call that a protocol politician or a protocol expert i think you're going to naturally see a gravitation towards you know individuals representing many stakeholders some of these individuals might form doubts right i could see you know a bunch of people delegating their votes to a dow which is you know has its own experiments and i could see a lot of people being individuals uh who participate i could see you know you ryan you know becoming popular in compound governance and having members of the community say you know let's form the bankless alliance or whatever it winds up being and i think this is going to emerge rapidly once we open the doors to 20 000 users having comp tokens and being able to participate in governance i think we're going to see some wild results oh yeah dave and i have uh given a lot of thought to what the bankless united political action group might look like uh robert so you'd be pleased to know what we're thinking about we've been chewing on this um that would be super cool yeah and you know it's very exciting to get the community involved in that way um i'm glad that you mentioned uh sort of some kinship with shareholder governance because th this is sort of what it strikes me as um some folks say well you know voting with with capital in this way that's a plutocracy right and um you know i think it i think that's right i think that it is a a plutocracy but companies are organized in that way right it's very good that our democratic republic protocol is not a plutocracy it's very good that the base layer um ethereum and and base layer value chains like bitcoin are not plutocracies but um for for d5 protocols i'm not certain that that is the the wrong model i think it could be a good model but there seems to be a piece that might be missing and i want your your thought on this so with a um a more mature it's been out there longer governance token like maker for example it ties two things together so there's the voting right that you have with with maker but you also have the the skin and the game aspect where uh maker you know receives some upside from fees that are burnt in the maker platform right so there's some upside there and if a mistake is made if the wrong collateral is added well um maker inflates and so the value of maker is essentially destroyed so governors don't just have the right to an ability to to govern but they also have some skin in the game do you think that that compound is is lacking that or do you think that um that's not an essential piece of the puzzle here that's a great question so you know i do think that over time um the way the token works may evolve based on the will of the community but when we launch compound governance to the community it's strictly a governance token there's no economics tied directly to the token i'll go on the record and say please do not speculate on comp token it is you know not meant to be an economic vehicle it is purely a governance token all it does is enable you to vote and participate in compound governance and i think that's really exciting because it keeps the system simple i i hope that it leads to a system that's easy to understand and easy to participate in and you know is open to a very large audience and over time you know the comp token holders may upgrade the protocol to change that but i'm very excited to start off with just a clean governance foundation and you know be in a position for people to get increasingly involved with it um i think that those who wind up holding the comp token are going to want to see compound succeed i think you know giving a token to the users and you know the folks that helped get it off the ground everyone is sort of rooting for the same thing which is to see a protocol continue to scale survive and evolve and i don't necessarily think there has to be economics for that to work so what's stopping comp holders from just voting themselves into profits from the uh the borrowers of the compound protocol they could the entire administration of the protocol is run by compound governance and the compound governance token holders and the protocol may evolve in unexpected ways i'm actually most excited by how much power compound token holders have it's really quite exciting i think over the next couple years we're gonna see all sorts of proposals some simple some advanced some complex some bewildering and it's gonna be really fun to watch the community debate them and implement the ones they think are best i just hope that you know governance evolves in a relatively slow fashion for major changes and can be nimble for small changes so the proposals that we've seen uh i i'm wondering if they are going to be kind of recipes for cookie cutters for proposals that that we'll see in the future i know in maker governance for example 95 or so of the maker governor and votes really surround changing a few core uh variables parameter changes and that sort of thing or even you know collateral types that sort of thing the first two votes that we saw in compound one was about a parameter change so that was adjusting the die parameter to something a bit more efficient and the second was a collateral change adding usdt can you talk about those two proposals and whether you see them as sort of emblematic of of the types of proposals that we'll see moving forward or even thoughts on the the types of governance issues that will be voted on in the future yeah absolutely so out of the two proposals what's interesting is one of them was written by our team and one was written by an application that's built on top of the compound protocol so our team did the work to propose the addition of a new asset tether to the protocol based on the community's prior interest in seeing the asset added to be clear it wasn't added as collateral you can't use it to borrow any other asset and it was designed such that it's as low risk to the protocol as possible but we did do the work of creating a template for how to add a new asset to the protocol and the second protocol improvement was created by dharma which did the work of writing and deploying a new interest rate model smart contract it was only one line of code different from the existing contract but it set a great example of the fact that the protocol is upgradable by the community our team that originally built it doesn't have to write the code to upgrade compound there's no foundation there's no middlemen anyone out there is able to write a new contract for the protocol or simply change one parameter of the protocol and i think it's gonna be really exciting because the first two demonstrated how easy it is to get involved um you know our contract was you know hopefully a cookie cutter for other assets that the community might want to add and debate you know how they are used as collateral and the second was you know done as an example of creating an entirely new contract by a third party team there's going to be additional proposals some of which require zero smart contracts to be deployed we're simply changing a parameter you know the community doesn't know this yet but there's actually a very simple drag-and-drop gui uh to create proposals uh wow you don't you only see it when you have enough comp votes uh it's a hidden feature unless you have a hundred thousand comps delegated to you but there's actually tools to create proposals that require no code and so i think what we're going to see is the community over time learning how to create proposals and how to garner support for them and deploy them and i think over time we're going to see both more of the simple stuff as well as ideas that are significantly larger um you know i you know i think you know there's a suggestion before that maybe the way that you know the token interacts with borrowers could change who knows i have no idea what the future of compound governance holds i just know that anything is possible well i know the the bankless community is absolutely excited about getting involved in governance have had a lot of interest that i've seen in various channels that that we monitor so we will be waiting with with baited breath on the plans to distribute uh to you know comp users and be looking for ways to plug in so hopefully a follow-up on that at some point robert um excellent you know one other one other question that's sort of been on my mind a lot lately is this interplay between what we call kind of the crypto banks the exchanges and the block fives of the world and the d5 protocols because sometimes it feels like they're very much competing with the d5 protocols so binance for example well if they're rolling out the a binance smart contract chain they are replicating some of the functionality of d5 protocols inside their own wild garden exchange that's on one side of the the spectrum the other side of the spectrum you have exchanges like coinbase that are actually last week we talked about this in in the front of episode 10 coinbase is actually rolling out their own uh d5 price oracle to help support the ecosystem like what does this interplay look like to you robert are crypto banks competing against d5 protocols like compound are they helping you what what's the interplay yeah it's a great question so i think it's a little bit of everything i think the industry as a whole is still extremely early um you know when i say extremely early i mean we're all of you know 10 years into crypto i think defy is about you know two years old you know it's so early that i think it's too soon to tell what the landscape looks like 6 12 18 24 72 months from now i mean i think there's gonna be a lot of experimentation from crypto banks from exchanges from custodians from every type of platform possible my goal and vision is for compound to be neutral territory for any exchange custodian wallet application to feel comfortable integrating the protocol knowing that it's unkillable by the legacy team and knowing that they have the ability to upgrade the protocol if they choose or would like to it can be very stable ground to build on and integrate and that's the goal and i think some crypto banks exchanges whatever you want to call them will experiment with integrating compound because you know they're able to then build on top of it and feel excited about that and know that you know the protocol does what they want and others will compete with it you know you might see someone like binance saying you know why integrating this sort of a shared resource let's go our own way inside of a walled garden and we'll see things in the middle i would love to come back to this question in two years and see how it's evolved because i think however it did evolve will have surprised present day yeah absolutely yeah so you're probably just about to say it david but like david and i have this this thesis and david's actually giving a presentation about it um called called like the the critical sync thesis maybe david you should describe that the protocol sync thesis references that uh the more decentralized the more uh money robot like the more robotic like the less subjective a a protocol is the the more it acts as infrastructure for people or companies or anybody to to leverage and like the best example of this is like the internet right like the internet is this ultimate agnostic platform that treats everyone fairly and because of that truth it's it's this platform that every in addition to all the other features that are wonderful about the internet it's this place of neutrality that everyone can go to access fairly and equally and so like businesses come and and we we're starting to see this with gemiini gemini is starting to become really crypto friendly or defy friendly and coinbase is already pretty d5 friendly and so the theory is that you know we're going to start seeing these centralized companies start to leverage the returns or the features or the products that defy offers inside of the company's you know service inside of the company's offering and so the company is able to leverage the value of defy for their own benefit and you would never really see this on a company to company basis right you would never see one company leverage another company in order to produce a a new product inside of their own walled garden because there's two wall gardens it doesn't really work like that and so the protocol sync thesis is that the more agnostic the more robotic protocols sink down to the bottom and have things built on top of them and i see that with compound with your guys's efforts to be not really something that you directly into interact with on a peer to peer to contract basis but rather it's obfuscated or abstracted away from the user and leveraged by other teams or other developers and so how do you think about that do you think that that is a a valid prediction or do do you see any problems with that i i love the protocol sync thesis uh thank you for sharing that because i think it describes exactly what we're hoping to achieve which is very neutral unopinionated you know independent infrastructure for others you know and it has been sort of the guiding direction for how we've thought about rolling out governance and transitioning from developer-led product and protocol to one that's community maintained huge fans of the thesis uh it'll be really cool to see which other projects sort of fit in and sink down to the bottom and wind up being sort of like the bedrock of other projects the most credibly neutral protocols win is kind of the heart of that thesis robert what's what's kind of the end game here for for compound i mean where do you see maybe we'll start with compounds like where do you see compound in the next you know two years and then five years and then maybe a decade out then i want to ask you about um ethereum and then crypto writ large and open finance yeah that's a great question so i think over the next couple years the community is going to be able to upgrade compound in entirely new ways so i think you know or at least i hope that the community can start to bridge compound with other blockchains i would love to see better bridges between compound on ethereum and you know other platforms like cosmos and bitcoin i think there's a lot of really exciting stuff that can emerge there so you know that's one that i'm excited for the community to pursue i'm excited for the community to improve the underlying contracts that compose compounds i think applications will want to see improvements made to the gas cost and efficiency of the protocol i'd love to see you know the community start to upgrade just the you know the sort of core of the protocol itself and i'm excited to see the community debate propose and implement new assets on ethereum there's quite a few and d5 is moving so quickly that there's probably going to be some defy you know tokens that are you know fantastic additions to the protocol so it's going to be really interesting to see compound but i think two years from now the protocol is a little bit faster more efficient and cheaper to use there's more assets and there's possibly the early traction on integrating compound with other blockchains so that's what i think the future of compound looks like in terms of the community and the governance and the interactions i absolutely think you're going to start to see some you know whether you call them politicians or experts emerge that take um sort of an unstructured process and turn it into a structured process that sort of you know through the organized chaos that is the blockchain create you know essentially you know like a board of directors or a parliament you know that helps govern the protocol but i think there's going to be some really great evolution there and lastly i think that there's going to be more applications built using compound that experiment with what you can do with being able to instantaneously earn an interest rate on any ethereum asset or borrow any ethereum asset and package them in entirely new ways i think you know we're gonna see you know the continuation of this golden era of defy experimentation play out and i think there's going to be products built with compound that just don't even exist yet one thing i think is interesting is is with this comp token the with the maximal success of the comp token doesn't that mean the end of you know compound labs the centralized company and so like you know jake shirnisky him and i chitchat and telegram and he was on my other podcast so he's a good friend and it's kind of weird just to see like well jake if you get this right if you get this comp token right like you're going to be out of a job so what what what's the future for com for compound labs after comp token is successful yeah it's a great question and you know the community should know that our goal is to not be involved um in maintaining and managing the protocol we want you the community to step up and own that um i think in a lot of ways you know it's kind of like if satoshi first made bitcoin and then once bitcoin was successful satoshi then went out and created coinbase um in a lot of ways that's how we see our own role it's creating this underlying protocol that's neutral that has all the tools it needs to grow and then building out the next thing on top of it um you know and that's exciting you know being able to move on being able to allow the community to sort of focus on making the protocol as great as possible and then being you know a team with no advantages over everybody else that's able to then build on the protocol so that's exciting and i think that's the future there's kind of uh two camps in the i guess maybe i'll say the digital asset space for large roberts right there's the one side which are kind of cryptoanarchists let's get all the centralized parties out of the money system you know government out uh banks out you know i'd confess that the the bankless movement is probably a little more on that side um there's another side of the movement of the digital asset movement that is a bit more facebook libra you know central bank of of china digital currency no question in my mind that that our future is going to be digital um but how do these two sides intersect like does one side have to win and the other lose do you see a more blended world uh what's your take you know me personally i'm somewhat in the middle um you know i believe that ethereum and blockchains have given us superpowers that allow us to reinvent finance for the better to make it faster cheaper more fair better and in some cases that means you know it's going to look extremely cooperative with existing financial services and existing financial products you know i'm not sad if a bank wants to leverage a blockchain to do things better i don't think it has to be a system in which you know it's just an us first them type mindset where you know it's our way or the highway or you know it's only for you know a libertarian bent i think you know this is a tool for good to make financial products out of thin air you know some will look like old products and some will be entirely new and i think there's going to be everything in the middle so i'm actually just most excited for tools like compound to be embraced by you know traditional participants i think one day you know you might see a bank integrating the compound protocol as a means of you know interacting with users you know in ethereum land and i might see some people say hey i don't want to use a system that you know isn't just for us and i don't think there's a right answer you know i just want to see more products come to life that you know how they work you know that they work it's fair it's transparent and it's affordable and i think that's exciting so i'm kind of in the middle i think neither camp is right and i think i think we still have a long way to go so robert one last question before we wrap this up uh what about defy or ethereum or compound keeps you up at night what are you scared of so my biggest fear is apathy i think this has always been the primary threat to d5 and to ethereum which is it stays a tool for a select group that are really excited really aware really educated really bought in and it fails to break out into the mainstream that people don't recognize the superpowers and the tools that we've been given and the thing that keeps me up at night is that d5 today is the same size as d5 in two years that's the fear that you know i get sweats just thinking about and i you know i'm grateful that there's bankless and you know people that are looking to change that and my biggest fear is that you know we don't succeed fast enough and far enough and that two years from now defy is still a niche where it's for a group of people that just love you know new faster better more fun financial products and they're not yet adopted by our friends or relatives and the public at large robert that was such a good answer i have to ask another follow-up sir how can the bankless community help you with that that's our mission too there's about 150 000 defy users today maybe if we're being generous how do we get to a million and how can the bankless community help you yeah so the first thing you can do is you know as we start to roll out compound governance just get involved help make compound safe enough and useful enough for a larger more mainstream audience ask tough questions you know try new products and you know as products become hardened and stable you know start to encourage others to build on them start to use the products built on them and you know just stay excited those are things we can definitely do bankless community you've heard it from robert that's what he wants you to do stay excited keep trying these protocols keep listening to the bankless podcast keep reading the bankless newsletter guys we can achieve what robert's talking about as a community robert david and i want to thank you it's been an absolute pleasure i've really enjoyed this conversation so thanks so much for joining us yeah thanks ryan thanks david really enjoyed being on the show thanks robert fantastic well action items guys so uh a few things i think you could do following up on this episode the first is actually try compound go to the compound website we will include it in the show notes actually dabble with it so use your metamask wallet or even an argent wallet take out a loan or blend some assets to compounds see how it works also a second action item in the future we'll have more information about compound governments and how the bankless community can get involved both in the newsletter and hopefully in the podcast too so stay tuned for that uh david we still need some five-star reviews don't we we we absolutely do uh in order to grow the bankless political party we need people to listen to it and and help govern compound when it comes time to govern it so in order to do that we need more people to listen to the bankless podcast and the way that we get that done is by giving us those five star reviews and so if you want to make sure that compound is adequately governed make sure that we show up on the top of the of the crypto podcast charts when you type in search terms like defy and ethereum and the way that we get that done is by giving bankless five-star reviews so if you could go to itunes or wherever you listen to podcasts and give us those five-star reviews we would really appreciate it awesome all right guys risks and disclaimers so everything we've talked about today is not financial advice ethereum is risky crypto is risky d5 protocols including compound have risk associated with them you could lose what you put in be careful out there we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everybody but we are excited that you are here with us this has been episode 11 how to go bankless with compound thanks for joining us [Music] you
