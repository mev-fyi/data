Sam is deleting Tweets in the Tweet being deleted is a tweet that says FTX is fine assets are fine and another tweet that says FTX has enough to cover all client Holdings we don't invest client assets even in treasuries the idea is that these tweets are being deleted because they're wrong at best and perhaps lies at worst and if there lies then that's fraud let's be clear on two things one Sam you can't delete things from the internet yeah and number two I'm doubtful this was actually SPF I'm sure it's I think I think it's been legal team and lawyers and PR for the past at least 36 hours 48 hours yeah if any of these things are not true I mean what is what do you call this tweet outright lying
