one of the things that brought me into ethereum is just how optimistic everyone is it's like it's infectious like everyone's really generally happy and accepting perhaps somewhere to our our own naivete when you come into ethereum and you see like the culture here what do you see we prided ourselves for years about being a very welcoming Community about being very friendly and it led to the ethereum community getting hacked in sort of predictable Ways by people who were like upfront like very friendly but then had sort of their own intentions and goals a lot of the Kumbaya culture isn't very well designed around adversarial thinking ethereum doesn't exist in a vacuum it's still subject to the competitive forces that drive everything else and so if we want our values of pro-social and positive sum to expand to the rest of the world we sort of have to compete to protect them and to advance them against other things that might try to out-compete them that don't have those values and I saw a lot of people taking this idea for granted that ethereum was just like the best it was going to dominate forever and it was just going to win because we're the good guys that's like not how anything works
