the only time i've ever said this is like the internet is is this wait you've never said this i never said it about anything else between the original internet and then the emergence of crypto when you get something like this that has a movement it has this sort of collective effect has a movement behind it and is attracting many of the world's smartest people to work on it the criticisms play out differently than the critics think so the critics make this long list of all of the problems but you're getting these genius engineers and entrepreneurs flood into the space which is what's happening right now and what happens is they look at that list of problems as a list of opportunities they're like okay like that's the punch list like these are the things that i can do because if i fix these problems it's going to be really important it's going to really matter i'm going to be famous right i can build a real business like you know this is going to be how i'm going to make my mark in the world so i'm going to fix these problems there's the reality of what you have today there's all the critics who are arguing against the reality of what you have today in a lot of cases they're actually right but the fact that they're right is actually totally beside the point because what they're not understanding is the potential they're not understanding what this is going to turn into and they're not going to understand what happens when like a lot of the world's smartest people devote themselves to solving all these problems that's how you ultimately get these amazing outcomes out the other side
