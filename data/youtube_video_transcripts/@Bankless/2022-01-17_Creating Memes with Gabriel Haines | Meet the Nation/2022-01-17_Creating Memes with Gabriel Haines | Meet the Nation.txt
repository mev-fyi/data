david hoffman grandfather of the bankless podcast i humbly ask you to appear on the bankless show at your earliest convenience is a triple point asset thank you eat this money hey bank list nation today we are talking with gabriel haynes who is a twitter personality of sorts uh gabriel has made a bunch of funny videos uh kind of mocking different aspects or things about crypto twitter and all the drama that goes on there and he recently made a video uh about uh bankless after our like spat with the frogs uh and uh he tells that story right at the beginning of the episode so i won't really go into it too much in detail uh but overall he's been around in the space he's been working on two projects one called clip do and the other called creator dao and all are about working in uh different parts of the content creation ecosystem and trying to make uh content creation platforms to work inside of web 3. um and so that conversation happens in the second half of the show uh after we kind of unpack the whole like frog danny d5 2.0 drama and talk about memes and divide d jennings so very loose very laid-back conversation with gabriel who's quickly becoming one of my favorite

it going hello david thanks for having me on uh is it gabriel or can i go with gabe uh well whatever you prefer i introduce myself as gabrielle it's kind of like a hebrew pronunciation okay um but uh biblical pronunciation yeah yeah yeah i'm jewish i grew up orthodox actually i went to yeshiva and all this stuff up until i was 20 so pretty recent my whole life so the uh the story about how you came onto the show today is a little bit interesting can you uh tell that story for the listeners so uh you got into a little kerfuffle with somebody who do you know them now yeah i definitely know them now yes did at the time did you know them i didn't know i did know them i did know them um but basically uh danny who is the founder of abracadabra ice wonderland basically i think called out bankless for being like a vc shill platform something along those lines and you and then and then you're like who are you and this is not the way to ask uh to appear on the show so i thought it would be funny to come up with uh what is the proper etiquette you know what is the way to ask so i think that paying homage to your the the bankless core principles and philosophies uh was the most appropriate way and you know i just got to show respect by bowing and you know reciting the mantras so here we are yeah so that you made a quick video that was uh you just like doing a repeated uh prayer bow saying some of our memes like ethan is a triple point asset you know decentralization is is why we're here like stuff like that uh and in the midst of just a very annoying battle with the frogs i thought this is this is the perfect amount of laughter that that i need in my life and you've done this you've made these quick like crypto twitter hit videos quite a lot recently um over the last like three or four months uh what's the motivation to make these like because it's like it's a little bit of like stand-up sketch comedy um for those that don't know like this this is not the first time that you've made a quick like you know 30 second one minute video uh commentating on some shenanigans about crypto twitter uh where's the motivation come to do do some of this stuff there's not a lot of funny i don't know there's not a lot of this like satirical type of comedic type of very crypto native type of jokes and i feel like bringing that out and like kind of trying to flesh out that medium i think is is quite funny it's quite valuable and just you know because i spend a lot of time on crypto on crypto twitter i obviously understand the memes and understand the inside jokes very well and being able to you know being part of the community i'm able to you know also make fun of the community and kind of embody a lot of the yeah a lot of the traits the community um you know appear to have so that's that's it wait tell for the listeners tell us a few other of your your quick sketches quick sketches um yeah um they're a minute long by the way because that's how long twitter lets you record that i mean that's that's the only reason um i did one uh with the paraswap airdrop where you know people complaining oh i was excluded from the airdrop i even though i was like an actual user and so i was kind of like putting this to extreme like oh i deserve i use 200 wallets on your website like i deserve at least 100k for whatever it is like obviously it's ridiculous so so that was one um another one i i called out kobe that was it was recently on uh episode 100 i was listening to earlier today great a great conversation but kobe changed his name um so i kind of called him out for being um a blue checkmark citadel overlord like oh you used to be a man of the people but now you fly private and have massive bags whatever right um so a beefing with people on twitter also those fun just like poking fun and whatever their personality or whatever traits they're exhibiting that's funny because that's kind of similar to uh the beef that uh spawned on twitter between like us and danny where danny called us like a vc shill platform which is like news to me because uh i mean we let vcs on our show like people like chris dixon that's because they have really really good thoughts and this and i i'm maybe i'm putting words in danny's mouth my critique was that danny was just using uh it like us as like a free punching bag because you know popular crypto show popular on twitter like loss of surface area and like he's become this like super duper like populist type leader and he's really really like leaned into it my interpretation was that he just like picked bankless as his like target of the week just to like drum up and rally up support of the green frog army is that your interpretation as well um no i don't know i don't know i mean that's an interesting perspective like i think that well why haven't you had him on i mean you i i assume it's kind of didn't know who he was it's not like you're forced to i mean but obviously spell is a big project i mean i know i recognize you didn't know exactly who founded it but it's you knew about abracadabra as soon as right i mean it's like it's a massive d5 protocol um the guy seems to be very charismatic so i mean you know i assume you would have him on in the right context like if you're like oh this guy looks interesting at night and you just didn't come across him whatever that's completely fine um i don't know why he was doing that i mean it is what it is but i do think and this is um not a criticism it's an observation i do think that bankless does have a more uh buttoned up type of approach right you do come from and i think you would say this yourself like you come from like a fundamental um you know let's as an investor even like we come with fundamental analysis which is a more conservative type of investment style which you know you know you equate with like warren buffett you know he's like wearing a suit right so i think he's commenting on that aspect like as opposed to something like up only which definitely is not is not that it's something completely different and is more meme driven more narrative kind of stuff like that um so and and he himself you know is not he's definitely more aligned with the up only type of vision than a fundamental he he understands that there's something very powerful about memes as do you but he's really tapped into that right he himself is a the frog is the meme right he is the meme so i think that's that's what he was saying yeah i agree with that and there are different like velocities of memes i think and i think like uh at bank list this whole like buttoned up like image or brand that we have is like because we enjoy our slower moving memes where there are some faster moving memes that like are the quick hits on on twitter and this can this kind of relates to also the projects that people invest in where danny's projects are relatively newer uh and they they move a lot more quicker than some of the projects that me and ryan are used to like me and ryan were in crypto before d5 was a thing and like the first d5 protocol maker dow that like spawned the whole concept of defy is the slowest most like boomer type protocol that exists and that's what we got that's how we came into the world of defy and the world of crypto and defy has only accelerated um since then it's only gotten faster and faster and faster uh and and so a lot of these newer protocols which like especially after some of the basic primitives like maker compound ave uniswap get built out and start to themselves slow down there's like this is an insatiable desire for like d jenning that i think danny has really answered for uh and that's why that's why i think you are calling it more aligned with like the up only crowd uh just because like you know they're things that only need to get more and more degen to answer to like the the dopamine hits that people want and bankless is less about that although like we'll cover we'll cover that even though we haven't yet um but we're we still want to like ground people in sort of some sort of like long-term outlook long-term like ethos or vision for for why we're all here in the space and i think those differences create some sort of friction even though i don't really think it's necessary that like it doesn't need to be there's not any like values misalignment it's just like a uh i think the bank list is tries to look 10 plus years into the future where some parts of d5 just is only looking a couple months into the future how do how does how does that all that interpretation land with you um yeah i mean it's just i i i just think you have a different audience and you have you're coming from a different place like you said like when you like i think bankless after uh what bitcoin did was like the first crypto podcast that i was listening to um i guess two years ago now um and and at that time crypto was much different it was much different and like you have a crypto punk hanging on your wall right like back then that's that wasn't a status symbol that was just like garbage like it was like nobody gives about it right like so stuff has really changed and i think that you're and i think that the way that you guys chose to approach it was kind of connecting like eve as a triple point asset that that statement that ideologue like that philosophy is trying to root eve like ethe asset into like a traditional financial framework which abracadabra does not they don't that's not what they're doing they're it's like it's just a different meme completely it's just completely different so so yeah do you agree that like if abracadabra it's like abracadabra is like less than a year old uh if i'm remembering correctly um but like don't you think that in order for it to go from like one year old to like five years old it needs to actually start to root itself in like traditional buttoned up framework because i i think like the longer something that exists the longer it it develops and expands the more kind of like polished and professional it needs to be in order to scale out to the whole entire world and so like i think if danny's projects need to stand the test of time they're going to also need to stop answering to like d-gen behavior and start to be more stable and foundational and so i think it's like a question of just like where is the ecosystem the relevant ecosystem whether it's like the d5 2.0 ecosystem or like boomer defy it's more of a question of just like how long it's been around i don't know i don't know you might be right but i don't think that has to be the case because crypto brings about its own culture its own unique new fresh fresh memes bro like you don't need to ascribe you don't need to take crypto to old memes in order to move forward necessarily maybe you do maybe you do and you need to have you know whatever you need to have like a thesis for all these different assets in order for them to really thrive but maybe you don't and maybe there is a culture of like a degen culture which does exist and maybe this culture can continue to develop and maybe it itself as it gets older will become more conservative the culture of being a degen and maybe it will evolve into more like um but i i do think it is new so you don't need to retrofit your ideas i think that you know people say like fiscantes like he says like post-value society now whatever that means i don't necessarily know but it does it does mean that there was something and now we have a new thing there is a change here yeah and simultaneously while i think in order for like d5 protocols to stand the test of time they need to become more just like mature and less less memey and more foundational simultaneously on the other side of things what crypto is doing in the first place is making like traditional finance become more like crypto so it's like a meeting in the middle right um like traditional time finance needs to take off the goddamn tie because they need to understand why dogecoin is what it is and why it works the way that it works because if you can understand why dogecoin works all of a sudden bitcoin becomes obvious like people think people traditional finance think that bitcoin is what bitcoiners think dogecoin is all right and then like it keeps on going down the line like well there's the dogecoiners who just think there's some other stupid meme like i don't know ship that's even more me and less rooted in in real life uh and at some point they're like the the most optimal place to be is some balance between the actual traditional trad five boomers who wear ties and like the defy 2.0 degens like there's something around that part of the spectrum where that is where most you can capture the most amount of attention and i think that's what we're going for at bankless it could be i mean this is the thing like when you bring up doge in relation to bitcoin i think that it goes even farther than that it's it's doge in relation to the us dollar the u.s dollar is a meme right can a traditional someone in tradify grasp that concept and embrace that content i don't know i don't know if it's possible because the whole industry is based around this like and and and the whole identity of the industry is based around the greenback right is it possible for the you know people to unders that's what i think dejan culture is it's like it's like it's already like a next level like kind of like it it's all it could be even nihilistic at a point like nothing matters right so i i don't know maybe i don't know i don't know and yeah it probably will be a pendulum like you know you have these swings you have you know and you have you know maker dial and you have also you know really super dj stuff i mean it's it's all spectrum don't you think d5 or dj inc can go like too far though i feel like at some point the whole building out the d gen side of d5 is kind of like a race to the bottom because like you're just trying to make like the quicker the the applications and the tokens have like quicker and quicker ponzi scheme like cycles right it's just like all right we built this new thing it's a token that can pump except this this pump is only going to last a month like oh we built out this new thing and it's got a new token but this one is only going to last like two weeks like i kind of think if you optimize for for the dj inside of the spectrum you're optimizing for just short term rism i don't know if that's true i i don't know if that's true because for sure there is that element and there is a lot of greed and people like just trying to make a quick buck but i think that on the margin there is a lot of innovation like you would see something like ohm like olympus to be super djan right oh wow we have 20 000 apy whatever and whatever you think about the project that has definitely broke new ground and and you could easily have viewed that as just d-gen race to the bottom but when in fact no actually there is something new here where do you fall on this spectrum um i don't know i definitely grew up in a framework of price to sale ratio price to earnings ratio um and the more time i spend in crypto the more i go to the other side and i think that my videos also are [Music] like an embodiment or a celebration i don't know what exactly of that culture and of that expression an expression yeah that's better yeah so um i do feel part of a crypto culture whatever that means um and i do think that it is new and we have our own ideas and our own memes and we have common we have common beliefs everyone in crypto has common beliefs like bitcoin was started you know the the what is it the commission the prime minister is bailing out the banks whatever it was that is a core belief of crypto right because you know that's a genesis and i think that every single person in crypto will say institutions are failing they're not doing well and we have a lack of trust in it and we all fit into that narrative and just just difference it's just different and it changes right it just it changes all the time it evolves all the time just like the crypto punk right now it's a huge part of the culture you know three years ago it wasn't i mean maybe to a few people but not as now right so it changes um what do you think about the frogs because the frogs are existing in crypto but also outside of crypto like they were a part of the 2016 um donald election of donald trump well simultaneously also a part of the uh fight for keeping um hong kong free from china oppression like the the the green frog is a symbol of both the like the alt-right but also the freedom for hong kong and it goes on from there and there's also now it's very much also been a part of like certain crypto things like chain link got blessed by the green green frogs and then arbor trump has gotten blessed by the green frogs and now all of danny's projects have gotten blessed by the green frogs what do you think of the frogs what are the frogs how do you define what the frogs are what it what what is it i don't know i don't know it's just um it's something that it's a message it's a symbol that people resonate with and that's kind of a broad answer but i don't i don't really know and and and it has to do with the particular context right it's just because alt-right had used this symbol i i don't think that matters so much it's more what you are using this to mean right and to me for whatever reason the frogs within crypto right now it's like i think of the frog that has a blanket over his head he's cozy right or the uh frog that's kicking his legs under the blanket cozy um that's that's that's um that's the meme within crypto i don't know cozy i don't know this idea and uh i like that idea i like cozy we all wanna be cozy we all wanna i see a blanket right behind you right so um i don't know i don't know how to answer that i think the frogs is a meme that actually predates me it's it's much older than my experience in memes and it has to do with 4chan a lot of it and cultures actually that i i wasn't necessarily um involved with what's you what's your niche in crypto what do you like to pay attention to um anything that can get me a 100x i like to pay attention to no um i don't know uh i really like i'm a creator so i'm i make videos i used to do a lot of interviews um so that the niche of being a content creator is very important to me and something i spend a lot of time on so um to that effect i'm i helped start creator dao which is a content creation dao which i think is very cool it's very unique um within the dao space the crypto space um and also i'm working on klypto which is a like a crypto cameo type app which also is in the creator niche obviously creators make the videos stuff like that so that is that is what i specialize in i don't know that's what i think a lot about tell me more about creator dao what's the goals of creator dell yeah so creator dao is i you know i i was making these interviews and doing these tutorial videos and people are reaching out to me and saying hey we'll we'd be happy to sponsor you if you you know did a review of one of our you know our platform whatever it is um and i i it is a bit of um there is a bit of friction between negotiating a price what kind of content do you want what other types of what content can you offer all that type of stuff um and i felt like if if there was a group of people that could actually offer a complete package and protocols wouldn't have to think so hard about what the what particular piece of content um they would want to create that could be quite valuable for them so basically it's to enable creators to access these opportunities and also for apps to get in touch with content creators who are crypto native and understand the space and spend a lot of time in the space so the goal is to have a way to earn um for creating content within crypto um and just to create good content so it's like a decentralized media business yeah it's like um it's like a it's like a marketing agency yeah a dow marketing agency market marketing yeah right right uh how has that been going have you actually been able to connect capital to creators in this bottom-up decentralized fashion yeah absolutely i think we're close to a million dollars distributed since we started which we started at the beginning of the year i guess in i don't remember exactly march april but yeah i'm almost a million it might be a little bit less eight hundred thousand and i don't know the exact number but it is close to that um and that is money that was paid directly from protocols to the dao and is then distributed to the um to the creators so it's not like some inflationary token it's actually cash right so the dow is just like trying to traffic control cash between buyers and and contributors um yeah is that about right yeah i mean there's one of the biggest um the biggest challenge is how do you assign value to the different creators like how can you actually right and you guys do this in the in the bankless dial i think you're one of the biggest uh coordinate users um actually but when we came up with the with when i was thinking about the dao i was i thought that coordinate basically in the initial design of the dow i included coordinate because that value distribution is so important and i was um along with caesar who also uh started out um and a few others as well but caesar and i were um part of yearn we were early urine contributors uh wi-fi contributors and yfi was facing this problem where they had a committee of i think it was trach and ban tag who would basically just go through all the contributions and they would just like be like oh you get 5 000 and you get a thousand whatever it is and people who were contributing felt neglected or thought it was unfair so actually urine came up with coordinate and so coordinate i thought could be you know it can be utilized in all sorts of different ways um like for this marketing organization i mean it could also be for just like uh an art collective you know if people want to commission art you have a bunch of artists who get together make art and they distribute it between themselves i mean just a random idea but um so i thought coordinate was really cool so we put it into the um into the like the structure of the dow and that's how we do the distribution so basically um everyone votes um on uh who provided value in like how in you know in give tokens and then you do an average of that and then that's how you distribute the funds uh basically from the clients and uh uh how many with creator dao how many people are like on average uh in a payout like is it like four people that got that participated in a certain product or release or creation or is it like 40 yeah it's closer to 40. i would say it's like 20 to 30. and then how how much likes auto organization or self organization is part of this or is there actually like are you and a few other people actually trying to like do a lot of the actual top-down coordination um i actually haven't been super involved in the past few months i had a baby oh congrats thank you uh almost three months ago uh two and a half months ago so i've been pretty busy on that end um and most of my time actually has been on klypto but um there are people who yes who do spend time uh doing a lot of the organization uh dunks uh bee fugu uh those are some of the members that are doing a lot of like the project manager like type role um and that was actually something that we uncovered along the way that you need a project manager because in the initial idea like it would just be like whoever contributed like we'll do the distribution but if there's no project manager and the project manager doesn't doesn't like have a fixed um sal salary or percentage of the distribution then it's very hard to make sure that the work actually gets done and and that there's actually someone communicating with the client and someone actually taking that responsibility um so there is i mean it's it's i don't i don't know if it's i guess it's top down but it's whoever wants can be uh you know project man whoever wants to take on that role right and that project manager could they in theory also become like sales whereas like they also like reach out to some squad and and some team or protocol or whatever and just say hey like i will be the coordinator between you guys and content creator dao or creator dao so anyway anyone can plug themselves in yeah and i mean um i don't think that it's ever been like that exact scenario but yeah i think a sales person anyone could be a sale i mean if you i think if you close a sale then if you like on board a client then you get ten percent of the sale something like that um that was also something that we wanted to make fixed i at the beginning i was doing a lot of the sales calls um and you know i realized that i wasn't getting a huge amount of the funds at the end of the period um and you know for me personally like i don't i don't really mind like whatever but i i could see that if you're not being fairly rewarded you're not gonna be motivated to continue to do these things right so um you have to have like a fixed percentage of the sale which i think it's like 10 like i said but yeah basically anyone can do it and uh just on board clients to the to the dow what's the dow's best skill what's what's the dow really really good at producing like if what you guys best product to be able to create it's it's focused only on content so um as the dow has uh matured and gotten um you know more people have joined we've gotten some very talented content creators to join um like musical artists that are like top level um graphics like we had some amazing graphic uh design someone worked at netflix i believe recently like you know really good quality high quality content creators so we don't focus on like um we don't do like web design or like ux ui like that's not like we could but it's not really what we do it's like focusing really on the content and um i mean the reason for that is because when we started i mean it was me caesar like we were content creators right that's what we do we we're not uh you know we're not we don't make a web flow necessarily what i want to focus on is give people who are creative the opportunity to actually create in the space and be awarded for that and so what kind of content are we talking about like two to five minute explainer videos or are we talking about more like long-form articles or podcasts or video interviews what kind of stuff yeah it's uh it's a mix of everything so the way um we have it set up is basically use a content pyramid structure and this can allow um it gives kind of a base for the kind of content the client can expect but so we do a long form interview usually um like like we're having right now and then from this interview you can extract lots of different content so you can make a summary of this conversation that's a piece of content you can take clips from this conversation and that's a piece of content you can write an article you know describing some of the points whatever it is you can take quotes so from this one piece of content you're able to make uh maybe 20 original unique pieces of content plus um aside from the contents pyramid we also just have like whatever someone wants to do so if it's like a tutorial of the app like a walkthrough of the app and explainer video of the app or a graphic like uh announcement uh gif or whatever or whatever it may be um so that's it's it's it's very uh intrinsically motivated it's what you want to contribute whatever and we like i said there's a musical artist she makes like like 30 second songs like um so it's really whatever you want to to contribute um is is what you can do how a bank list how could we best utilize um the dao in your opinion so actually it's interesting because when i was um a young buck i mean i guess like a year and a half ago i was i was uh actually doing a lot of this stuff for you guys like i did this a few times i would listen to the show and i would like make a clip of the episode whatever like a one minute clip and put subtitles and stuff and publish it um so like i think that at the time you weren't doing that but i think now you are and and i think that that that is an improvement i mean i just i mean obviously you know what you're doing you've grown a tremendous amount since since then um but i don't necessarily know because you have the bankless dow like it kind of serves a very similar role to what uh creator doubt provides because the banker style also is basically provides support content for the show right so you have people correct me from wrong people that want to write an article they write an article right they they make clips you know they come up with uh you know similar things graphics uh all this kind of stuff um and you use it's like almost it's a very similar structure just it's very personal to your brand right right totally polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon

bankless let's go into the the other dow uh what was the other dell clip kliptow klypto what's crypto crypto so um so i was making these twitter videos as you mentioned and people were asking me to be on cameo you know to sign up so i applied to be on cameo but for the listeners who don't know what cameo is what's cameo it's like um you have like celebrities or influencers and they'll make personalized content for you so if you've ever seen a real housewife be like oh happy birthday justine like that was that was from cameo right okay um so ins and and on more specifically for crypto hard rock nick um was has become this massive crypto meme and um he's on so all of those videos where you see him say the devs uh whatever whatever he says yelling about whatever it is that's all from cameo as well so people were asking me to to get my cameras i want to commission some you know personalized videos so i i signed up for cameo but um i didn't get a response like they never answered me so um that's kind of the classic crypto story you get rejected from web two so you gotta go to web three right um so i so i put out a plea to the devs i i said i put out the idea i'm like listen i think we should make a crypto cameo it would be really cool to you know make payment for the stuff on chain instead of using credit card uh you could receive the content as an nft which is much better than just like a video file so we're actually and this video went out on december 14th so that was almost one month ago and since then we've got together a group of a good pretty good group of people maybe 10 15 people that are a core team whatever that means the people that are actually spending time actually moving this forward and that includes developers uh design like ux ui um creator dao is on board of course um and just a bunch of uh you know muni uh helping you a little bit coin alchemist helping you just like a bunch of people dave white uh from paradigm he helped out with us a lot he got um he got a lot of the devs involved um but um yeah so we're able we were able to put together this app basically it's um it's technically live like we're testing it right now it's not 100 finished it's like 60 70 done um but it is deployed on polygon um it technically does work but like i said like there's just a lot of bugs we need to keep working on that um but this was all done in less than a month i put together kind of an event in new york um last week i guess a lot exactly a week ago kind of just talking about what i'm saying here and uh explaining the vision explaining the project um so yeah that's that's where we're standing today we have a bunch of community members who helped test the app yesterday we got tons of bugs that we need to fix um and you know just every day i'm just trying to push this along bring energy to the project i wrote up a short vision statement for what i think the project could become but yeah that's uh klypto so klypto is just uh cameo but uh web3 is that a fair tl dr yeah um and yeah and then so at the beginning it was it's just very simple like just pigment on chain and receiving an nft but i think that it could be much broader like you could have um some sort of engage to earn type of token model where the the people that are buying on the users because the users are actually part of the creation process right they have to pick a good person to deliver the lines and actually have to pick the line so if you know they're part of the creation as well and actually honoring that like in the vein of d5 and web 3 like really paying those users for using the platform i think is where this could really become uh much bigger than than cameo um [Music] like like like the dao for example for example like the dao could have like an award show every month like awarding the funniest or the most interesting uh klyptos right um and that's it's very valuable for crypto to have these viral videos come out because that's how people use the platform obviously and we want to pay for that right so you can kind of imagine that there would be some sort of flywheel effect which i think could be really cool and also um we can leverage web3 in ways that cameo can't so if for example we could do a party bid for a very high profile type cameo so imagine uh elon musk right we got 300 eth in a party bid for elon musk to say something ridiculous i don't even know what he would say eat to the moon whatever it is like i think it would be pretty funny like i could definitely see him just for the lulls being like okay this million dollar one minute clip like why not you know what i mean so i think it could get pretty big in that way that massive coordination that you can't get in web 2 in web 3 like you can do this type of stuff wait so like uh you can put up bounties so like hey there's a 300 eath bounty for this celebrity to make this statement for in this sort of clip and this celebrity doesn't have to have signed up for the platform they would just probably hear about how there's like this million dollar bounty that's available to them and then they can go check out the the uh to do's and check it out if they and then see if they are into completing that bounty or not and if they do then the money gets sent to them yeah that is definitely something that we want to do um it there are some technical challenges with the decentralization of that particular bounty there's got to be escrow accounts and stuff like this huh exactly the escrow isn't the problem it's just that you don't know what elon musk's wallet address is um going into it so it would have to be tied to his like twitter or something like that but in a perfect world i think that is a hundred percent what we want to do and even i i think that even if it is not that particular feature is not decentralized it is okay maybe for not like a million dollar like what like that's too much but if there is a creator that you were like man i really want to pay this guy a thousand dollars to do x y and z and that that is not then that part of it not being decentralized is okay because that is not like the primary way of doing the transaction the primary way is you come to the platform and you do the whole thing trustlessly right you put it into a smart contract once it's delivered it's delivered to the you know the creator right um because the bounty would only be like a one-time thing once a creator signed up there's no more bounty right it's just like you're just using the platform normally um we could just do it like that so i don't know it's it's it's still a work in progress for sure i i would like everything to be trustless i would like everything to be on chain 100 um i want it to be deployed on every chain uh anywhere where users want to like interact with it um but yeah that's we're still pretty early stages and we've seen plenty of precedent for this before there there's that one like chick on uh cameo i think it must be cameo um that had like she's uh done a lot of just like quick videos for like d5 food coins i think was a popular one and like she was actually really clever she's she's brunette and she would video record herself talking and then also put on a blonde wig and and then stand just to the right of where her previous self was and then she would splice those together so it was like two hot girls talking about this one d5 protocol and of how it's going to the moon uh and like some of these some of these videos they got super viral on twitter because they were the first time that somebody ever tried to do something like this but you could totally see like um tick tock videos just having like ton of traction here and like if they were created a branded like watermarked from like you know klypto twit or uh crypto uh created video clip you could totally see this like really taking off absolutely absolutely and on that i i think that what's interesting here also that cameo doesn't necessarily enable is the ability to make uh a multiple characters like like if you wanted to like if and and be like anonymous people so if you have an anon right who doesn't want to show their face maybe they're okay with their voice you could definitely see tons of youtubers wanting to use this type of platform right it's just another way for them to to monetize their their streams and stuff like that and i'm sure people will love to support them uh with you know whatever whatever they're doing right um so i think that that avenue of having like so when you can have multiple characters because if you're anonymous right you could also be you could be a guy and then you could be a girl and you could have two different profiles and like no one would know and you could i don't know it's just it's it's interesting because there's it creates a lot of um it creates a lot of new opportunity also for people that can't necessarily monetize right now i mean v tubers aren't super popular i mean they're very popular in some sections and they the popular ones are able to monetize but the smaller ones are not necessarily able to um so even with smaller people like smaller followings like this is like a small way that they couldn't you know start to build up you know some cash flow and for build their brand and there's a ton of alignment i'm seeing behind uh creator dao and klypto where like you could just see crater dao was like one of the lead um uh just creators for klypto uh if they can prove to the world that they can actually produce the best stuff uh you could totally see them as being like a as your two projects having alignment and you won using the other to bootstrap itself yeah i mean i mentioned the girl uh i think her name is sarah hartman she's the musician that i mentioned a couple times like for example it doesn't have to be video i mean it could be a commission of anything so if any if someone wanted like oh i want to commission a 30-second jingle um why they could do they could use the platform for that uh we have another guy um i think his name is frederick um i might be misremembering but he's the guy he's the animator from netflix i mentioned um he was like uh we could i could offer a service where i'll bring your pf i'll animate your pfp right um so it kind of becomes like a marketplace for any type of content um you know the reason i i went with the cameo idea is because people were requesting me for video so i was like this is the obvious parallel but it could be much broader than that totally and so there's like a growing ecosystem i'm seeing coming out of you where you have these quick one minute like hit clips on crypto twitter about some crypto twitter meme uh and then you also have this uh you know web three-ish uh con uh content creator like bounty network and then also you have uh creator dao um is is this maybe there's not some sort of intentional goal but if this could turn into some sort of like you know interesting little empire of content creation in web 3. what do you think the long-term conclusion of all these things is or what do you hope that it is yeah um i wouldn't say i have these things i mean like i i definitely um like for crypto like i i definitely had the vision for it but the devs do all the work like if if there's no devs there's no app that's just it and also like i me as an individual any person any founder i don't think that you as a person can carry a project on your shoulders you really need to tap into some sort of energy that already exists right you you can't if i'm the only one passionate about this project it's not gonna happen right right so i have to make sure that there's other people that are invested and you know with their energy and with their time um but as far as your question i think that a lot of the things that i try to create are things that i would use and that and i didn't mention this but i i hired when i was doing my recordings i hired creator to do my whole editing they would edit upload create thumbnail description timestamps everything um and i i actually like i was working with fugu and lem previously to creator just like on my own stuff like i would just send the video they would take care of it and so kind of i on boarded them to creator and did it within the creative framework because it is something that i needed and it is something that like every single podcast and i think we have another podcast that matterhorn does one and they do the same thing for him and every single podcaster every single person that wants to create a broadcast they can use that service um and it takes away so much of the friction of from producing right editing for me is a drag it really sucks it's boring it takes a lot of time and being able to do less editing is good for me right and that's why one minute videos for me are perfect because i don't edit those that's just one off we just do it upload it i'm done right so uh this is a long way of saying yes i build stuff i try to create stuff that are helpful to me and that are helpful to other creators and that enable creator empower creators to you know create more stuff interact with their audience you know and like earn within crypto uh so for your uh your quick twitter one minute videos are you doing that multiple times until you get it right or do you just hit record and whatever comes out comes out and then you hit send um sometimes i will do it multiple times but um the best is just to do one take and send the the first take is usually going to be the best take um the the best if if if i'm able if if i'm able to tap into this of going into a video and i don't even know what i'm going to say in the video that is going to be the best type of video it is very hard to get to that kind of like state of just having the idea like this is what i want to comment on and these are like maybe three or four words that i want to say but those are the best type of video because you're not you're not inhibited by any type of story and you're really in the moment and you're really feeling it you're really channeling it and i would imagine that like you don't have your next like video planned it has to be pretty like spur at the moment just like whatever is going on on crypto twitter that day yeah yeah usually i'm i usually react to i'm scrolling on twitter and i'm reacting to something that's you know has happened whether it's an airdrop or kobe changing their name or you know whatever whatever it is that is going on you know today yeah so you're you when you wake up in the morning you could be or could not be making a video you have no idea while i'm waking up i'm probably not making a video well no no i said like like do you if you know you that you're going to be making a video that day oh that day i make a video every day oh really i think so i mean one of these twitter twitter funny comedy meme videos i make a lot of videos like i'm making i don't think i've missed a day in a while but i might i might have but i make a lot of videos you should do you know the song a day man yeah i know i know the song today man yeah sure i mean it's definitely hard to commit to doing one per day but like he's gotten a ton of traction on just like being consistent with that have you ever thought about doing something like that well that dude has didn't he like he has a guinness book yeah his world records like 10 000 days he's like really legit and i i really respect him for that actually i minted uh some songs uh he just did a sale nft sale and i really respect that i really respect that consistency and i think that's something that i definitely strive for um and actually i i don't know if uh i don't know if like when i when i started doing the interviews uh last year and creating content last year um i actually had a goal for myself to try and publish every single day um what ended up on youtube what ended up happening was that actually was i think i created 150 so basically it was like every other day um and this was like for me it's very very impressive because these videos are much different than like youtube takes a lot more time and takes a lot more time to upload it takes a lot more time to edit it takes a lot more time for description and stuff like that uh which you well know i'm sure but um but yeah i mean i make a lot of videos i make a lot of videos let's just say that what else what else are the crypto space you do you pay attention to or do you really care about uh what else do i pay attention to um i i'm in a group called uh country capital where a group of guys i think we're 12 or so people we got together also maybe like six months ago we do like a lot of like investment in early stage stuff like seed round private round type stuff so any like any new opportunities on that front um i'm always interested in uh like one thing that we got into was um uh paragon dao which is have you heard of that i have not no it's um so basically you know parallel the card game you don't know the parallel card game no no david come on apparently i don't know a lot of things in people and stuff yeah um the nft card game you how do not see this okay um basically um they created like uh it's an nft card game it's like a magic the magic the gathering hearthstone uh type of game um i know god's unchained yeah yeah yeah exactly so this is what i was saying but there's the old memes and then there's the fresh memes right so we we are all like the fresh memes over here okay um so yeah i mean it's kind of it's kind of like gargantuan um but anyway um one of the uh the reason i got excited about parallel is um i love magic the gathering um i play a lot um and one of the founders over there is merchant who's a streamer uh he played a lot of magic the gathering also hearthstone stuff like that and i really i respected him and watched his content before um and he's a part of the game design team over there so um and have a great community but basically anyway paragon dao is um a uh dao that is going to be built on top of this uh game and and it's cool i mean it's exciting i think that uh especially the the intersection of gaming and crypto is a is a space that i really like because uh you know i played a lot of games growing up and um this is the type of stuff that um you know really excites me so this is like a ygg for axe infinity but instead it's built on parallel yeah yeah yeah that's pretty much it so uh gabriel you've we've talked about a number of organizations or or projects that you're involved with if people want to learn more about them where should they go well um in my uh bio i have a link to um clito creator and country if you want to find out about any of those the main way to get in touch with me is via twitter you could just send me a dm i try to respond to everyone but yeah that's the best place to to get in touch can we expect another funny video about bankless in the future listen up david you don't tell me what to do just i'm just asking i'm just asking if i can't um it's got to be uh it's got to be inspired it's got to be inspired right it's got i got to have that spark i got to tap into that energy so potentially potentially why let me ask you a question why did ryan say that the guy had to put up 250k in order to what was that yeah yeah okay so first off that was a group decision so him and i both discussed that okay before the tweet went out and there there is precedent for this uh we've had uh we've had uh udi wertheimer on the show twice uh because cms holdings committed to spending sending uh 250 000 one time and then another hundred thousand another time to charity to get coin uh to host udi on the show uh and so um that that was the history to that that's why that the idea even came about uh and then from my perspective when i woke up to a friend of mine uh sending danny's tweet to me in the morning saying what what what a dick i think was was what he said about danny's uh comment under the thing that that started off the whole thing where i just tweeted out that mkr was undervalued i i think that mkr is just a bullied token it's just like undervalued and then danny comes in and and says says that thing where he says like oh that's why you haven't invited us on your defy show it's because you're a bunch of suits who support like you know boomer tokens basically uh and so like i didn't appreciate that uh i don't i don't enjoy being called like some vc suit person from this guy that i do not know from my perspective like somebody just like walked up to me in the middle of a crowd and was like yo why the f haven't i been on your on your podcast yet and then walked away so like i didn't appreciate that at all and again i don't know who this guy is uh and so like we're not just going to look and bank list we're not just going to like bend the knee to like this frog army who's bullying us on twitter to allow danny to just come onto the show after he was mean to us so we wanted an apology uh and so we wanted him to actually prove that he actually wanted to be on the show for for like actually wanted to put skin in the game uh and so that's where that came from he's like well if he wants to be on the show we'll see how badly he actually wants to be on the show will um he can come on the show if he donates some public goods so that was the impetus behind that in hindsight that was mistake in hindsight that was a bad move um not only was the 250 000 like number just way too high but also it was it was just not the right way to like ask for an apology uh so that was the story behind that all right okay well yeah well if you if you think it was a mistake then that's okay i mean i just i think the con the context of udi you know donating 250k for udi to come on versus this is much different and yes anyway so i don't know i was just it's okay it is what it is i think that you cleared it up i i don't think that there is any reason to be uh upset or no i'm not no not you i mean even dan no one like i think it's fine like it's just like it is what it is you don't have to be friends or you can be i i i have a account for the record i have a calendly link in dms with danny for him to click on it and get some time with me because he said he wanted to chat i don't think he's clicked on it yet so that's that's where that has left off all right you're calling him out danny i'm not talking about ball's in your court i'm not yeah the ball is in his court i'm not that ball isn't its court this is true well gabriel thanks for coming on and chuckling with me i appreciate this i appreciate it thank you for taking the time cheers bye hey we
