[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless hey david we've got an exciting topic today man what are we going to talk about oh yeah this episode is going to be super fun talking all about memes what they are why they are important how they emerge and how they fit into a crypto world yeah these aren't just gifs these aren't just internet jokes these are actually pretty fundamental there have been a few memes going around these days uh we've got the the money printer go brewer meme how do you say bird by the way i i've seen it like spelled but how do you how do you say it if you are a follower of military aviation burr comes from the a-10 warthog uh like chain gun that they have built into the the plane and when it comes in it comes and it goes burr and then it just you know throws like a thousand around so that's where burr comes from fun fact no way it's just being you're way more researched on that than i thought you'd be that's super impressive yeah i know uh yeah that was that's where burr comes from uh and it really sounds like just a bur and then and then they just got repatriated to uh money print or go burr so it it actually comes from just the sheer magnitude of bullets that can come out of an a10 warthog that's wow so i thought it was like you know the sound of like a photocopier made my grandparents used to have a photocopier my grandpa did at his office and he used to get like like that something like that yeah you know that's that's pretty close if you guys are curious to learn more you should go to youtube and go and just type in a10 burr and like 100 like 10 10 different videos will show up all right so memes we're going to talk about memes uh before we get to it let's uh just do some chit chat uh we are all getting checks this week we live in the us both you and i do david we're getting a check from uncle sam for one thousand two hundred dollars each five hundred dollars per child if you have any children uh and i believe if you know your spouse gets a check too if you have a spouse uh is that exciting or what getting a check is exciting uh what's not exciting is that most people getting checks are no longer getting checks from their jobs uh the if you go look at the amount of unemployment filings that have been filed in the last two weeks the uh you know the big greens uh you know the big candle the big green candle that spiked this week is like at least five times larger than what happened in 2008 uh and so this is kind of the reason why we're getting checks is because we're not getting checks anywhere else we have record unemployment uh and so the the trump administration is is sending out you know twelve hundred dollars to every adult plus five hundred dollars if you have a kid to help compensate for this the narrative that that i see forming is that this is just a slap in the face for what is actually needed if this is the first of many checks then that's one thing but right now this sounds like a one-time check that's taxes taxable income which is weird but uh we'll we'll see what happens money is fun but not losing your job isn't and and other countries are doing this as well so this is not just a us event this is happening with central banks and countries around the world uh but you know where are they getting this money from it's definitely a case of money printer go burr nice nicely done yeah you know i had a a friend um who for the first time i've talked to him about crypto a number of times never really been interested the first time he texted me and he said oh my god we're getting checks the government's printing money what crypto should i buy very first time he's ever texted me and asked me that question and i wonder what percent of this essentially temporary ubi check is actually going to end up in crypto obviously a lot of folks need the money they need to pay bills my friend fortunately is in a better position than that and he's just wondering where he should actually store some of this some of this wealth uh you know and his question like like anybody to me was like you know how can i get how can i get five x how can i get 10x which crypto should i bet on that was his question it's just interesting so you told him to put it into xrp the standard right totally that's the standard man i was like extended it's the standard it's a well-established meme that means it's obviously true you know and then i was like just kidding you should put your money in bitcoin and ether some combination of both and that's an interesting question i think because it made me think later in the week of well like what is a good combination of crypto money of ether and bitcoin if those are sort of the you know the recommendations uh what's your thought on that topic what would you do 100 your friend asked you 100 david what should i put it in bitcoin or ether i've heard they're both great what's the allocation i i've had this question asked me multiple times and i always give two separate answers and i and i tell them both answer answers the the first answer i say is do a 50 50 split uh because you know the the only two crypto economic systems that exist are bitcoin and ethereum like it looks like litecoin is also a cryptocurrency in the same category as bitcoin and ether but it's really not and i explained to them why i explained to them that okay so the very very core principle of every blockchain is that there's demand for block space and only these two blockchains are are generating any amount of fees which illustrate that there is only these two blockchains that have demand for block space and i'm pretty easily able to illustrate that to a newbie and i just tell them that there's only two blockchains that have scarce block space and that's what's really important and so a 50 50 split into bitcoin and ether is a 50 50 split into the two blockchains that are actually real blockchains uh and then i tell them what my portfolio is which is a hundred percent into ether and then i explained that you know bitcoin is an asymmetric bet versus the world but ethereum is an asymmetric bet versus bitcoin uh in my opinion uh and so i tell them like those are those are the two somewhere between those two answers is a good place i think i i totally agree i don't i don't have a strong opinion on um you know for for people who are new to the space on what percentage to allocate to what it it it depends on risk tolerance what i what i do have a strong opinion on is you know trying to keep them away from xrp the standard and i definitely do that in all of my advice but everyone's going to find the right the right answer in terms of allocation between those two and it really depends on what you think about the future and your risk tolerance and where you want that asymmetric upside both good stuff all right we should why don't we get into it then today but before we get into the topic of memes which is super exciting crypto has the best memes by the way uh let's talk about our sponsors so this is for our us listeners primarily this first one is rocket dollar if you have an ira or a 401k it's probably jailed in your brokerage that means you can't access crypto very easily you can't use that money and buy eth or bitcoin on coinbase the thing you need to do is break it out of crypto jail so that you can buy bitcoin and eth on the spot markets um if you try to do it in your brokerage you're gonna get ripped off it's 4x the price right now you need to go to rocket dollar they can help you with the paperwork i've done this with two of my iras it's called a self-directed ira it is kind of a magic button for this and they can break your retirement count out of brokerage jail help you buy that eve help you buy that bitcoin you can go to rocketdollar.com and use the code bank list to get 50 off uh that's the best deal you're gonna get on this and uh they can help you up get you set up it's rocketdollar.com all right our second sponsor monolith if you want to have a little bit of ethereum in your pocket you need to get your monolith defy card the monolith defy card is a visa card that looks like all the other visa cards that you've ever owned except the difference is is that there's ethereum inside of it last uh last episode we talked about uh the different m1 m0 the monetary layers of ethereum dye is ethereum's m1 and the monolith d5 card allows you to tap into ethereum's m1 wherever visa is accepted basically all over the world so go to monolith.xyz to get your defy card this is specifically for our european listeners at the moment but when they come to america you know i will be the first to sign up and so if you want to spend your die and put some of the world's economy onto ethereum it is your duty to go to monolith.xyz and get your d5 card so you can spend your die out in the real world i think that crypto has the best memes i think there's a lot of compacted wisdom i think you can be taught the ways of crypto and the wisdom from previous generations through some of these memes and there's other memes that you should be wary of we're going to talk about that today in our meme episode but we should start maybe with uh with a definition david because when people hear the word meme i told my wife we were going to do an episode on memes and she was like what like you know those internet jokes like what what's a meme though david i'm pretty sure a meme is a gif with text on it or a still photo and it's a funny joke that makes me blow around out my nose is that what a meme is yeah that's what she thought right so that's that was exact that's the common definition that's what we think of when we think of a meme but the the idea of a meme in mimetics was actually birthed in the 1970s by a gentleman by the name of richard dawkins which we'll get into in a little bit um but what a meme is more fundamentally it's not a gif it's not just an internet joke it is a thought or behavior that spreads within a culture so a thought or behavior that spreads within a culture so memes can be images memes can be behaviors learn traits behaviors memes can be slogans they are compact units of information that have an aspect of virality and they become pretty powerful because of the most important and most interesting large scale communication tool that humanity has ever devised which is the internet that is essentially a meme propagation tool what else does it mean david yeah memes go all the way back uh the whole idea of how to conceptualize a meme should kind of relay itself as a mind virus uh so you can go all the way back to like um just religion and and spirituality as like kind of the early semblances of memes people believe in religion they have belief or have faith in this idea or concept and then they share that with others and so this idea spreads from brain to brain and lodges itself in there so like i mean a meme is very much like a virus in that it's it packages up information and then it is easy to spread and share and so that's why the internet and memes are actually so well intertwined because the information the internet is a platform for free and cheap data proliferation and a meme is a small bundle a small little packet of information that goes from brain to brain and it's something a good memes there are definitely good memes and bad memes right good memes are things that are easy to understand and that everyone can relate to and that's why memes on the internet which we often think as jokes or you know little cartoons or pictures or gifs the reason why good memes spread and bad memes die is that good memes are relatable everyone can immediately understand a good meme and the bad memes are the ones that people don't understand and so a meme is this thing is this culturally relevant thing that is spread that we can all look at and be like haha i relate to that and bringing this back to like today's context money printer go bur is something that is a funny packet of information that is easy to spread and all of us can relate to it right now because we are all looking at the money printer going bur at this present moment and that's why money printer go bur it communicates a ton and it's easy to spread and it is the current topic of conversation and the internet is proliferating that right now the cool thing about that meme too is the money printer go bird like i mean who created it we have no idea no idea i mean it it's it's something that really emerged out of our collective conscious but there was probably somebody out there right one person or maybe a bunch of people at the same time who came up with that idea and that's why memes are so interesting is because they're essentially a decentralized system uh just like cryptocurrencies are decentralized and permissionless anyone can create a meme you don't have to ask permission if you want to create a new word for example and you know words language those are meme expressions as well if you want to create a new word you don't submit a form to webster's dictionary and have them add it right it's more like webster's dictionary has to catch up with the words that humans create and they add new ones every year and so all of these words are created by individuals in a permissionless way to describe something and the way they propagate is other nodes on the network other humans brains have to actually download the meme and accept it or reject it and so it's decentralized and permissionless in its creation but it's also decentralized in its uh propagation humans can decide whether or not to accept a given meme and if they reject it you know then it's it's kind of gone if enough of them reject it it's gone but if enough of them accept it it becomes established and that it can become even embedded even deeper into the fabric of society as well yeah 100 and and making this a little bit more tangible i want to turn to richard dawkins in his book the selfish gene where he talks about the fundamental base layer of any human is one gene right and all these genes connect to other genes to create your dna well what is what is the cumulative human body is just a collection of genes and each gene is something that is trying to get itself replicated and shared over and over and over again and the idea of the selfish gene is that each gene is motivated it's it wants to survive and it needs to survive by a being a good gene something that is beneficial to survival so you know this this particular gene makes you more muscular it makes you run faster it makes you think better these genes survive and they spread and they spread in the physical world via reproduction and memes are the same thing but memes are this intangible layer on top of consciousness right like memes require consciousness we all need to be able to understand and spread information and so memes are like genes except they are part of the culture they're part of the information that we share and understand as a culture so memes are really spread across time across people in specific cultures memes are really the genetic makeup of culture yeah there's definitely an element of survival of the fittest for memes memes can have a life span so you know some last days weeks months some last years they cannot also mutate so they can become other things and they absolutely have to survive in their environment or they die but the ones that do survive the fit ones they can become almost a uh a shelling point of sorts um david maybe you want to describe what a shelling point is yeah sure so i'm gonna give you a list of three numbers ryan and uh i want you and the listeners to all pick the same number are you ready yeah let's do it 7 342 204 1. now i want all the listeners to pick one of those three numbers i got mine you got yours yep okay was it one yep yeah and i bet all the listeners uh also probably picked one and so that's what a shelling point is if if you the idea of a shelling point is it's this point that we all can agree to choose without actually needing to communicate with each other and so this actually is very relevant to things like game theory this is a shelling point is how you break the prisoner's dilemma if you have a shelling point between you and your other prisoner you can coordinate without having to communicate and so shelling point is something that just people automatically choose as defaults just because of what it is yeah do you want to know why i picked one why'd you pick one i mean it's first of all it's the easiest to remember right the other ones were not i can't even recall them now you just said it and i can't recall the first two but the second thing and i think this compounds it if you were to ask the question now ryan what which of the three numbers do you think everyone else is most likely to pick right then it would have been hands down the number one because you know that that that it's obvious i think memes are very like some some memes are very obvious in terms of which which ones individuals and humans would prefer and i think that's an example of that and some of these you know become so deeply embedded into our society that we don't even notice them you know they're just like they're just like common sense you know some of them some memes even can become so embedded they become almost institutional right there is a a gentleman who wrote one of my favorite books um you've read this too david the book sapiens eval harari and he talks about human beings as a storytelling species one of the big distinctions from kind of the animal kingdom all of humanity's sophistication its civilization its society maybe is partially rooted in its ability to share stories and to believe in those shared stories he calls them shared narratives or he calls them myths and that's what human beings are really great at we're like biologically adapted to share stories and to believe in myths and once society shares these myths once there's a collective belief in these myths they can form some of our most important underlying institutions and technologies when i say technologies i'm not talking about you know technologies like computers and science and advanced technologies i'm talking more about the the softer technology that is underneath all of our civilization and all of our society you know things like money things like government things like um you know the the constitution as an example of a protocol technology we've talked about uh several times so these things become embedded and they become almost common sense and they become almost indisputable they win these like network effects within a society and they're very difficult to change at that point and we don't even notice that we believe in these shared memes we just operate as if everyone else obviously does the cool thing about memes and the inside of the context of humans telling stories is that you know we tell stories to pass information right so like ryan i know a secret that this grocery store down the street actually has toilet paper in stock so you should go take advantage of that but me do you really yeah no that was just i just made that up okay cause i need some toilet paper uh but memes are a way of our ancestors to communicate with the current set of people it's a communication mechanism across time in the same way that money is actually something that develops across time memes and information cross across time as it's shared by culture to culture and that's really why the bible is actually so incredibly important as a log of memes the bible is this book that is a fable of stories it's a set of stories that are supposed to teach you a lesson and that lesson is so in the the bible is just this collection of short stories and and and lessons to be learned that can be shared and propagated as memes so the bible's just this mean book it's this mean book of sharing all the important things that our ancestors have learned that is worth transcending through time absolutely it's it's all the memes are the wisdom of our ancestors the wisdom of humanity really like passed down to us from generation to generation um very powerful oh you know i am i had a friend of mine who um said you know when asked like what's the meaning of life he said two things to spread my genes and to spread my memes you know like i i don't know if that quite does it for me as far as like life fulfillment um but there is an element of truth that those are the two things that that human beings biologically do and they really do well so if you were to like ask an alien what do humans do the alien might say something like that well they spread genes right biologically and then they spread memes which are these societal beliefs and through those two things they've actually become pretty powerful because memes are incredibly incredibly powerful right um you know um they're almost like a way to program a society they're um also a superpower is that they're reflexive in nature uh some of them anyway um do you know what i mean by reflexive um i could use some elaboration so some memes are powerful and um become more powerful and more true the more people who believe they're actually true i'm not sure if this is a property of of all memes but it's certainly uh true of of some memes like the meme of money you know something becomes more like a money and exhibits higher moneyness when the more people believe it's a mummy it's a money and so this like this this feedback loop of you you believe the meme and you get other people to believe the meme and the more that they believe the meme the more the meme actually becomes true and then the more people who believe the mean there are a few memes like that that can become incredibly powerful because they're reflexive in that way and they also can exhibit really high network effects so once a money becomes embedded like the us dollar for instance it's now an embedded money meme it's really hard to disrupt that and it's really hard to you know because you essentially you have to get all of the other nodes on the network these are human brains to go you know replace their money meme with another meme and typically that happens over decades and generations which is incidentally why i think we think that the crypto movement is not going to happen overnight right um the the money meme actually has to shift some of this will be generational change this will play out over decades yeah absolutely so speaking of crypto why are we talking about memes ryan like what does this have to do with anything well okay so i think that uh one of the most interesting ways to actually learn crypto is through the memes that folks in crypto have created over the years right maybe we should start by talking about some like non-crypto memes first that are really good and then talk about the you know the crypto memes that are also good and have really you know held up well um we talked about money printer go burr right at the outset um how about this meme it's just the flu it's just the flu bro yeah just the limit just the flu yeah uh that one is like that's like an offensive meme that's a meme that's supposed to make fun of all the other humans who actually do think that it's just a flu and it's it's a shaming meme this meme is this meme is all the people that are taking chronovirus virus seriously and shaming all the people that don't take it seriously hahaha it's just the flu bro like we're all making fun of those people collectively through this meme to shame them into going inside and quarantining themselves like that's what that meme is supposed to do right and it's it's definitely effective in terms of its ability to uh to spread virally right so but but but another i think aspect of a meme and you know that this one is no exception it actually has to uh has to in the long run anyway be true right so you know it's easy to say it's just the flu brah like at the beginning of coronavirus and maybe before the the deaths and the hospitalizations a lot of folks will kind of download that meme and and propagate it but over time if that meme becomes less true and you know we realize that wow our workplaces are closed our schools are closed uh people are dying on mass the mortality rate is higher than the flu then that meme starts to lose its its relevance and starts to die it's it's no longer fit for its environment so it no longer gets passed on and no longer gets embedded in human consciousness and the it's just a flu meme is going is going to die when coronavirus dies because it's just a flu is locked into coronavirus right like we're not going to be saying it's just a flu bro in five ten years like it's only relevant for as long as coronavirus is relevant and so this this is a meme that is good now but it's not going to serve us any purposes later and so you know it's going to you know be eventually a thing of the past into the future absolutely and it compresses a lot in that in that in those four words it's just the flu right um i think actually uh trump is a master meme maker he's created like several memes and i think this is through sort of repetition listening to his audience he's able to do this but it accounts for a lot of his political success in my mind that he's able to get these memes together and to propagate them and compress a lot of information in like three word memes like build the wall or lock her up right like these memes convey a lot of underlying information to their you know the groups who have tribal affinity with them and they're very they're very viral um particularly on the internet uh these quick three-word memes can spread like wildfire and uh propagate very quickly and you know i think politicians some politicians might underestimate the power of memes but we're really living in a meme-centric world now yeah absolutely donald trump's biggest uh you know boon to his success is his mastery of the three-word meme he he speaks simple words in a simple way for people to understand and he really just sets up memes to be born into existence he's a master memester the other really good meme that's outside of crypto that's come out recently that i think is a really good case study is epstein didn't kill himself and this is one of my favorite memes because it just shows the sheer power of the internet where you know the the wealthy and the the elites do their whatever with epstein they they kill him or they they kidnap him or whatever conspiracy theory you believe that i'm on board with uh the internet the internet acknowledges it yeah like while any one person can't do anything we can at least use memes that meme epstein didn't kill himself to create universal recognition without needing to actually like trust the authority or instance of one person statement or whatever the epstein didn't kill himself is the human collective mind agreeing that epstein didn't kill himself and also sharing and spreading that information as a middle finger to the elites that did whatever they did with epstein and so that that meme itself epstein didn't kill himself that means so much more than the four words epstein didn't kill himself right i mean like what what what does that actually mean that it's it's it's more like a um uh i guess you know common man against the plutocrats and oligarchy that is organizing uh society and bending it to their will uh you know it's like it means so much more than the actual statement i think totally it's it's an absolute acknowledgement that this is being covered up by the powers that be whatever those powers are it's an acknowledgement that we don't actually know much more than that but we do know that it is not the only part of the story the least interesting thing about jeffrey epstein is that uh is that he died that's not that's not really the fact that he died is is not the story the story is how he died and how it has been told to us and how we actually think of it and that's the the fact that we have to say what um something that happened didn't actually happen the the epstein didn't kill himself it's the didn't word it's the something else happened and look at that something else all right so david i've got a list of crypto memes here that we should go through some of these have been successful and have held up they've survived they've been the fit ones and they have collective generations of crypto people to um like they're passing down that information from the wise crypto uh people of of ages past others have been unsuccessful um but i want to ask you know what you what what you think each of these each of these mean let's start with the general crypto memes here here's one that i'm sure almost everyone listening has heard of hoddle what does that mean what's the meme yeah huddle came out of this guy i believe on the bitcoin talk forum who was drunk posting during the 2013 crash and he said like [ __ ] it i'm huddling i don't care i'm gonna huddle through uh you know i'm strong strong hodler i'm gonna hold my funds huddle is this call to a lack of action it's where most things are a call to action a huddle is saying hey don't do anything the idea is that there are whales that manipulate the markets there is volatility that will crush your spirits but if you can hold on for dear life which some people think is what huddle stands for even though i think that is something that got appended after the fact that's like a meme that's like a meme within the meme that holds on for dear life like added that later right it's it's a it's a called it's a unifying rallying cry that we are all going to hold and we are all going to be the buyers of last resort the whole a common thought experiment i like to run with with people that think that bitcoin can go to xero is that if bitcoin does go to zero there will be so many buyers that it can't be at zero and if you are a hodler you are saying that you will buy bitcoin and hold it no matter what the price you will buy bitcoin at one thousand dollars you will buy bitcoin at five hundred dollars you'll buy it at one hundred you'll also be buying it at 100 000 and you will hold that [ __ ] until the end it's basically saying that you are you are in bitcoin until it either goes to the moon or it crashes and burns and you are going willing to do one of those two things and i don't think it has to be just applied to bitcoin it can certainly be applied to other you know crypto monies who face this kind of volatile volatility but certainly birthed in the bitcoin community the bitcoin community is fantastic at memes it's got a celebrated history but yeah i uh i totally resonate with this meme like i think it's true and i think it's useful advice for people who are just entering crypto um you know it kind of sounds stupid it kind of sounds silly but like huddle it's you know when price drops 90 right in a in a bear market which it can tend to do in crypto the volatility is intense or or 50 in one day i mean that happened two weeks ago uh you don't panic you huddle i think that's uh that's sound advice and something that crypto newbies could learn from for sure how about this one that applies to you know all crypto as well uh number go up number go up is a great meme uh so the very surface level of this meme is a communication tool to newbies saying that we are here for number to go up we are here to get rich we are here to get wealthy we want our own personal finance number to go up and we do that by buying crypto and holding it now there's actually so much more to this if you peel back the layers because a lot of people and me included believe that the fundamental objective of these cryptoeconomic systems is for number to go up if ethereum succeeds in pulling some of the economic activity from the banks from the central banks from the member banks from payment merchants that are charging three percent on every transaction if ethereum takes all of that business and puts it on ethereum for reduced middlemen reduced fees the number has to go up and that's true because of economic bandwidth so listen to that episode if you don't understand why that directly relates to number go up number go up is a is the number is a metric that measures the success of these things and so when number goes up literally the ecosystem is more healthy security is stronger we have more we have more runway into the future so not only is it illustrating the incentive to buy these things and be a part of the crypto economic system but they also illustrate why it's so important to do that do you know i think um and you know i'll admit uh this was my take on it earlier when i first started getting into crypto number go up at first seems like it's just like a greedy wall street thing to say right like yeah i'm just here for the money basically right i just want the you know it's kind of a brainless like as long as the price is going up i'm happy but the the way you just articulated it is the way i've come to understand it a bit more because the number is essential to the security of the underlying network ethereum as a trustless economic system is a lot less interesting if its market cap is 10 billion versus a market cap of five trillion dollars and that's because at 10 billion dollars it can't be an open financial system for the world you know it can be a niche interesting experiment that a bunch of geeks kind of run but in order to provide the economic bandwidth and the economic security for an entire permissionless trustless open financial system the number has to go up if it doesn't then none of this is really consequential to the world so it's not just a like you know we're greedy we want more so number goes up there is an element of that um but it's also like the health of the system and the impact of the system on the world depends on number go up absolutely the number is a score card it is the high score it's the it's the health report of the system and the cool thing is there's that number can always be higher and the the greediness and how these systems run on greed and how these systems run on people's block folio number going up is the thing that makes these the health of the system also go up these are the same numbers that we're talking about you know i think the bitcoin community is way more comfortable with number go up as a meme than the ethereum community and i feel like the ethereum community should embrace it a bit more and maybe the you know the sweet spot is somewhere right in the middle where you're kind of comfortable with it but you're not like just comfortable with pure unadulterated greed you also have to like build stuff uh that that changes the world too um yeah that's my take on it but let's take a minute and talk about our sponsors david so i want to talk about ave today ave is a d5 protocol that you guys absolutely have to check out it's a way to lend or borrow on ethereum so what does that mean it means you can put dye inside of it so you can take dye that you have which is a staple coin it will magically transform that dye into an asset called a dye that adi is then earning interest for you a fantastic way to get started on on on defy and get started in the bankless path is going to ave and making this happen start lending out die and earning interest on it you can also borrow against your eth in the ave protocol cool thing about it is they offer fixed rate loans so not variable loans that change but fixed rate um developers can check out their flash loan products and and protocols they have recently been integrated into things like defy saver which is a way to help manage maker cdps flash loans are super interesting tech go to ave.com and start depositing crypto and earning and borrowing that's ave dot com aave dot com as you are moving into the bankless world it's helpful to have something that you're familiar with to help ground you in this new revolution xeron xeron.io can be your front page to your asset portfolio instead of logging into your wells fargo or your bank account as you are used to xeron serves that same purpose but for crypto and with a much better user experience and user interface at xeron you can add all of your wallets and then they will be aggregated into a single portfolio of all of your assets from all of your wallets and give you a nice beautiful chart of the value of your assets across time as well as a breakdown of the percentage of your portfolio but that's not all you also have access to a bunch of financial services all in the same spot if you want to exchange one asset for another xeron uses a combination of d5 protocols to make sure that you are making the best trade so you can swap ether for die and it can be routed through uniswap or kyber or 0x to make sure you are getting the best trade on that particular exchange you can also invest into uniswap uh liquidity pools and also lending protocols so you instead of having to go to uniswap.exchange or compound.finance or wherever you want to achieve your financial transactions you can instead just go to xeron.io add all your wallets and do all of your personal finance activity there let's talk more about some more bitcoin specific memes because the bitcoin community uh this is a community of meme masters themselves so let me give you this one uh bitcoin is digital gold yeah so that's another meme for newbies where i think if you talk to some of the more advanced bitcoiners if you will that they will actually push back against the digital gold narrative uh it's a great tool to onboarding people what bitcoin is in relation to other assets you know provably scarce stock to flow you know permissionless uncensorable asset and money that was picked by the people for the people not a money that was uh you know engineered and and captured and put upon by force it's uh to the users of the world and so in that sense bitcoin is digital gold is is a great way to communicate uh something that is very similar to bitcoin that everyone understands so it's easier to get people to understand you know okay what is internet money what does that actually look like uh where where it starts to break down where some bitcoiners will add some changes is that you know we don't actually know what the market cap of gold is but we do we don't know how much gold supply there is but we do know the bitcoin supply and you know if the bit if the gold price goes up well more gold will be mined and added to the supply but if bitcoin price goes up that does not happen and so there are some nuances to this meme that bitcoiners would bring up but uh like as a tool for getting newbies on bitcoin and digital gold is a great me yeah and it's interesting so um you know some people in the bitcoin community early bitcoiners sort of supported this meme and propagated it but it's become more deeply embedded in the institutional world too i was you know looking at some commercials i don't know if you saw these sometime last year from digital currency group and they're literally running commercials talking about bitcoin as the new gold right there they were showing there's this guy with a wheelbarrow of gold bars right and he's running around the street and it just looks ridiculous and they're talking about like look this is the the 21st century this is the internet you know we need a digital gold on the internet so that meme while it started with a small niche group of people has kind of spread to be uh adopted really in the in the institutions i mean they would have laughed at it you know five five years ago even and now they're starting to embrace it and i think five ten years from now it'll become even more established in the community that these crypto monies such as bitcoin are like a a digital gold even if even if the technicalities aren't quite perfect it's uh it's been a really successful meme how about this one bitcoin fixes this so this one is one of those that has such a massive amount of information wrapped up inside of it bitcoin fixes this the meme is so aggressively pressed by bitcoiners that they just memed it into reality the idea is that bitcoin can fix so many of the world's problems and if you talk to the right bitcoiner they will take you through a and sometimes a pretty like coherent step-by-step case as to how big bitcoin as a monetary system will lead to the curing of cancer uh this this then they are 100 they are 100 serious when they say this and and sometimes i'm i'm compelled by it as well at least to listen to it the the idea goes like bitcoin fixes the monetary system the monetary the fixed monetary system fixes the financial system the fixed financial system can more accurately allocate resources to different places the places that had previously inefficient capital now have efficient capital allocation and then we can start to actually innovate and build things that we weren't previously able to innovate and build and that's the fundamental uh thesis of bitcoin fixes this you can take any part of the bulk broken economy and and you know it's anything that has to do with inefficient capital allocation and then bitcoiners will say that bitcoin fixes this the the a good example of this is right now is um for politicians inside of the united states they never ever have to talk about fiscal responsibility they can they only can talk about what they want to do for americans and how much money they want to spend because there's no limit on what politicians can spend they can just print money as we have as we are seeing right now the government will just increase the debt ceiling the federal reserve will just print more um print more cash and so the politicians are never really held accountable to what they want to promise and bitcoin fixes this because if the big if the monetary system is not in the hands of the government then and it's in the hands of the people then the government can't print money because they can't print bitcoins and so that's an example of how bitcoin fixes this but when you see it being used on twitter it's three words that are easily shareable that say just like bitcoin solves all these problems bitcoin solves all these problems and the thing is that people actually believe this a lot a lot of people actually believe it so yeah i uh i definitely think there's an element of truth in the bitcoin fixes this meme the the place where i think my my node doesn't fully download it is when it's applied to strange things like uh miley ray cyrus's twerks i heard safety and a moose the gentleman uh the gentleman behind the the book the bitcoin standard um he apparently hates miley rae cyrus and her contemporary dance moves and he thinks that if we uh restored the world to a bitcoin standard we wouldn't have such fiat style dance moves in in contemporary society so that's where the bitcoin fixes this uh loses me i think a little bit and uh sometimes it's it's it's applied in in very strange and odd ways um how about this one i think this is a a pretty smart meme um stacking stats yeah matt o'dell made stacking sats and that is a similar meme to huddle uh stacking sats first it's an alliteration and that means it's good to share and spread because you know you can just hashtag it on twitter but stacking sats it does a lot of things all at once so again memes are little packets of information right so uh not many people know that bitcoin is divisible not many people in the outside world so a satoshi is the bottom most the lowest denomination of bitcoin and if you stack them you get more of them and so it's a reminder that bitcoin it can actually be divided into eight decimals and you want to stack responsibly you want to dollar cost average your buys into bitcoin over time and so you want to stack a small amount of sats together over and over time you want to dollar cost average into the smallest denomination of bitcoin and a lot of bitcoins get frustrated when they are bringing people onto crypto and they they say hey you should buy some bitcoin and then people are like uh bitcoin is really expensive it's eight thousand dollars i'm going to buy this xrp thing it's only a quarter uh and and so sats is a reminder or a teaching tool that you can actually buy a fraction of a bitcoin and one satoshi is actually .001 pennies and so if you liked that xrp asset that was a quarter you'll even love a satoshi which is you know a fraction of a penny yeah it's a really clever meme and i think there's definitely some good advice embedded in it particularly the idea of dollar cost averaging in uh if you're going to buy ether if you're going to buy bitcoin dollar cost averaging in is not a bad way to do it so you stack stats where you stack way it doesn't have the alliteration that's the ether you know lower denominated ether and you do that on a weekly basis that's that's a great way to buy into the system how about the meme of 21 million so that's not only a monetary policy it's also a meme isn't it yeah the 21 million meme uh it's it's more of a hard cap meme right like the 21 million isn't really that special but it's just a reminder that there is a concrete number that can be shared right like you know exactly how much bitcoins there are and you have no idea how many dollars there are so the fact that you can share the number there are 21 million bitcoins and be perfectly correct in that statement also conveys a large amount of information all at once i do think it's useful to have this meme in the bitcoin community as well because it embeds itself as part of the um the social the social fabric and the social consensus layer so that if somebody ever tried to propose a you know 25 million uh hard cap bitcoin or a bitcoin with 21 million plus one percent issuance per year they wouldn't be able to do it because the 21 million meme is so strong and the people who believed in that meme would not download the software and run the nodes so it's it's also important as a kind of embedded in the social consensus layer that ultimately protects these systems at the base level these memes can actually protect the uh the economic security and preserve the decentralization of these systems as well let's talk about one last bitcoin meme because i think it's interesting and then we'll jump to ethereum memes uh and this is the meme of altcoins i view the meme of altcoins as a defensive meme that bitcoin has put in place um you know emanating from you know circa 2013-ish when all of these forks of bitcoin started happening uh and you know the there was the question out there as well if anyone can fork bitcoin anyone can create their own coin then why is bitcoin valuable how could it ever become uh any any sort of money for the world when effectively it's it's subject to unlimited inflation uh when anyone can create their own altcoin and so uh bitcoiners came up with this meme to essentially preserve the uh the notion that that bitcoin was separate it was the the king coin the the real coin the primary coin and everything else was an altcoin uh is the implication and that that meme has been pretty effective i i consider it sort of a defensive meme uh for bitcoin and bitcoiners to you know stand on their guard against any competing monetary coin what's your take on it yeah the altcoin meme altcoin is is if you really want to demean someone you won't call them by their name you'll just call them hey guy like hey dude and then that's what that's what bitcoiners are doing they're just saying like okay that massive pile of just [ __ ] coins let's call them alts let's call them all coins we don't it won't even they don't even deserve a name uh and i i think it started as a practical pragmatic approach back in the early days and now it's kind of been adopted as like a like you said an offensive strategy from bitcoiners uh to just attack the legitimacy or viability of all these other systems uh however i kind of agree with that like we should probably just not not like xrp the standard doesn't deserve a name like we don't need to name it um and so a lot of these things like all these small small little chains like bitcoin gold litecoin they're not even worth talking about at some point in in their progression i i don't even i don't even bother to talk about bitcoin gold except to talk about how it's it's a fork that's failed um when we talk about ethereum like i don't even consider ethereum in the same league and so a lot of bitcoiners will will say that ethereum is an alt but to me an alts on ethereum is any erc20 token and if the ether is the only real asset on the ethereum network everything else is an alt to ethereum so it really depends on your perspective right yeah absolutely and i i do think that um ether is sort of fighting to become not uh an altcoin in the eyes of of bitcoiners who will continue to play that defensive offensive strategy of of calling it a an altcoin uh in my mind it's kind of clearly not um bitcoin and ether are kind of the the most widely accepted and spread monetary assets and maybe everything else at some level competing for that is an altcoin at this stage um that's my take on it but let's talk about some uh successful memes in ethereum so this is one that you created um which is is it's kind of interesting like you're the the author of a very successful ethereum meme the meme of money legos can you talk about that yeah everyone knows legos right so we all no one needs to have it legos be explained to them and we all understand money right so money is not something that we really need explained even though it turns out we do but at a high level we all know what money is and so what happens when you take money and legos and you put those two visualizations in your brain together you kind of get this view of this like open landscape you you have this floor you have all these legos on the floor and you have this all the space to build and now you just want to build something except now on ethereum we're doing that same lego activity that we all did as a child that we're all familiar with but now we're doing it with money and so somehow the light money lego's meme regardless of whether you understand ethereum or not you get this image of constructing things with many different parts and you can reorganize and reorder and recombine these money legos into different structures and sometimes those structures are just a pile of garbage where it just makes no sense but sometimes those structures are you know skyscrapers and cars and you know airplanes and whatever you can really construct and so the money legos meme illustrates that ethereum is this open sandbox environment for creation of an integration of many different parts and it all has to do with managing money these are financial structures these are financial things that are being built and combined together and the more legos you have the more possible opportunities there are so the more different legos that are designed the more tools you have in your toolbox to build some new structure and all of that is wrapped up in two words which is money legos yeah i think it's a super successful meme and and also it has a you know a high degree of visual componentry to it i've seen uh people take that meme and create physical legos with different d5 protocols um on it and sort of stack those up uh do that do that in physical form but also do that visually in graphics and it's super effective to convey the composability aspect the ability to string these d5 protocols together and create really interesting new money systems and economic systems let's talk about a another ethereum meme that i think has been somewhat of a fail i'm i'm interested in getting your take but that's the meme of ethereum is a world computer uh what's your take on that yeah it it uh it was created before we really knew what ethereum is or is going to be and so it was this kind of shot in the dark illustration of what ethereum is it is this computer that is this single global computer that can be accessed from anywhere however that kind of makes more questions than it provides answers like what does that mean is there only one computer is that's everyone's using the same computer how does that work what does this computer even do why do i need a global computer instead of the computer at home what's the benefit of a single global global computer versus you know just seeing the the one that i'm used to or the phone in my pocket and it doesn't even have any sort of a value component in there as well it was i think the world computer meme was created before a lot of people accepted that blockchains and crypto protocols are inherently about money and value management i think a better meme would be a world economic computer but again that doesn't really illustrate much that kind of just is is something for people that already understand not for people who are looking to gain an understanding yeah i totally agree i i think the meme was uh best best exemplified in a contrast versus bitcoin so with bitcoin on the network there's not a lot you can do with bitcoin you can't you can't program it um it's it's more like a calculator but with ethereum that has the ability to you put you can you can create programs inside of it there's almost uh uh it's almost the difference between a calculator and a smartphone in terms of different applications that can be created money applications that can be created inside of it and that way it's it's kind of a bit more like a computer versus a calculator but then people started taking that too far and they started thinking that ethereum would have the capabilities of a um a cloud compute system like amazon web services aws uh and would be this decentralized internet platform and and in my mind anyway that meme kind of led people astray into this web 3 vision of a decentralized internet which is probably years away what ethereum is really well suited for today given its its transaction throughput is is relatively slow is not a replacement for amazon web services and in cloud compute but as a replacement for traditional financial settlement layers like like fedwire and like our central banking system and at some level like our um commercial banking system so yeah a partial fail and i think the meme has has died a little bit over the last couple of years but let's talk about a meme in ethereum that has maybe had a bit of a resurgence or a renaissance or any kind of a new creation that's ethan's money so ethan's money came out of the very the very beginning came out of this uh bitcoin boom conference in texas i believe where michael goldstein who is a bitcoiner of bitcoiners was presenting uh kind of as we are now presenting the bitcoin memes and the strategy for marketing bitcoin for quote unquote memeing it to the moon uh and this is a this is the strategy that many bitcoiners have believed uh is how bitcoin will become successful is that all the bitcoiners are going to chant the bitcoin memes until the whole world gets it and then bitcoin will be worth a trillion dollars and so during this presentation michael goldstein was talking about this how how we are going to meme bitcoin into existence and he went through the the general principles of you know the components of memes and how they spread uh and and he also at the same time uh was poking fun at other communities who can't meme very well which is something that you'll see on crypto twitter and in crypto debates where you know one side will call the other side bad memers and that's a huge insult because if you're a bad memer you're not your crypto chain isn't going anywhere and so meanwhile michael goldstein points his finger at the community at the ethereum community and talk about how they're bad memers and that they they're going to fail because they can't meme anything into reality and then he also provides this recipe for how to meme something mainly three words good was the thing that came out of of his hit was his big lesson and so ryan you watch this and be like wow thanks michael bitstein i'm going to take this and run with it watch this and you go etha's money and then and then this what i just think has happened is that you just lit this fuse which has led to this powder keg that michael bitstein left and the powder keg is all of these the ethereum community that is looking for some sort of narrative to rally behind about with what ether is and why why we want uh and what its role is in ethereum you and because you created this meme you said ethan's money and you started you started sending that out in through your messaging through your articles through your twitter and then like like clockwork the ethereum community in my head i'm just picturing the sequels from from finding nemo like ethan's money ethan's money ethan's money and that's how it spread and boom eth is money and that's how it got created and now everyone assumes eath is money now there's swag there's merchandise it's on eath hub everyone is repeating etha's money so ryan tip of the hat for taking that that lesson from michael bitstein and running with it do you know i think michael bitstein is a brilliant and many bitcoiners are a brilliant meme artist uh to be honest like his uh his ideas and that presentation are kind of fantastic you know i'm not actually sure if um i was the first to say ethan's money i don't know and that's actually kind of like cool that we don't really know who the originator of it is maybe a bunch of people started saying it at the same time anthony sassiano eric connor uh you know you others i think it was it's kind of a community recognition that hey ethan is not just a gas or an oil um you know that that was an early meme i think from the ethereum as a world computer days it actually has the same cryptocurrency attributes as as bitcoin does it is a hard money it has a supply that's subject to a monetary policy of minimum viable issuance it's being used as a money in the ethereum commodity in the ethereum community ethan's money it's just as austrian an idea and again we're talking about austrian the economist not the country um as bitcoin and so i think that uh some ethereans in the ethereum community were initially resistant to ethan's money because it's not 100 accurate right um eth is not a medium of exchange and a good unit of account right now and it's sort of a very volatile store of value but it does have this monetary premium property and it is the base money of the ethereum community so i think the ethereum community has started to accept the meme and propagate it and it's been successful in disbanding this this notion that eth is just a utility coin and the reason it's stuck is because it's true like you know nodes have downloaded it in their brains and they've accepted it as true and they've decided to propagate it if it wasn't true it would be an unsuccessful meme it would be something like xrp the standard which is a failed meme that will be relegated to the dustbin of crypto history that no one really cares about right now let's talk about another meme so this is the meme of defy and d5 stands for decentralized finance we refer to defy a lot in bankless in the podcast and other places talk about the d5 meme david do you like do you like this meme yeah so i like d5 d5 is great d5 as a word as a four-letter word uh is good for if you already understand what it is if you can hear the words decentralized finance and think of what decentralized finance actually is like maker dow compound die et cetera then you don't need the meme who does need the meme are people outside of crypto that that uh if they hear defy they're like what the [ __ ] is that and then if they hear decentralized finance they're like what the [ __ ] is that uh and so d5 d5 is great as a colloquial tool of spreading communication for people that already understand it i preferred open finance which does start to put some idea of what it is into people's brains that hear it open finance as opposed to just finance implying that normal finance the finance that you're used to is closed finance so therefore what's open finance that was a that's a more uh that's a better packet of information but open finance unfortunately lost uh and defy is here to stay yeah yeah op fi doesn't work i i also liked permissionless finance but that would be pfi and you know no no one wanted to go with that for some reason i don't know just didn't have the meme quality you don't want you don't want dope phy of decentralized open finance look i kind of like dopefy but that didn't seem to stick either and that's the thing with memes is sometimes you just have to capitulate um i totally capitulated on d5 i now i call it defy and even if it's not the most accurate um you know it was a better meme and it won and that's what tends to happen it it survived uh let's talk about some memes that are not winning or are uh maybe dying or are less accurate um here's a meme from the early days in crypto litecoin is the silver to bitcoin's gold what do you think about that mean yeah silver and gold something we can all relate to we all know that if you get first you get silver if you are excuse me if you get first you're you get the gold medal and if you're second you'll get the silver medal uh and so saying that my blockchain x is going to be the silver to bitcoin implies that you know you're not going to be as powerful as as valuable but you'll be still be pretty valuable and so you're worth buying um the way that that breaks down is that bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal points so why do you even need silver in the first place um and so it was a great tool to market litecoin back before we really understood these things but now litecoin and the silver to bitcoins gold is kind of dying uh no one really understands what the value proposition of lightning is when bitcoin both has the super high market cap and lightning network like why do we need it uh and so as as the truth goes so does the meme yeah i definitely place it in the dying meme category though there are still out there some some litecoiners who will tell you that litecoin is silver so there's still a community that stands behind that meme there's not much of a community but there are still some folks that stand by the xrp the standard meme but to me that is a total fail but do you remember in 2017 when that meme was propagated all over the the crypto community are we talking about xrp at the standard absolutely yeah xrp the standard the standard for all banks to use every single bank is going to use xrp it will be the way that banks transfer value between other banks xrp will be the substrate asset for all banks to transfer value and this meme really got propped up by by ripple labs because their whole value proposition was partnering with banks so that they can use the xrp currency and the the ripple labs maliciously or accidentally or naively help to foster that meme they said they released partnership after partnership when banks were really just kind of experimenting they were probably just like yeah go away ripple we'll see we'll try it out and see if it works and then ripple labs goes we have a new partnership and then the xrp army goes xrp the standard xrp the standard in reality banks have no interest in transferring the u.s dollar denominated values inside of a volatile stable cryptocurrency that is used by a handful of people uh but xrp the standard was something that was chanted by armies and armies of people during 2017 and is very likely the reason why the price jumped though to the degree that it did yeah i'm not sure how high in market cap they they got they flipped uh ether a couple of times at least twice and i i know that they got somewhere close to 100 billion at least xrp did it's now and the the problem with xrp the standard as well as the issues you mentioned is that just because even if the the network itself ripple labs network that has xrp on it becomes a standard for banks which again is it doesn't seem to be moving in that direction but even if that occurs you know what's the value accrual mechanism for xrp um that doesn't mean that xrp necessarily needs to be valuable either so i i think that is a dying meme uh but who knows uh some community could adopt it and try a resurgence and uh and fire it up again um hopefully crypto has moved on from some of these failed memes um we should talk maybe for a second about why memes and crypto intersect so much why are they so important in the crypto space crypto is an internet-based phenomenon and remember the internet is a platform for the cheap and free spreading of information and data and information and data is what a meme is and we need these two platforms crypto and memes are using the same substrate the internet to exist and so they already are intertwined by that however at the same time crypto networks are inherently social networks they are propped up by users by people running the node by people mining the chain by people validating the chain by using the chain by holding the assets crypto networks are a very wide collection of different participants and stakeholders but at the end of the day they're all the more humans involved in a network the better and so when a meme is conveying information as to how you should join that crypto network then that crypto network grows stronger the better the memes are and the stronger the crypto network is the better the memes become and this turns into a positive feedback loop in the same way that like religion is a positive feedback loop and they converge upon the large religions and capitalism and communism were mind viruses that that brought on new participants especially throughout the 1900s and in these memes to spread and spread and spread it's now crypto the the turn of cryptoeconomic protocols to be the new meme for the new age technology revolution and that's why crypto and memes in the internet are these three things that are going to help bootstrap themselves into existence absolutely i think people forget that this crypto movement is as much a social technology as it is a software technology and people talk about is crypto money or is it software and my answer is it's both but if you forget one of those two things if you forget for instance the meme quality of it the the social technology aspect of it if you forget that crypto is a lot like writing or language or government or money and you are only uh thinking about the the technology aspect of it the transactions per second on the network you know the details of the cryptography then you miss the point i think this is very much a social technology and a social experiment and a societal change and that's why memes are so important and so essential to the decentralized propagation of crypto even though all of this stuff sounds silly right now the base layer of the social tech we're creating is all based on on on memes and these memes will kind of propagate up they will you know work their way into institutional acceptance wall street will repeat these memes as they've started to do with bitcoin as digital gold it will become common knowledge uh common sense that of course you know this is what crypto is you know these memes are crypto and it will leak in its way into into mainstream that is essentially how good memes propagate and what uh i anticipate will happen with with crypto so we gotta be working on this meme layer we also have to evaluate the memes uh that we see in crypto as as far as whether they're true or not and we need to work on propagating the memes that uh that are true all right david so let's wrap this up so to summarize memes they are thoughts or behaviors that spread within culture they could spread super fast because of the internet they are they when embedded can become the core social fabric of everything that we do as a society they are at the core of crypto as well so you should use the good ones to level up um accept those be careful of the wrong ones uh evaluate each of them one of the things that we want you to do is try to escape mean bubbles that that you might be in that that aren't accurate realize that some of these memes are used to program you to think or to respond in a certain way and check those assumptions at the door so that these are the actions today evaluate the memes figure out if they're true or not figure out what you can learn from them we also want you to go to bankless uh in the app store give us five stars david why are those five stars important man yeah the five stars are super important because they are an impact bankless's rankings when you search for generic crypto turns in the itunes store right now there is this podcast it's called ico 101 and it has i think 43 5 star reviews but it hasn't put out an episode since early 2019. uh i think the content that we are putting out here is much better than whatever ico 101 was doing and we deserve to show up higher than them so if you could please go to the itunes store and give us that five-star review so we can help share the bankless meme we would much appreciate it you know what else they can do they can go to bankless on youtube david you've been putting out some awesome videos in addition to getting the podcast there uh they can also check out some of the videos you've been uploading want to talk about that yeah so all of my articles i have read for you i have the article itself on the screen but i'm reading it as well and we go through the article together i pause them and i share my thoughts as we work through them so if you like to have things spoon-fed to you like me and want me to read the articles right into your ear holes you can go to youtube and do that and also subscribe to the youtube channel give us those thumbs up so we also show up higher on youtube as well so you guys know what to do five stars bankless on itunes check out youtube youtube's going to get better and better as we go you can read you can watch you can now listen to bankless we're going to get it into every hole in your body let's talk about risks and disclaimers eath is risky crypto is risky d5 is risky guys if you're buying eth if you're buying into these memes if you're buying bitcoin uh know that you are going out west you're you're going into the frontier uh there's bandits isn't for everyone you can lose what you put in be careful out there guys we are very excited to be on the bankless journey with you this has been bankless episode five thanks a lot thanks everyone you
