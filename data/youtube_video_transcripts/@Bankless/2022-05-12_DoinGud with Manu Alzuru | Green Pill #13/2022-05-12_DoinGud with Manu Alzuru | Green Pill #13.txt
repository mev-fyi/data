okay you have to fork the project and call it doing super good if you continue to do good um what what is doing good well doing good is um is currently let's say a platform for creators to tokenize their creations in the form of nfts and collaborate with different creators different curators or gallery owners and basically split uh split everything between all the parties but at the same time enable creators to support social costs that they care about and like that hopefully create let's say a more sustainable world and a more interconnected world as well amazing what are your favorite creators on the platform in social causes that doing good has supported so one of the top creators that i am loving is alcoholic who is someone from india who actually paints uh traditionally just with a normal painting but now he's getting into the little space and he's creating beautiful beautiful landscapes um one of my favorite social causes um i would say the malala fund because he's trying to educate women and also um basically help out a lot of people in poverty um and yeah uh there's actually a lot of creators that i that i really like um that are coming to the platform um which are you know creators that really want to do good for this world and are really connected to the to the goal and mission that we have and that's what what doing good is today but the idea of doing good is actually to become a protocol uh for social causes and and basically enable enable us to curate the social causes that are within that within that registry and that anyone any defy any dow any nft project can actually access that protocol as well uh and contribute to these social social causes all of these social causes currently are are are categorized based on the 17 sustainable development goals by the united nations um you know everyone is talking about the problems that we humanity are facing everyone is saying uh climate change and and and this type of thing but there's way more problems than that that we humans need to coordinate for and and yeah essentially uh the doing good protocol would be like a way for all of us to coordinate uh on on on those those specific causes those humanitarian causes that should be receiving some funding amazing yeah i'm just checking it out at uh doinggood.com so d-o-i-n-g-u-d dot com and i i think that like talking about it doesn't really do justice to the beauty of the product a picture is worth a thousand words and you just have some amazing artists supporting some really strong causes uh on the website so would encourage listeners to go check out uh doinggood.com so can you tell me a little bit about so why did you found it i guess like how did you get into crypto and and from from getting into crypto how did that take you to the journey of founding doing good um how did i get into crypto well at the time i was working in a very web 2 company i was working for a venture funded by microsoft and axa the insurance company i was leading the the marketing team as a cmo and also the product team there focused on the growth of the product and yeah basically during that time i had a friend that was talking to me about color coins over and over and over and telling me that everything was going to be tokenized uh to me i didn't understand any any of that like it was like game currency in my mind until he until actually ethereum came out and he showed me a smart contract uh that enabled you to swap assets without having a middleman and when he explained uh the consensus algorithms and basically how it worked it all clicked and i was like wow this is giving freedom to humanity in a way and i want to be part of this um my story my let's say my life story got me into that pretty much because i've been an activist um i'm a venezuelan i was born in venezuela and i was basically fighting for um freedom of speech and for property rights back at home as the government took everything away from my family and and and yeah basically uh to me like this was a way of giving power back to humanity and unless to nation states totally and so you know when you got into crypto i guess i'm wondering the connection between uh property rights as you saw the government taking away property from people and um you know how we kind of have things in web 2 where we're all serfs on zuckerberg's kingdom or land or whatever like blockchains actually give us digital property rights was that a connection for for you throughout the journey yeah definitely so um actually the first thing that i was doing uh in the space was tokenizing real estate tokenizing venture funds and venture capital with a european legal framework so the idea the idea that i had was to enable anyone around the world to invest in any type of physical asset uh using this ledger technology and i work on that for over two years and a half let's say like uh trying like to understand what was going on what's happening but i realized that you know there's there's a lot of laws that don't enable this to to be a reality uh and all of these imaginary lines that we call states or nations uh basically that are not uh aligned and and don't enable us to transact these type of assets in a in a global way um and i thought that i was probably i don't know maybe 10 years 20 years too early so i actually after that i decided to focus on something that i thought was going to make a bigger impact and that's when i really got into the house uh probably like three years three years and a half ago right it's crazy how fast things have accelerated with dallas where they were just this theory three or five years ago and then we had the dao which collapsed and ever since molok dao it's feel like we've had this like exponentially accelerating uh trend of of dallas forming and collapsing and it's kind of this cambrian explosion of of uh of innovation and so i'm wondering you know like against that background what were the insights and like the perfect storm that caused you to found doing good and um you know i'm curious like what how you went from crypto and activism to doing good as as the tip of the sphere for the work you're doing yeah okay that's a really good question so i have to say that it all started with my with my let's say youth so when i was um when i was a kid i got my first computer and and yeah the age of 12 maybe i was i started building websites very shitty ones actually and i was i was buying stuff online uh in the us and also in europe and reselli is reselling it back at home because because there was there was issues yeah and i was doing every trash without me knowing that i was doing every trash yeah so um so yeah that was like the first the first let's say touch with the with the internet and then when i uh when i was in in university i got my diploma as a mechanical engineer and then i got hired by schlumberger which is uh one of the largest oil service companies in the world and when i was working there as a field engineer i realized that that the meta game that nation stairs are playing is basically to create conflict um and basically extract as much as they can from that from that you know and kind of like have everyone hypnotized and not really realizing what's what's happening so for example uh in venezuela like at that time we said that we hated uh the us and that we hated europe uh but at the same time we said that we love uh let's say russia china uh turkey uh iraq iran and we will you know sell petroleum to the u.s that will throw bombs back to our friends so when i realized that i was part of that you know right i was like wow i don't want to be part of this this is this is so bad and that's when i left so and after that when i left chavez died and when chavez died there was like a lot of a lot of things happening in venezuela my friends were protesting and during my university years i was actually like very very active organizing events for people that for people to express themselves and stuff um so when i saw my friends going out to the streets and so on i i went with them and i started to organize stuff until my life got in in danger uh multiple times uh to a point that you know like one of my best friends got killed um oh wow yeah a couple of friends were kidnapped uh put in jail like my cousin got kidnapped and like my life was was was uh in a point that you know i was actually creating a lot of stress for my parents like they were being called all the time telling them that they were going to keep not me or killed me for basically organizing protests against the government so yeah my parents decided to send me out of the country so i came to europe and when i came to europe um my first job was again building websites like telling people that i knew how to build websites and then after that i got hired by rocket internet which is one of the largest uh let's say venture builders in the world and what they were doing they were basically uh copying business models from uh let's say from successful areas and bringing them to new areas and sounds like arbitrage again again it was arbitrage it was exactly arbitrage so initially i was a marketing manager and then a few few months later uh i was leading the mobile for basically kind of like a company that is called jumia and jumia is a it's a marketplace of marketplaces so you have amazon like ebay like uber um booking.com and initially it was focused on the on the travel side and yeah i thought that we were you know creating a lot of value for africans at the very beginning but then i really understood after you know being trained and going and learning about facebook tools and google tools i learned that basically we were colonizing africa with cash um and i felt really really bad about it and that's when i decided to leave and i joined this venture from microsoft and axa that was basically connecting patients and doctors using machine learning and chatbots um and there i thought i was doing something more humane but again with two problems um you know kind of like let me to leave that um right and yeah that's basically how my whole life has led me to always trying to find something that is giving more and more freedom to humans um so for me uh that was that was doused like the initial thing that i said wow this is this is giving some sort of freedom up um after you know after understanding a little bit about cryptocurrencies uh and the freedom is that you could essentially decide what you want to work on and when you want to work on and basically hopefully the community will will notice your contribution and and give you back so to me that was kind of like some sort of freedom uh but um then i when i found any of these uh i realized that there was another abstraction of value that was deeper or like it was giving more power to the individual because before with cryptocurrencies in general like with ethereum and so on like group of group of people could come in and you know write a white paper and basically launch launch something that someone else could support them from the other side of the world um and and then we pass from that to now individuals anywhere in the world can create whatever sort of value tokenizer out there and you don't need to have everyone uh you don't need to uh you don't need that everyone agrees on that specific value you just need one person that that is basically willing to support that value um and to me that was like wow that means that essentially if i value something and someone else around the other world values that same something then it does have value uh and it was mind-blowing for me was like wow this is giving freedom for people to actually create value it's not any more nation-states but anyone can create value uh um and basically represent represented in a digital way so you've got some money but how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping

um to tokenize culture and um culture is an n-dimensional space where you have different values in artistic expressions and you can kind of combine that and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts so were nfts like kind of the light bulb moment that that led to doing good doing goods launch yes well um i would say that we're a combination of things before that i was working during the pandemic um during the pandemic i well let me actually go back before the pandemic we were creating the marketing dial for ethereum and the pandemic happened uh just after if hcc in paris and everyone got sick and like the people that were that were pushing the the the marketing down for ethereum actually kind of like cool off uh their contributions and and yeah also like the market went down a lot and and the idea was to create this marketing dow for the whole ethereum community but it was depending on donations so there was no real sustainable way for that dow to to stay forever um so what happened was that um yeah everyone went to build their own stuff and myself i started to build a platform called five pandemics and fight pandemics was essentially a place to connect those in need of help with those who can provide help and in the right place anywhere in the world and the way that we built this platform was with the community like within race one single us dollar we just got community uh community members contributing to the to the code contribute to the design to the communications the operations and the idea was to actually create a social dial from that that could manage this product but sadly most of the people that contributed to the product were not web3 native so they didn't understand why we needed a token why we needed to manage this they were just contributing to the project out of good intentions they were just contributing because they wanted to do something during the pandemic and they wanted to help others so there was no no like no interest in in governing this uh because maybe there was no enough education uh from my side or maybe i wasn't able to explain explain myself enough like how how we could potentially coordinate this this this mutual aid platform so yeah uh what i saw at that time what was happening with nft is how people were using nfts and i thought okay we can create kind of like a game where people contribute and they receive nfts as a proof of contribution proof of doing something so that's when the idea really clicked because uh what i was while i was building uh five pandemics um i was interviewing a lot of people that were behind non-profits ngos and i realized that most of the people that are behind these organizations are actually artists and actually creators so to me it was kind of weird that it did that it didn't exist uh a bridge between the creator economy and the giving economy or the altruistic economy so that was that was the moment that i that that basically led to the the ideas of doing good and obviously uh this idea uh these ideas of doing good have been you know um fueled by by many different many different ideas uh starting with git coin as well and and with uh common stack and with other let's say other projects that are you know uh that are trying to do good for humanity uh right and also like i i was like meeting more and more people and realizing that that the tribe was there you know that people want to do good and they have really good intentions and and yeah that's what motivated me to to get this this going yeah yeah i mean do you think there's such an amazing uh nascent community of people who are working on regenerative crypto economics public goods doing good and more solar pump type stuff and i think that it's really a growing niche in the community and you know that's part of we wanted to highlight some of these stories on this podcast i guess i'm wondering like what is a world where you were doing good as maximally successful look like like what's different in that type of world versus uh if doing good wasn't there i would say a world without needing to funding social causes because it's already inherited in in the in our system so it's baked in at the base layer of the system correct okay got it um do you think that uh doing good will expand into other mechanisms or is it going to be nfts the whole the whole way down um we're starting with nfts just because as i said i believe that there's uh there's there's this bridge missing between the creators and the social causes which are usually managed by creators but then i believe that we should also uh create tools for managing these social causes like enabling them to govern in a more transparent way and to basically spread that knowledge across other social courses as well so basically opening up uh or making open source doing good or social social endeavors and social organizations right yeah sort of envision a world in which there's multiple social causes um and then there's multiple mechanisms through which you can support them and they're all like we're building this pluralistic civilizational scale uh infrastructure for funding public goods and social causes um and the pluralism there i think is the key that i'm really starting to discover uh is that um giveth and get coin and doing good and radical and common stack and all these other projects like the pluralism and the diversity of mechanisms that support those causes is really important to me so um hopefully we're listening to this in a year or two we've built interoperability between all these platforms 100 i i also believe that you know like we are all supporting each other at the end of the day uh like for example uh five pandemics you know was supported by the community on git coin and we were able to pay we were able to pay for uh the servers using those using those contributions on git coin for example and that helped kick kickstart our our endeavor and from that you know we got the first community members for doing good and so on so we are all you know interconnected in one way or in another for sure and making sure that we can create you know interoperable uh mechanisms between all of these ecosystems i think it will be amazing yeah totally all right well be careful i might make you into a testimonial if you're not if you're not careful i guess i i guess i'm wondering you know how do you keep that optimism alive like when you're grinding on doing good and working on the next release and you know you read the news and something bad has happened how do you keep that optimism alive look i already lost everything you know i already lost everything uh financially speaking when i was living in venezuela i lost also my house my place where i was raised i lost being able to be next to my family i lost the people that i loved the most i lost i lost them uh i lost being close to them at least yeah um so i don't have anything else to lose so i'm just focused on the positive side of things rather than in the negative side of things because i think i believe in a world where where you know we can live without uh without violence and without coercive ways of enforcing things on humans and and yeah i believe in a world where we can live using the energy the the most precious energy to me which is love um and yeah that's why i'm so positive and optimistic nice appreciate that perspective um i guess is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say about the ecosystem about doing good about what's on the roadmap yeah one of the things that is in the roadmap is this multi-gallery ecosystem which will enable communities to come in and curate their own exhibitions or their own drops so for example we're going to have at 8th denver we're going to have um let's say a gallery also a shelling point with you guys we're going to have also a gallery and yeah so enabling that to the broader ecosystem uh is going to be to me is going to be it's going to be great because it's going to create more and more synergies between all of all of us all of the different project projects um so enabling let's say communities that already exist in web3 uh to basically use their tokens and curate uh within our within within our platform would be something that i'm really looking for nice um yeah excited to see that roll out um i guess where can people find you online um they can find me on twitter on telegram instagram whatever um just write my first name and my second last name is m-a-n-u manu and then al-suru a-l-z-u-r-u manu al-suru and yeah basically anywhere you can find me you can find me with that nice all right man i'm looking forward to hanging out with you at east denver and to building this better world together so thanks so much for coming on the show thank you so much for having me here man [Music]
