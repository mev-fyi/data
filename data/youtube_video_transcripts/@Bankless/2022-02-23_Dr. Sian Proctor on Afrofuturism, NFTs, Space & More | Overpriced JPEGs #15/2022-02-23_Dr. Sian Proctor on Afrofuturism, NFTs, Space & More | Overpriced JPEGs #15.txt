think about how do you create the jedi metaverse just equitable diverse and inclusive it starts by creating your space into a jedi space you're a metaverse into a jedi space [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and i am coming at you from eath denver where i am having so much fun i i cannot tell you all how amazing it has been to run into listeners of this show to get to meet you guys in person to meet everyone who's here in person this is just such an amazing space full of truly special people and it's just a joy to meet everybody i've like said this to people that i've met here but i've worked in a couple different industries in my life and so when in the past i would go to like industry specific events or parties or whatever i like always had this feeling of like god when can i get out of here i don't want to talk to people here and i have the opposite experience whenever i get around a bunch of web 3 people where i just want to talk to everyone and i'm so grateful to get to be a part of this so with that mushy love fest out of the way i want to get into today's episode in which i talk to dr cyan proctor dr proctor is a geoscientist an explorer she's an artist and she's an astronaut she's the first black woman to pilot a spacecraft into orbit and she's also the first person to bring nfts into space so we talk about dr proctor's journey to nfts and web 3 what it really is to be an early adopter and be interested in new frontiers because i think there are a few people i've ever had the privilege to meet who have explored as many new frontiers as dr proctor and uh i was really excited to talk to her about her art uh dr proctor launched an nft called seeker uh last year i hope i got that right um and just had a new collection come out it should be yesterday by the time this episode airs and she works in a style of art known as afrofuturism which i wanted to understand better from her perspective and as an art genre in general my friend and colleague kai turner and other folks that i've seen on twitter have been talking about february as black nft month in honor of black history month so i really wanted to learn more about some of the black specific art styles that we've seen come out in the nft space and dr proctor was generous enough to share some of the other black artists that she loves and and that others should check out and follow so of course dr proctor is an astronaut and i also asked her about aliens and if they're real and what she knows on that front so if you also love the alien conspiracy theories as i do stay tuned for that and on that note i want to say thank you to bankless of course for making this and all episodes possible and to our amazing sponsors

overpriced jpegs today's guest is dr cyan proctor dr proctor is a geoscientist she's an astronaut an author an explorer and for our purposes she is the first person to ever run an nft auction from space so dr proctor i am so excited that you're here so excited to to talk about your background and your new foray into nfts thank you for coming on the show thank you for having me i'm really excited to be here let's start with your background uh because while i want to make sure we're talking lots about nfts and the metaverse and all that good stuff that you're now into your history is amazing and would love for you to give folks a little bit of a sense of of how you got here yeah so i i was born on the island of guam because my dad was working at the nasa tracking station during the apollo missions so i grew up with a lot of space memorabilia and just this love of aviation exploration and space and and i wanted to be a fighter pilot and an astronaut when i was a kid then you know things happen and life changes and so i went off and became dr proctor i got my i'm a geoscience professor at maricopa community college district and i just went off and kind of did my exploration thing and just loving earth and traveling and doing all those things um and then but i always had that you know that love of of space and so covet happened and i couldn't travel which was my number one hobby like a lot of people they turned inward for creativity and i became a space artist and poet during that time and it just so happened that they were also looking for the first all civilian crew to go to space and i won a seat called the prosperity seat um on a spacex dragon capsule and it was part of the inspiration for mission the alt first all civilian mission to orbit and i became the first black female pilot of uh of a spacecraft in history during the mission and and i also um brought nfts to space with me i brought art to with me um and and that's how i got into the nft space was as an artist and a poet actually going to space so i'm going to ask maybe a surprising question but i'm curious like because i'm really interested in people who are early adopters to things and sort of that's what we'll get into that when we talk about your work in nfts and obviously you're like a new frontiers person in in so many areas why why did you want to be a fighter pilot when you were younger like what drew you to that what do you think it is about sort of like who you are as a person that is drawn to these new frontier areas you know that's a good question i was always very independent but i just remember from an early age looking up and loving planes always trying whenever i heard a plane in the sky i had to kind of like try to figure out could i identify it my dad bought me binoculars when i was 12 so i could look for airplanes and and i i just one of those things where i can't explain it if it was just you know somehow tapping into my future of being a you know pilot of a dragon spacecraft or not but i just was always just wanted to be a pilot and then you know when i was 16 top gun came out and that was all the rage and so you it was but it was funny because um i didn't even realize that there were no women fighter pilots because i want to be a fighter pilot and i then my parents never my parents never discouraged me my dad instead encouraged me and said yeah you know here's the civil air patrol if you want to you know learn about military and and want to think about going to the air force academy but back in the 80s if you wore glasses you weren't going to be a fighter pilot anyways and so um i got glasses when about the age 15 16 i got glasses and you know i knew that was not going to be for me but my dad instilled a love of of science in me and i was an explorer and like you said an early adopter i was always kind of pushing the edge and seeing what can i do uh next and and so that's just been a part of me my entire life and so your journey is you wanted to be a fighter pilot you had this fascination with space growing up you then realized or that that door kind of closed to you because you've got glasses and that disqualified you from going to be a fighter pilot or being into the air being in the air force and so you went and studied uh geoscience is that the right way to phrase that you went and got sort of multiple science and math degrees and then uh almost became an astronaut through nasa was like a finalist you know maybe tell that story a little bit and then uh when when that didn't fully come to fruition then you went and were an analog astronaut which i want to talk about what that means but so tell that part of the story in terms of applying to nasa and then becoming an analog astronaut yeah so i you know i at 1918 going off to college didn't know what i wanted to do my dad passed away when i was 19. but i i always had a love of science so i got an environmental science undergrad degree then i went off to arizona state university to get my master's and phd my master's in geology my phd in science education because i knew i wanted to be a teacher a community college professor by that time and and i was kind of living my life and then you know in my late 30s i got the opportunity to almost become a nasa astronaut down to that yes no phone call and and then it was a no and you're like oh my goodness this is my last chance and and so you have to kind of keep moving forward so you i started thinking well if i can't go you know the space how can i still advance human space flight here on earth and that's when i became an analog astronaut and they're basically people who live in moon and mars simulations and and so i was living in the high seas habitat back in 2013 for four months investigating food strategies for long-duration space flight for nasa and that just kind of you know it allowed me to basically go to space camp as an adult which i you know wanted to do as a kid and and uh and i loved it um and you know just kind of again keeping that hope alive that well maybe if i keep training and keep working at it one day maybe i'll be able to go to space and then you did is so exciting how does going to space change your perspective on life oh well you know it definitely is been the biggest thing of accomplishment of my career to have that global perspective uh both as a geoscientist and as an artist and a poet so i've been a geoscientist for you know over like 25 years now and so i've i i love our planet um it's the best place in the solar system but then to win my seat to space not as a geoscientist but as an artist and a poet you know adding this whole kind of new layer or texture to my thinking it definitely gave me this new perspective of the earth because yeah i just saw the earth as this beautiful portrait in motion while i was up there you know looking at it and thinking about how wonderful earth light is and to be bathed in earth light and see our little tiny moon up against our big giant planet from that perspective was was just fantastic it's incredible and i think it's maybe worth clarifying for folks so you piloted this flight that went into orbit you orbited the earth for three days for three days okay which is very different than when you see like william shatner just like take a little rocket up to space like this is you know i think civilians going into spaces uh become a more normalized concept because of what's happened over the last year with with bezos and spacex and others sort of sending sending people to space but you what you did was much more technically complicated and involved and that's probably worth worth noting yeah that's correct and so you know when the difference between suborbital and orbital is that you have to have a lot more energy um a bigger rocket to be able to go into orbit because you need to hit a velocity of 17 500 miles per hour so you're really moving and and then you have to dissipate you have to take all that energy back out when you come back into the atmosphere and when you do a suborbital flight you don't have that um you don't have the speeds and you don't have the same dynamics and and so we went up to space for three full days and so we were living working playing up in space were you scared at any point no you know i was people ask me that and not not for the the actual space mission going up i was more afraid that uh something was gonna go wrong wrong before i got to lift off and so you know it's one of those things it's i kind of say it's like winning you know being selected for the olympic team and everybody congratulates you oh you made the olympics you're like whoa whoa i still have to win the gold medal and so he gets he gets elected and you have six months of intense training and the thing about it is like spacex made it clear that you know you may have won this contest but you have to earn your seat so to become the mission pilot i'm not i'm not an engineer i'm not i have my pilot's license but flying a cessna 172 not the same as flying a dragon capsule and so i had to qualify for that and then you're also doing things where you could get hurt and it's during covet and all of these things you can't have go wrong because if you do you guess what they're flying sandbags in your spot you know like they're replacing you and and so i was really more concerned that um something would go wrong and it would be taken away from me and you wouldn't get to go at all i mean gosh that's such a testament to what like an adventurer spirit you have and that this is such a childhood dream because i would be like just praying that something happens that means i don't have to go up to space like i'm a bit of an early adopter but like solidly on things here on the ground on planet earth like you know play the game of like would you up to space if you could i'm like nope you know like when it becomes like driving to the supermarket that's when i'll i'll head out but i'll let let people like yourself sort of take the early risks which i'm just so in awe of that okay i have to ask you a question because i believe you appeared on an episode of genius by like stephen hawking's show talking about sort of like extraterrestrial life and aliens so like what are the secrets there are there aliens like have they come to earth and this is all like a big secret being hidden by the government like what can you share with us on this very critical talk well i would say you know being on that show um genius by stephen hawking it's episode two are we alone was fantastic and you know i i want to believe you know i think that you know just like in the movie contact one of my favorite movies when jody foster says it you know it'd be a an awful waste of space if you know other intelligent life didn't exist out there um i definitely was looking for it while i was up there and unfortunately the only intelligent life i found was our you know humanity us and um and then as far as you know uh aliens being among us down here on earth shoot come visit me if you are i want to have a conversation you know i'm completely open to the idea but i haven't had any experience in that area and as a scientist i remain skeptical until i have the experience the data to back it up fair enough okay let's get into the nft art part of this and and your sort of passions so walk me through how did you first hear about nfts and get involved with nfts well you know it's kind of interesting because um i i was doing art and poetry uh and just kind of like physical art pieces drawing paintings things like that and then i won my seat and it just so happened that the person who does the back end for all of spacex's launches is um kyle schimber is his name and he's part of the company called subtractive and so i ran into kyle and i'd known him from yuri's night celebration and he was like hey cyan and we started talking and he knew about nfts and the fact that we were doing this fundraiser for saint jude children's research hospital so inspiration for not only were we going to space for three days but we were trying to do the largest fundraiser in their history with a 200 million dollar raise and and i was talking to him about how i had a peace seeker that was a physical piece that i was going to bring to space with me and then donated to saint jude for auction and then he said well how about nfts and i said wait what are nfts and then you know um him and my friend mike kind of broke it down for me about you know how my art like as an artist i can have control over my art in the digital space and then um kyle uh we were talking about how we could raise money for saint jude and he said well we should do a fundraiser um of nfts while i was in orbit and so we would get um you know actually he reached out to artists for one of ones and you know we ended up raising over four hundred thousand dollars and so the three days that i was on orbit was the three days in which the auction was live and people could go and bid on these one-of-ones and uh and again it was extremely successful in fact the patch that we made the animated inspiration for patch um had the largest um you know sales of any like one piece um in origin protocols history uh what does that mean what is the inspiration for patch so we we have a logo a patch that we was created for our mission and and that got animated into an nft and then that was made available um through the website nft.goingtospace.com where people could not only bid on the one of ones but they could also buy you know as many editions of this animated animation of the patch as they want it and i believe they they sold like over 60 000 of them and in just an incredible um you know experience that's amazing so let me break this down so so inspiration four which is the mission that you piloted that orbited space they had had a mission from the outset which is to have this saint jude's children's research hospital fundraiser tied into it and the goal there was to raise did you say 200 million dollars that's correct and did they hit that goal overall we hit 240 million dollars oh and so by the time we splashed down we had hit 200 million and then with all the things that we took to space and the fundraising we added another actually i think we're over 50 another 50 million so i think we're officially over 250 million that's incredible and so and then your piece of this specifically was that you had you had this work called seeker which was a physical art piece that then you learned about nfts and you said let's make this an nft i believe you had folks from spacex like animate and and put music to it that was really cool if you want to speak on that but but you have this peace seeker and it sold if i'm not mistaken for a hundred thousand dollars is that right or was it bought in east then well there was two things that happened so we when we did the when we knew we were gonna do the on orbit auction uh i donated my first ever digital piece so i'd always been a physical artist and then i got on my ipad and i made a piece called my genie and and that got animated by um the people at subtractive and and made it into a beautiful piece that sold as part of this saint jude auction that was on orbit but then i had a physical piece that had this wonderful history because before i even knew that i drew it before i knew i was going to become an astronaut and it's a tribute to where i was born the marianas trench because another former astronaut richard garriott who's the president of the explorers club was going down to the marianas the challenger deep a location the deepest part of the of our planet and he was taking art and poetry with them so i was like oh this is a great opportunity so i drew seeker wrote a poem sent it down with him it came back up and and i had won my inspiration fourth seat and i knew that if i donated that that could be my contribution towards raising the 200 million but before i took it to space another astronaut friend of mine scott parazynski and his wife took seeker the physical piece down to the titanic with them and then yeah so two four two astronauts one to the pacific deepest part of our planet then another astronaut took it to um the most iconic shipwreck in human history uh and then it came back to me and me and my crew took it to space uh and then we all signed the back of it so six you know astronauts signed the back and we donated it to saint jude where it went for auction for a hundred thousand dollars and then me along with the crew at subtractive we turned it into an nft that is now available we just launched it for the month of february it's a it's an addition of 100 and to to mark that amazing you know accomplishment of where this piece has been that's very cool okay so we'll have to link we'll include the link below for folks if you want to go check out seeker the digital you know nft version of this piece that the physical version has been you know all over the world and i'm going to ask you uh in a bit about your advice to artists who want to get into nfts but i think i just want to highlight here i think people maybe miss maybe they don't but how important the story part for art is and having that story and i see artists who get into nfts who are like i'm a great artist like i just want to sell my work and i'm like you are a great artist but the reality is like having a story behind it people understanding who you are as an artist like that's all a part of giving value to something and how humans like imbue value on things and i think this is such a great example of of that like gosh can you find a better story than like this artwork going to the deepest depths of the ocean and also up into space and like that's just amazing um let me ask so when you were first hearing about this concept of an nft from kyle you said correct did it click for you immediately like why this was interesting and why blockchain technology was interesting or like did you have that sort of like wait walk with you that again like who cares like what was your reaction you know it was it was definitely a walk me through this for a moment um because i you know i kind of like been on the sidelines and and thinking about uh blockchain and uh and that whole thing but i but kind of like i don't know how to get into this i don't know what i'm doing and and then but i'm an early adopter of technology i have taught with i you know i've been an educator who's taught online and using i was always the person who was buying the newest software and getting into augmented reality and virtual learning early so when the when this came up and i learned what nft was and how you know how ownership you know worked because um one of the things that i've been doing as a teacher we talk a lot about open educational resources and creative commons licensing and you know the different types of licensing you can have on digital assets that was the job that i was doing right before i got selected to go to space and so um this was really interesting because i was like oh wow we can actually now assign ownership in that digital space because it has been this really interesting free-for-all um and particularly when we're talking about licenses and what teachers can and cannot use and so i was kind of there like but i definitely still needed him to say walk me through this again like because of just knowing i think the most complicated thing for people who are just entering the space is okay you know what what is a what the terminology what is a wallet how many different types of platforms is there what's the difference between um uh you know eath and and um uh just the different coins um a dao i mean there's so many components that you can have and i think that that's where you know having somebody who you can talk to and you trust to lead you through these processes of of getting your wallet set up you know how are we going to promote this you know who are we going to um collaborate with all of those things are important it's interesting to hear and it makes some sense that it sounds like the the sort of initial aha moment for you was understanding licensing and ownership and even if you're talking about cco where you're something in the creative commons like understanding for the first time sort of oh okay here's how this can be applied to digital art because before there was no need for any of that because there was no way to authenticate anything or identify ownerships there was no ownership to give up to the community in the first place because you really couldn't have that and that was for you where you were like okay this is interesting is that uh absolutely that was the click moment yeah because now it's in and it's interesting because it's we're on the cusp of it being just kind of this revolution that's gonna is going through the the digital space um where it's you know any kind of digital asset now can be um assigned to the blockchain and and and not only does that allow tracking but it also allows an ownership but also you know the the royalty that goes along with that right uh and then that adds another whole dimension because now you can you can say this belongs to me and if you want to use it you know here's the you know either creative commons license or for um being able to say i want you to pay this amount or even if you you sell it um that for the rest of your life you can get royalties off of it and that's a big thing for artists um and and i don't think that you know if that gets overlooked a lot when you talk to people about why nfts are so important and what it's doing for the you know independent artists yeah you've told me in a past conversation that actually a good bit of the space community is fairly anti-nft and that surprised me because again it feels like that new frontier thing i would think you know space explorers would be like the metaverse is also a new frontier or you know along those lines um why do you think there's sort of skepticism among the space community around this technology well i think a lot of it is you know that first um misinformation that might come out you know if somebody says oh this isn't very good or you know this is causing you know a lot of harm to the environment or this is a ponzi scheme people tend to latch on to those kinds of things and and then it's hard to it's always hard to break a first impression um because you have to work you know multiple times harder in order to just say no you know the this is what's really happening and and i think part of it is that people today you know they would rather just you know accept what they hear instead of doing the hard work of investigating and learning more and but as what what i'm seeing is that the people who are more negative kind of like comments are dissipating because it's being you know we just had the super bowl and and it was all like you know there's this huge nft theme to it and so people i think are now being like oh wait a minute because it's not going away it's only going to get deeper better stronger all of those things and yeah there are some criticisms to it um but that's what's great about the community and if you get involved you can work towards uh you know mitigating and reducing those challenges you mentioned the super bowl i i was debating asking you this question but since you brought it up i'm going to ask uh i'm assuming you you know the the sales force commercial with matthew mcconaughey and he's like you know i'm a fan here on earth just you know like snarky kind of you know i get it but commercial really taking a shot at both the metaverse and then also at space travel and of course like the dir you know all these billionaires going into space i wondered what you thought about that as somebody who both is a huge proponent of space travel and into the metaverse and nfts like what was your uh feeling about that commercial well you know it's not one or the other you know it can if this is a win-win-win situation like and and we we always think in terms of competition and obviously it was the super ball competition and that there's always a winner and a loser and that doesn't have to be the case we can choose to make this a win-win situation where we are advancing human space flight when you know because as we do that solving for space solves for earth and all of the technology and the efficiencies of space travel if you think about it you have to be efficient in water energy waste shelter all the things that we have challenges here on earth with they're trying to make it as efficient as possible and all that technology comes back and makes us super efficient here on earth because we can adopt it on a large scale and then and then when you think about the you know the metaverse and digital technology and the revolution that's happening in that space and the democratization of you know assets and and finances and stuff again um that's a win uh and and so we get to write that narrative and all of this and and if we just frame it in the right context where it is a win-win and not a competition and we look at ways to make it a what i call a jedi space a just equitable diverse and inclusive space for all of humanity um that's the foundation for moving forward yeah i i heard you make that point about the the technologies that we're developing for space are hugely applicable and helpful here on earth and it was such a like oh my god yeah moment for me where i had never thought about that and i didn't hear it brought up ever in all of the discourse about how dare jeff bezos and elon musk you know go to space and all the problems here on earth and to think like oh gosh the process of innovating there actually does so much for us here i i was just like you know why can't you just go on all the news programs and be the one talking about all this stuff because it feels like it would be such a healthier and more interesting conversation than the one that i i felt like i saw happening it is and and you know and i think that the space community is trying to um and make that narrative um but again it's it's sometimes there's that just that that immediate disconnect of why are we spending all this money out there when we have wicked problems here and again those two things aren't opposed to each other they actually mutually help each other yeah yeah they're complementary and yeah that mutually reinforcing everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland eluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their defy goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes miden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon i want to talk about the other nft projects that you've been involved in uh so mutnik uh people love this it's it's dogs tell us a little bit about muttnick oh i love my muttnix okay so a lot of people don't realize this but dogs went to space before humans did and you know but yuri yuri gagarin was the first human to fly into space out of soviet union and before that they sent dogs they trained dogs to be in the spacecraft and they were they were mutts they were dogs that they found on the streets of you know russia and they took them and they trained them and only the best dogs got selected to go to space so you can imagine these are loyal loving dogs and and we sent them to space knowing that a lot of them wouldn't survive um there were ways in which you know we we basically wrote them off some of them did come back but the muttnick project or cosmic paws dot io is all about bringing these dogs back from history and and giving them a space in the mud a verse and being able to find agency there and and um you know provide uh utility and enjoy and then experience but also thinking about history and how we can take things from the past and bring them forward and shed light on them in a new and interesting way and so what's fun about it is i got my wolf pack um but if you go to cosmic paws dot io they have what's called a do-over generating engine uh or doge and and it's where you get to um create your own mutt neck and so every time you hit um the generate button you don't get you don't mint it it basically generates a new mutt nick in all these different like um costumes and styles and things like that and one of them is spacesuits so i have a collection of my my muttnicks and they all have spacesuits on because you know who doesn't like a dog in a spacesuit and that was what their original purpose was was to go to space and trailblaze is a way for humans and how did you get involved in this project was this this was one kyle and subtractive already had it um and along with mike and just a great creative team and so when we were talking about the projects that you know bringing dog bringing nfts to space and doing the auction um i you know i knew i fell in love with these dogs the moment i saw them so i had to get mine the first one was leica and now they have star and and i was able to bring those nfts the first 100 one that were generated to space with me on my i on my iphone and basically my iphone and my ipad and so it was really cool is this connected to the fundraise in some capacity this was just an independent project where i when i saw it um i was like i've got to be a part of this you know let me start generating and creating my wolf pack and and uh and then how can i help and so they brought me on as part of the team and that's when i was like well let me bring these them to space with me so because it's based on dogs going to space and now i had the opportunity to bring the you know the mother verse version of them to space with me and back max fit awesome when i i should clarify here this is very much not financial advice i don't own any nicks at this point i'm not saying go out and necessarily go buy muttnix but go look at the project if you think it's fun obviously uh you know and i want to say that that uh part of the proceeds from the project actually go to helping real dogs uh in need here um in the present moment and so that's another reason why i do it too because so it doesn't have that i knew i okay and then i really want to dive into the meat of this which is the upcoming nft project you have and sort of your you've got a book that's connected to it and this like afrofuturism which is the style of art that really is is what you mostly work in and explaining for folks what that is and for myself who doesn't know a ton about this so uh talk about the upcoming nft project and and you know sort of all the the components that are connected to that yeah so i consider myself an afrofuturism artist and so that's basically somebody who's gonna explore you know the future of humanity but from this you know afrocentric lens and and for me i think about um us going out in the space and and i i think about it in a couple of different ways and so i have these a couple of signature characters and one is my afro knot which is kind of like this you know faceless um after uh you know astronaut but i call her my afronaut because um not only does she represent me but it's this whole idea of of you it could be anyone in that suit and and is it could it be a person of color and what does that mean and so a lot of the times when i do these this art i also write poetry with it that expresses these ideas and then my other main character is called afro and so seeker has afro-gaya on it and it's afro-gaya means mother earth and and so gaia means earth and so for me it's it's this whole idea of us all being connected um is as part of the living system of earth in the entire earth but also the fact that humans came out of africa and and having this kind of like afrocentric history and then what does that mean um for solving for space solving for earth you know again being a geoscientist and thinking about how you know mother earth is watching and and we are the stewards and how are we going to take you know uh take uh her into the future and and make it better for everyone um including all the species on earth and then my other character is afrobotica which is more of a mechanical kind of like robotic feature that when i think about afrobotica i think about well what's the what are we going to look like in the future when we go among the stars can humans survive in our present form you know on the moon mars and beyond or will we have to be augmented in some way will we have to have some cyborg kind of component in order to be able to you know uh venture not only in our solar system but interstellar and so uh those are the things that i like to think about so you're showing photos from your book if for folks who were listening on audio and couldn't see it and that space to inspire is the book that that you're highlighting right and yes it's called space to inspire the art of inspiration and it's available on amazon awesome and who who is like the target audience for this book what tell us a little bit about what the book is well i like to think that the target audience is everyone because i tried to get a publisher to pick it up and they're like this is there's no one john right here they're like you're all over this this is for kids this is for adults this is for and i'm like yeah you know um and so i ended up self-publishing this and so it's a collection of my art from the beginning i started off as a collage artist during the middle of covet of 2020 and and then it just follows me kind of from being a collage artist into dabbling into watercolors and then line drawings and then also going to space and and so it has um my colleague complete collection of art and poetry that i've created over the last two two and a half years and so this book is out and by the ti i think when this podcast airs we will be into day one of your new nft collection also being out which if i'm not mistaken is connected to the book can you explain this nft project that by the time folks are hearing this probably will have just been released yeah so what i wanted to do was i wanted to take each on page is laid out as a work of art i'm going to hold it up so that people who are watching the video can see where i have art and the poem connected well i want to release these pages as nfts one of ones so there's going to be 22 one-of-ones from the book that have the art and poem together that people can go and get and it's gonna it's gonna drop on um february which is zero to the 22nd 22 of 2022 and there will be 22 pieces and so lots of twos going on there for anybody who loves numbers 22 is my lucky number i have to say my address growing up as a kid was 222. i've always loved the number 22 so uh already i'm already unfavorable and uh maybe an obvious question but why did you why did you want to have an nft component to this and why did you want to release this as an nft well you know um it's kind of interesting because now that i'm in that space i'm always thinking about how do i give you know how do i share my work to a broader audience and so one of the things is like seeker is available and so anybody who buys seeker i will send them um a digital i mean a physical copy of my signed book and so that's kind of like my gift once the collection is completely sold out we're gonna track everybody down and um say hey you know where do we send the book to and and then and then when i was thinking about the book itself and the fact that i laid it out as pieces of art to inspire people and then i was like well okay how do i give access again to this work that i've done in the nft space and so it just and not only that i should say that the book is augmented reality so if you get the physical book and you there's a free app you can use to download it will play videos of me and animations reading the poems to people and so i i try to combine the the physical and the digital together in multiple layers so that people just feel like they're connected and that they can be a part of this experience as i'm going through it are is this launching on like a bespoke site where folks will be able to get these nfts that are connected to the book you know that's a good uh a question um still working out on the details it'll definitely be on openc under me which is dr proctor and so people will be able to go and see that collection and yet to be determined nft.going to space is really cool because it has all of my animated is on there like you know seekers there whereas i feel like this is a little bit different because this isn't um these pieces aren't animated they're they are still images of art and poetry combined together and so we're still talking about should we keep these things separate or together but um i will be doing some twitter spaces and announcing it and i'll be on my twitter feed at dr cyanfroctor so anybody who is listening to this can go there and check it out awesome one of the things when i when we were sort of chatting about doing this episode and i was asking you like what would you want to talk about what do you think is really important to get across i know something that you mentioned and that is really important to you is more diversity in nfts and in blockchain and you know it's something that we sort of talk about as a space but what do you see as the biggest ways that we can work to make the space more diverse and and get a a variety of voices in here well you know the biggest thing is who do you follow you know when you're in social media and you look at who you follow is it diverse and if it's not why not and so that was even me i had that issue i was following the space community which is not diverse and and then you know black lives matters happened and talking about black and the ivory and just um just all of the social unrest and then i went to my twitter feed and i was like huh you know and this was one of the things that got me you know going as an artist because this was back um in early 2020 and i was like well how why am i not following all these amazing black scientists and then i got now that i'm in art i'm like well who are the um afrofuturist artists who are the um black poets and really starting to diversify my following so that i become more connected and then and so that's what my first advice to people is you know diversify who you're you're listening to and interacting with and so when we think about these nft projects and going into different spaces and promoting artists you know how do you bring in people who normally aren't in this space and so i love it when people say hey you know there's a new project um and they've got an allow list coming out and they say and they're thoughtful about it they're like okay well we want to make sure that it's not the same old people getting on the allow list we're gonna intentionally reach out to artists um particularly artists not just um you know collectors but people creating the art and saying hey you know we want you to donate a piece or be a part of the piece and get royalties or be on the allow list so that you can be you can get a piece of um you know our drop who are some afrofuturist artists that we should all check out and you want to shout out quickstover edwin it's uh c-r-i-x-t-o-v-e-r edwin.eth and so she's a visual artist and painter and so you can see i'm just going to hold it up so that if you want to cut to or drop her in we'll make sure we put the the links in for on the podcast and youtube side and then cue club dot eth perfect and uh and i mean there's a whole bunch of them oh and then okay there's also skid row crypto who's a journalist in that space in the nft space the dark mist dot eth i just love you know some of their when i go to their pieces here and look at their art and what they're doing i just love it and this one is stone as stone as the organic dot eath and so a lot of times when i jump into these new twitter spaces edballoon.eth i a lot of twitter spaces and clubhouse i'm looking at you know who's in there and how do i follow them and the list goes on and on and that's a great way again to just think about how do you create the jedi metaverse just equitable diverse and inclusive it starts by creating your space into a jedi space you're a metaverse into a jedi space yeah well and i'm i'm glad so glad to be having this conversation because it you know i often find that the guests that i have on than in my doing the research before the guests coming on i i learn about a whole new world or space and so this afro-futurism style of art is something i knew nothing about and i've been sort of you know diving into and learning about and i think at like the basic level for folks who aren't familiar with it like wakanda is sort of like a good is one version of that to sort of picture you know and this sort of i think it's yeah exactly it's a part of you know a black imagination of how can the future for black people be amazing and and you know arguably better than we have it right now and i think that's sort of at the core of this is that right is there anything you want to add about afrofuturism as a style of art or what it represents and and and what its inspirations are and it goes beyond just art you know it's music it is um it's movies like wakanda um it's literature uh and so uh one of my favorite books is um um parable of the sower by octo octavia butler fantastic you know and so just thinking about and then again it's about that inclusivity that idea of distribution of knowledge wealth power um information you know access all of that kind of stuff and when people you know again we come from such a competitive history um as human beings and how do we switch that narrative of competition to um you know complementary um completion and all of these things and because people get scared that there's not enough pie to go around but instead of thinking of it as a pie you eat think of it as the number pie it's infinite there's plenty of pie for everyone this is what i like to say right and so just uh open up a little bit and start diversifying your own space one of the things that excites me about web3 and the space and i want to get your take on it is you know we're really opening up new ways to [Music] i guess monetize culture and on the one hand i say that and i think it sounds kind of bad and scary like the the way that i think people who hate nfts would articulate it as like the financialization of everything on the flip side the part that really excites me is i think about the contributions that black americans but globally right have made to culture and how so much of our culture really comes from black culture and how black people have so often not really profited from that properly not gotten the right like you know credit for it and how web 3 is potentially perfectly designed to start to remedy some of that because it's all about providence and you can see the origins on a blockchain and and you can in theory and hopefully we get to this point where you're if you're good at spotting the new up-and-coming artist and the the kind of cultural mover and shakers you can get a part become a part of their community early you know make bets there early and um and really benefit from that is that something you're hopeful for when it comes to black inclusion in this space and and or am i being sort of overly optimistic and naive like how do you think about that no that's exactly what i feel it's that again um it's where there's money you know power um the whole power structure has been uh controlled um and that's and a lot of that's based through money and access and so if you look at our you know humanity um through the ages and they have sources to have nots and and how that power you know it started with kind of not only just power in a sense of of money and being able to control the distribution of wealth but also knowledge um was always a gatekeeper too uh and and so when we look at you know the digital space and what's happening there we're talking about access to information and you know which again helps to democratize things granted there is a lot of like misinformation out there um but that's having the ability to weed through that is is better than having limited access to knowledge and information um so empowering people to be able to uh go out there and and become better to some extent and to learn but then also thinking about wealth distribution and access to money um and and through your own creative efforts and so when i think about the fact that you as you know as an artist you can put something on the black blockchain and have ownership versus being afraid that if you put it out there somebody's going to steal it like in the past that happened you know but now you can like directly tie ownership um in the digital space to certain people and that and that to me is amazing because it really gives you more control now the issue i see is that um the now that people are catching on and the power structure that be what kind of limitations to access and ability to encode and and use these things and and what kind of fees will be kind of like placed on people um if we as individuals don't continue to move this all in a positive direction and and like i said make it into a jedi um space because others who you know people don't like to give up power whether it's an institution or a collective of individuals or a group and you know eyes are beginning to turn to to the space and we've already seen it with what facebook wants to do and some of the corporations and my goodness the super bowl i want to ask you i have sort of two quick follow-ups there which is first i'll i'll speak for myself like i have actually found the web 3 nft this community like wonderful and you know women in the space are sort of less represented you could say right but like i have felt really really included and felt um really like not not biased and i say that because i actually want other women to know that and to say like hey it may look male dominated but women are killing it you know and and also it's it's actually not so bad i've found when i get here like i and and i would i'd be curious for your experience specifically as a black woman right like how have you found the community and in terms of openness and when you're interacting with folks uh is like the water warm you know like come on guys it is you know very accepting um it's it's such a great space and and i really enjoy it you know it's really interesting because again it's not the same space that i'm used to being a seasoned individual you know at an older age you know we used to gather and meet in person and so now i'm meeting all these people in you know in um online through nfts and building nfts to me is all about community building in um the metaverse in the digital space but then it's funny because then you get out into the real world now that we're opening up and you go to an nft conference and you're like wow i know you you know i've been interacting with you for two years and and but you feel this kind of interesting connection uh to them as a result of that uh but it's been fantastic my one criticism it has to be with a lot of like um the pfps and the big drops and stuff they have been um a little bit on the on the when i think of gender uh male's male heavy like the the the designs and stuff and i'm like come on now yeah and i i do think there are there are lots of projects that are are catching up to rectifying that right you have i like to think so world of women and your meta angels and your boss beauty like you have a number of projects that are doing really well and and on the rise that uh are either geared towards women or are remain really i think neutral about it dead fellas i know made a real intention early on to to be kind of androgynous and a little bit yes and you know just sort of gender unclear yes like that that's that would be nice but i i want to see more kind of like um women get that opportunity to be leaders in the field and and have successful jobs or you know again when we look at the teams behind these projects coming together because we have the power to look them up and if you look them up and you're like well wait what is this you know if they don't have anything you know behind behind them i'm very skeptical um if they're not talking about their community and and who's part of the community and who is benefiting overall um from the projects and so i think that that's part of the the homework i only have a few more minutes here i know we're a little over our time but there are a couple other things i want to get to because as we talk about this like bringing new people into the space i think it's that combination of those of us who are already in the space being cognizant about who we're following who we're highlighting and then also you know encouraging new folks to to come in partly by saying hey look you know you're not gonna probably encounter a barrage of sexism there might be subtle things like you wish there were more pfps with women in it but in general people are like really warm here don't be don't be scared uh and and then secondarily i think there's this overcoming an imposter syndrome effect potentially and this is something you've talked a lot about publicly and so i i wanted to just highlight that because i think imposter syndrome can be especially bad in a in a tech space where it's like kind of confusing for everyone initially but i think there's maybe a tendency for women or for people of color to like encounter that confusion and think oh it's something about me like i just don't get this i'm not good enough or i'm not smart enough or any of the number of things we tell ourselves and and then they they don't push further because they think that's not for them and i would love to just hear your experience you know you've again talked about it with imposter syndrome and what your advice is for folks who encounter that wall and then think okay i should just quit now or i should this this space isn't for me no the imposter syndrome is a real thing i suffer from it you know and it's something that will always be with me but it's how you talk to yourself about with that that voice inside your head so those of you that don't know imposter syndrome is you know this idea that you don't see yourself as good enough or successful enough or capable of being able to go after this job or be in this type of space or environment but you actually are it's just this narrative that you have this conversation that you have in your head that fuels you with doubt and uh and again it's about how you respond to that because that voice is going to be there and so when i think about um imposter syndrome in this type of space uh i it goes back to one um finding that community because those are the people who are going to support you and help walk you through it is confusing i i spent hours the other day with my good friend mike and he was walking me through and he would he would cheer when i was like he's like congrats i sold my first um my first nft uh that i had collected like i put it back up just the other day on secondary yeah i second i simpled it on secondary and and and he was like yeah well done i was like yeah you know but he you know he he helped me walk walked me through it because uh again we're dealing with money and we're dealing with not wanting to mess up and trying to understand you know how do i convert this um this type of currency into this and how do i set up these different wallets and then you know how do i enter a discord and be safe and not um you know click on something i shouldn't click on and so but that's step one find good people to be um your peeps and so i have my what i call my wolf pack because they're all the people who are in the muttnick community and they're the ones who i am doing my artist in residence with and so they are a fantastic crew and so what you'll find is when you jump into the space like you said it's it's inviting and there are good people here wanting to help and do good and so that's what's what's fantastic about it yeah all right i want to close by getting your advice for artists collectors folks who are trying to get into this space and i think specifically on the artist side being an artist yourself what is your biggest piece of advice for artists who maybe are physical artists who are trying to break into the digital space um what do you what do you tell folks you know and that's what i was i you know i'm a i'm still a physical artist i was just creating a piece the other day uh figuring out how to capture your art uh and and then making it available um in the nft space is important and and it's worth the effort um because again it's just opening up access to um a community that you're not tapped into at the moment uh and but it's also developing you as an artist um so i've been working on my digital art skills also and thinking about how i can take advantage of the fact that the um digital space allows me to do things that i can't necessarily do efficiently in the physical space and that is combine art poetry music animation all of those things into one and make it available awesome dr proctor thank you so much for being here also i love that it's dr proctor it's like you know it's like a wonderful name i love the rhyming um thank you so much for being here with us i really appreciate you sharing all of this send me the names those artists you highlighted we'll make sure we link to them and uh any final any final words before we sign off no thank you for having me and then i hope that everybody who's listening will check out not
