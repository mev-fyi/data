wait who said that the metaverse is rendered at the periphery did we say that that's my line yeah that's a great line that's a david hoffman original brother wow yeah you like that one great no i i love that one that's uh yeah yeah we should start a podcast hey banquet station happy fourth week of march david it's friday morning what time is it oh it's the bankless friday weekly roll of ryan where we cover the entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor this week's pretty tame it's pretty pretty okay it's gonna be it's gonna be fun though there's a lot of interesting things going on uh right there's some hot headlines so tell us what's going down this week yeah usually you're more intimidated by the length this agenda but that this week maybe feels manageable david you're telling us yeah this is a 5 out of 10 on the crazy scale which is modest for crypto 5 out of 10. all right okay so here's what we're going to talk about yuga labs the apes bought the punks for uh 400 well actually that happened last week okay but this week they just got 450 million dollars in funding okay what are they gonna do with this they're gonna build a real metaverse a real metaverse and um a16z is in on this of course uh and we have the deck we have the slide deck we know exactly what they are planning to do so we're going to comment on that also vitalik buterin made the cover of time magazine this led to a lot of uh hilarious twitter threats i think hilarious twitter yeah yeah we're gonna talk about that um also gamestop released their first nft marketplace that's out it's built on loop ring and the loopering community is absolutely stoked about this i couldn't be more excited uh number going up a little bit so we'll talk about that to you and of course more of our weekly cringe out of elizabeth warren she's proposing new things in congress anti-crypto things shadowy supercoder things so of course you know we gotta comment on that because this sort of stuff can't happen in a free western liberal democracy where uh property rights um should count for something so uh we're gonna talk about that too the consistency of cringe out of elizabeth warren is just it's every single week at this point but also elizabeth come on the podcast because we're we're friendly and we don't bite it's true uh david before we get in we got to talk about the permissionless conference that is coming up we are on the road to permissionless right now this is going to be the d5 conference of the year not just d5 also the metaverse also we're going to talk about like institutional stuff as well a lot of people are going to be there who are some of the speakers you're most looking forward to seeing oh my god some some of my best friends out there justin drake we're going to be talking about ethan's ultrasound money of course on the verge of the merge because this is happening is that a panel title we're working we're working to the verge of the merge right because this is the permission list is in two months two months you have two months to get your ticket and in two months we will be on the cusp of the merge i mean excuse me pardon me the verge of the merge so justin drake is going to be talking all about that of course chris dixon from the famous uh web 3 mental models podcast you guys know all about chris nick carter is going to talk about stable coins eric peter is eric peters who's been on the podcast before is going to talk about uh some uh changing world order type content i get i'm guessing uh and then we also got jiho from axiomfinity jake schravinski for all the legal minds out there ryan selkiss donnie from ave it's going to be i think the the hottest event of the summer and this is of course where ryan and i will meet for the very first time so it's going to be a fun time bangles books their airbnb so bankless has an airbnb there's going to be the bankless party it's going to be sick as um a lot it's going to be very sick excuse me palm beach florida too the dates are may 17th through 19th and david said you have two months to get these tickets you kind of do but also you kind of don't because number one they're probably gonna sell out in the coming uh weeks and number two they just get more expensive over time all right so there was a time you could purchase these tickets for like 15 i don't want to tell people that but like right the price has gone up a lot since then and it will continue to go up until the date of the conference so book now of course if you have a bankless premium membership you get a discount on this big discount not a little discount it's a big difference 20 20 30 30 30 30 a generous a healthy discount pays for your whole entire premium membership it really does some no-brainers there also another no-brainer connect your wallet to zerion zurian is like the best like uh when i first discovered zirion getting into crypto right it's just like oh my god i can bring my assets to the interface rather than being locked inside of the interface like with a wells fargo account and they are adding features all of the time uh some of my favorite features that they've added recently is like multi-chain support ethereum optimism so l2s avalanches alternative l1s they also have phantom support they just added solana support so this is like their first non-evm chain so you know how you have your assets scattered all over the crypto universe here uh you can organize that you can track them all in one single mission control center user interface for your d5 antics also david there's some uh bridging capability here bridge what can you do here yeah so we're going to be in a multi-chain world uh whether with a multi-l layer one multi-v layer two it's going to happen and you shouldn't have to go to the optimism website or the arbitrage website to go and use their portals you should just go to xerion because they got it all for you uh you imagine just like you know a triple monitor five monitor setup and you have like all this is what xerion does it's your battle station for the multi-chain world and it makes it extremely easy to bridge to all the other layer twos the one of the fun stories i like to tell about why people should load up their uh address to something like zirion like the first time i did it ryan uh he discovered things yeah you know how you sometimes you you discover 20 20 in your pocket yeah like xerion will tell you everything about the state of the tokens that you have so there's a decent chance you have tokens that you don't aren't even aware of so go check your pants pockets by loading up your address into xerion all the all that change in the cushions of your couch you know shake all that out go go find it go turn it into eath i honestly i found some nfts this way too because they have an nft viewer these are not my nfts but i was like oh i own some okay nfts and they're actually like worth something which is kind of cool to know especially uh nfts aren't worth as much as they were maybe a month or two ago and then what happened next was ryan pulled out his tax document and started [Laughter] it's true too true story anyway guys go check that out go connect your wallets to xerion and uh get this all in one place of course we will include a link in the show notes because that's what we do for you market time david bitcoin mm-hmm what do you guys think happy bitcoin happy bitcoin happy crypto prices this week yeah bitcoin started the week at forty one thousand dollars ending the week right where it is right now at forty four thousand dollars up seven percent on the week a little bit of chop from a to b but here we are at forty four thousand dollars so the bowls are the bowls are bullish i thought we were down only how are we doing this this is like almost you know it's rising above some of these uh local peaks the last like early march peak is this a pre is this a pre uh war conflict peak here yeah that's exactly right we are we are starting to get higher than where we were pre-russian invasion of ukraine that is crazy and how about eth what's that looking like same same yeah start of the week at 2800 uh that was the low and we are currently just below 3100 basically call it three thousand one hundred dollars we got up to three thousand one hundred and twenty dollars right before recording dipped a little bit down right below it but again uh chop between the a to the b at the start of the week to the end of the week but you know overall when you zoom out and look at it smoothly it is a line up you know i i think i've told you before that like that 3k number is really important to me anytime it's above 3k it's a good day right it's like feels it feels bullish it feels like we're streaming yeah the pull of the bear market so uh wow up on the weekend is this on any news or anything david like why are we going up uh there's a bunch of reasons i could i could hypothesize about um i but i don't really have any strong conviction about any of them uh so i think like the the trade if you're a trader putting on your trade or hat is just an overall mean reversion so like ryan zoom out to like the the four-month four-month time frame or something like that three months yeah yeah yeah so i i guess the mean reversion trade has actually started to already kind of play out going from 2600 to like 3200 but there's also the mean reversion trade of going from like 3 000 back to 4 000 uh and so like two different trade time frames uh for trades on the menu but you know sometimes people are like well the the sellers just got exhausted and there's not enough sellers to keep on making price go down and even though macro or is still super bearish uh crypto like whenever crypto disassociates from macro it's usually to the bullish side yeah and i think that's perhaps what's going on yeah that's um at some point i'm definitely far from calling this sort of thing right i still believe we're very much in like kind of like a crab crab market season sideways action but like at some point prices get high enough it does break the back of of the bear market in the bear market fears i don't know what price point that is for easter certainly higher than 3 100. yes we still have room to go do you think it's all-time high like what are we all-time high for eth i mean okay so we're going to look at some we can definitely look at some trends right 600 40 4 600 but also like if you can you make that window go away uh like the 300 number is kind of where you we were hanging around 3 300 between august and september of 2021 we were hanging around 3 300 at the start of 2022 before we broke it down so i would say breaking 3 300 and getting into the area between 3 300 and 4 000 is like starts to feel that's the next window uh and then and then it's just absolutely confirmed by the time we get above 4 000 obviously because you know bullish bullishness begins bullishness um but like there's very little price action above 4 000 like we haven't spent a lot of time only a couple months of time but above 4 000 and so like above 4 000 is price discovery uh and so like if you're not into the trade by then you've like kind of missed out on it a lot but like that's when you can kind of start to ask yourself like well there's not really much information here about what happens next therefore your your uh you have permission to be bullish about you know price discovery once again especially because it's not going to just like zoom from 3 000 to 4 000 and like it's not going to do it in one month i mean it's done before it could do it but like it's probably not uh but like you know you start to look out at the two three four month time horizons and like that's when the merge happens so once again the alignment between the timing of the merge and the shape of the charts is interesting and we will actually be able to see that ryan when we look at the ether btc ratio i think that's where we're going next but but i gotta say this is um kind of not supposed to happen that way right according to a lot of according to the sentiment that i'm feeling like it's like the sentiment is we're in kind of this crab market and we're still destined to go down but it seems like we're kind of starting to reverse those trends and we'll see if that continues but what's the sentiment doesn't cause market action it generally follows it okay so this is the long-term view of the east btc ratio back when things got really really crazy in 2017 2018 and then we had the 2018 to 2020 bear market and now you can see this channel that we're forming and the east btc ratio we were talking about how for like there was three to four months of straight down downwards price action both in dollar terms and in each btc term starting in like november december of 2021 to uh basically like three weeks ago uh and we bounced off the bottom of that trend line and like kind of the self-fulfilling prophecy meme is that you bounce from trend line to trendline uh and so we go from point zero seven point zero six five where we at the bottom to like something like point zero nine point zero point zero nine five which is really bullish uh what's our f what's our flipping watch number for this oh i know that one uh point one five eight ryan i do have it memorized yeah so we need we need a basically a doubling uh a little bit more than a doubling of the eth price with the current bitcoin price staying ready to flip it yeah it's pretty high it's pretty high up there um but never been there before never no no we have not um the the spikes on the very far left this is coinbase the spikes on the very far left are noise you don't see that on any other chart fun fact you got it okay cool uh that's somebody who observes his ratio right there bankless bed index the third or third or third bitcoin eath and dpi what are we doing there yeah start of the week at 97 ended the week where we are now at 113 wow that's higher than when i wrote it down a couple minutes ago we are up roughly eight and a half percent uh bullish overall bullish on the market i will take that um let's talk about these outflows it's really cool when we see big outflows i think you can track it all on chain this is into the block doing it the largest outflows in 2022 so far over 180k eath was withdrawn from centralized exchanges in a single day the last time such a magnitude of eath left exchanges was in october 2021 preceding a 15 price increase within 10 days also of note 190k eath was also deposited into lido's staking eath contract into the lido staking pool what's happening here are people like withdrawing their eath to stake it is this like merge hype catching up with um like the actions of the market now is this what we're seeing well i mean this this happened at around the same time that we saw a very large increase in the validator queue the queue to get into e-staking for those that don't know you can't just like go and send your ether a smart contract and begin staking you have to enter and exit out of a queue and that queue is just meant to stabilize the security around the proof of stake chain right like we want to make sure that this security of the chain doesn't go up and down too fast so they have like they have like a bottleneck to you gotta wait to get in and out the weight to get in i think is about by the way you can't get out right now just for forever so it's a one-way ticket now but there will be a way out and we'll also have a queue out yes yeah uh and so i mean you tell me that there was significant outflows out of exchanges and there's significant uh eth queuing for the validator like well i mean i know how to interpret data do you do you know how to interpret bullish data david i think so i think so yeah okay the other reason why this is always bullish we always like to see for a number of reasons um why ether leaving exchanges same with bitcoin bitcoin leaving exchanges going into either like uh private keys self self-custody addresses or smart contracts one is bullish just because a lot of price discovery happens on centralized exchanges centralized exchanges determine what the price is so any new buying demand goes on to centralize exchanges first and so any new demand for ether is now now that there's 180 000 less ether on on centralized exchanges and dollar worth of pr of each purchase means a lot more to the price just because things are a lot more sensitive when there's a lot less ether on secondary markets there's a lot less volume uh and so that's the bullish the the of things there's also the philosophical side of things is we have a 180 000 more ether that's bankless or bankless ether there's people using smart contracts people using defy people moving their ether out of centralized exchanges which definitely seems to fit the narrative the the trend of the last uh two months or so of uh nation states like looking over at crypto and being like i don't like what you guys are doing uh and so then you know what we do we withdraw our ether we're gonna sanction you yeah that's the name of the show it's bankless so 180k in one day just went bankless more assets more bankless it's awesome we're here to build decentralization absolutely uh let's talk about the world dokuan is here to build uh we talked about this a little bit you like these segways they're getting better david yeah they are giving uh reveals a plan to increase usts that's the stablecoin on the luna network the terra network i should say um bitcoin reserve just jack that up to three billion dollars so last week we talked about dokwan um saying hey eventually i want at least 10 billion dollars worth of bitcoin backing ust so ust is like an algorithmic stable coin primarily it's backed by luna the value of luna and we've seen a lot of algo stable coins like not to not to be like the uh the old geezers on the podcast but like you and i have seen a lot of algorithmic stable coins coming crazy fall in our day many of them right and i've always thought of them as interesting experiments right and like maybe we can get one right at some point in time but um haven't yet there's always been sort of a crash in it any cataclysm i think doe is wanting to um uh like mitigate that a little bit by adding multiple collaterals to his algorithmic stablecoin not just luna but also bitcoin so um increasing to three billion bitcoin that is going to be backing this what are your thoughts here david uh yeah um i mean it makes sense right multi-collaterals backstable coins i've heard this one before maker dao is is this model uh i'm currently in a little bit of a twitter tussle with do kwan because he made this tweet saying by my hand to die the disabled coin will die like have a death wait what did he say uh he said by my hand dai will die as in like he wants to kill die he wants to like out compete die and i'm like i know the elon musk man right right it's some icarus level stuff dude like what he's really saying is like mkr price is gonna go down while well uh luna price is gonna go up um but like dude you can't kill die it's like one of the most battle-tested decentralized stable coins of all time like sure we can talk elders we can stop we can talk yeah plus you're just recreating the making this the make or down model in a different way uh anyways there's more more like more steps in some ways right there's more custody although although uh you know make your maker and die to be fair has a lot of like centralized stablecoin backing it at this point in time certainly but go on yeah say more okay so i tweeted after to his response uh my money's on die as in like no dou kwan you're not going to kill dai and so on twitter he he gives me this uh let's see if i can uh that's no that's like is that nick cage like yeah it's nick cage oh really and then does like the the empty brain like empty brain meme just making fun of me and like it's just always funny when i see like l1 founders engaging in just like uh kind of degenerate twitter antics anyways uh i have dms out to dokwan to do an ama on bankless all about what he's up to with uh with uh tara and and and all this so all of the uh the luna shills that are in my dms trying to get me to get uh dokuan on bank list go to hillary go to go to him tell him because he because he he has the invite he has the invite dm's inbound oh we'd love to have you on the show want to talk a little bit more let's talk about this let's hear about your plan to kill dye i'd love to hear it um also what's going on here uh we've got um a i guess a burn watch we should talk a little bit about so six billion eath has been burnt to date six billion dollars worth of eve has been burnt we're not even a year into david we got six billion eth burnt but also uh this the burn rate right now as of when we are uh talking about this this this week in the last couple of weeks is plunge has plunged to a seven month low that is why because gas fees are low because blocks based demand has decreased so transactions are cheaper a byproduct of that is we actually burn less eath even though we're burning less heat though we're still burning a lot this is uh ultrasound.money again where you can simulate the burn uh on the one day for instance in a post-merge world when's the merch gonna happen i don't know is it june david august we'll talk about that we would be still burning 0.9 percent of total eath uh supply per year so that would be deflationary that would be ultrasound eth in this in this scenario post in a post merge world so still a lot of eth being burnt and uh but not as much as before what are your thoughts here ryan if uh the amount of ether that was burnt was a token on coin market cap or coin gecko it would come in um 20 24th right ahead of bitcoin cash it would be the 24th highest market cap token the amount of ether that's burnt uh so there's your fun fact for the day well that is a fun fact uh we haven't talked about the burn in like at least like three or four shows so you know got to bring it back because it happens i bet we have on a weekly basis don't fact check us don't fact-check us fake this nation uh okay maple finance they just originated one billion dollars worth of loans this is uh a protocol for d5 services for institutions which is kind of cool because i think sticks money markets yeah aggregation loans yeah and that's a theme of today's episode which is like hey the institutions like they're not coming they're they're already here and this is them here in d5 uh so what is maple finance again can you refresh us yeah it's a fixed money market like it aggregates a bunch of loans and simplifies it and uh it just makes life easier for institutions who are trying to get yield and defy maple finance has been grinding for years i remember talking to them back in my realty days uh 2019 to 2020. australia australia australia-based australia-based yeah so definitely like true to the to the good ethos true builders of good d5 products so uh just tip of the hat to maple finance congratulations for breaking one billion dollars look at this congratulations on this tie sid powell from maple finance hey that's what happens when you have to when you have to deal with institutions you wear two yes that's just for the headshot right all right guys we will be back with the releases of the week and of course the hot news of the week we're gonna get to vitalik on the cover of time and some other things but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet and brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nano s plus a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet with more memory and a larger screen the nano s plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions and the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your nft what you see is what you sign the nano s plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things so go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new ledger nano s plus and join the waitlist to get yours and don't forget about the crypto life card also powered by ledger the cl card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app right next to all the device apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking so if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto if you're going bankless you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet you can now trade tokens on any decks or aggregator metamatic swap gathers real-time pricing information across all the default exchanges allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that i use when i'm out and about which i use to collect po-apps nfts and do all my defy things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out web3 wouldn't be the same without it download bend maps for desktop and mobile at metamask.io and load up your trezor ledger lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web3 polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their d5 goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and zero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon all right guys we are back with the releases of the week got to start with this release this made some waves loop rings lrc their lrc token is up and that's because there was a beta release of gamestops nft marketplaces built on loop ring that was just released this is a little bit what it looks like you can connect your wallet you can add funds to loop rings slayer two here uh gamestop plus ethereum layer two that seems like a good marriage now we also i think heard uh about immutable doing this with um with gamestop as well so i'm i'm a little bit confused because it feels like there's some mixed messages here yeah game stops definitely on layer two but like they're they're dating two different layer twos right now it seems like yeah and and well actually when you do the whole like log in with your wallet there is actually no like loop ring or actually for that matter immutable uh like just to log in so like what is what layer two is this uh like there there's the formal relationship between uh uh gamestop and immutable x and they have that 100 million dollar fund uh but then like okay so so the back story here is that there is uh a former loopering uh business developer we've had we had him on the show um uh matt feinstein great great guy great guy fantastic got but got poached by gamestop to start building out their nft ecosystem so loopering business developer went it went to gamestop uh i'm sure matt uh with you know knowing loopering in and out uh uh connected gamestop to loopering and that's the connection there but then gamestop i think elected to go with uh with immutable which i mean makes sense because loopering uh immutable x is a validium which is off-chain data but on-chain transactions on train assets so it's it's super fast super cheap loopering is more comfortable nothing to mint things cost you nothing well it costs the network something but it costs you the user not pays for it yeah people just pays for it which makes sense because like with loopering you still have like 30 transaction fees and everything's on chain so like it's actually better for like very very high value transactions like i would feel more comfortable having my crypto punch on loopering than i would on immutable um but uh like for gaming makes less sense and so like there's no reason why they have to pick one nft marketplace one nft platform but like the mixed messaging here is a little bit confusing so what are they actually doing with with uh loopering i don't know um it's also interesting that loopring is tweeting about this and not necessarily gamestop yeah i was just gonna say that and but of course anytime you uh you tweet something about gamestop like uh it does it does quite well it gets a lot of attention wow like look at this uh and lrc price is up a little bit on this news uh but but maybe not a ton right i i think the like the bigger spike with um the price of the loopering token actually happens like look at this back in november when uh the rumors start first rumors about about the matt feinstone bridge loop ring relationship with gamestop happened but then but then they announced but then gamestop announced their relationship with immutable and then it kind of tanked back to the pre-price and but now it's up just a little bit so got a little blip yeah market market confused market confused but not super excited about that which this which uh which does maybe tell you something also let's talk about this uh a protocol called time swap just launched on the polygon network this is a fixed income lending and borrowing protocol for erc 20s uh it's built on polygon i guess you know we've seen a lot of these um lending and borrowing protocols the the special sauce here is no no oracle uh somehow so that makes it you know permissionless there's no like governance apparatus they're saying non-liquidatable they're also saying it's got fixed maturity lending and borrowing so you can kind of lock in the date at which these these uh these assets will mature and of course this is in d5 um built on polygon first i i guess like my observation about this stuff and like i think we cover as many as we can and as many as we see but so many launch that we're just like not able to fit into the roll-up every week but one top observation i've had is like we're starting to see more innovation on the edges and what i mean by that is like the new protocols are being developed and launched like the new weird stuff on layer twos and on side chains first not on ethereum and once they prove themselves in kind of these like more local jurisdictions then maybe they make their way back to ethereum and they kind of launch on mainnet but the innovation is starting to happen at the edges so i guess one message is like be on the lookout for cool new projects on side chains and layer twos that's where the action is going to be that's where the innovation is going to be in the future the alpha is always on the frontier that's why we have the going west metaphor it's the new frontier oh my god yeah i mean we were in colorado i guess now we're just headed we're headed west towards uh california going to the gold rush yeah yeah come visit me just learn more space and this makes sense right because innovation needs to have cheap fees espec if you're going to take risks you need to have cheap fees because why would you take risks when you have to pay the fees of the ethereum l1 so i think the process for this is that developers and the cost of innovation goes to zero on the layer twos developers are free to experiment and free to innovate and then they are free to experiment and get their product market fit and then if they do get it it justifies returning back to manhattan back to the l1 and and you can have your ceremony of just like yo we made it guys by deploying your contracts on the l1 because you have proven that there is sufficient demand to justify it on the layer two the new frontier l22 you like that one i i like it a lot david i don't know where you come up with this stuff sir it's just genius um robin hood they're coming up with some stuff too uh a new debit card that offers crypto rewards well where have i seen that uh some of the the quotes are interesting here of course everyone's trying to get gen z now uh sorry millennials you're no longer hot [Laughter] and uh the idea is to turn non-crypto natives onto bitcoin so basically it's a debit card because according this article uh gen z doesn't like credit cards they swan debit cards no this article says david i don't know uh and decrypt the alpha for this i'm not sure i don't know if that's true but we do know they do like crypto and so when you use your debit card you can like like basically if if you're paying something and it's you know 90 cents you can just round up to the dollar and that 10 gets allocated to whatever you want including crypto you buy some ether fat you buy some bitcoin with that little excess on your debit card so i think the story here is like robin hood becoming more crypto friendly and actually taking a page out of the crypto bank's book right gemini does this already um with their card as does block fi uh as as does uh coinbase like they're all going to do this and now fintech is coming to crypto for like the uh the new features which is sort of sort of interesting to me i will have to say that a crypto themed like credit or debit card is like okay cool like you get the thumbs up but like there's no innovation points on that one it's just something it's probably table stakes it's probably something you have to have to keep going all right man you want to get to some raises yeah okay let's go with it let's go with this one this one's awesome the mega race race yeah so board ape yacht club creators yuga labs raises 450 million dollars that is a large number to build the first version of the metaverse uh these are my words first version of the metaverse but we talk about the metaverse a lot like oh nfts they're part of the metaverse digital land they're part of the metaverse yuga labs is on a race to build out the ful the first fully fledged version of the metaverse so complete with land complete with uh nfts being the board apes and all the other uh ip that yugo labs owns uh you know complete with you know people running around in their avatars doing board ape things they have the apecoin for the currency of that metaverse so they are not doing just one part of the metaverse they're doing the full entire metaverse uh this funding round evaluates yuka labs at four billion dollars and like using that kind of like frame of reference for what yoga labs is building no as a team that has been known to execute and execute very very well um you know remember when ryan when board apes used to be considered like the poor man's punk and now they're almost like 2x the floor price of punks and how they just like bought like punks and they bought the punks yeah yeah i remember that so like people are looking at the apecoin drop at the current valuation of 13 billion dollars and being like that is ridiculous that's way too high usually air drops happen they have a spike of interest but then they just basically bleed to zero people in my mind are valuing this apecoin based on the value of like a completely fully fledged uh first half first functional metaverse ever coming out of yooka labs right and so that is that is the the value 13 billion dollars that is absolutely insane 13 billion drop that makes that makes the minting of a board ape perhaps one of the greatest investments of all time i think it was .08 east to mint and ape so that's now like a hundred e don't remind me okay that's painful but then you also got the apecoin airdrop ryan you also got probably i think i think they got mutant apes airdropped as well maybe they had to make those two um yeah minting and ape one of the best investments of all time dude uh i would you know what maybe william peaster can do a uh metaversal post on that you know i'd love to see the best nft investments of all time like compare like the original crypto punks um you know like mints to this but this is their slide deck it's okay it's bullish it's eucalyptus it's a pretty chad chad uh uh deck it's a chat well when you've got a slide that just lists like you know 12 different celebrities and their names are shaq post malone snoop dogg justin bieber timberland future the biebs williams and they're all like apes right you've done something really well to kind of penetrate and this is all about i mean there's so much in the slide deck we'll include a link in the show notes but and we think like our conspiracy theory right it's like i think you said this that uh this was probably leaked to hype up what they're doing so people like being potentially the intentional leak the intentional leak yeah so this is basically like they're saying everyone's done crappy versions of the metaverse no one else gets it we uh have the brand and the the ability to actually pull off a metaverse the thing that zuckerberg is talking about like that's the thing that we can build and we are going to build and apecoin is the currency of this you know the nft early community and all of our brands will be sort of the nft layer and come hang with us and you know it's going to be really awesome and now all we have to do is build it uh so if you want to hear more content about this this uh this news actually dropped while we were live streaming on the state of the nation on tuesday about this exact topic so you can go watch that state of the nation so it's about yoga labs buying the punks but we also talk about what they're building we had a number of builders on that show who were saying like okay yeah yoga labs executed on on the branding behind board apes but like building a metaverse building digital land and all the other things that they're talking about like that's hard and that's something new uh so sure they have the ability to execute in one domain does that mean that they have that it carries over to the ability to execute in like three other domains simultaneously uh tbd i kind of agree i kind of agree with that take which is like you have one category of execution that you've absolutely crushed and that is like narrative building story building branding marketing total points there you totally crushed it but the metaverse that is a different type of execution ability right and the question is can you now pull that off as well and uh i i guess we'll have to see but um they're definitely funded to do that a16z was involved in that funding round they did uh their profile pic of uh you know whatever board ape that they hold uh 3d glasses board ape with a astronaut suit the astronauts use a nice touch you like this one yeah uh they put it as their profile pic for a very short amount of time that's wonderful you know the announcement day the announcement that's all you get just one day um okay let's keep moving ftx is backing a 500 million dollar crypto gaming platform on tara what's super interesting is these alt layer one ecosystems are also accruing their own funding um you know funding rounds too and 500 million dollars for a crypto gaming platform like that just blows my blows my mind the money that is flowing into this space right now do you have any thoughts on this yeah no no thoughts other than just there's absolutely you would have no idea what the price action would be if it being down for the last four months based on the the valuations that are being pulled in the private rounds so absolutely private rounds are not bearish yeah it's like do you remember how the private rounds like dried up in 2018 2019 like you know what like people couldn't raise money yeah like i remember talking to founders and they're like it's it's really hard like we don't know if we're going to be able to survive and this is not that type of bear market at all thank you for printing all the money federal reserve appreciate it all right fdx they just invested 100 million dollars in an app banking app called dave yeah i ryan i have a banking app that i sold for 100 million dollars is this yours dave banking app called dave they have dave.com i'm surprised that wasn't yours dave have you used this before i have not used this it's the first time i've heard about this okay this is the first time david has heard about dave um anyway this is an example i think of ftx like i don't know what you'd call this but like going toward the the trad fi side of things right so ft fdx is obviously like a crypto exchange of crypto bank and now they are investing in in tradify fintech companies 100 million dollars worth uh so you know smart move but this is all like we've had this thesis for a long time that crypto banks would just become basically neo banks and this is looks like what they're evolving into kind of see cool to see uh crypto get involved a bit more in in fintech i don't know very much about dave but um you should invite these guys to dave dowd david oh they're they're in dave dall um world coin oh boy okay this raised 100 million dog i feel like they just raised the last time we heard about world corn was because of their raise and their investment okay so i i wasn't making that up um they raised a hundred million dollars this time at a three billion dollar token valuation what what is wrong for people who forgot about this thing okay talk about a lot of races there is a particular like niche in crypto that has been tried a number of times and that is the uh uh civil resistant token distribution as as in can we distribute the same amount of tokens to everyone in the world and so the attempt here is to make your token value valuable by fairness right so if everyone has the equal and an equal amount then that's super super fair and humans value fairness humans value legitimacy we did a great podcast on this with photographer untitled legitimacy you should definitely listen to that if you haven't uh and so this is an attempt for that when they released the first time around um they got absolutely slaughtered on twitter and in the in the public sphere because of how they actually went about trying to solve civil resistance and they did it with these like super dystopian silver ball looking things that scans your iris and it uses your iris and your fingerprints as like an anti-sybil mechanism so it's the classic web 2 model of like give us your data and we'll give you money and so they got absolutely slaughtered on crypto twitter and everything and they were funded by like a very big names like uh three hours capital uh a16z uh uh and coinbase is now in this one uh coastal adventures right uh and and so they were in the news cycle so we reached out to them to host them on state of the nation because it was hot in the news cycle that's what we do and they were afraid to come on they we we told them like you guys need to come on because you guys are getting slaughtered in the narrative and if you ever want to justify or explain your project you guys need to you guys are welcome to use our platform to explain what you guys are up to and they were too scared do you think they were i they backed out which surprised us oh fun fact about that you know what episode we did in in lieu of that episode ryan you remember no it was ultra scalable ethereum oh really one of the most popular episodes of all time oh the one that we were just like oh  because we got rushed into episodes yeah they were like yo like we don't want to come on anymore we're not ready for the pr and then we i went back to the ceo and dm'd him on twitter like you're making a huge mistake like bankless is one of the most fair platforms you'll ever get ever and you're not going to get this opportunity again and then he just didn't respond and so instead uh we ground it out and produce the agenda for ultra-scalable ethereum and it's one of the best episodes of all time i remember being very stressed with the cancellation there like uh we don't usually get cancellations uh i don't think like um look i i am actually optimistic like i was cautiously optimistic about this i think they may have gotten a fair like an unfair rap on twitter and and in in the crypto community i wanted them to kind of explain themselves because they have made some really cool engineering decisions for example they've built this thing on a really interesting layer two set of technologies so it's all like ultimately settled on ethereum and i do think fair distribution this way is a monetary experiment that we've never been able to successfully try so can we uh mitigate the privacy concerns that people have like i i do think that they should spend some time with the crypto community and uh and explain this so i guess despite what we've just said and despite the previous invitation i would still welcome these guys on at least somebody from their project to like talk a little bit about world coin but um what they're in the news for is more funding and not necessarily like progress traction in progress right so like we would know that there would be traction if people saw little silver balls in their neighborhood and we saw cues of people lining up to get their irises scanned so bankless listeners if you've seen that tweet at us and let us know if you've seen that because i certainly haven't yes and i will not be first in line for that one though i'll skip that that's a cool experiment yeah i'll just i'll just wait for at least come on the podcast first and then we'll talk about it um this is kind of neat this is under the uh i guess the title of why work at a crypto fund when you can go start your own uh katie han she was at a16z she was a partner she started her own fund recently she just raised 1.5 billion dollars for a web 3 fund um again more money in the space more people breaking off from the funds that they were in and starting their own here's another this is a former poly chain capital founder who just launched 125 million dollar fund now the i guess the twist here is this fund is actually destined to become a dow at some point in the future uh let me describe how that works it says after the full 125 million is invested that's the initial fund amount the fund will be dissolved and the dow um and dow 5 will return the limited partnership capital to investors and convert the fund into a dow which of course is an online community that uses smart contracts cryptocurrency etc etc so that is the plan for this kind of a unique twist on things um why why join a fund when you could start your own david when bankless doubt win bankless fund are we gonna do a fund at some point uh i mean we've talked about this the answer is yes if people are interested i've i've too much i have too much to do we're not not anytime soon guys but um yeah why start a fund when you can build your own that is the question uh and i think it's a question for for everyone right like these cryptoeconomic tools make it easier than ever to like coordinate capital so why not try some capital coordination experiments uh if you're listening to bank list if you're plugged into d5 you're probably on the frontier and you're probably able to make some pretty good investment decisions at least if you've been in this space for a little bit and have seen some cycles play out um let's see what qualcomm does in the space because this one's mine ryan because qualcomm is basically right around the corner from me so here in san diego they're in san diego yeah they drive by their their office every now and then uh 100 million dollar metaverse investment fund and this is actually pretty interesting and when i was reading this article i was uh i was reminded of kathy wood's whole the futures nearer than we actually think and there are like five mega trends in technology one of them being blockchain another one being um basically like uh kind of like ai chip what call what qualcomm's up to so qualcomm is putting a hundred million dollars into a metaverse fund to build out things like vr headsets and things that demand chips so because so they are investing in the metaverse because they think the metaverse will create net new demand for microchips for silver for silicon it's like the hardware side of the hardware side of the metaverse right uh and so this is the intersection of industries coming together to build out the future and so reminder the metaverse is not just crypto it is so many more other things it is uh data centers and servers that can host persistent state of many many different people from across the world like significantly more massive mmorpgs we need ships for that uh it's headsets and immersive experiences so these technologies are coming together and qualcomm is putting 100 million dollars into that investment i do think crypto people forget about the hardware side of things i mean we are focused on the content we're focused on the property property to populate the metaverse and the people but there's a lot of uh like hardware uh in you know data center tech underneath all of this um this is another one uh the teams behind the meena mina protocol i think that's how you say it made a protocol they just raised 92 mina okay i don't know the mena protocol they just raised 92 million dollars from throughout capital ftx and others this is a layer one chain okay and it is a privacy-focused chain i don't know very much about this to be honest david i haven't you know gone down the the rabbit hole on this one um i imagine it it's probably proof of stake i imagine it's uh using some advanced uh cryptography i imagine it's also a um a smart contract platform beyond that i gotta ask the question like do we have any more room for for more layer one chains well we have room for more layer one investments ryan we got lots of that lots of room for that at some point it's got to become a bad investment though right it's like i at some point when it when does the window fully close on layer ones well okay so privacy is is hot right now because of the whole conversations of sanctions and nation states and crypto and so privacy tools and privacy tooling is in vogue at the moment so i think that kind of explains that a little bit i just always ask the question is you'd have to have a really good reason to build a layer one when you could also just build a layer two from an economics perspective and sometimes i wonder if the the reason to build a layer one is just investors will fund your project for a lot of money and you can sell tokens that's been the status quo for like almost five years now uh let's talk about this paradigm just invested 8.75 million dollars in ribbon finance what's this about so in the tradify world we have these things called structured products which is basically like i think an analogy is like kind of like a yearns custom strategies like you can you can load up yield strategies so it's like it's like a yield strategy d5 product we have these things in tradfy but basically anything you can do in in tradify you can do even better in defy so that's what ribbon is uh their project's declared mission is to create sustainable alpha for everyone uh financial products are bundled per specific investment strategies uh so uh they just raised eight point seven five million dollars from paradigm i think this is a cool d5 protocol and if people want to check it out of course bankless wrote a tactic about this article how to make money with ribbon finance and uh one piece or describes it as a pre-packaged and cross-protocol defy investment strategy so if you want to learn how to use this thing um yeah at the time we wrote it apis apys ranged from 10 to 54 on this thing so pretty good apys go check out this article we'll include a link in the show notes um dalio bridgewater investing in a crypto fund finally dally was warming up a little bit to crypto finally yeah what do you think about this it's it's so frustrating uh i know you and i are both reading his book i don't know if you've finished his book or not ryan um but like it's impossible to read his book which is titled like uh uh how principal world order principles are for living in a changing world order and the changing world order is something we talk on banknotes about all the time this just nails it the client the decline of the dollar the decline of institutions here's what you here's this is why we're we talk about how it's risky to not go into crypto while crypto is also risky itself things are risky and things are volatile and things are chaotic when we have changing world orders and ray dalio is so tapped into this what he's missing and he talks about how the phoenix that rises from the ashes of like one broken world order moves into a new world order and then the phoenix rise from the ashes and we do it all over again uh he talks about like these new uh these new uh uh nations always work well when they have their own internal financial markets their own internal equities markets their own like uh places of trade and like it's so frustrating when i'm hearing this and i'm like oh okay so ethereum it's got its own uniswap it's got its own like dydx it's got its own money markets with compound and ave it's got all of the financial institutions that ray dalio is says is critical for the rising of a new of the new neo nation the next step in in the world and i'm like great it's right in front of you it's right in front of you it's ethereum it's defined it's crypto he he literally goes he's like here he here's the history of you know denmark in like amsterdam is the first exchange and then we got london right and that that that was another financial we invented the llc it's like yeah yeah we have dows now exactly and then and then he's like and then it's new york and then he's like well what what's going to be next the question is what's the next nation state on the rise is it going to be china maybe it's like beijing is the next i'm like what about ethereum it's ethereum theory it perfectly fits into the trajectory it it really does and i don't think he's i just don't think that's on his radar the raise the like the rise of what we would call like the you know this new institution the digital nation these new protocols i think even if you are if you believe that nation states will get a whole nother big cycle like financial cycle and be kind of the empire then even in the most like i guess bearish case for you know the bankless concept of a digital nation crypto is still the new the perfect bridge between the old paradigm and the new paradigm so you at least want to be crypt in crypto because you don't know what the the future big nation you know new world order is going to be and like so you want to be in crypto in order to get across that bridge because crypto is going to be essential for getting across the bridge and establishing a new world order so we tend to think that hey the new world order will probably be based on crypto because it's the only credibly neutral institution to actually do the job in the digital era right it's going to just slurp in all of the value just like the internet has slurped in all of our you know communication content but even if you don't believe that that's true you know crypto is going to play a massive role as the bridge between old paradigm and new paradigm anyway all that to say ray's getting it though he's investing in crypto funds so it's it's starting to happen there's a reason why we call it the bankless nation and it's not just because it's a good name like it is a direct reference to exactly what ray dalio's talking about we're building new nations in the sky uh and they shall be bankless there you go guys uh if you want to get into the new nation you gotta get a job in crypto that's what it takes uh we got some fantastic jobs we tell you every week to get a job in crypto i think we just got a massive dump of new job postings on the bankless job boards ready to check that out ready to dance you ready to dance because i'm ready to read all right let's go uh yeah well uh blockchain engineer daos masari is hiring that what a fantastic role software engineer for market data also at missouri go check those roles out operations manager cynica senior product designer smart defy a senior go rust engineer at syndica a senior full stack engineer at syndica a senior software engineer airdrop labs a product manager for crypto at nori a bankless web developer at bank list and editor at bank list as well senior project engineer at the bankless academy a senior product engineer at super rare got a bunch more positions open for missouri you should take a look at gauntlet as well uh david's done dancing and uh i gotta take a sip of water because i've been reading a little bit i would like to emphasize the bankless web developer would be in charge of building out one of the coolest websites of all time i shouldn't even call it a website we need a better name for it but if you want some alpha you got to apply to be the bankless web dev if you are a talented web dev who wants to lead bankless into the world of web 3 and into the frontier uh pay attention to that one yeah why would you not get a job in crypto companies are still hiring like crazy this is not like the last bear market this is a ton of hiring going on um all right man well let's get to news okay yeah and let's get to uh vitalik on the cover of time magazine look at this picture looking like an absolute towel well he's not a king he's the prince of krypto excuse me excuse me it's on the the cover of time magazine it says the prince of crypto has concerns on vitalik's shirt and then it says ethereum creator vitalik buter and fights to fix the world he created and this isn't anything new vitalik in 2017 made similar sentiments on twitter saying like yo if this whole industry just turns into like pump and dump ico ponzi schemes like i'm out here yeah and then the bear market happened so he stayed thank god but like now now once again like it's always the hotline like vitalik's a very like pragmatic modest person when he sees like all the scams and crypto he's like yes those are bad like i don't want ethereum necessarily to be used for these things but i understand the value of open permissionless systems um but like it's a really really hot line for something something like time magazine to be like yo the guy that invented crypto says it's bad uh but you know you know what that's a catchy look it's called it's called we call it legit bait okay which is like you say something but like it has has to have some legitimacy and in the article which was absolutely fantastic i think everyone if you've got like you know 15 minutes go read this article uh vitalik does you know put in place some of his his criticisms about the current state of crypto and many of these criticisms are always well reasoned but they're also very valid um but yeah they like they put him on the top but not everyone liked this image of vitalik david so when this got out of course everyone in crypto was very excited to see vitalik and like if you've met vitalik i mean this is pretty much what he dresses like and what he looks like this is tame vitalik there's but there's no pretense in the guy like you're never gonna catch him in a you know a suit and tie and you know fully buttoned up and usually it's in the unicorn t-shirt [Laughter] but i mean some of the responses some of the quote tweets on this were absolutely like ridiculous yeah they're pretty terrible because crypto has a bad rap right so here's a quote tweet from the time article this guy looks like the clone of tom brady can you go back to the other one this guy looks like the clone of tom brady keeps locked in his basement to periodically feed on to stay youthful oh my god yeah uh there's there's a few others this is if tom brady was a doc was on dog food how is it possible to be this rich and still be ugly oh my god get a hair transplant or a botox or a new wardrobe something okay this one i want to dwell on this one this is why i love italic because he doesn't care about his image he is a person he is him and like he shows up in ruffled hair that he didn't comb and it's in a unicorn t-shirt because he has no ego and who do you want most to be the founder of your of your crypto project to have someone with zero ego we are missing l1 founders with zero ego in this world in my opinion there's not there's not very many there's satoshi i think there's vitalik and i don't know i don't know there's another i can think of maybe zuko zuko is a pretty cool guy yeah a fantastic person as well um my uh my wife actually sent me this one it was like oh my god everyone's being mean to vitalik on the internet like like i could do something but i did i tweeted out i was like most of the comments here suck and this is so true vitalik is one of the best human beings i know he'll be remembered as a historical figure of monumental importance petty people can't get past how he looks in this image we don't deserve him i 100 stand by that that's the right take one of the best humans i know not only that i think the vitalik is going to be remembered across history like he is going to be one of the most important people i think of this century uh for his work in ethereum but the other things he's he's going to do in life as well and um it's super petty that people just you know take that take this picture and use it to insult him uh pretty annoying actually to me but there we got a funny exchange out of it david i'm reminded of uh the layer zero i did with um uh santi siri from from argentina and he called vitalik while he walked around argentina in his like sandals he called vitalik like this monk figure and i think that's a very very apt description of italic right like has has no like is not interested in material things is mostly interested in making good things happen for the world um very polite very respectful um very grounded even even yeah yeah very grounded individual yeah i just i know both of us have you know had the opportunity to interact with him on a number of occasions and uh he's just a fantastic human being and represents the the best of us and i think the best of this industry as well but at least we got some fun out of this as well because there was some back and forth on on the tom brady why don't you tell us what happened here okay vitelli vitelli can take a joke he can take a joke very very well he's been used to getting just berated in all different capacities for ever since he's been in crypto so he he retweets the all of these like terrible terrible comments on him on twitter and he goes the quote quote tweets on the new time article about me are truly amazing these are barely even cherry-picked it's pretty much one piece of awesome after another highly recommend scrolling uh and then he follows up his own tweet saying i don't even know who tom brady is had to ask people around me my best guess is that he is the actor from mission impossible tweets like calling him tom brady's like anyone else looks like vitalik looks like tom brady on meth bro looks like a dystopian tom brady tom brady was a reverse captain america super soldier serum uh the prince of crypto kind of looks like tom brady after two years of retirement and no weight lifting no okay and then what happened tom brady retweets metallic vitalik's tweet saying i don't know who tom brady is and tom brady says what's up vitalik you may not know me but just wanted to say i'm a big fan of yours thank you for everything you've built in the world of crypto otherwise autograph wouldn't have been possible his nft platform hope i get to meet you someday you're the goat uh which is a which is a tip of the hat to how everyone calls tom brady the goat he's like won the most super bowls by all time forever uh so the goat of super bowl of football is calling vitalik buterin the goat oh real also a slight show of his autograph platform yeah but but also real recognize real you know like one goat seeing another it's uh it's really cool to see and i um i love that uh the story came together that way um anything else on this david um no it was a good story it was a good story the last time we saw uh vitalik engaged with uh celebrities it turned into uh a really funny video of mila kunis and aston kutcher and vitalik in the living room so i'm hopeful something like this happens with tom brady yeah absolutely all right man let's move on to uh some other ethereum stuff while we're talking about ethereum and you know we gotta just mention eip4844 okay i'm going to say that again because this is the first time we've talked about this ethereum improvement proposal that's what an eip is on bankless eip4844 remember the name remember remember that number okay because it is like 1559 in that it is going to be of uh that level of significance i think in the future we don't talk about eips very often but this thing is worth talking about now we're not going to go in detail it's probably a bunch of future bankless articles and probably some shows that we'll put together for you in the future and there's kind of no rush because it's still in the early stages of development so we got a long time on this one but david could you sum up what eip 4844 is going to do for us yeah it's a new type of data sharding structure which takes a leaf out of distributed systems like bittorrent it kind of copies a bittorrent model so on the website you'll it'll read eip4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to ethereum which accepts blobs of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time these changes are forward compatible not required for evm execution and small enough to keep disk use manageable so it's basically allowing allowing ethereum's data layer to be a little bit more expressive and using distributed systems again like bittorrent we will get better and better at explaining these things as we come to understand them more but the tldr is that this is from proto-lambda out of the optimism team data blobs are the first milestone milestone towards full ethereum charting enabling roll-ups like optimism to grow a hundred times in capacity that's already after uh roll-ups like optimism have 10x and capacity coming from their own innovations and so this is we were just previewing this very very significant subject for something that's going to have a huge scalability increase both to the ethereum l1 and of course orders of magnitude more scalability to the ethereum layer twos and in particular this is going to scale out remember we've talked about on our modular blockchain show the three the three kind of layers of the stack here uh the consensus layer the data layer and the execution layer and the ethereum scalability roadmap the execution layers is all rollups basically and the consensus layer is is the beacon chain of course this is bringing massive scalability to the data layer which roll-ups of course need in order to scale so what we get when this thing is deployed and it's a much more simplified version than the full data sharding spec so the hope is it can be deployed a little bit faster than the full data sharding um you know spec is roll-up fees as david said up to 100 times uh faster like a hundred times more space on roll-ups so look at your what you pay on arbitram or optimism or any of the zk roll ups you use right and it's going to be 99 less in terms of costs so if you're paying like you know one set now or 10 cents now you're gonna be paying like fractions of a cent in the future for a transaction so lots of cool stuff to unpack there and we will unpack it in the future just not on this particular episode while we're talking about that though david should we talk a little bit about the merge because um some people uh brought to our attention that like we should emphasize something yes okay what should we emphasize last week we were we went through like the um the super fizz's analysis on like five different points that indicate that the merge is coming in june and then we talked about how bullish emerges and emphasized june emphasized drew and emphasized june uh june is possible uh but it is not it's not fact it's not it's not canon uh so the merge is coming perhaps sometime in q3 sometime between june and august but it could also come in 2024 it could come in 2025 it could come in 20 20 20 30. it'll be ready when it's ready uh bank list is not the oracle for when the merge comes that's what the developer's job's for so apologies if any of the ethereum developers felt any pressure by the narratives that bankless likes to beat the drum for um the merge is is is would the merge if it came in june that would be fantastic uh people are are hypo hypothetic hypothesizing that it'll be sometime between june and august but june is not it's actually scheduled that's just a uh estimation so i just want to say that and i do think that people um got a little bit skittish after there was a bug in the kiln test net right and they were just like ah wow given that bug you know the june date might not happen right and um so that's some of the feedback anyway there's still a chance it happens in june so of course but it could also be july it could also be august it could also be later it's ready when it's ready as david said um the best time for the merge is when it's time for the merge which is the summer i don't even know if that makes sense i don't know either but moving on this summer uh let's talk about nft stuff and first we gotta talk about a pretty massive phishing scam not because it's the biggest uh in dollar amounts because but because it seemed like it was targeted and very sophisticated uh we've had arthur 0x on the show before he is uh the the founder of defiance capital which is a d5 for him he just got 1.7 million dollars worth of nfts joint from his uh ethereum wallet david like what happened here and how did it happen yeah so i think somebody uh spun up like a shared google doc and sent it to his email uh and it kind of looks like somebody was sharing a google doc but um when he opened it that did things uh and i'm noticing that that that doc is a docx file dot d u c x uh and that is the same file type that hugh carp had his uh his nexus mutual tokens stolen from uh and so be wary about people sending you files basically and which makes it really really hard because um maybe we maybe we could talk to somebody technical about this i don't know if this like functionality is possible inside of a pdf but a docx file can have embedded data in it that can uh swap out your meta mask to a clone of a metamask that looks like metamask that does things that you shouldn't do and so you know even people as sophisticated as arthur 0x got phished and so it can happen to you too if you want to have maximum security about how to not have this happen to you the best way to do this is to work on one computer and sign transactions on a different computer and not to open up files on that second computer and keep that other computer relatively clean uh and that's how you can protect yourself from this i think that is especially true the the other thing you should do is uh go read this article that that william peacer put together on mediversal about about this hack and how it happened and how you can uh protect yourself because i think you you were talking about the hugh carr pack who's the d5 founder the crazy thing about this is with arthur as well is uh he's likely stocked likely targeted right so if you have kind of a public reputation in d5 i think you should be especially cautious of this type of hack because not only was he targeted he was likely targeted by a uh a known group in um uh in crypto the you know the blue norov group it's called and this there's some speculation that this might be a group out of north korea that's actually assembled to go attack some of these individuals in in crypto and kind of like hunt them down learn their patterns and actually see where their vulnerabilities were because this email that got sent to arthur was actually somebody from one of his portfolio accounts whom he trusted so like they had inside knowledge of who arthur might trust and the type of link he might click um anyway william concludes this article with a few other resources for you on self-custody operational security tips uh on um you know how to how to guard yourself and how to store bitcoin in cryptocurrencies so go refresh yourself on that if you uh especially if you're one of these like public high-profile um people who uh you know might be uh might be susceptible to a group like this yeah the same strategy was used with hugh carp where he clicked a document that just made sense for him to receive it came out of like the nexus community call and so somebody was like okay hugh carp here's this document it's part of the nexus community call information that we were talking about so somebody was using relevant information to heal carbs so that when he received this file he's like oh this totally makes sense that i'm receiving this file i will totally click on this yes this is why we also talk about cold storage so often and like you know the ledger uh keys um that didn't protect hugh carp hugh carp got rugged from his ledger you're right um it can help with some things but uh it doesn't help with this kind of fishing phishing attack um the best thing you can do is just make sure you know exactly what you're signing and sometimes that's tricky too but be vigilant plus up your opsec if you can let's keep moving uh hollywood in our hollywood section so disney just released something called pixar pals what are these uh these are both the most simple types of nfts you'll ever see they are nfts of pixar characters like woody from toy story buzz from toy story they are pictures of characters you can buy them in the nfts and it's disney disney's getting in on nft so is dc the dc universe right the creators of batman of course um marvel's um rival so what are they doing in the nft space uh digital trading cards of their characters from the marvel universe you can buy them as nfts pretty simple open and shut they're they're at the the very simple stages of nfts right yeah you gotta imagine these are just like tests and prototypes and it's gonna get more complicated from here um let's talk about the institutions a little bit david so uh check this out man this is goldman sachs holdings shall we read this is say yeah read it big word digitalization front and center with the subtitle from cryptocurrencies to the metaverse explore the meta trends mega trends that are reshaping economies um that's it just the word digitalization cryptocurrencies and metaverse now on the front page of goldman sachs so crypto making the front page of goldman sachs as if it's like a pillar of their strategy moving forward um but are they gonna get it right this is uh this is ben's take he's actually from the bankless team why don't you uh talk about this yeah ben bankless analyst head of the the gmi index uh one of the methodologists says per f per command f uh where you know you find something uh this goldman sachs report on the metaverse in web 3 does not include a single mention of either blockchain or ethereum this is a perfect example of why d5 natives are going to eat their damn lunch well said ben that's what we love to hear that's the right take chad ben's the best ben yeah like if you don't know what's up we're just gonna learn how to eat you like this is the rise of the of the individual against the institution like if you don't know what defy is and you're not reporting on it we're just gonna eat your lunch yeah i think we got like at least five years of knowledge on these guys and they're just kind of getting into the space and i bet they're gonna not understand it for a while um but they could if they start like consuming the right content actually using these protocols and getting in the space but i think that's uh it's kind of few that's not the many we're going to go on that path um they just also as well announced the first otc crypto trade of course we talked about their partnership with galaxy digital last week apparently that partnership went forward and they're actually spending money on crypto right now yep um that's that let's talk about our friend elizabeth warren what's she up to these days uh being cringe she reduced or she introduced a new compliance bill for crypto uh on the wake of the whole sanctions conversation with russia uh and so it's it's it's using the russian narrative of we need to uh regulate crypto because you can use crypto to get around sanctions even though there's absolutely no evidence that that's actually happening but in addition to that the bill goes beyond russian sanctions an additional provision in the bill would authorize fincen the financial crimes enforcement enforcement network to force users to report transactions larger than ten thousand dollars if they send them outside of the united states so if you're a crypto person you send ten thousand dollars to somebody else that is outside the united states you have to report it uh but that also begs the question in what jurisdiction is a smart contract if it exists on ethereum like does that smart contract is that outside of the united states like it's on the internet is the internet outside of the united states not only that but the the bill also tries to attempt to regulate publishing code which is a legal battle that we have already fought before there's this line that code is speech that came out of the cypherpunks so basically you are not allowed to put strings of characters together in a way that creates code and then publish that to ethereum if this bill goes through without it being regulated uh so elizabeth reign it in reign it in yeah we're disappointed david and i are disappointed and continually disappointed uh there's absolutely no reason for this like number one there's there's no evidence of russians actually like uh russian oligarchs actually using crypto to like you know launder money or evade sanctions or anything like that but um you know even if that was the case what they actually want to do is basically put you in a database they want all of your crypto wallets in a database so they have an id and they they can match your eth address your crypto wallet address to your identity right and that that's what would happen if it was any any 10k transaction that i sent from like one place to another i would have to actually uh make sure the government ids my wallet uh it's absolutely crazy absolutely insane this is um i guess you know the surveillance state trying to reach its tentacles into crypto what i was super disappointed with is actually one of my senators in virginia mark warner uh co-signed this as well so i sent some uh you know tweets his ways you know that said basically this kind of financial surveillance is is garbage and is what's going to make the next generation leave the u.s that i was sad to see him to support this so it's another reminder tweet at your congress representatives tweet at your senators tweet at the people uh who are behind this bill and um and get your opinion out there because this sort of thing can't be pushed forward it's it's unlikely that this will go through is what i would say but the fact that they're even trying yes the fact that they're trying and they're they're couching this in language as if this is being tough on russia when really it's just being tough on annoying citizens no it's like it's like it's an authoritarian anti-speech provision that they're trying to push down our throat using russia as a um a justification for that and there's a reason for doing that and if you want to get a taste on the um what's the right descriptor the dishonest intentions of elizabeth warren there's a clip of her asking um somebody who's an expert in crypto about how somebody can use cross-chain bridges uh to like uh to launder billions and dollars of russian oligarch money and the guy attempts to answer the questions like well elizabeth uh senator warren you can't really there's not enough liquidity and she actually referenced the wormhole bridge between salon and ethereum there's not enough liquidity to support 10 billion dollars going from one chain to another uh like and and she's like and she goes i don't care about the liquidity can you obfuscate funds by going from one chain to another can you obfuscate funds by breaking it up into small little wallets and using tumblers and mixers to obfuscate to obfuscate transactions and the man attempts to answer it's like senator warren like it's too much money the liquidity isn't there and she goes i don't care but stop asking about the liquidity can you do this and she just refused to listen to the answer david they just okay so what i feel like is is nation states and people like politicians like elizabeth warren they feel like because everything's digital that they should have a license to see it all this is like imagine if she put forward a bill that said basically if you keep any valuables i need to know the physical locations of all your vaults you have gold bars in your home you have jewelry like you have any gold which room which room is it in which room in your house the actual location we need an identification system for your physical vaults right if she proposed something like that that's essentially what she's proposing here but because it's digital they think they have a right to like inspect all of this and to have everything registered with with the state it's absolutely ludicrous to me and if this kind of thing goes forward in the u.s um crypto will be fine over the long run but the u.s will get left behind right and that's my big concern here it's like there's there's like that gif of like this sword coming down and like hitting the thing and a sword just shatters like that's what's gonna happen if you keep on trying to swing the sword at crypto uh absolutely um well let's keep moving uh so fifa world cup crypto.com being it's a sponsor of this it's like crypto is is taking all the the sports it can yeah what's going on no that's about it yeah crypto.com in addition to crypto.com arena is now a fifa world cup sponsor for an undisclosed some wow crypto's uh getting everywhere uh guys we'll be right back with the takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this

time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] all right guys we are back with two david hoffman takes in a row back to back my favorite is a great one all right i'll read this out this cultural difference between vitalik and the other co-founders is such a crucial part of this industry and you were talking about a cultural difference this is a quote from laura shin's book cryptopians should i read this last paragraph is this where the good part is yeah yeah that's that last paragraph for sure okay this is from the book cryptopians as ethereum's promise became apparent people jockeyed for positions charles is hospitalized right from uh yeah now cardano who had lobbied to be ceo did people know that he lobbied to be ceo in early ethereum anyway he casually asked gavin over a game of chess to be his chief technology officer cto gavin who on wednesday sent the first ether transaction from his laptop to charles asked vitalik that was cool vitalik being less interested in a title or in ordering people around than in conducting research or learning chinese said sure and gave himself the title c-3po [Laughter] we got a cto we got a ceo and he wants to be c-3po so this is going back to the whole like monk like perception of vitalik the guy does not care about status the guy does not care about material things when everyone else is jockeying for position vitalik is just letting it go in the same way satoshi let bitcoin go and go off into the world vitalik is like oh you're going to be c ceo fine i'll be c-3po and like this is the this is the culture of that's been baked into ethereum not not completely but more than any other smart contract chain that is really what makes me feel good about being part of ethereum this is the culture that i align with because if we're going to make a new financial world order if we're going to make a new money for the whole entire globe we can't have people like charles hoskinson who's jockeying to be a ceo of the new monetary world order yeah yeah you know what so uh p people say uh vitalik has too much power in ethereum and so first of all i disagree but i do agree that that vitalik does have some power in ethereum but there's a difference because the type of power vitalik has isn't hard power it's not top-down authority power it is soft power and the fantastic thing about soft power is soft power is earned right it's like it's a decentralized form of power because it's only power if people actually like follow him and actually believe what he's saying it's not something that he can force on others they have to consent yeah they have to opt in to that sort of like yeah and it's the kind of power um a monk would would have or like a religious leader or like the dalai lama or something like that and i'm not trying to exalt him into like a religious leader but there's an element of that type of leadership of soft power that i think vitalik wields very well and that's the sort of of leadership you need in a decentralized system i've come to realize and it's just this charm in the oh you'll be ceo i'll be c3po it's the charm of that is just what gets people to believe in this man and not only that but like even after vitalik was a billionaire based on on his holdings he was still staying in hostels trying to spend the minimum amount of money just because that's what is downhill for him that's what's natural to him yeah just uh a good person all around um the second david hoffman second david yeah uh this is about music nfts and i was going i was just kind of like thinking about like why do jpeg nfts why are they so much more viral than music nfts and what is a music nft anyways so basically the difference in my mind between jpeg nfts and mp3 nfts is that you can fully experience a jpeg basically instantaneously like because it's an image you can receive it all at once and music nfts take time to experience like if we're talking about a song that's like three plus minutes so like jpegs can be instantly viral right uh mp3s take too much time and i follow that up with the next tweet ryan where you can apply the same thought to like profile picture nfts some nft art is more viral than others like crypto punks extremely obvious aesthetic same thing with board apes also why i'm bullish on mfers right like it's just so obvious what their vibe is it's easy for these uh nfts to live rent free in your brain kind of like a meme right these are memes it's harder like songs definitely go viral but like pictures go viral on on average way more than songs do just because like of how laborious it is to consume a whole entire song versus how laborious it is to just view an image do you also think that like there's an element of um there was an existing uh hole for pfps to fill in a way there's not for mp3s and here's here's what i mean like there's there's like um in all of my social media profiles there's no place where i can like set my profile song right like that was like maybe the myspace days people did that like people would put it on mew anyways right and people hate that right but um for pfps profile pics i have so many places where i can just like display my image there's so much surface area in the web too and i wonder if that's an insight too it's like in order to do really well at least in this phase of the nft game the thing that will make the nft category popular is does it have surface area in web 2. does it have like a ready-made hole it could just like plop in and fill right i think that might be part of it too and this is not to say that music nfts aren't a thing like they are absolutely a thing they just will be a different it should be a different thing it'll fill a different niche than like the profile picture nft it's not going to go like music nfcs aren't going to like go viral in the same way that that jpeg and fts will yeah but we got it all figured out guys that's that's how it's going to happen this is a good take i i hear a lot of people saying this that hey you guys talk about ethan's ultrasound money and deflationary like isn't deflationary bad here's a hot take from kevin uh fitcher i think deflationary systems are kind of whack and it's frustrating that deflation is becoming core ethereum meme thanks bankless guys you can't say that but he's on the optimism team by the way okay deflation mainly really benefits the people who already have stacks to sit on i thought this is a fantastic and that's not the take this is the take this is the response from polynya do you want to read this david yeah polynya says ethereum is inflationary deflation is not a given it is earned through surplus demand the current gas price is 14 gway at this level there is no deflation if deflation is earned it means that the network is undervalued it's a self-correcting system that minimizes deflation okay so like kind of how like eip1559 throttles up or down based on demand polynomial is saying a similar dynamic is happening there's a governor to the system as in if ethereum has a ton of utility if it's very very useful then the block space becomes very very useful and block space becomes a very high in demand and a lot of ether gets burned if ethereum stops becoming useful then there's less blocks based demand therefore less ether is burned and ethereum starts to become inflationary decreasing the value of ether making it easier to transact on ethereum but as ethereum becomes more useful more ethers burned making it deflationary the whole uh uh it's earned concept i think is beautiful that's a fantastic take ethereum is only deflationary if it is earned by being youthful to the world around it so the answer if someone asks you like isn't it a deflationary system like ethereum bad the the answer is ethereum is inflationary if it's not selling any blocks it's inflationary but because it's in demand and selling so many blocks it actually turns out that's deflationary and some point in time it's going to hit this nice equilibrium where those things kind of line up and then the the the whole network and block space and everything is kind of fairly valued the supply of ether is not going to zero it's not going to zero right it's just going down a lot right like well uh justin drake so we were talking ultrasound money case like uh 100 million or so right like under 100 million right like that's probably the long term yeah project but i bet the equilibrium supply is like somewhere between like 85 and 100 million over the very long term like 50 plus years i bet too i bet uh let's talk about this this is an arthur hayes piece probably my favorite written piece of the week uh do you want to pull out some takes from this uh the title of this is energy cancelled yeah energy canceled what's arthur hayes thesis here what's he saying yeah so this is part of the whole macro conversation that's happening with oil and energy in russia but not just that and all over the world and also the energy that is basically imbued into currencies and how uh currencies are basically a store of energy basically and when you expend that energy by inflating your currency well then you're deleting the last bits of energy that your currency has anyways uh arthur hayes says the current petro dollar euro dollar monetary system ended last week which is a huge statement with the confiscation of the russian central bank's fiat currency reserves by the u.s and the eu and the removal of certain russian banks from the swift network in a generation hence when this hopefully sad episode of human history concludes historians will point to 26 february 2022 as the date upon which the system ended and a new currently unknown to us system sprouted also shout out to ray dolly in the changing world world order this is the same energy same vibe uh great take what do you think about that ryan yeah i mean he go he goes on i mean we've been saying that basically too it's like this kind of could mark the end of us uh us dollar monetary supremacy right as being the reserve currency but you know he says what's going to happen is energy will cost more food will cost more as a result of of the sanctions and everyone's going to increase their military spending will further crowd up the civilian economy and i i said because of the sanctions i mean it's what why were the sanctions put in place because putin decided to go invade ukraine right like ultimately that's that's like the root cause that's like the reason why in this case but um i do think it's gonna cost it's going to cost the u.s this is going to accelerate the paradigm shift that we're talking about earlier and that that ray dalio you know talks about in his book to a new world order uh arthur's thesis in this article is basically we'll have to go back to commodity money like bretton woods v3 v3 basically so we had bretton woods original uh v2 1946 us dollar would be the global reserve currency base backed by gold and then we had bretton woods v2 which is like um when nixon got us off the gold standard in the early 1970s and that's been the regime right now bretton woods v3 is something new something different nation states will have to kind of go back to commodity-backed money and arthur's thesis is actually the nation-state money just because of its history will probably be gold so he actually ends this article being like i'm bullish on gold but i'm also super bullish and even more bullish on crypto and for him it's specifically bitcoin but i would also like lump ether in that category and say like more bullish on ether than than bitcoin but those are words in arthur's mouth anyway commodity money like uh death of the u.s dollar as the reserve currency system that future i think is accelerating it still could take many years to play out it's it's like not a transformation that's going to happen instantly but this is another step in that direction and i think has accelerated things um sanctions the war like conflict in ukraine and the globe's global world response to that i think one other piece that i maybe want to mention is he he puts you in the shoes of china and he says china is probably thinking deep and hard about the value of inside money claims in in its fx reserves now that the g7 just seized russia's right so he's saying like are nation states gonna store up their reserve um currencies in the dollar with this kind of global distrust not after the union yeah after after watching the us just rugging in the entire country of russia china's like well i don't want to get rugged for sure so it's going to be it's going to be an interesting uh decade uh for sure and like i think this is just accelerating the regime change yeah ryan when we have our closing statements at the end of the podcast crypto's risky d5 is risky staying in the same spot also risky also risky you don't want to be caught in the same spot during a paradigm shift uh donald glover he's not getting caught in the same spot what's his take here no donald glover gets it so he says this is a quote about nfts nfts are gonna be a thing but not in the way that people think they're gonna be a thing like it'll be way easier to not fake things online and it's gonna affect a lot of other stuff in a way that people won't understand for like another five years oh yeah remember when we had all that corruption in this section and now it's gone because you basically can't lie about this that's probably what's gonna happen uh this is a live quote out of donald glover from south by southwest uh very rare to see a hot and accurate take from a celebrity nice job donald nice job donald we love it we love it yes i think this this man's brilliant i think he's a genius uh yeah so i'm not super surprised that he gets nfts but well articulated um last last take of the week another nft take david what's uh this one from jimmy.e yeah jim jimmy j j1 mmy jimmy.eth he was recently on the overpriced jpegs podcast talking about a very similar subject he goes in the future most nfts will be all data and no media uh and i think we will look back on the current state of nfts with embedded photos uh that aren't actually embedded uh as like analog nfts and so this is a little bit like the loot nft vibe where instead of having like this point to a picture instead all of the value of the nft will be embedded inside of it and we're actually starting to see this i i'll listen to listening to this podcast i learned that the cipher brokers nft project they have a bunch of svg files like all the properties of a of a profile picture nft like the the blue shirt some 3d sunglasses beanie caps uh you know like cypherpunk hair or whatever all of these properties for the cypherpunks and nfts are svg files that are embedded into the ethereum into ethereum on chain and then what the produ what the project does is that it just takes all the different permutations and it layers on all the svg files and so every single thing about the nft is on chain and so completely trustless completely decentralized completely cypherpunk super bullish on that whole entire concept and so the idea that like we are going to point out words for the data that our nfts represents is short term short term yeah that's a really good take and for people who aren't following what an svg file is right so that's basically like it's a different type of image format but it can be all distilled to a bunch of numbers a bunch of data basically and that's different from like bitmap style images of which you know a gif is one and a jpegs one which can't really be distilled into like into like data and can't be embedded on a chain so with like jpeg nfts which have been this current era this current generation of nfts all you can really do on a on chain except in cases like like crypto punks where the image is like really small enough and able to be fully embedded on chain is like you're generally putting a pointer out to an external bitmap image somewhere right with sgv svgs you can just put all of the data on chain and then wow the metaverse could fully manifest this particular object or image in any way it chooses to do so because all of the data behind that image is on chain so that's part of it i don't think jimmy's saying like there's going to be no graphics on chain and it's all going to be like data but it'll be more like vector style images uh rather than maybe like bitmap style jpegs and gifs when we did our defining the metaverse episode ryan the the line the metaverse is rendered at the periphery perfectly aligns with this that's cool data at the center compressed highly dense data at the center and then it's it's rendered locally on your computers because they're just given instructions on how to render it so when we when jimmy says the future of entities will be all data the data is instructions on how to render the metaverse or in and your local computer wherever you are in the world wait who said that the metaverse is rendered at the periphery did we say that that's my line yeah that's a great line that's a david hoffman original brother wow yeah you like that one great no i i love that one that's uh yeah yeah we should start a podcast [Laughter] what are you excited about this week man oh my god ryan okay so i made this meme uh earlier this morning about like all right what narrative am i trying to promote on twitter uh do i want l222 or do i want the merge and so it's the the meme is the guy like sweating his face like doesn't know which button to press like which what do i shill l two two two or do i shield the merge uh because like the thing is i think they're both happening around the same time uh i think l two two two and the merge is gonna happen towards the end of q2 start of q3 mutual climax time i think that's i think that's what's about to happen right wow very exciting year of course somebody would be excited about that a new article by david mutual hoffmann thesis [Laughter] wow this is the uh the type of content people subscribe to vancouver right that's exactly right what are you excited about i don't think i can top that mine was gonna be the institutions are are here they're they're not just coming but they're here uh and that's also an unfortunate turn of phrase anyway institutions are here it's the bottom line so there's this phrase repeated over and over again in 2018 um the institutions are coming the institutions are coming like uh like there won't be a bear mark it was kind of the implication because like big copium institutions would buy our bags yeah and that really never happened nope uh the institutions were nowhere in 2018 2019 goldman sachs was not talking about digitization on their homepage uh they were not buying uh d5 no one believed in it ethereum was dead bitcoin was just hanging by a thread but now they're here okay like this week digitization on the goldman sachs homepage they just announced their first trade we talked about that earlier bridgewater ray dalio massive fund not only like in terms of assets under managed but but in terms of like institutional respect right this guy is like a global leader they're doing crypto now uh qualcomm even if they're a metaverse fund right the institutions are here they're not coming anywhere they're here and that is like i you know that is a shift i don't know when it happened it feels like um i kind of thought in the in in the days of uh you know 2019 2019 when i somewhat thought that that meme could be true uh that there would be like a big announcement and somebody would be like yep we're here now guys well it's actually just happened without people knowing about like uh about it ends up happening on a week by week basis um but they are quite obviously here and what i think that means david is uh like we kind of won right you know i'm crypto's not going anywhere at this point in time the world's biggest institutions are behind it that means nation states will eventually fall in line because of lobbying yep and it's it'll be a slow trickle at times sometimes it'll feel like a stampede but the institutions are already here and i feel like i've just realized that maybe in the last uh last week or two it's not as cool as yours okay but it's it's it's what i had hey the institutions are here for the for the mutual climax that's right we are ever gonna get all right uh meme of the week guys um what are we looking at here david yeah this is uh sorry for the polycaste listeners this one's not gonna translate very well but we're gonna watch a short video of two high schoolers in a lunch room having a break dance competition so we have a guy who's decently good at break dancing no i'll give him a soft five out of ten going up against like a kind of a white skinny nerdy kid who doesn't you wouldn't
