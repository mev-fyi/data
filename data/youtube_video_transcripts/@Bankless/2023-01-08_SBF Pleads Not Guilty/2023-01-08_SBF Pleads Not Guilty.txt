when the judge asked what do you plead Sam bankman freed he said not guilty I'm innocent I know there's been some conspiracy maybe he has some get out of jail free card what do you think about this the plea deal that he got was so bad that he was like damn it I'll just fight this they basically gave him zero compromises on his plea deal well this is an interesting opinion piece uh read in coindesk basically the idea that maybe Sam begman freed actually is so deluded that he thinks he's innocent he thinks that he is the victim yeah and I think that's the case with Sam bankman freed what's the probability that Sam goes to jail this year I think it would be rational to bet my net worth yeah your network yeah it would not be rational because there's no upside David you don't have to do that
