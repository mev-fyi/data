what's up coordination today on the pod we have biology the one and only biology who's just written a book about the network state the network state is a highly aligned online community with the capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states so we talk about ethereum dows how to create more coordination across network states what would have to be true to build a coordination a network collective that perhaps eventually becomes a network state that is creating more coordination for network states and nations states across the world what will be enabled by this new technology as opposed to social media just destructing things how do we construct things with collective action in a network state world so biology is this extremely prolific philosopher thinker successful startup founder started earn.com which exited to coinbase and i am just so thrilled to have him on the pod talking about network states and how can we build and fund digital public goods and public infrastructure in a network state world this is one of my favorite episodes that we've ever done and i hope

man good good to be here yeah so glad to have you thanks for agreeing to do this greenfield podcast episode on the network state so tell us about the network state uh what is it why does it matter so uh the network c is a new book um that is in v1 meaning i am updating it it's at thenetworkstate.com and um the the fundamental concept behind it is that you know we've started new companies that's google and we started new communities that's facebook and started new currencies with bitcoin and ethereum is it possible to start new cities or even new countries and if it is that would be a really big deal and that is sort of the in a sense the cutting edge of social technology in terms of using technology to align people for you know common good collective good etc online i think what i've tried to do in the book is talk about a new emergence mode for um a state and you know one way of thinking about it is 2020 was arguably the year where a big chunk of the world if not you know the the elite of the world went digital first and so after 2020 things happened digital first and physical second that's not to say that physical isn't important but physical is now a premium product for example meetings occur digitally first and only you know if you really need them do you physically go and fly in in person conversations happen in whatsapp groups and signal chats and only very very uh high value ones or infrequent ones happen in person and you know currency for example i mean that's that kind of flipped a while ago communication flipped a while ago you know and um in the sense that probably most communication was digital or electronic and you know not printed out on a piece of paper quite a while ago maybe maybe even 10 years ago but each of those are flippings and if you had a graph of you know offline versus online you know communication goes and then transaction goes and so on and so the the directional that is digital first and so uh you know how would that exactly work lots of people have kind of proposed sort of vague things or things that i think are close but not exactly right and i talk about why they're close for example i don't think of facebook as a network state or bitcoin or wework they have aspects that are similar like you know facebook has this huge international community but it doesn't have any collective consciousness that is to say those three something billion people do not think of themselves as facebook users do not think of zuck as their leader he's just sort of like almost the bar bar owner or something like that they don't report to him in a sense in the same way they do to a president or to the chinese people have a very different relationship with xi jinping than facebook users due to zuckerberg facebook employees fold into zuckerberg that's different you know they've signed a different social contract upon entering and a big part of it is about expectations it's possible that you know zuck if he wanted to could um have not not a click-through but a very serious social smart contract that he deployed to facebook members that they sort of opted into governance and what exactly would that mean so i've got the one sentence definition which is a network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states so highly aligned online community meaning it's not just a bunch of game of thrones fans who have nothing in common but their interest it is people who really have a bunch of deep moral beliefs in common at least one commandment in common but like a serious thing um a capacity for collective action so again it's not just an online group it's not just a bunch of disorganized tweeters it is folks who can work together and just to understand this point which is why it's so important if you have just 100 random people and you tell them to go and burn something down burn down a building i mentioned this point in the book but 100 people you say go burn down that house uh they can they can handle it because you know one guy grabs a brick and some guy grabs a torch and they go to it if you tell those hundred people go build a building that's much harder right because um first of all they might not be able to do it you're gonna need uh you know cement and you're gonna need a plan and not everybody can go after it at once and you you'll need a foreman and some blueprints and skilled electricians basically paralyzing building is much harder than paralyzing destruction and so what happens today is that the collective action problems online i've written about this are you know are largely cancellation and destruction and social mobbing and so on because that's what the interfaces of these uh you know like social media programs allow you know but it's also something that's fundamentally easier to do it's easier to destroy than to build for the reasons i just outlined you know like the it's good that building is profitable or else people wouldn't do it you know because it's rewarding in all senses of the term you know it's like you feel like you've accomplished something you know first and foremost and you gain the money to be able to do some more of it and so on and so forth if that wasn't the case it'd be you know people just destroy everything and you'd have a some world so the the capacity for collective action is a very non-trivial thing cryptocurrency is a part of it but not the only part i think leadership is a part tasking is a part and the alignment is very much a part that people have to feel like they're they're there for the same cause you can have all the tools all the software but if the mental software isn't there in people's heads the shared values that underpin the valuations if that isn't there then then you're not there okay so it's a highly aligned online community with the capacity for collective action that right there is what i'd call a network union a digital union a group of people that gets together and that does something for their members collectively not necessarily solely negotiating with some malign employer though that is a that is part of it uh they could also um you know go and uh crowd purchase something um for example they they buy things in bulk uh a network union could go and uh you know crowdfund something like invest in a member's company they could you know rt something and help that members you know work of art gain exposure and so and so forth the network union is there for the benefit of the community and each person pays dues and or you know puts in their time and you might have a cryptocurrency there uh which sort of bookmarks you know some person couldn't make it for this session so they pay in and they're substituting capital in in the form of labor obviously get coin and everything you're doing is very much in line with all of this type of stuff you know task boards for communities that have alignment i think is is really important and so far you know those communities have been like companies where the alignment is provided by the boundary and membrane of the company and the hiring policy and so on but you could have a boundary and membrane of a community and a moderator policy which is just like a subreddit joined this community if you share these values and then eventually it becomes a dues-paying thing right okay so highly relied on a community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world so that third clause that you know once you have the alignment okay that is upstream of being able to do things together online and one of the big things one of the biggest things you could do together is online you gather the funds to buy land offline and live together and crucially and this is a very important point not all in one place okay so i've got this gif and that is actually the failure mode of city states and startup cities and lots of other things is they didn't decentralize the physical location okay so take a look at this so this is a gif that you just sent across that shows a network straight state growing from tokyo to mumbai to delhi and the annual income population and the amount of territory that it owns grows over time that's right and the thing about this is um you know technically i define it as a network state only when it gains diplomatic recognition from an existing sovereignty from yeah exactly so yeah so i have a i have a technical four-stage kind of thing which is i i may lose the battle where people will say i'm founding networks say casually but really i think it should be startup society network union network archipelago network state okay so startup society is just you know i'm one person it's like a startup company the implication is that it's early but has you know aspirations of being great okay or big network union as a digital union that's a group online with a capacity for collective action a network archipelago or physical archipelago that is um something that looks like this it's got crowdfunded territory around the world and those little pieces are all knit together into something that feels like the same territory using like the uh the capacity for um you know single sign-on and augmented reality and so on that um that we that we now have for example like just the simplest version is you walk into any google office around the world and it's a little slice of google it's got google branding your google badge works you plug in your laptops on the google internet all of these little fractal pieces around the world are homogenized and connected under the same ideology right and um if you go a little bit further the uh you know into what's coming i think um just like the iphone was sort of predictable if you were following mobile in the 2000s you know not ultra predictable it's surprising um augmented reality glasses that look like glasses but that you can tap you know like snapchat speckles i talked about this is one of the most predictable outcomes of the book or of technology those glasses are um are something that will allow since people will wear them all the time and deliver them in a heads-up way it actually adds in a sense even more online time because you don't need to pick up your phone anymore you can just tap your glasses and sort of just basically be you have your hands free and you're online and guess what you can see augmented reality ghosts or projections from other people in your network state or startup society in your zone and talk to them as if they were there and if you think about it most of your interface with another human being i mean sometimes of course you want to like you know give them a hug or you know like you know high five or something like that but a big chunk of it is basically hands off it's audio visual and so you know as i said digital first and physical is a premium product right like you know for a lot of daily purposes you know digital would be sufficient and all these people they you could imagine actually some sort of 2030 zoom that um used you know various kinds of signals so that you had a bunch of people in four different locations sitting around table but the other three were in different locations you know what i'm saying and it's like telepresence yeah telepresence of an augmented reality kind right where you didn't even need to right so the point is you know those are things like uh you know ens uh unlocking of doors right or um making have you seen ar kit like sigils hovering in midair where you have to hold an nft you see a sigil there that indicates that this startup society has a territory so you start thinking about essentially the augmented reality slash transfer you know such enos based transformation of the world such that your digital key unlocks a different view on the world than other people have if you have the crypto passport for the star of society this entire building suddenly has markings on it that indicates that you can go in and otherwise anybody walking by their ar glasses showed to be a nondescript building okay so the return of secret societies um but at scale it's really secret states okay so this is kind of very you know it's very satoshi it's very cryptocurrency it uh you know one of the things about that graph that i just showed is that's a lot of nodes there but guess what not all of them have to be world visible they could have different levels of visibility some of them could be encrypted some of them in the sense that you can only see them if you have you know an nft if you're if you're part of the community for more than a year and have more than x amount of commitment then you can see the um you know the the jerusalem or the uh the rome of that startup society right you can see the you know the capital city basically are capital cities perhaps right and uh so so that's the crowdfund territory around the world and the last bit is actually really important eventually gains diplomatic recognition um from pre-existing states so why do i include something like that see this is why i would never call myself you know a libertarian in a you know there's certain libertarian ideals that i understand and i think have you know have been useful in the same way there's certain liberal ideas conservative ideas you know even anarchist heads that i think have um have moved things forward or at least contributed something but the thing is that the sort of the i'll just poke at you know the naive libertarian who you know made me consider themselves such okay um really thinks they can go and just you know put a flag on some weird edge territory and then call themselves you know the president of something right and of course the issue with this is you know them and what army but as they talk about actually it's not just them and one army it's really them and what nation them and what country right um what group considers themselves the natural inhabitants of this land what nation is there right just like a cryptocurrency if you just considered yourself to have a zillion dollars or whatever no one would care but if there's a community around you that gives it value right that's a skilled larp and actually all social constructs are in a sense scaled larps you know meaning you know live-action role-playing games right so the last bit on diplomatic recognition is really important because um what does that mean it means it could be a city like miami it could be a a internal jurisdiction like you know province or what have you like texas funny called texas province but because i use the term state otherwise right it could be an internal administrative division um or it could actually be a sovereign country like el salvador's recognition of bitcoin as a national currency or cure body or something like that but the i call this the bootstrap recognizer the first legacy state or government that recognizes a network state and integrates with it we've already got some preston for that you have things like tuvalu doing you know and colombia doing deals with the dot tv and dot co domains right you have um wyoming uh and i i'm sure if there's a netherlands or a denmark um wyoming and there's some place in europe recently that recognized dows and ethereum and started integrating in the sense of the ethereum network right you have um you know the miami and new york city mayors uh and el salvador you know miami and nyc are taking salaries in bitcoin if i recall correctly and el salvador has bitcoin is there sovereign currency so we're seeing the diplomatic relations between nation states and network states because these network states have bootstrapped enough legitimacy through their network effects to actually be diplomatically worthy as opposed to some guy who just declares his back backyard a new area exactly right and one of the things in there if you go to the longer definition the last part of the longer definition says an on-chain census that proves a large enough population income and real estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition okay right so why is that part why do i front page that well most people don't know this but the u.s census is actually in the constitution of the united states did you know that uh only because i've been doing my research on you but i didn't know that before this okay fine so so that's kind of interesting right because um you know the census in this case uh you know what we call a census in here uh you know today we might call it a dashboard that dashboard that i just showed you that gif showing the counters at the top people will not trust those numbers at the beginning they will want to click into them they will want to look at proof of human which i know that they both talked about and they'll want to look at proof that the tasks and the the income is actually happening they'll want to click into proof of you know real estate and each of those will be diligence processes where people will be diligencing these crypto oracles and this is i think the right level you know where it's okay for some of those things to fail at times right yeah but people are really starting to try to put weight on this stuff you know it's kind of like if you turn them uh use something in anger right fire a shot in anger right it means to do something for real you know you're not just doing toy exercise anymore you're actually trying to use that new programming language you you learn to solve a real problem right now you're not doing for the sake of learning your the training wheels are off right so using i mean obviously people are using crypto oracles for real things today in terms of trading but this is kind of cool we're using it to prove that this thing is real in a publicly diligenceable way right and yet a privacy-preserving way so it could be something where those 1729 members all sign something where they're dot ether dresses to prove that they are who they are online yeah no i i just think that you know it's also a way of bootstrapping legitimacy just from the start i remember when bitcoin first launched we launched this results page that showed the traction going through the network this is back in 2017 when every other thing in the blockchain ecosystem was just like a hope and a prayer and a white house yeah exactly she helped us like hey look here's the live network stats of this and it helped us bootstrap legitimacy which is reflective it helps it helps the network grow as well and remember like i think i was your first seed investor like you know very very early on if i'm not mistaken yeah which i appreciate belgium was the first i think check into the the round after consensus and your conviction really really meant a lot to aspalji well i i i still believe in you guys and i believe in what you're doing and you know one thing is i've always been a believer in the use of web3 to uh build genuine ties between people not just speculation and stuff like that i mean i i think of speculation is it's like okay that it's out there but it has to be sort of um you know connected the liquidity and all the financial engineering should be connected to something of impact right yeah and and you know sometimes it can be for example like commodities futures uh you know initially agricultural futures you have a farmer and they've got a crop and they've got an uncertain future price you know for that crop they don't know if their potatoes are going to be worth 10 bucks or one buck but three bucks they can pay their rent and and so on so they sell the futures at three bucks and then some guy with deep pockets um you know does the other side of that transaction and they book the upside in the event that it goes to 10 they make seven dollars per but they also take the downside loss they're basically a risk-on they're buying the risk their guy is selling the risk that's a totally reasonable thing for you know finance that's a good thing and there's lots of other things in finance you know interest rates and you know npv and being able to transform cash flows all that stuff is good but it's just something where it's like you don't want to build this house of cards on top but nothing too much so the foundation there is the physical product so we want to be actually creating a lot of these features on physical yams not digital ems so it's funny you say it i actually say in this case the foundation is the moral fiber that binds the community okay because the humans ultimately are what are sort of upstream of the whole thing any physical stuff will come out of their effort and you know one one concept i have is you know like an uptime tracker mm-hmm you know like that it's like it's ping ping it's like supposed to be at 99 yeah yeah exactly so one concept i have is a moral uptime tracker okay so like a like a tracking poll will judge sentiment over time and then sentiment can fall off a cliff okay and uh you know i've got um you know i'm sure can screencaster or can can you can you project some images i'm not sure if you can i don't think you can unfortunately but if you link the image here we can put in the show notes maybe we can just speak to it in the meantime all right i'll speak to it so basically um there's a graph which shows so everybody's familiar with like the graph of like a like a stable coin losing its peg now unfortunately unfortunately yes unfortunately so that happens over the course of like a few hours right basically a day now there's another graph that actually kind of looks like that it's a it's a gallup poll church membership among us adults now below 50 okay and it's something where it's like stable at like 75 for a long time in the last few years has just catastrophically fallen off a cliff to like sub 47 and keeps declining okay the time scale is not um you know a few hours it's not one day it's like 70 years right so it is you know thousands of x creator but in a sense it's similar because it's you know something losing its peg that thing that people thought was a constant is becoming a variable okay and so uh you know it it was okay if it fluctuated like 75 76 72 lots of things could be taken for granted once it was there but when you undercut the foundations now you have people who just fundamentally disagree on core principles you can't take that for granted anymore right and um it's also trust in government looks not exactly the same but similar it's a long slide and now it's in like the 20s in terms of people trust in government for generations okay yeah and you know the thing about this is you start thinking okay what if uh you know your community has a moral uptime tracker you have certain moral principles i'm not saying to be clear they don't have to be like the ten commandments or what have you but one of the points to make is you probably want a one commandment something that your community right some you know uh it could be for for get coin that um i don't know collective uh you know collective self-sacrifice is good or something like that yeah i don't know building fund public goods is i think bitcoin's one commandment great okay and then you have derivations from that you know open source is good and yeah being civil to people online is good and so on and so forth right you have various derivations from that that follow from that first thing and you can this is probably one of those derivations it's discovering like what regen web 3 could look like yeah there you go right so the the thing is that basically um the uh the problem is that um many people have those moral premises implicit uh at companies it's interesting you know the many companies have you know they talk about company culture and company culture becomes explicit when you're beyond a certain scale where it needs to be conveyed you know here's how we do things we do it x y and the most trivial is you know we're using google docs rather than word and we're using uh you know twitter rather than instagram and so and so forth those are just sort of like symptoms rather than the the cause yeah but basically those are those are useful because they're explicitly articulable you know and they're some of them are more substantive you can think of culture as a set of sliders like i'm a full in-person company or a full remote company right yeah i i pay market compensation or highly equity-based and so it's like all of those are sliders that you can set and different combinations will work it you know it's not that there's any one combination that works and the thing is that culture is a set of sliders you know culture is this thing that is less important as like a one-person show or a small group because you kind of take it for granted but as the company grows the culture becomes more and more important and for startup society though it flips around the culture is everything the culture is actually you know as with a startup company the innovation is a technology because you're selling an individual product to people for startup community the innovation is the morality because you don't necessarily need to have because it's hard to by the way have flying cars and other kinds of things forget all that and i should say forget all of it but basically you could have hundreds of star society innovations that are not based on technological innovation but based on a social innovation and you say the way society is doing is bad here's what's doing here's how it's here's what should be good and you have history plus graphs to back up what you're saying okay anyway but go ahead and that becomes like the index indexer for your startup society or sorry for your like network collective so for get coin it's building fund public goods you could do it around keto you could do it around being a mother you could do it around any of these interests so we're indexing online based off of the interests that we have and offline in nation states is based of our geography which is more or less inherited that's right but the thing is that one thing that's exciting to me about online tasking and get coin and you know what i what i call you know i had this thing on crypto credentials and ntfs and you know the concept of you know soul bounds or what have you all of those you put those together you know puja's paper and you you put this together and um you have uh you have something where um there's there's sort of portability between communities because you don't just have unchained tasks you have on chain credentials and those unchained credentials could be an endorsement from somebody you know and devolve endorse this person kevin endorsed this person it could be oh this person came in every single day for uh you know a year to this community forum and you know they they just organize stuff they clean the whiteboards whatever they just show diligence and public spirit and so on and that's the kind of person that would be an asset to many different kinds of communities you know right uh or you have somebody who let's it's even as trivial as okay they worked out every single day in the crossfit community that's somebody who probably will also be able to be disciplined enough for keto kosher you know it's almost like your reputation becomes your collateral in this one commandment moral fiber being the basis of the entire community so as you accrue reputation over time that makes you trustworthy which creates a positive sum economy on on top of that is is that i know you're excited about identity is is that sort of why or how would you how would you state why you're so excited about identity in this credentialing why am i excited about identity because identity is the it's like the hub where everything else is you know like it's uh a walkie.eth and you know front slash everything else they're not really front sights what i mean like you first do effectively an ens lookup and then you're pulling all these other fields and so everything is bound to that so your entire crypto resume all your credentials uh you log in with that your um that's really your digital passport and then you know the algorithm parses all of your on-chain contributions and votes and stuff like that and determines whether you are admitted to the community or not and if not why and it tells you you have to do x y and z and many of those things are not fundamentally commercial they are non-commercial but they wouldn't it wouldn't be possible to defend them algorithmically without all of the commerce and value around nfts and around you know fungible tokens for that matter right so this is really about how we how we coordinate with each other the accrual of reputation informs the marketplace of ideas and how we transact with each other the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet opera

about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts so i guess you know i'd love to focus the rest of the episode on the network state is such an amazing book and we'll put a link to it in the in the show notes i'd encourage the readers to to to check it out um but and you've done a couple of different podcasts over the last few days i would encourage the listeners to check those out but i think that the highest use of this podcast time biology would be talk be talking about how we can build network states that increase the capacity for collective action how do we build a coordination which is like a network state or a network collective before it gives gains physical territory or diplomatic recognition that the main export is more coordination so like forkable open source software um and and basically what we want to do is increase the capacity for coordination for all other network states in nation states this is get coins one commandment uh which is building funding public goods and i guess like my first prompt for you within the category of that is how do we increase our capacity for collective action within these nation states how do we build public infrastructure within these these nation states how do we fund it how do we build it and how do we coordinate better using network states than than we have in the past so within existing nation states are you saying or yeah well well i mean i guess like network states or nation states i mean my theory is basically forkable open source software is powerful because we can build smart contracts that solve the prisoner's dilemma and because anyone can fork it it's not like you have zuckerberg extracting from your community your community can bootstrap its own like prisoners dilemma solving coordination tools i guess i want to hear your take on these things totally totally so actually a couple of things one is um you know i'll probably have like a longer answer for telecom a very thoughtful review and so on one thing he talks about is how he'd like to see more on exit to community and actually i do have a whole section on m a of network states and how a founder can hang up the cleats and so on and so forth but another thing is not just exit to community but exit to world which is open sourcing the whole thing and having anybody have it right so rather than one founder giving it to end people a community he gives it to everybody which is exit to world right um so that's kind of one part the other part is you're saying how can you help existing nations existing neuroscience well it kind of you know not all nation states are in the same in my view negative shape but first of all the term nation state people use it as a compound noun but for example you know maybe maybe if you've read it do you know the difference between the nation and the state yeah so i think that the state is is sort of like the bureaucracy that organizes things but there's different nations within states so like the reds and the blues in the united states or the kurds within the iraqis is the example that you that you get yeah exactly and so the thing is that's right that's right so basically the nation it comes from like the same kind of root word as natality like common birth common descent you know common genetics or history or culture or language you know like the japanese people have descended from you know and they speak the same japanese language and so on there's a japanese state which is a tiny layer on top of the japanese people you know that's that's a you know today it's a democracy in the past it was like you know imperial japan and and you know before that it was uh something else and the the thing is that you know france understands this well because on it's like fifth republic or something you know and uh so they just keep changing out this layer and the french people uh you might say they remain the same but what's interesting is french nationalism itself is something of a social con not something very much a social construct um hobbs balm who are you know quote in the book he he cites a fact which says or like he says that only a small percentage of you know people around the time the french revolution spoke we'd think of today as french this at the time they spoke many other kinds of dialects and then nationalism at that time was a left-wing ideology which said let's unify this huge group of people under what's common which is our language and um you know the the the administrative you know uniformity um let's overthrow you know the royals and the monarchs and and so on and so forth okay and so the thing is that uh when you talk about capacity for collective action it is about tools absolutely it's about tools that is very important but it's about beliefs and alignment it's like you want people to want to do the right thing together and um you know having values being explicit now you don't have to crucially you don't have to enumerate every single thing that people believe because then you'll get into what scott alexander uh you know called scissor statements right or um the uh you know the famous uh joke about like christian denominations uh dude i've never heard that one no one let me see if i can go something like this once i saw this guy in a bridge about to jump i said don't do it he said nobody loves me i said god loves you do you believe in god he said yes i said are you a christian or a jew he said christian i said me too protestant or catholic he said protestant i said me too what franchise he said baptist i said me too northern baptist or southern baptist he said northern baptist i said me too northern conservative baptist or northern liberal baptist he said northern conservative baptist i said me too northern conservative baptist great lakes region or northern conservative baptist eastern region he said you know northern conservative baptist great electrician and they said northern conservative baptist great lakes region council of 1912. i said die heretic and i pushed him over right and you know that's like a classic you know sort of joke about you know when people really took the christian you know stuff uh you know seriously right yeah exactly and and the thing is if you look at crypto tribalism or you look at eunuchs or you look at you know there's certain aspects of human nature with the fissioning and factionalization and so on like you have something really big and you know communism splits and you know so and so forth right um and so you you get go ahead yeah yeah i was going to say i was going to sort of combine it also to crypto and say like as long as you're a regen web 3 etherean uh and not a dj ethereum then you're fine with b and i won't yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly and you know what the thing about this is once you start thinking about those scissor statements and and just to clarify you should google this it's like um sort by controversial create short story by scott sky alexander so scissor statements are a statement that like basically one group he says one group thinks is true and the other group thinks is false um but but you know they both think it's obviously true or obviously false i won't even repeat a scissor statement here um actually you know a good example of one that's less hot today but that was a big deal like 15 years ago did iraq have wmds right like so that was something which you know some group thought was obviously true because you know like the un said this and that and their group says obviously false and you know blah blah blah and so that's a great example of something that just gets people bickering because one group thinks it's obviously true that our group thinks it's obviously false and so you want to minimize i mean there's different ways of dealing with this right one is to not allow anybody to say any sister statements okay that's actually not at you know whether by convention or so on people you have this convention like don't talk about religion or politics you know um so that was like kind of one thing the then with social media everybody could talk about anything and this these seem to be some of the most engaging topics so they got a lot of engagements they scissored up the whole country and and you know so on and so forth right the second possibility is you select people on scissor statements and so they uh you know these are like boolean variables and let's say each one cuts not exactly 50 of the population but it cuts into two so maybe this is a 30 70 split and a 20 80 split and now you're down to this group of people that agrees with you on all these core premises and they really agree with you etc okay great and the third possibility is something like the synonymous economy where you only disclose those aspects that people really need to know and all the rest is done through cryptography and whatnot and you bring your minimum necessary self to work recognizing that you know there's something that you know you you basically just don't want to know it's uh you heard the term tmi too much information yeah right yeah you literally don't want to know and it's different sense of tmi right and um so the the point being that um scissor statements are something to manage for collective action it's not just about the tools that's the software it's about the beliefs in people's heads the intellectual software you know their morals and their beliefs and alignment what they think of as good and bad yeah so it seems like in order to you you kind of want to close the scissor so we can do that with zero knowledge cryptography bottoms up open source software that creates cooperation across distance and it seems like to me the opportunity here is to create bottoms-up coordination in the nation as opposed to just the top-down coordination that has come from the state in the past and so it bottoms up public goods that creates cooperation across distance with these like scissored groups it feels like the opportunity for me with web3 and with with network states uh i'd be curious to your reaction to that i think that's good i'm definitely supportive of building organic communities um and you know the thing is like localism is kind of a good concept except i think you need a digital localism because most people don't know their neighbors anymore you know but they know people who are their social network neighbors right so their neighbors in the in the network state well their neighbors in the cloud become their neighbors on the earth right right so because they group together they have common values and they get you know some plot of land in ohio or something like that you have sub community sub networks within the network i mean one way of thinking about it is um i go through a bunch of different authors who have thought about what is a nation and they have it's kind of like the tale and the snout and so on of the elephant they're like oh a nation is um go ahead oh it's just going to explain the uh analogy that you made there where you've got five blind men and an elephant and one of them grabs it says and says he grabs the trunk and says this is a tree and then another grabs the tusk and says this is a sphere and then another one grabs the eyes and says this is a squid or something like that and they not all of them fail to grasp the entire elephant so you're saying there are different authors that have grasped different parts of what a nation means and uh but but yeah continue after that yeah and i offer obviously you know maybe i'm just grabbing you know the horns or something like that the tusks but um but i but my definition is kind of interesting maybe interesting it's a computational definition that a nation is a densely connected subgraph in the social network or in a social network right why do i say that because a complete graph is one where every node is connected to every other node okay but a densely connected subgraph means that if you have a hundred nodes they don't have necessarily all 100 to choose two mutual you know connections and and that's a symmetric graph you could have asymmetrical graphs or things they're not necessarily all hundred choose two connections but they have way more internal connections than they do with a hundred random people it's a genuine community it's a densely interlinked community of people who like each other and work with each other and share the same values and so forth that starts to define what like a nation is not the lines on a map so this is similar to like the what's funny about it is it's actually uh like the liberal or internationalist view of what a nation is a nation is not necessarily people you know related by blood or what have you it's those people who you know in renon's you know words have done great things together and wish to do more you know it's it's a you know they've signed the social contract to be you know that that's not renowned that's you know rousseau's right the vernan result model is um renault they've done great things and want to do great things together so uh for the state you know you sign the the social contract to be part of the state so the nation state is kind of the combination of those two concepts right there's a group that you know has uh like this common you know alignment and and they have whether it's language or culture or you know a feeling of collective purpose and they have a government a state that helps coordinate them now to your point could you have like these you know communities that are that are doing collective things within a larger state and so on sure you could and and that's good okay and you know for many things it'll be fine to do that no one's gonna care if you are you know just cleaning up the neighborhood or something like that or you know building open source stuff most of those things will be okay except i do think that nowadays anything that's beautiful in some way someone is going to attack it for for some grounds oh it's exclusive in this way oh you know it's not patriotic in this way etc so you just can't be like you know the naive farmers and not have any form of intellectual self-defense okay it's got your play the game civilization i have not okay so in civilization basically it's a you know it's this game where you you know you can start as the iroquois or the indians or you know the russians or whatever you know you can basically start as different civilizations and you build up right and the thing about civilization is there's guaranteed way to lose which is just in put everything into you know commerce and technology and not have any defense whatsoever and try to ascend the tech tree and what happens the guy next door who sends in like one spearman just takes all your stuff right that's what happens when you're at 99 you know 100 commerce in technology zero percent defense okay conversely if all you do is you crank out soldiers and stuff well you know it's saying uh you know you don't have a civ you may have defense but you don't have a civilization worth defending and so you just end up as this sort of primitive barbarian tribe that's attacking and you don't level up and so the right approach is a v3 that says okay i'm going to allocate some to building and some to critiquing the critiquers of builders that's a digital version of it right because right most of society i think is over is invested in critiquing and tearing things down there's some group that says ignore all that and just build and i i vibe with the second group a lot but i also think some of them are naive because they'll build something great and guess what the critiquers are like armed robbers gangs who's the only thing is patrolling the internet and finding some way to try to bully you into handing it over to them right and go ahead as you can see it reminds me of um if you ever hear vitalik talk about proof of stake he talks about in order to design a economic network that is secure you have to make it a thousand times cheaper to defend than it is to attack and what this does over time is like with proof-of-stake ethereum it hardens it so that basically any attacker is going to have to expend way way way more resources in order to tear down what you're building and therefore it deters uh yes from doing that so it creates anti-fragility at the base layer that's right and there's different ways of doing defense pseudonymity is a form of defense where so long as you may opsec remain uh maintain opsec which is hard okay but yeah that's kind of a form of sort of passive self-defense right it's not the self-defense of a gun it is actually in a sense security through obscurity um you people don't have 33 bits on you you know what 33 bits is it's uh arvid and orion's concept of um two to the 33rd is uh like eight billion and so that's seven something billion people in the world with 33 bits of independent information on somebody you could de-anonymize them and so the degree of pseudonymity you have can be thought of as being on a continuum like you have 10 bits of anonymity you're part of a set a pseudonymity set of 1000 people if you have 20 bits you're part of a million people right so you put enemies into me on a continuum and certain actions like showing a particular crypto credential it shows now that you're part of a million person group right but it doesn't fully de-anonymize you and uh you know so that may be a sufficient you know that may be an acceptable cost of a decrement in pseudonymity of reduction in opsec to achieve whatever goal you want so basically like pseudonymity is is a way to be defensive and anti-fragile um you know i guess you know are there other ways that we can create more coordination and and and be able to build these digital public goods and and not do it in a naive way like how do we how do we create more coordination and not have it be the naive variety we're all just kind of like pie in the sky building these non-defensible systems well i think you know you should you should basically well first of all having a moral one commandment is important because that's that's yeah it's dual purpose actually right if you really believe that something you're doing is good and you've got um you know hundreds of citations and videos and films and you can show the deficiencies of society at large and so and so forth you have an argument for your right to exist and somebody who's coming at you and trying to delegitimize you well they will have to punch their way through all those citations and argue because everybody in your community is equipped with that initial set of shields of citations that knock them down and the initial at least the uh it might be by the way it might be the case that even despite that you've gotten something wrong and your community fizzles out and it doesn't test empirically and so on and so forth that actually happened in many of the american communes they just their moral innovation didn't work just like many startups start companies don't work right but the one commandment gives that self-defense because now if somebody wants to critique at least you know the lazy v1 obvious you know kind of attacks you know that that falls on deaf ears and frankly most of the sort of marauding social media people that want to attack don't have any depth to their thinking you know for example there's this guy the other day who's like oh oh my god i can't believe you made all this money and you're unpatriotic and you're now exiting oh you trade or blah blah and it's like wait a second um you know this is like uh this is the kind of person who wanted h1bs to come to the country to work hard to do all this stuff to not choose other countries but now it says they can't leave but they're slaves right and you know doesn't understand that actually the rest of the world doesn't have you know shootings and has reproductive choice and you know other stuff like this person's like very entitled in a certain way and you know that they will in a different context talk about how america is a nation of immigrants and how good that is but then they hate the immigrant and every immigrant is taught a logically an immigrant right they emigrated from somewhere are we saying that someone who immigrates from india is betraying india or from poland they're betraying poland this is the stupidest thing in the world they're you know like you're supposedly you know we don't people don't even think about that part of it right by saying that their ancestors who got on you know the ships to come to there was a mayflower ellis island or got a plane that they were betraying their home country i don't think so and uh moreover it doesn't have to be like are we saying like you know somebody who comes from south america latin america that they have to fix the you know the the problems of the political system in their home country before coming here uh no no i do not believe that that you can put that you know onus on every single person right um and so so folks who haven't thought it through will try these in my view kind of stupid arguments and you can just knock that down with you know like there's a few citations there i could really write a whole book on just that on the right to exit and in fact it's actually one of the un's fundamental rights article 13 is uh you know everyone has the right to leave any country including their own right and um that doesn't mean the right to enter everywhere by the way just like you know you can't imprison somebody in your house but that doesn't mean that you somebody can enter every house those are those are you know different things but it does mean that you can't have like this you know sir prison status the point is that's an example of somebody who's just got a lazy attack that you know just easily kind of batted away because they really haven't thought through the morality of it at all you know and so thinking through the morality of it is uh it's basically like programming the software of people's heads having a really clear sense of why they're doing what they're doing and the ability for them to defend that on their own or in groups and frankly to interrogate it because you know what it might be inconsistent you know this premise might not add up and so that ethical thinking is i think really underappreciated because when you have true clarity of purpose and when people really really really really believe in what they're doing that's when you build great things in my view it's just so interesting that well first off with the right to exit i was talking to someone as i was doing my research for this podcast and one interesting sort of observation biology was that network states are going to allow refugees to resettle in new places more easily so say you're in syria you're in the ukraine and you have to go west because of some sort of physical war you're gonna be able to reset resettle in your new place uh yes easier because you're bringing your assets with you but also your your your connections from the network state into into that nation so so it creates more of a right to exit in the physical world you can actually have this pretty interesting thing there like digital government jump at this did this thing where um the uh it's called diia okay and it it's made it much easier for those refugees to integrate into like the uk and other places they actually just had that in the end of 2021 and like this site says 13 million out of 44 million inhabitants and so because of that they're able to you know sometimes have to flee with just you know possessions on their back but they had their phone and guess what they could prove who they were because you know most of the time when people are fleeing they don't have their papers and so on they're you know stateless persons but this allowed them to sort of integrate into new society get new identity documents and and whatnot right so diia i think is pretty pretty important and a piece of the future and um uh you know i just wanted to flag that you know for uh your people we'll put it in the show in the show notes for sure yeah so biology thanks for coming on the greenfield podcast to talk about the network state where can we find you online and how can we engage with the network's sake state ideas well go to thenetworkstate.com and go subscribe there and uh there will be i've kind of only written in my view half the book i've got so much supplemental stuff and arguments tighten up and images and code and stuff like that so subscribe there you know i'm also on twitter at balags and um you know look forward to seeing everybody and it's all free and if you want to buy it on amazon you know you'll get the offline kindle version oh we will do like a hardcover and audible later in the year once i quote finish the book then we'll tape it out so right i just think one thing that's cool about what you're doing is that you're writing the book at least the next version of the book with the community as you share these ideas and you're kind of getting the steel man version back so you're kind of using the network to write the book that's right exactly and the feedback from that is helpful because i do i think the basic some of the basic concepts are out there but there's certain things that you know i can add facts to and you know faqs and whatnot so okay well this is great um thank you so much for being on the show biology really appreciate you and your work and uh let us know if get coin or the ethereum community can do anything for you in the future well thanks again i'm a huge fan of you guys okay thanks sorry bye [Music] you
