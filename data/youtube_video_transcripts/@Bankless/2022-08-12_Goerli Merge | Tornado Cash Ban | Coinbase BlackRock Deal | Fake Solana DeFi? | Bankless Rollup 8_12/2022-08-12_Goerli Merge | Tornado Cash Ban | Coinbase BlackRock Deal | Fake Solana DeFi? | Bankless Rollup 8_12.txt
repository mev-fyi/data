merge is scheduled inflation down no hopefully that continues uh l2 tokens are up fee tokens are up like not only is eth bullish in proof of stake polish but tokens are also bullish bankless nation happy second friday of august david what time is it oh ryan it's the friday bank this weekly roll-up time where we cover the entire week of news in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless ryan it was a good news week this week well actually it was very much it was very it ended up week started on a bad note ended on a very very high note yeah exactly and so like i missed a lot of the week so i was over in the uk with my family for vacation and uh you know i usually say grab your morning coffee in the uk david i discovered that coffee means something different than it does in the u.s what at least it was like it was more like uh when i would ask for a coffee you'd be like okay what type of coffee would you like and the options are like espresso cappuccino macchiato like it's like an array of coffee beverages wait that feels normal not for me though like in the us if if you're like hey i want a coffee then it's okay regular coffee it's not an espresso americano yeah americano was generally the only option maybe this was just like where i was in um the in in the uk or i don't know well you're from seattle that's coffee capital of the us is that what coffee really is yeah i think well i think if you go to a coffee store in seattle and you ask for coffee then they will continue like yeah what what kind they will yeah i think i think that's normal it's probably actually definitionally correct but like uh here on the east coast david you can go into any place in the us and be like i'll take a coffee and they won't ask you like if you want americano or espresso black burnt black drip coffee yeah burnt and then they will make the a beverage by putting cream and sugar in it if they will yeah grab your bankless coffee beverage if you will uh and uh join us for some topics of the week number one david the merge the ethereum merge it has a date we're merging we're merging it's what's the date gonna be oh we'll tell you later we're not gonna get you right now yeah we're not gonna spoil that uh also there's some big stuff going on with uh tornado cash yeah that's that's the bad part of this week what do they do what's happening tornado cash the first ever smart contract on ethereum is now illegal there is now an illegal smart contract for u.s citizens so if you are a u.s citizen congratulations there's like 40 or 50 smart contracts all associated with tornado cash that is illegal for you to touch i didn't know that smart contracts could become illegal right that's that's news to me yeah it doesn't feel like they could do that constitutionally but we'll get into the arguments there uh the last thing is coinbase based just landed a 10 trillion dollar client wow we'll tell you who that is but of course you're going to do the roll up with us and if you like these roll ups you got to make sure you like subscribe rate and review so like and subscribe if you're looking on youtube watching this on youtube or rate and review in your podcast player if you're on spotify by the way this comes in video form now so you can get bankless via video which is the best way to do a roll up is to watch a roll-up not just listen to it um but of course with spotify now you can do both so that's pretty cool did you know that uh this last week we uh received our two thousand five star review and then this same week the merger gets a date this is not a coincidence sir it couldn't be it was that uh 2000 a reviewer oh i don't know i truly said something great right it's probably metallic thanks metallic um all right before we get into it though we got to talk about relay a quick message from our sponsor and friends at florida there have been so many hacks recently and last year there were a ton of defy crypto related hacks but i think florida helps with that what are these guys all about what do they do yeah forda does real time mempool and transaction monitoring so there might be a transaction that is coming for your tvl if you built a defy app with tvl in it there can be ways to exploit that and so forza can you can set up a list of parameters for forza to listen to and if transactions come in that trigger one of these things that you don't want to be triggered florida can zap that transaction it can front run that transaction and save your contract your nft or your governance whatever so real-time security and operational monitoring for over 36 billion dollars in tvl things like maker dow uh uh bridges uh all the things that we use uh uma finance poly network compound balancer liquidity of course uh there's a link in the show notes to get started so you know not only do you need to get your smart contracts audited but you can have an extra layer of defense with something like forda yeah it notifies you in advance you do not want to find out your smart contract has been hacked for millions of dollars on twitter yeah okay ford can notify you of that in advance uh so you could do something about it so go check that out david let's get to markets man what are the markets saying to us today let's talk to big daddy bitcoin markets are happy bitcoins happy up a very impressive 8.3 percent start of the week at 22 400 where we are currently is twenty four thousand three hundred dollars so almost up two thousand dollars okay so we're happy up two thousand dollars in a bear market that's feeling good and tell me about eth wow this starts looking bullish yeah that's a that's a 18.7 percent up in one week for ether started the week at just under sixteen hundred dollars fifteen thousand ninety two and we are currently at eighteen thousand ninety yesterday ryan right after the uh gore lee merge which was a success uh we hit 1950 1950 wow the gorly merge by the way is a test net merge the last remaining testing we're going to talk about that in a little bit so do you think the market is just responding to the the merged news if so that makes me bullish because like the market actually responding to fundamentals is a thing that is relatively rare in crypto at least i found it rare maybe that's my cynic point of view the market just generally responds to stupid things all the time narratives or like fake partnerships or just dumb stuff that happens it's rare that you actually have a market event that's affecting fundamentals and the market you digest that and immediately responds with upward or or downward price movement what do you think yeah the the thing i've noticed about the market lately is that it's been responding positively to positive news and it's not been responding negatively to negative news which is generally an indication of what what the mind shift my like the mental mental state of market participants that's not a bear market that is not a bear market because bear market even when there's really good news it can be fundamentally good news nothing happens right or it could continue to drop down but now we're seeing good news and good things are happening to price and that's following fairly rapidly after the good news in a timely orderly way smart market now yeah and not a bear market maybe yeah i don't think you can say a 1900 ether is a bear market i don't think that's right to say that yeah i mean i don't think so all right but like uh still i i think most people if you ask the average crypto investor they would still say we're in a bear market but this is starting to feel a little bit different uh i guess we'll see what happens but you know when eth is doing things relative to bitcoin uh we start talking about the flipping again and uh let's let's take a look at the eth to bitcoin ratio and i'll go back to that uh that flipping chart to see where we are what's the ratio showing today yeah the ratio is up 10 in the last week uh going from point zero seven zero five to point seven seven seven seven uh actually on screen at seven seven nine six uh but you know a lot of sevens and sevens are lucky i've heard sevens are lucky which means your boy's back in the green in his btc trade look at that look at that spike down and then back up it's like oh yeah it's like if you just erase those months and like act like nothing happens like look we're back in that trend line this is great yeah that's great too i think we made some uh bankless purchases around the 1900 range too and i was like david it's going to drop further dude we got it i'm so bullish the merge is coming we got to buy at 19. we got to buy again 1900 let's go back to that opportunity that ethan afforded us two months ago but anytime the ratio is going this direction like it starts to be a good time to look at the actual flipping metrics and this is uh ratio gang.com we are fifty percent of the way to the flipping 48.9 48.9 so what is the definition of the flipping by the way that is eth's market cap exceeds bitcoin's market cap and that has never happened it came very close in 2017. there was a prophecy right it was like in 2017 it got us like 70 something i think higher than that i think it was above like 85 percent did it okay so it was already and it was maybe a brief spike it was oh it was like it was it was a wick of a candle yeah it did not stay there very long all right so so what do you think there are there are various events that have been predicted for a possible flipping i know you are a believer in the eventual flipping at some point in time i am also a believer in uh the flipping at some point in time the difference i think with uh hardcore ethereum bulls of which david and myself would call ourselves for sure is when they think that will happen one of the catalyzing events people have said could be the actual merge on the back of the ethereum merge maybe the flipping happens you know somewhere in the next in the next few months potentially what do you think i think if it happened in 2022 that would be way faster than expected although crypto is known for doing things faster than expected uh like recovering out of that bear market allegedly knock on wood um i think the odds that it happens in 2023 are over 50 percent wow in 2023 that's next year so not 20 20. what do you think what are the odds that happens this year 2022. 10 to 15 10 15 seems really high odds that it happens uh 20 by 2025 oh gosh uh okay well see the the time is always in ethereum's favor because of the significant reduction of issuance and the significant earth burn which we've talked about on the show an infinite number of times but it's like ethereum at that point in a post-merge ethereum ethereum just has to wait it out and eventually unless some other blockchain is generating more blocks based demand than ethereum which has never been no one's gotten anywhere close ethereum is just a waiting game in ethereum's favor to take the number one spot so like as we go beyond 2023 it just the the percentage that it becomes the number one asset in the world in crypto is like approaches 99 are you ignoring the bull catalyst for bitcoin though of which there are there's at least one happening there so 2024 there's going to be having yeah but it's the same bulk like the happening and the merge are the same catalyst and the merge is objectively more powerful by like three orders of magnitude not just that central bankers maybe like central banks maybe el salvador is one uh you know sailors gonna keep buying i don't know there's some other those are not like those are not catalysts that bitcoin has a monopoly over sir so i uh i agree uh the probability is very high before uh 2025. i don't know if i'm ready to say like 50 in 20 in 2023 because one of us has to be you know the more conservative one i guess but like by 2025 david i'm putting this at like 90 percent 95 i'll go conservative though and i'll say 90 like okay and then by the end of this decade 100 it's 100. i mean unless unless we're completely wrong i'm discounting some like weird disaster merge scenario which i guess you have to do david and i will quit crypto [Laughter] sorry guys we were wrong we're done now all right so uh we talked about that um total crypto market cap though um that's adding some money right yeah up a bit 100 billion dollars so last uh last week it was at 1.1 trillion we are at 1.2 trillion so 100 billion dollars on the market account for crypto this week that's pretty nice a lot of uh billions being added in the week two times two here's the thing here's a here's a tweak on it okay um on the ether bowl case gas prices are down my friend down bad no this is right isn't it no what's the medium gas price this week it's that purple one that you want oh wait no it's a green one above that that you want this one median gas price for the week no scroll up scroll up go up that green one oh distribution yeah yeah okay so what is the transaction distribution for gas 10. we're back up to 10. we went from nine to ten six that was that that that's the distribution of the average average dave way free for the last seven days is uh like 10 ish okay so block space demand down for ethereum overall yeah right all right there's the bear peak in its head why is it down david uh because it's a bear market like people aren't doing their shenanigans and also we're getting better at scale like simultaneously things are scaling more people are on more layer twos and nft volumes are super low uh and so like let's layer one block space is being consumed um so yeah things are just quieter in the in the smart contract space okay so let me throw that bear case uh by you again right because like right you know block space is only going to get more efficient on ethereum we have rollups and then in a post eip4844 world of which by the way we talk in depth with paulie not polanya with milan pelania excuse me the pseudo-anonymous persona on twitter who knows so much about rollups that episode's coming out on monday there is a world where like block space becomes very cheap essentially the data layer on ethereum and we're not actually burning as much eath as we thought and i guess maybe getting back to that uh what price point for gway are we actually burning each like what is kind of the the break even burn rate here yeah so we we've been saying for the last two weeks that the number is seven and i think that number came from historical number when less people had staked their ether as more people stake their ether the amount of ether issuance actually goes up uh so somebody corrected us and said it's actually 15. and i verified this with paulinha and so a few others 15 gwei is the ultrasound barrier so ryan if we merged today we would actually not be ultrasound we would still be issuing ether we're still inflating more ethan and so we're at nine so this has to go back up to 15 in order for us to start the burning process of fire can we get some can we get some ponzi's back can we have this just one ponzi please just all we need just for a few days anyway like post post merge yeah uh this is the math behind that by the way anything you want to say about that from don uh yeah here's the math if you just want to check it out uh you take the active number of active validators on the beacon chain and then you calculate the square root of that and multiply that by .0239 so that's how you get the number the ultrasound barrier number there you go bank list is backed by math um yeah this is uh an article from the defined ethereum gas fees fall to the lowest level in two years did you know that two year lows yeah so two years ago it was 24. the bull market lasted about two years so that makes sense yeah i guess it's not as dire as it seems as it sounds yeah my i think gas fees will go right back up yeah they definitely come back this is kind of a short-term thing and probably in post-merge world or even like uh leading up to the merge we'll we'll see some increase but okay markets up this week saw a lot of green candles and bitcoin and ether and it seems like the reason for this is maybe decent cpi numbers but in the face of it it doesn't look decent so here's breaking from bloomberg u.s consumer prices rise 8.5 in july from a year earlier that sounds bad but then they also add slower than estimated so maybe good maybe good okay so the the trick about this is that actual july inflation was actually reported at zero so there was zero inflation in the month of july we have the the prices are the same like consumer prices or whatever are the same that they were one month ago and so it's 8.5 because that is a 12 month lagging indicator and so that's actually the really really bullish news is that inflation seemed to have like ran up against a wall and it has not gone higher for at least 30 days in a row uh so i mean i would love to see this continue for another month just to have an extra another data point but like this is this is the news that you want to see if you want to get bullish so i think the uh average analyst expectation was 8.7 percent inflation annual inflation and it came in at 8.5 and as you said there's no month to month increase at least that's what it seems like so let's declare victory what move are we looking at here david yeah this is the uh squid games guy where on the left he's looking just like disheveled and like fearful like ten thousand yards upstairs yeah fetal position and then the caption is march march of this year inflation at eight point five percent like oh my god inflation eight point five percent and now we're in august and we're uh inflation's at eight point five percent and we're dancing like all right it's coming down i guess that's what it is and markets really like this as well it's not just crypto but traditional uh you know risk-on assets let's say including stocks and tradify markets seem to be telling us that this is like a mild recession only that we already kind of dipped and it's looking kind of mild and powell does not need to be volcker in order to curb inflation volcker of course tightened the monetary policy pretty uh excessively in the 1980s and powell maybe doesn't need to do that and the soft landing is within sight it's even possible so the s p is uh up it's a 50 rep retracement from the june lows of 4227 and the nasdaq just bounced 21 from its june lows this is the moment that the crypto markets also just shot right up like bitcoin went from 23 hundred thousand dollars and then uh like half a day later it was above 24 000. and then that's when ether was at 1700 and then as soon as this thing announced was announced it just shot up to 1850. i mean some people are saying david that the nasdaq as of yesterday actually entered bull market territory wow we're using the bull market word wow people are actually using that term and i can't tell you you know um the statement that always remains true no matter what part you're in the market cycles sentiment follows price right and so now we've seen price uh increase a couple couple months in a row and now the sentiment feels completely different than it did just six weeks ago and so you wonder how much of that is going to happen i uh i'm not ready to say we're out of the woods yet but um i don't know i'm just feeling pretty bullish this week on the merge yeah maybe that's nice lower inflate like remember we had our conversation with um luke grauman and also um little and alden yeah so all of our like the takeaway from all of those is that like yeah wow things are looking really bad but there's like this needle that we can thread that the macro actually turns bullish at the same time that the merge happens and this so far is the reality playing out ryan they also said that we're going to have multiple dunks in the tank i remember lynn alden making this pretty clear that's like it'll look like inflation recovers for a period of time and everyone will celebrate and be like hey it's good we're fine we're back to the good old days again and then we'll get dunked back in the tank again and inflation will be back and this will happen a few more times over the next decade so i'm also conscious of that but i don't know it's hard not to be bullish and cool well if you shorten your time frames ryan it's really whatever just buy and hold okay people forget this why are we even talking about this week to week david but this this chart also looks good what are we looking at here yeah this is the tvl chart on layer twos uh and so it is also having a bull market it's been like up forty percent in tvl on layer twos in the last like two weeks or so uh so kind of just like the e3c ratio like it went down bigly it went from like uh six or seven billion in layer twos down to like under three under four billion uh but now we are up to six billion uh in layer twos uh within striking distance of new highs and tvl of course is like what assets the total value of assets all these value deposited yeah yeah so it's like uh assets under management i guess like aum of these layer twos that's what it basically means more talk on tvl a little bit later in this episode by the way um there also appears to be a lot of money sitting on the sidelines david this is a a list from fintech frank of sidelined capital 23 billion dollars worth what are we looking at here david yeah we're looking at a list of all these funds that raise a bunch of money that have not yet deployed it so a16z coming in at the top at 7.6 billion dollars on cash takes a lot of cash paradigm 2.5 billion ftx ventures 2 billion katie han ventures 1.5 billion high hive mind 1.5 billion it keeps on going there's a lot of cash out there um this is all crypto cash these are crypto funds yes but they they're not necessarily meant for like bitcoin and ether right i think they're meant for like startups and investments so i mean in my mind i look at this and i'm like oh job security for startups like funding funding is not yet secured but there's funding out there that's one thing i think the other thing i i think of is oh my god private equity valuations are not going down anytime soon right so that's good if you're retail you can't get in these private round deals anyway it's like there could be a lot of value on the public side relative to private which is pretty good like bitcoin underneath might look like good purchases or other defy assets uh that have been tokenized um all right did you know we just passed the birthday of everybody 1559. one year of eip1559 as a result of eip-1559 2.1 of the total east supply has been burnt in the last year uh so that's uh 2.5 million ether a pretty good amount of ether that's a huge amount that's that's great that's great um so like you know you know ultrasound or not uh the eip1559 is kicking in it's always going to be bullish burning five eighth a minute last year wow that's kind of the average okay so there's a lot of the most famous eip in existence how many people do you think know what eip fifteen five nine is one five five nine how many people out there even just like let's take crypto people give me a percentage of people like people you think that oh that know that what this eip is and its significance i think a good 20 to 30 000 people know eip for one five five nine really twenty to thirty thousand people might be good that might be a little high actually you think that's high yeah i think that's high we have more bankless listeners than twenty thirty thousand so it's got to be more than that doesn't mean they understand it come on i listen to a lot of podcasts with only half my brain okay so like i i don't mean like understand it to the depth of that no timber understands it yeah just don't understand yeah this is what i mean david i mean that like just like um bitcoin has meme like memed that that the 21 million hardcap yeah in 21 million hard caps some of those court numbers how many people do you think i have i have no idea i have no idea i think it's still probably like 10 to 20 of all crypto buyers what i'm saying is that's low i think it's that though wow of people that own crypt there's a lot of people that own crypto i mean they're bought like dogecoin and stuff yeah like they just don't know what eip1559 is what an eip is the significance of like eth is burning what does that even mean there's a lot of there's a lot to this stuff it's it's not simple to understand i think as you have more capital you likely know what eip1559 is so on an individual per person basis sure but i think a percentage of i think over 50 of all capital in the crypto industry understands eip1559 ah that's cool and what's next eip the second most famous for d844 yeah how many people that is yeah we'll get we'll get there next so uh there's also this really cool chart of eip1559 before and after it was included and just shows a really good mechanism design like this is what eip 1559 was supposed to do like on the left side of this green line before eip1559 was introduced like trent like the estimated gas for inclusion on the ethereum blockchain was all over the place super volatile and on the right side it's just way more regular way more efficient yeah there are a few spikes to the upside because of nft drops but it's just a much more stable mechanism and overall it has led to an actual reduction like i think a 10 to 15 reduction of perceived gas prices as in people overpaying for gas uh really cool chart here a lot less volatility you can see a lot more stability it's really good david what's coming up next coming up next in the show we're going to cover the merge we're going to tell you when exactly the exact number that the merge will happen at we finally have it uh so that's going to that's going to come up next we're also going to talk about tornado cash and the first ever illegal smart contract and how 7.5 out of the 11 billion dollars of tvl on solana was fake question mark wow what a story what a claim uh so we're gonna get into all these stories and more right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 he to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it d5 maker dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and

twitter maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down in existence all right guys we are back and we're talking about the merge there's been some major updates this week including we have a merch date we're going into that in a moment but first things first david while i was out in the uk the gourley test net merged so this was sort of uh we we've called it kind of the uh the pre-show or the dress rehearsal for the mainnet ethereum merge and it happened this week you were actually on the call i think hosting the call yeah bankless youtube when it happened so tell us what happened this week yeah there was like 50 people on the call of the livestream you can go watch it on on the youtube but basically we all sat on zoom and watched the goalie test net merge and then it merged and then we were like okay we waited we it's a little bit like all these merge merges are like a little bit like y2k you know it's gonna happen nothing's gonna break before that moment it's the moment afterwards that everyone's interested in it's like all right is there any damage like is everyone okay is that anything broken and so it took a while for us to figure out if anything was broken there was a there was like an oh moment and so like when this thing like wasn't wasn't finalizing or something but it turned out to be a nothing burger turned out to be just like false reporting and so after like four or five or six hours people kind of realized like yo nothing broke nothing something like that i saw some chatter on this i didn't see any of it live because i was uh traveling but like um devs look scared or something at some point yeah right so like it wasn't there was like something that wasn't finalizing but it actually was finalizing it just wasn't reporting that it was finalized on the front end something it was something like this some technical thing that i can't so like for a while oh it's not finalizing it's not finalizing and then people are realizing no no it is finalizing uh so overall it was like successful like yeah basically like previous merges no issues whatsoever no significant issues whatsoever uh and then what happens next this morning thursday morning uh there was a consensus layer call with all the core devs where they decided the ttd for the real merge the ttd is the total terminal difficulty it's basically like a block height um but uh uh it's it is effectively the date so the merge date has been decided the emerge has been officially announced is coming in at a ttd number that's very very large but effectively puts us at the trajectory of september 15th to 16th there it is that's the date then september 15th to 16th okay so so back us into that again so we have got this very large number which is the t uh ttd and that stands for what total terminal difficulty it's basically the a a number that is it's basically a number that we're going to approach uh as the miners do their thing uh it's it's the reason why it's done this way if you want to find out there's an episode we uh recorded with tim baker forever ago um but once we hit a terminal total terminal difficulty of that very large number which doesn't really make any sense it's basically approximately september 15th to 16th thursday or friday of that week okay so has the code been activated yet it's just been selected right now right yes the ttd and then it gets activated at what point in time yeah there there's these two uh software updates that will go out for the consensus layer and the execution layer and then once those nodes get updated people uh will update their nodes to follow the merge and merge at that particular time and okay and so that is approximately uh september 15 to the 16th so how likely is it to fall on one of those two days versus outside of it are we like 90 95 percent probability that yeah we're going to be the 15th 16th we don't know the time the exact time we will as it approaches but we don't know exactly when but it's going to be the 15th or 16th if this ttd number holds up yeah it has to do with hash power so as hash power fluctuates up and down it will change the actual arrival of that ttd number uh we saw the the gorilla estimated date like uh time jump around actually kind of quite a lot so it started at 6 p.m it went as far as late as midnight and i was like damn it i have to host this thing at midnight and then it came it came forward to nine and ended up happening at like 9 40. but like we're talking about fluctuations of hours i don't know how well that the girly test net translates to the actual proof of work main net but i don't think there's going to be too much fluctuation here dude i can't believe so september 15th to 16th it's going to happen we don't know what time of day we do know we will be on a live stream somewhere yeah watching this happening i'm going to be sipping a vitalik buterin which of course green tea mixed with red wine all mulled together in some concoction i've never tasted before but that's it man it's gonna happen in september i'm gonna enjoy it and i'm gonna enjoy the merge um what are you expecting like do you think anything could go wrong here i mean there's always a chance i don't think so this is something that has been planned for so long it's like the miners aren't like oh they're finally merging now let's like mess with them like no the miners have known about this too there's not going to be any big shenanigans we've tested this how many times i've tested this a bajillion times like i'm thinking the drama is relatively minimal here so a successful merged fifteenth to seven calling the successful merge yeah that's incredible so there you go guys that's the date uh and uh make sure you tune in to watch i think what will be the largest event in crypto history since ethereum was launched um i think this will stand out as one of three events that we've seen so far launch of bitcoin launch of ethereum and then merge which means getting rid of the proof-of-work ethereum chain and merging to the new proof-of-stake consensus layers the third largest event in crypto's history as far as i'm concerned and i think we'll be viewed historically through that as well so significantly don't miss it it's a good time to be in ethereum yes other than business other than this yeah this is this is i i saw this come through of course when i was in the uk it's just like but i couldn't believe this was happening so tell us the headlines right the treasury apparently has sanctioned the virtual currency mixer tornado cash this is a press release from the us department of the treasury website can you give us the story what happened here david yeah so treasury ofac uh which ofac the office of foreign asset control which is part of the treasury put the tornado cash smart contracts on like especially designated like persons list which is weird because it's not a person so this is the first uh pretty sure this is the first person to go on like uh on a sanctions list that's not a person that's just these are like specific addresses that they're using right because yes specific experience contracts maps to an ether dress and they put them the ether dresses themselves on the list right and what's also weird about this list is that it's it's on the responsibility of the individual to make sure that they are not uh transacting with somebody on this sdn list and so if you go out on the street and like hand somebody some cash it's on your responsibility it's your responsibility to make sure that that person that you're handing cash to is not on it's not on the ofac list because that's your responsibility as an individual who's on the ofact list it's like it's like terrorist terrorism yeah like yeah exactly like north korea iran probably enemies of the state right exactly uh and now also tornado cash uh and so they can't turn off tornado cash so what they did is they said hey any u.s citizen that is interacting with tornado cash is in violation of the ofac sdn list uh and that it can result in criminal penalties um ryan did you know that you and i have both interacted with the uh tornado cash contract address since uh this went on the ofac list well how so sir because i haven't touched any buttons on anything while i was away traveling right somebody sent us point and bankless.eath .01 ether from the tornado cash uh smart contract so they the tornado cash mark contract since sent david hoffman.eath rsa.eth and bankless.et.0.1 ether and uh and now and as a result of that we have violated ofac's sen list because we have engaged with that contract how could we be violating when someone sends us right these transactions and by the way it wasn't just us of course it's like i read it was like you know logan paul yeah italic jimmy fallon like somebody some i guess a troll or somebody trying to make a political point uh which i understand kind of the motivations went through and sent right tokens from tornado cash to all of these addresses is that what happened yep that's exactly right yeah so every every person that received the money violated ofac and the reason why this works is that like okay if north korea sends you a check you don't cash it you don't cash that and it says like from north korea you don't catch that thing but north korea can send you money to your ethereum address with or without your permission and so this is where why this gets uh incongruent uh with like other mechanisms of payment though okay so but if north korea sends like cash in the mail to my address right then you violated ofac yeah if if i open up my mailbox or if i do what or if it's in my mailbox they sent it to me i guess so yeah that's kind of the parallel here and the challenge with it is because ethe is um completely fungible right the point one eth just merges with all of the other ether right that you have that's in your wallet yeah in your wallet so do we report this as revenue to the point one e that went to bank without either that i am not is that revenue any of it i'm i don't know what to do david someone help me i don't know what to do i'm just trying to be like you know a good citizen and not um go to prison right uh so like what here's maybe we should read the tweet out from secretary anthony blinken uh when this happened what's he saying here he says can we'll continue to aggressively pursue actions against currency mixtures laundering virtual currency for criminals today u.s treasury sanctioned virtual currency mixture mixer tornado cast which has been used to launder money for u.s sanctioned north korea state-sponsored cyber hacking group um i did a full show on this about a 30 to 35 minute long show uh new format actually where i interviewed jerry britto from coin center and uh collins a fantastic crypto lawyer so if you just want the full story on this uh ryan was out of town and so i had to do the state of nation by myself um but instead of doing the typical just like interview format i kind of tell the story myself and go in and out of interviews with uh collins uh and jerry uh so the full story is available on the on the bankless youtube uh crazy story crazy story okay so the the fallout for this uh tornado cash contracts get listed in the ofact list right um side story is you know some trolls somebody trying to prove a political point goes and sends a bunch of eth to specific kind of influencer type uh ethereum addresses including by the way all of the crypto banks and such like it's just like everybody got this everybody who has an east address who has a large account uh that's a side story then there's some fallout from this as well so uh circle uh just they froze all of the usdc belonging to the unsuspected tornado tornado users right so so yeah tornado people people put usdc into tornado cash because tornado doesn't only work with ether it also works for usdc uh and so people deposit ether or uscc into tornado cache wait a little bit while it gets mixed up and then withdraw it later but you have to wait for a while or else it doesn't work so like all this uscc is sitting in tornado cache and so at the moment that uscc froze that address 75 000 usdc was frozen in tornado cash and so like yeah like uscc like regulated domiciled u.s entity they're not gonna like they're not gonna go up against ofac over seventy five thousand dollars so they just bent the knee and like it's the logical thing to do people were mad at circle and uh you know circle for doing this for freezing the usdc but it's like completely obvious that this is what they would do this is it it's either frees the account or shutdown yeah it's like it's an obvious trade right and they're going to have to do this because they're kind of regulated in the way that they're that's what usdc the product is and so if you didn't realize that about usdc by the way that is kind of a regular regulated stable coin it's not at all like in that way then kind of now you know the effects of something like this and also there's something to do with uh with github as well so is this a tornado cache yeah roman seminole he's a tornado cash developer who's who published a lot of the tornado cache open source code his github was suspended and so the tornado cache open source code was pulled down from github which brings in like first amendment uh questions as to whether or not this actually violates speech because after all code is just speech we we learned this in the crypto wars of the studies and 70s and 80s and by the way there are there are court cases establishing code and speech together this coach bernstein i believe versus the u.s in 2000 kind of established code of speech so this is also u.s legal precedent as well um we should go through the summary yeah this is a great summary threat i'll go ahead and read it uh this is from seth hurling i'll try and do this as fast as possible this week u.s treasury department did something it's never done before it's sanctioned a piece of code weird right specifically treasury added the tornado cache url and smart contract as addresses to the special species especially designated nationals and blocked persons list tornado cache is a crypto mixer that allows people to maintain their privacy online prior to tornado cash sanctions had only been levied against persons it's illegal for americans to transact with any person on the scn list due to the legal doctrine of corporate personhood formal business entities can also be put on the naughty list however computer code is neither a natural person nor a legal entity code is speech bernstein versus the department of justice similarly money a speech or more precisely what you do with your money is speech and then he cites two more court cases as well uh buckley versus valio and citizens and united versus the fec the legal doctrine of prior restraint holds a preemptive government censorship it's almost always unconstitutional and even government acts that have been substantially have a substantial chilling effect which i've learned is actually a legal phrase on speech may be unconstitutional and then he cites another legal court case sanction law is a strict liability regime meaning that if an american transaction with a sanctioned person without intent or even a knowledge of having done so they can be sentenced to 30 years in federal prison ryan you and i might be sentenced to 30 years in federal prison you're smiling when you say this but this is not a smiling matter david why are you smiling why are they going to send all like 200 of us to federal prison for receiving money from tornado cash i don't think it exactly it sounds absolutely ridiculous but that is what the letter of the law actually says does it not i will not be going to jail ryan you'll drag me kicking and screaming anyways the threat continues beyond the likely first amendment violation this action also raises significant due process concerns in that the code was not afforded adequate notice or opportunity to appeal and individuals may be implicated without the means to comply while this law does not seem to be in the treasury's favor litigation will take years to play out treasury knows this now i've seen a lot of discussions essentially saying tornado caster is used by criminals and hackers so it deserves to be shut down well i don't support either let me explain why this reaction misses the point this is where we get into free free speech stuff if treasury had sanctioned the criminals and the hackers that use tornado cash no problem but tornado cash is an open source code meaning it's not owned by anyone and is freely available to everyone it is thus a public good we enjoy the benefits of public goods and infrastructure every day the internet wireless networks money banking system roads and highways transportation infrastructure guess what criminals use these every day too of course we should pursue criminal persons who misuse public goods but we don't sanction smtp because hackers send phishing emails or i-95 because drug dealers drive on it or cell towers that route terrorist calls these are not persians neither is tornado cash like highway emails and highways tornado cash has been misused by criminals for criminal ends however tornado cash is also a tool that enables law-abiding citizens to maintain their privacy on the blockchain for a host of legal purposes including political speech like political donations uh taking this into its logical conclusion if treasury can sanction tornado cache and can sanction any code no software safe if sanctions are no longer limited to persons what other objects or information can the government some summarily jail you for 30 years for interacting with ultimately there is no freedom without privacy and there can be no democracy without free speech privacy and free speech are the bedrock of free and open societies make no mistake this is what treasury has sanctioned this week great threat great threat great summary put this together i think it's the legal council of ledger oh hello well done well done seth hurley um maybe we should get him on the show this was a fantastic thread and went through all the issues i i mean i i think we have some more to talk about about this david but before we do this also had some impact on maker potentially there's some chat chatter in the maker governance forums about an emergency shutdown other d5 protocols are asking what if they get put on the ofac naughty list what happens to them so it's one thing for tornado to be put on it right but what if maker's core contracts were put on the ofac naughty list because a bad guy decided to use dye for some purpose that the us did not like uh so what are the implications of this what's actually being considered by maker yeah so there's a nesting doll of trouble here so usdc is now frozen in tornado cache can't use uscc and tornado cache you can put usdc into maker dow and mint die and then you can take that dye and put it in tornado cash right so rut ro uh uh oh uh and so like and also there's like 40 of outstanding dye that's backed by usdc so if you if circle was told by treasury that they need to blacklist the maker dow usdc address because that was something tainted from tornado cache yeah yeah or it just enables usage of it right so like you can so like it's kind of similar to like i could i could spin up a contract i could make it write a contract that interacts with tornado cash on my behalf and then i could send my ether or uh or die into that contract and then that contract can go talk to tornado cash and my addresses haven't touched tornado cache so i'm free and clear but the proxy address did go touch tornado cache that's basically uscc and maker dow is you can take uscc go to make or dao just use maker dow to talk to tornado cash it's the same same so like is treasury really going to let that go like rut row and so this is being caused a great cause of concern in the maker discord and so they are now like more aggressively prioritizing how to become much less dominant of uscc lately yeah including i think so there's um you know how much how much dye is backed by usdc david right now there is 3.56 billion dollars of uscc in maker dell which is like it'd be one thing if it was just you know a smaller amount but it's hard to like you know swap out 3.5 billion dollars this has been a known challenge that the dye has had right which is like it's trading off some scalability for some decrease in censorship resistance and the way to get pure censorship resistance and scalability on ethereum is you actually have to use eth which is the only you know the most unsensible uh store value asset in order to back all of your diet of course they went the multi-collateral route which makes sense for the product but um you know you could you could swap something else out if uh if needed um so i guess what do you think about this like first of all why do you think treasury is is doing this do you think that this is partially because um north korea essentially has hacked they've been involved implicated in a number of bridge hacks recently and they have used tornado cash to try to anonymize their ill-gotten gains and so now treasury and now u.s national security apparatus is taking a very close look at tornado cash and so they've just said no one can use this if you're a us citizen you just can't use these contracts anymore is this where this all of this ir is coming from because tornado cash has been in existence for like three years yeah something like this and zcash even longer which is privacy enables cryptocurrency yeah this uh the implications of this are significant and people are mainly asking all right where does this go next um uh how many more smart contracts are going to become like quote unquote illegal uh it's kind of unfortunate that tornado cash i asked alex svanovic from nansen like how much of tornado cash funds is like illicit deemed elicit uh and he came back to me with a number of 35 percent of funds going through tornado cash is stuff that we know came from like bridge hacks and some sort of hacks but ryan that's just what we know about so like could be as much as 50 of the money flowing through tornado cash is like illegal or illicit which makes it really hard that it is there is some illicit active illegal activity on it there's there's more than just like a little there's like quite a quite a lot but the precedent that this sets and the implications anyone using tornado cash is is guilty i mean at its core tornado cache is just a service that allows you to have privacy right i i had to take as as i was thinking about this a little bit and the implications of um how i feel uh as you know somebody who received some funds from tornado cash was just sent to me is they're trying to make you feel like a criminal for wanting basic privacy at its core that's what tornado cash is doing uh and i don't think that's a radical thing for us to want the same sort of privacy anonymization that we have in the real world with cash if i were to pay you a cash payment david um like no one needs to know about that the government doesn't have to record that in a ledger the amount that i gave you i don't you don't have to identify yourself to me i don't have to identify yourself to me if i if i give you some gold there's no sort of registry that needs to be created and it's not radical for us to want digital privacy privacy on our digital transactions what i do think is radical about the way treasury has gone about doing that this is that an unelected surveillance bureau that's what treasury is their branch the executive branch they're unelected and they are a surveillance bureau and they can make privacy illegal i think this is normalizing tyranny if we if we let this go because what privacy tools do they suggest we use right if not public good code like tornado if i want to have some sort of privacy on my crypto transactions what tool do i use treasury right are they saying we can't use any of it as an american citizen sorry privacy more or less they're saying that more or less is exactly what you're saying because the reason the reason why tornado cash is being used by criminals is because it's really good at offering individuals privacy and so it's not it's not like criminals would be able to use tornado cash in in silo right if only criminals were using tornado cash you would just like okay well this criminal is going in therefore criminal's going out but it's because tornado cash is useful to individuals and it's because it does provide privacy to individuals that it that's actually what enables the fact that criminals and and and you know hijack hackers can use this because they they can't use tornado cash without there being a crowd to hide in so it's a very important order of operations as the individuals just like you and you and me and people who don't want to have the eyes of the world upon their financial history to like see what they're up to they use tornado cash and that gives the option of criminals to use tornado cash because because they couldn't use it without you know normal people also using it but the normal people come first which makes that ours ryan in my mind yeah and and the other piece about this of course that's indefensible is the the breach of first amendment rights which is you know freedom of speech right and uh so uh if if governments can start shutting down bitcoin or sorry get github repos of developers for writing code that's a scary prospect that that brings up some dystopian ideology so i'm still kind of uh trying to figure out what we do as a crypto industry to react against this have you identified any sort of action steps things we can do i mean is is treasury going to get sued at some point who can sue them for this uh i guess we have to settle this in courts yeah in court legislation crypto friendly uh politician politicians that want to respect and embed in our legal protocols a um basically digital rights which is a thing we i think as americans and probably everyone across the world do not have embedded in our legal protocols we haven't we have no digital rights at this point we have to ultimately find politicians support politicians who will write laws in order to protect and enforce our digital rights but for now like we have a first amendment at least in the u.s with freedom of speech and this should fall under that so what do we do with all of this data the good thing is that we've done this before the crypt cryptography wars of the 70s and 80s was more or less the same fight where uh the united states of america wanted to make code illegal and the cryptographers won the fight by saying no code is free speech we're basically revisiting this same exact there's already legal precedent for this the only difference now is now there's money now it's not cryptography and now it's cryptocurrency so we're gonna like we're you know right we speed run the history of money and finance and now also law uh and we've done this before and we'll do it again it's just gonna be like yeah we're gonna have to like every time they take away our rights we're gonna have to fight for them back but crypto people fight for their territory right this is our home so you are are you optimistic that we'll be able to kind of like oh god yes and yeah sort of stuff in the same way that you know we did with uh the previous crypto wars or do you think the us has passed that point when it comes to finance and money transactions like because every every single uh democracy western liberal democracy is going to have to contend with this because these privacy tools are not going away right now and that's the other thing is like so many privacy tools are going to like it's going to be whack-a-mole they're not going to be able to ban them all aztec layer 2 complete link to you which is uh i believe it's evm compatible as well and privacy it's not it's not quite but okay but like privacy for everything you put inside of aztec is that illegal are americans just banned from legally using uh crypto privacy tools how is how is how is that right the only way for them to make a ruling that satisfies their actual desires is just to say like you're all transactions on a blockchain need to be fully traceable and at that point it's like well you're banning ethereum yeah which goes to the question of where does this stop david right because like today we we find the tornado cash uh smart contracts on the ban list tomorrow is it uniswap right for the sec yeah sure i mean like the sec or oh fact just let let's say uh let's say north korea uses unit swap for some transactions sure they do in fact on the back of this just to cause more chaos maybe they will what if what if north korea became like the dominant lp for like uh die or like unit swap or uniswap lp for ether and usdc yeah what if what if they had 50 of the liquidity so like all of your counter trades are north korea they could be listening to this podcast and getting these these are a really good idea for real and so what is the bankless podcast illegal this is these are the questions i'm asking right like we're going down this path and this is a very dystopian path i feel like we're going down and it's the first time i felt like that with crypto it's like oh okay we've entered a new territory now nation states are actually attacking what we're trying to do in this space and attacking the freedom of individual citizens as a result and uh i think that's different this week has felt different right starting pistol and all of this david we got to move on though are you sure if you want the full story uh you gotta go watch the uh the the youtube video that's already out on the youtube yeah it's hard to move on okay uh the fake team that made solana definitely okay so there was this uh ecosystem on solana that had a bunch of tvl uh it was saber and a few other like protocols sunny aggregator uh and uh there was a dev team behind it and it had like like 10 or like seven billion dollars out of the 10 or 12 billion dollars of solana tvl um but as it turns out instead of like a suite of devs in a big community it was actually just like one guy and his brother with a bunch of sock puppets ryan he's just faking different online identities yeah uh and so i'll read some some uh quotes out from this article coding as 11 purportedly independent developers ian how do you pronounce this name uh panini ian mceliano machiliano a 20-something computer wiz from texas created a vast web of interlocking d5 protocols that projected billions of dollars of double counted value onto the saber ecosystem that temporarily inflated the tvl on solana as the network was racing towards its zenith last november the d5 the d5 faithful regarded tvl as the barometer of on-chain activity of course so a quote from a blog post that was unreleased which is how this all this news came about says that uh ian set wrote i devised the scheme to maximize solana's tvl i would build protocols that stack on top of each other so that a dollar would be counted several times yin's ploy worked for a while by his count saber and sonny compromised seven comprised 7.5 billion of solana's 10.5 billion tbl at their peak billions of those dollars were double counted between his two protocols and so there's also the component of fake friends in public ian and his brother dylan call their anonymous personas friends or friends of friends any quote from from ian i wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol rather than ship 20 disjointed programs as one person so they just like spun up 10 20 developers on the same protocol and so this whole entire thing created this narrative that had a substantial role in driving the solana token price from under 40 in july to a peak of 259 in november of 2021. a significant portion of bullish salon and narrative now seems to be based on a series of deceptions wrote coindesk so tldr this guy ian and his brother built an interwoven defense ecosystem on solana spun up a bunch of twitter sock puppets to make people think that there were a lot of devs attracted a small amount of tvl that would then double triple quadruple be counted in the overall tvl of solana and what really what this whole entire story reveals is that you know less than a small handful of people with dishonest intentions can produce like significantly distorted like realities in the crypto markets absolutely crazy they did this is uh 7.5 billion of solana's 10.5 billion tvl at their peak basically faked by this one dude and all of its sock puckets and his brother and his brother what's crazy i i guess the implications of this are um and we were talking about the being of this episode the tvl on layer two it's very important not to very important to know that tvl is a very gameable metric at this point and there are people who are actively trying to it isn't it's it's just it's not when you put either intuition is what i mean well not necessarily that too when you put ether into arbitrary optimism or whatever that is tvl it's how you count it that's the the the what people just forgot to stop double counting all this stuff and really didn't look under the hood yes so sloppy counting of it and tvl is only one metric among many i think is and and i guess the other takeaway are and be careful who you trust online i don't know like um and on devs are always dubious well it's it's not all like it's not satoshi isn't an ant on dev right it's like not always dubious but like they're not they're more dubious than an on and on dev they can start with a uh clean slate clean reputation every time so i think it it's worth saying that um it it should take them longer to establish you know trust than a person in the real world who basically establish your trust over multiple cycles of doing good things uh and that's how you create your your reputation and your name a name for yourself an anon could just like have one reputation for one account another for another uh so yeah we have to be careful who we trust i guess that is the end state the the next coindesk article about this uh concludes with something really really funny uh quote from the article says further users have now seemingly been abandoned with the macaleno's announcing that they're shifting projects shifting their focus towards new projects on the upstart aptos blockchain so they're just rotating to the new like faster blockchain they did it with salon another gonna play the same trick with aptos so um be wary of that crypto nation beware that um coming up next uniswap is getting a new foundation all right question mark tell us about that david also a brand new arbitrary is trainer it it seems like uh vitalik gives a statement an idea on theory crafting we'll talk about that as well it's all coming at you but first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure crosstrain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across these bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of across the story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrary or boba networks and we are back coinbase lands a 10 trillion dollar client in blackrock providing aladdin clients access to crypto trading and custody via coinbase prime so coinbase is all going to be the crypto black back end by blackrock which is the biggest aum institution hedge fund ever in the world 10 trillion you can't catch a bigger fish than that yeah the biggest fish i guess entering entering crypto is the bottom line here so the the coinbase prime will provide crypto trading custody prime brokerages and reporting capabilities to aladdin into institutional's client base who are also clients of coinbase i don't know what aladdin is but something associated with blackrock anyways uh coin the uh the equity for coinbase up fifteen percent on the news bouncing off the low hoes the low lows that it set a couple months ago that's good because it's been down bad lately it's really getting really a bit of bullish news also got this david this is a tweet from arbitram a new dawn is upon us arbitrary nova is now live and open to the public nova this is a definition it's not like arbitrarium one it is a new train built on the arbitrary any trust technology and optimized for social and gaming applications that require ultra low fees and high security so this is another instance of arbitrum it is not the arbitrary one chain arbitram when they came on the podcast about a year ago and they were launching the very first arbitrary chain they said they could do this they said they could launch other chains as well it's kind of implied in the arbitrary one name you know yeah one kind of implies two this is not to you this is nova yeah it is the second chain though nova nova means new i guess so it's a new chain built on arbitrary and it is for social and gaming applications that need ultra low fees and also high security that's part of the news the other part of the news is uh coinciding with the launch reddit reddit will be migrating community points onto nova so of course read it 400 000 some on daily active users of which i'm one big fan of reddit it's a social media entity um they are going to be deploying on nova as well if you pop the hood on nova this is uh the website what actually is it david so it's a new chain from arbitrom technology so it's definitely a rollup for game developers and social projects we know that um what the main difference is that the arbitrary one chain posts all of its data to the main ethereum chain and the main ethereum chain is like where you get a lot of cost for roll-ups uh so arbitrary nova has kind of created a committee of entities like coinbase cloudy i think is one of them and there's others as well uh that instead of uh the ethereum blockchain they're gonna post data to uh this this committee right so reddit is one of these people consensus ftx google cloud off chain labs quick node p2p and so instead of posting it to ethereum they're posting it to all of these entities that can kind of use databases so it's more centralized but for gaming and social applications it doesn't really matter because they're not financial applications so you don't need as much security uh and the costs are just probably many orders of magnitude cheaper so faster cheaper like basically zero transaction fees i would guess consensus is still secured on ethereum so consensus is still ethereum that's what makes it a roll-up but data is now not being posted on ethereum it's being posted to this data availability community committee run by these this set of organizations right so it's it's almost as secure as ethereum but the data part is not quite as secure so there's a bit of a trade-off but in exchange for that trade-off you get a pretty great chain that's very cheap for social and gaming type applications that's what it is you get a chain that emulates and has the ux of web 2. so it's a great place to start for like reddit like points for example that you know you don't need to have like metamask pop up and ask for approval this is kind of like um if you're into like roll up terminology it sounds kind of like a valydium yeah there might be some differences here and we should probably have uh arbitrary uh tell us more about it at some point but uh yeah it's pretty cool and good to see reddit adoption for sure um this is by the way nova on layer two beat look at that tv nova well from zero to eight hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars inside of seven days so kind of technically up uh infinity percent yeah at fifty percent so still under a million dollars so it's like you gotta waste that a million dollar tvl in seven days is great not if all tvl is fake david how can we trust tvl anymore did we just talk about that how about unit swap what are they doing yeah unifop's making a foundation uh and so a foundation has always been missing absent from like the uniswap ecosystem there's uniswap labs but that's a for-profit company that doesn't have complete and total alignment with the uni token unisop labs is the thing that acquired the genie nft aggregator but the value of that genie nft aggregator doesn't go to the unity token it goes to unit swap labs so we need this uniswap's foundation to kind of put like a central thinking head upon the unit swap dao and so this uniswap foundation has been proposed uh and so this is just a temperature check but i'm pretty sure this is going to go through i this isn't a direct one-to-one like link but i think like something like this is a necessary step to turning on the fee switch because the union swap foundation can have the best interest of the uni token holders at heart and the labs can't because of sec regulations so bullish we're trying to fix our governance tokens here right now um how about maker dow this is uh pretty interesting news that happened last week as well yeah there's a hvb bank minted 25 million dollars in a single transaction so maker dow really leaning into the real world asset real world collateral uh which i've always been bullish on so congratulations to them i wonder if this week changed any of that i know it's not really it didn't it didn't it didn't it's like everyone tries to conflate these things but it didn't it's it's it's it's interesting though if like um if the us government goes aggro on d5 what the fallout will be i don't think that's where the well i don't think the us government isn't like a monolith yeah it's not it's like oh the the government's going to come from maker dow like some specific agency has to get offended by this and i don't think there's there is one plus again real world collateral is not like this centralized thing it's it's also decentralized it's just decentralized in meat space not in crypto space and so i mean the fact that these banks could be from any jurisdiction in the world any jurisdiction yeah like right yeah and like no there's not one like contract to rule them all so if you if you shut down one contract all the other ones are still standing right so you have to go one by one by one and fight each one in court it's a different level of different kind of decentralization the other thing i think that that makes this bullish and going after real-world assets is now you have hv bank that knows about defy and it's an advocate right it's also going to stand up and fight on the side of crypto big time in any battles that are yeah see you're getting it you're getting it real real world assets it's so bullish it is it's and i'm so glad we have all of these experiments playing out at once because i think um you know ethereum crypto has a very big tent um some news from meta david what are we looking at instagram has rolled out its nft support to a bunch of more countries 100 more countries and also the float blockchain yeah instagram rolled out their nft support forever ago i haven't really like seen anyone been using any of that but maybe it's because we haven't had a hundred more companies do stuff with it or countries do stuff with it yeah i don't know it's a slower rollout but we'll see i think they've got some bigger things planned um david do you remember all those uh bankruptcies um this is some news from the bankrupt crypto broker voyager they just approved to return they've just been approved to return 270 million dollars to their clients so i guess if you're a depositor or maybe a debtor like a customer yeah like a normal customer you're getting some money back maybe cents on the dollar i don't think you're getting all your money back but i don't know the details of this it specifically is returning 270 million dollars to affected customers and so i think that means retail is getting this before like other creditors or debtors or whatever i hope so we'll see but it's like it's gonna work its way out over the months to come as we said so we'll see more of this as uh as they wind up uh this is some news from immutable as well and the gamestop partnership what's happening here yeah yeah we saw this coming uh from a mile away but uh immutable uh x the layer two and also gamestop wallet the the wallet are now integrated so this this whole like immutable gamestop asset gaming ecosystem it's moving pretty fast we're liking what we're seeing here david uh a tweet from vitalik this week uh some quick theory crafting that's a great word theory crafting right how much data space we could save by improving compression so this is vitalik talking about compression of various erc20 tokens and there's a lot of detail in this slide but can you dumb it down for us what are we looking at yeah basically each there's a bunch of like bars and each bar is cut up into sections and it's basically a anatomy of a transaction so you have the nonce and how much data that consumes is like one one section of the bigger bar you have the priority fee and how much data that is the gas and how much data that is the token address and how much data that is the signature is a really big chunk of this overall data and you can kind of just see the way that ethereum scales is not necessarily like adding bigger blocks or shards or more block space that is one way but it's also by compressing all the transactions into a smaller packet of data and so i just thought this visualization by vitalik shows how much scalability there's left in ethereum for just a normal erc20 transfer so if for the viewers on the youtube if you're looking at the top that's where we are currently it's this bar that spans the whole entire page and then at the ideal stateful compression it goes to a much smaller bar and so we're at 188 bytes currently for an erc20 transaction and then the ideal stateful compression is 23 bytes and so in the future with all these optimations how many times can you fit 23 into 188 quick math is 8.7 or 8.2 times uh and so with all of these compressions which have nothing to do with the actual protocol of the blockchain uh the actual like block space of the blockchain we can get eight times more scale and a basic erc20 transfer so i just like this visualization it's a great visualization by the way in that plenty of episode we talk about scalability in compression right and he thinks sorry they think with the introduction of eip4844 plus compression this is the compression the polenia was talking about we're gonna get in a thousand uh x increase in roll-up transaction throughputs and ethereum transaction throughput so that's what all this leads to and compression is an important part of that story you know it's another important part of the crypto story is the jobs market in crypto jobs jobs market still going strong david uh this is our time to remind the bankless nation to do what they get a job and actually you should get a job at bank list because banco's has more jobs on the job board look at that podcast editor we're throwing out more podcast content so we're going to need a third editor to add to the team also if you know how to make like defy tutorials on youtube if you're good at like whatever those like adobe that's whole suite and you can make good tutorials we're definitely looking for that media operations also at bank list bankless is hiring so many god we're having so much jesus this is crazy yeah oh wait i'm reading off the jobs right now that's not what i do you should yeah no you're supposed to be dancing right now so i get to dancing sir um boardroom laughs if i read out the drops does that mean you dance no it doesn't it doesn't it's not bi-directional all right unidirectional arrangement here uh boardroom labs they are i better start this before i'm uh asked to dance again software engineer dow governance also manticore games manager of crypto marketing what is that david oh non-technical thanks veglus we're also looking for a writer vertex protocol a marketing coordinator uh still want a senior newsletter editor for bankless streams financial analyst bankless academy product manager wow i guess it's all bankless jobs this week but there are plenty of others actually i shouldn't say that there's a head of marketing pleaser dow the sandbox wants a biz dev manager on juno ethereum foundation wants a front-end uh developer there's a ton more go to the bank list dot palette dot com jobs uh url to get access to those jobs and make sure you sign up to get these jobs by email guys we got a lot more coming up david what tell them what's coming up next oh we got the questions from the nation how to get the eth proof of work token if you think that token is valuable i do not think it will be but if you do we'll tell you how to get it to get it anyway you're gonna get either way whether it's worth zero pennies or whatnot uh also some bridge risk stuff and of course the hot takes out of crypto twitter so in order to get some of that stuff you gotta go like and subscribe uh you're gonna get it anyways but you should also like and subscribe anyways and we'll be right back after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home while d5 protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage you can now bridge straight into arbitrarily for more than 10 different exchanges including binance ftx kuobi and crypto.com once on arbitrary you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe new to arbitrary for a limited time you can get arbitrary nfts designed by the famous artist ratwell and sugoi for joining the arbitrary odyssey the odyssey is an eight-week long

switch to the brave wallet download brave brave dot com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started alright guys we're back with some questions from the bankless nation that's questions from you and if you've got a question for the weekly roll up make sure you follow banklesshq on twitter we post a request for questions once a week and you can get your question answered if you post there number one from nobody if there is a proof-of-work fork at the merge will you receive the airdrop to a ledger wallet i think that's a ledger wallet specifically wants to know if this user wants to know if they will receive a part of that token eat the pow token will they david well you will absolutely because a ledger wallet means that you have your own private keys so it's actually less about the ledger and more about do you have your own private keys and because you have a ledger you have your own private keys so the answer is absolutely yes if you have your own private keys then you will get that you will be able to access your ether on the proof of work chain if you have that ether though okay so what happens if you have your eth at somewhere like coinbase well so that means you don't have your private keys which means that is up to coinbase and historically coinbase has honored forks um and we've seen that happen before that happened with bitcoin cash so when bitcoin uh forked off into bitcoin and bitcoin cash coinbase gave all bitcoin holders their their their owed bitcoin cash i mean but blockchain's forked many many many times uh and so there have been other forks where coinbase was like that's too small of a fork we don't care about that one so you didn't get those other forks uh and so i mean coinbase hasn't really taken a position but if there's enough of like a movement behind the eth proof of work train you could see coinbase listing that chain excuse me uh and then they would give you your eth proof of work token if they choose but you're beholden to coinbase is up to coinbase because you know you trusted them with your keys i think some other exchanges have signaled that they would support yeah a trading parent train all the trash exchanges they will but as long as someone uh someone does it then you could sell that's how that works if you want to sell you can sell and by the way that's taxable income apparently if you're receiving airdrop taxable income nice taxable income for your air drop so sell it quickly um second question from avigupta.eth i don't even remember the bridge i used to transfer my funds to layer 2 but once funds reach l2 am i still exposed to bridge risk or just the risk of smart contract for l2 so that is what you bridge great question it's a great question once you bridge you still have the risk of the bridge on your assets lingering forever yeah ryan can you go to bungie.exchange real quick okay so this is bungie.exchange it's like a bridge aggregator plus also a dex aggregator so ryan's got ethereum to optimism he's got .044 eth on one side on the ethereum chain and he's asking for 84.8 usdc on the optimism chain and so here's all these bridges on the on the top one that this thing automatically selects the bridge that gives you the most value on the other side and so that is currently hop for this current transfer it tells you how much you're going to pay in gas how long it's going to take the next best bridge after that is the actual canonical optimism chain below that you have hyphen bridge below that you have a cross below that you have multi train bridge there's all these different bridges all like so many different ways to get to optimism it does does the security of your assets on optimism depend on any of these bridges that you take over there the answer is no no it does not the only thing that matters is the canonical optimism bridge because once you get over to optimism the only security dependency that you have is the actual canonical optimism bridge and so once once you have ether on optimism the bridge that you use to get there can break and you still have ether on optimism it's not beholden to that particular bridge and this is only true for layer twos on ethereum this is not true for cross layer one bridges if you are a crosslayer one bridge a multi-stake bridge to like ethereum to solana or ethereum to avalanche then you are beholden to whatever bridge that you use to get there but then you could so you could bridge your ether from like ethereum to like avalanche and then you could trade that ether for the avax token and then you are no longer beholden to that bridge because you sold that risk off to somebody else um and so this is a really good just like lesson in just like bridge risk for if for all layer twos if you're on arbitrarily and you have your arbitrary ether you only are at risk of the canonical arbitrary bridge not the bridge that you use to get there that's really cool david so like um yeah good overview here so you can cross with whatever like you can cross with whatever janky bridge right like you need to it could be any bridge entirely as long as the optimism bridge itself remains intact you are fine there is still bridge risk right in that the optimism bridge itself the canonical bridge could go down but if like you cross over to the island on some bridge that looks like something like this this janky sort of like it's got holes in the middle of it right and it's just rope and like pieces of of wood uh as long as the main optimism bridge stays intact all the other bridges could collapse you will be fine right exactly and there there is bridge risk so if you're using hop to go from ethereum to optimism there's bridge risk while your assets are like in flight while like you're they're out of your ethereum wallet and they have not yet landed in your optimism wallet yeah 20 minutes or less usually it's less uh once it's once it lands on optimism then the only bridge that you have risk to is the actual canonical optimism bridge very cool here's another question if i stick one minute after the merch am i allowed to unstake whenever i want or i'm am i subjected to the same waiting time to unstake of who staked before the merge you sir or yes sir matt are beholden to the same wait times withdrawals are on are not enabled for anyone staking their ether for six to twelve months after the merge so even after the merge happens if you begin staking then you do not you are not able to withdraw you are still stuck like everyone else uh six to 12 months and then there will be some sort of software upgrade a fork and then everyone will be able to unstake at once but until that time nope no they will not be able to there'll be a waiting list there's there's a cue yes but like everyone can start the process that's a good clarification yes so we're all in the same boat together we're all like staking until that next fork happens which by the way is pretty bullish for eth price like it's a one-way ticket speaking of one-way tickets fam um all right let's get some takes of the week takes this one from polenia coming to the podcast again on monday but what is plenty of saying here this is a governance post yeah so pelenia actually produces a governance post per optimism this is one of the few like governing things that pollenia does and says he they introduced a proposal to pause governance funding voting cycles until some level of optimism layer to decentralization has been achieved so what pellenia is really saying is that we should stop distributing the op token stop doing rewards stop doing governance proposals until optimism is more decentralized and they cite regulatory risk um as a one of the big reasons behind this so they're just saying hey let's make sure the actual thing optimism is more decentralized than it currently is before we start paying out op tokens as like reward incentives so you know kind of a contrarian take but this is kind of why we appreciate polenia because they are very just clear and sober minded uh and plenty of being a good governor too there's a pretty detailed post uh about this too uh i think i am sticking to plenty uh polenia on uh the optimism i think this is a take from ryan anderson he says the nft space is like caveman inventing the wheel and then only using it for roulette and that is a valid use of a wheel yes do you think there will be some non-speculative nft cases uh use cases in the future in the next um next bull run next year i know a project that's working on right now ryan utility nfts baby yeah utility ft's token gated access do you remember when icos were just basically speculative tools right and like that i remember when icos were in the future tokens where right like tokens did nothing they were completely stupid and useless in 2017 and it was only during the the bear market by the way are are we at a bear market still do we still say that so i don't think so the bear market didn't last very long no it's really we're trying to brand this thing the build market and like if we're already done then i guess it's over yeah that's actually a good point we should have we should it'd be nice to have the bear market for a little bit longer just to really put a fight i don't know yet i think we'll crab for a while i think a merch will be catalyst yeah crab between three and two thousand crap mark it's not doesn't sound well good though it's either bowl or bear there's no in um all right this is another take uh i can't read my own tape right ryan shot his classic tank ryan says i hear bad people use the internet let's just ban tcp ip and ssl and be done with it and uh funk nine evan 9871 a funk is a backwards punk uh they uh they say especially ssl do you know what ssl stands for secure sockets layer is a standard security technology first to establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client basically a website okay cool okay and so funk 9871 says especially ssl you can have military-grade encrypted communication with servers scaredy-face imagine what could be wired there pedophiles instructions for bomb building conspiracy theories hate speech we need to censor this yeah also your transaction and credit card data let's make sure that that stays like open for the all of the internet to watch no thanks uh exactly exactly the point so it's like what do we do you just ban everything right uh i mean we need privacy we're gonna have digital uh crypto technology but by the way what does this say for the central bank digital currency right do you do you think treasury is going to want to enable privacy by default on that thing the central bank digital currency no no they're not going to give you privacy they're going to want to back door into everything this is why like in the cbdc there would also never be like a public accessible virtual machine because then you could build tornado cash on it exactly right so they're going to hamstr string the whole thing which is i think i guess the bookcase for crypto but um i guess your take is david it's all going to work out okay right it's all going to work out okay have faith all right i'm going to have faith uh all right this one's great you zoom out a little bit is this week no we're not in the meme no this is this well we had two memes of the week and this is the one that we put in the take section uh the the twitter the tweet says inflation is down point two percent to eight point five percent second worst recorded uh ventilation ever and then the picture goes crypto mf ers and then it's the picture of the hangover and they're all gambling at the roulette table it's like yeah let's go to the casino it is i'm surprised the market reacted so bullishly to this like spec tiny tiny micro spec of good news but such as the market all right david uh close this out man what are you bullish on this week can i really say anything other than ethereum right now like we just scheduled the merge okay so this is something i always think is super ironic in 2017 that bull market got the ethereum bull market was partially catalyzed by everyone wanting to buy ether so they could stake it and that was me like oh gotta get as much ether as i can get passive income baby yeah passive income because they're gonna go to proof of stake in 2018 uh and then 2018 came and like the road map just like was not defined and then we went into a bear market and then like d5 summer hit and i was like oh yeah like proof of stake by the end of 2020 like oh my god i've got to get as much easier as i can so like so i can stake it at the end of 2020 and then like that came and went and then like now we're into the second the last part of 2022. and we actually have it scheduled it's actually real this time actually so instead of like being the catalyst for like a bull market that's actually happening right now it's a catalyst for a bull market that is completely proof of like ethereum proof of stake being driven right now so far which is now to be fair though david you could stake when the beacon chain went live true right which is a long time ago but you've been have you been waiting with the bulk of your eat for for kind of the merch no my my the bulk of my eat is not on the beacon chain are you gonna start staking like post post merge is that your catalyst you're gonna wait for the um the next fork where you can actually withdraw um yeah i was proud that's a really good question i have not seriously considered you haven't thought about what you're gonna say or how much you know what we need david do you remember that episode we did on uh how much eath can you retire on a long time ago right right how much was that i think it was like i think it was just like a little over a hundred eighth i mean to get a sixty thousand dollar this had a sixty thousand dollar a year salary off of a hundred east this was before we had two years of like twenty percent each uh your inflation but or like like massive inflation so maybe this that was also assuming a five thousand dollar eath price as well but we'll get there too okay yeah anyway how much it's the conversation's back baby yeah okay so like the the merge is scheduled inflation down no hopefully that continues uh l2 tokens are up fee tokens are up like not only is eth bullish and proof of stake polish but tokens are also bullish tokens are having a great moment right now so like people are feeling good about stuff and i'm hoping ryan that that makes people feel better about stuff in the future huh there's a picture for you which of these people are you okay the one missing the tooth [Laughter] i'm showing the hand over the hangover picture again yeah that's it that's us right now what tokens have i put my uh my get my bets on ryan where do you bullshot um i was listening to the bloody episode again the episode that came out this monday the one on nations and then like in the backdrop of an actual nation state banning a privacy protocol banning code banning effectively speech right uh it went back to like what am i bullish on nations and the way bellagio defined it is nation is different than a nation state a nation is a community it's a tribe of people the wikipedia definition is a community of people formed on the basis of combination of shared features such as language history culture territory belief nations what are nations they are communities that is not the nation state but i feel like the nation state has kind of conflated those two together and they want uh the word nations to actually mean this nation-state type thing and it's different it's different because we can have these things that are internet nations digital nations uh and i think this unlocks something big for communities for societies for groups of individuals with with shared beliefs uh and this opens up an avenue for humans coordinating outside of the nation state at first the nation states are i think gonna feel a little threatened by this we're starting to see some of that like feeling threatened i do don't know what to do with this new thing you're not you're not a nation you don't have a flag you don't have rights you don't like you can't you're you're creating your own money that's not real money it's fake internet money and like you're not and it'll take time right but the thing that the things that we will build in this new digital nation internet nation will be different than the nation state and i think will be complementary to it uh over time uh and i can't wait to start unlocking some of those new things oblashi said in our episode he's like the 2010s we discovered internet money the 2020s are going to be about discovering internet nations and uh i i think that is a a big thing we're going to like define and uncover and start to see use cases for this decade i think people people have a hard time think imagining this right now in the same way that was very difficult to imagine a crypto uh internet money back in 2011 you have to have like a big broad imagination but um i think that's it man we're we're in the process of defining it and like what i love going back to is like you remember blah she was talking about sometimes you have to go back in order to go forward right right i find myself being very attracted to like some of the founding principles of nation states right like you go back to kind of like the federalist papers and like the united states constitution and like those are the base principles for they got humans want to live they got that right and they built a protocol called a state around that and that's cool but like some of these base principles um we can manifest the core base principles of um life liberty liberty and the pursuit of happiness in internet protocols and what does that look like anyway i think we're in this new era of of nation builders yeah i think i think you're saying you're bullish on nations without states nations without states very very careful not to stay nation states i'm bullish just on nations and specifically internet nations right that is bullish on small communities of people yeah um i think that means you're bullish on discord channels yes discord channels disco channels i mean i said i was bullish on tokens i think you just said what i meant in a different way yes well you're bullish on their assets all right i'm bullish on the abstract things but they do have tokens i think velocity just nailed it man i i just uh it's a good episode anyway totally um but what do we got for meme of the week meme of the week let's do it it's cooking it up i am sharing a picture of trains and godzilla yeah so this is my the the reason why i love this uh train godzilla where did you get caught i don't know it's blurred what is that thing on the track those things that like end a train from going off the track what that's not like a balrog or a winning winged beast thing what are you looking at i mean did you watch a bunch of lord of the rings with your kids on vacation actually it's just like a barrier it's like a wooden barrier because that's the end of the train track okay this is a back to the future movie uh where they go back and uh is this back to the future number one i think it might be maybe my number two i can't remember anyways this is when they have to get their car up to 88 miles an hour using a truck yes it's three inspection feature three that's actually the future three okay so then they get they get they get the delorean up to 88 miles an hour and so then it disappears and goes back to the future and that is the merge the merge is when like the ethereum chain disappears from the proof of the big slow chunky proof of work train and then it disappears and then it goes to the proof of stake chain which is the future and then the proof of work train literally goes off of the track and crashes and burns and this is why i've been calling the d5 ecosystem on the proof of work chain is dividing by zero once the ethereum chain leaves proof of work and goes to proof of stake the proof of work chain crashes it goes off the bridge it dies uh and this is a great meme that that encapsulates this there you go it's back to the future nothing to do with dragons or lord of the rings or whatever else i said and but this does look like it's from a video game am i right about this or these actual scenes from a movie 80s animation bro that's 80s animation it's 80s yeah for sure 1985 yeah and all right i have time flies uh that's it for this week guys as always none of this has been financial advice never is it wasn't legal advice either it wasn't legal advice uh whatsoever but we are headed west this is the frontier
