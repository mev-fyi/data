if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at y earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well bankless nation welcome to this special episode we've brought our best legal mind onto the episode he is crypto twitter's lawyer he is the national representative of the bankless nation i feel like at least in our hearts he is this is jake trevinsky uh he's also the chief legal officer at compound labs and he is here to help us understand this new 12 o'clock midnight rule that just came down the pipe um the proposed full rule from treasury secretary mnuchin jake how you doing today happy holidays i'm doing well happy holidays how are you guys we are doing trying to figure this out i'm trying to try to figure this out yeah well so so that's what this episode we want this episode to be is just you put out some twitter threads about it can you explain this rule i guess to to cue everyone up to the context um there had been rumors circulating around the crypto universe for what feels like uh well feels like months but it's probably been weeks uh that something was coming right some some regulatory rules some clarification something from finson the rumor was that it was coming from minutian uh you put out this this uh tweet a couple of weeks ago that said hey heads up get your coins off of exchanges uh gets kind of sound of the alarm again that that something was coming so this has been i guess in the uh the rumor mill for quite some time we finally got what was coming down the pike i hope this is all that's coming down the pipe but it finally landed uh and it is a proposed rule from the financial crimes enforcement network in the u.s and uh the title is it's aimed at closing anti-money laundering regulatory gaps uh it does have an impact on crypto and so we are here to understand what that is i'm going to share maybe your your tweet thread jake because i think that provides a great summary of what we're looking at here but could you just go over like where this rule came from what it actually is and the highlights of it sure uh so you're right that this is the long awaited uh new proposal from fincen the financial crimes enforcement network uh that everyone has been talking about for quite a while um it is the only thing that we're expecting for now so this is sort of the big fight that we need to have before treasury secretary mnuchin is out of a job in uh in january um so to give you sort of an overview fincen is a bureau of the treasury department that enforces the anti-money laundering regulations which to boil it down to a very simple explanation requires certain regulated financial institutions to have compliance programs that record certain information about transactions that their customers are conducting through those intermediaries and also to report some of that information to the government among other requirements um of course crypto exchanges and custodians and other service providers are regulated financial institutions and have to comply with the aml regulations that fincen enforces um fincen derives its authority from the bank secrecy act to the bsa which we talk about a lot when we're when we're discussing these types of regulations the bank secrecy act is federal law passed by congress it delegates authority to fincen to create its own implementing regulations so vincent gets to decide to some extent what the rules are going to be for what financial institutions have to do to comply with the aml regulations until now crypto companies that were subject to the bank secrecy act only had to do this type of record keeping and reporting for certain transactions generally speaking transactions between regulated financial institutions so transactions from institution to another institution and this was done under something called the travel rule which we also talk about a lot which basically says when institutions send crypto between each other they have to send along with that crypto information about the people who are parties to the transaction so you know the names and the addresses social security numbers other information about the parties to the transaction until now and including right now the travel rule does not apply to transactions from institution to an individual's wallet where they hold their own private keys this is what the government calls an unhosted wallet as opposed to a hosted wallet which is basically just an account that you have with an exchange or custodian um i think we're sort of trying to get away from the term unhosted which sort of signals that when a person holds their own private keys it's somehow unusual or scary or dangerous or something like that it's just self-hosted it's not unhosted right sure self-hosted i you could call it non-custodial you could just call it a wallet right if you have a ledger or a treasurer or a meta mask that's just a wallet and if you have an account at coinbase or gemini or some other exchange that's an account that you have with them where they are in custody of your assets um but anyway the the travel ruling anti-money laundering regulations did not apply to transactions between an institution and your wallet this new proposed rule that fincen put out on friday would extend aml regulation to those transactions from institution to personal non-custodial wallet so that for you to withdraw your bitcoin or ether or other asset from coinbase to your own wallet coinbase will be required to collect your name and address associated with that wallet but yeah so uh you know the impact of this regulation basically is an increase in the amount of record collection and reporting that an exchange or custodian would have to do now with coinbase they do that anyway right so in order to onboard or trade with coinbase you it's aml kyc do you have to you know provide identity you have to provide address all of those things but i guess the distinction here is that um it wasn't explicitly required when you withdrew some crypto assets from coinbase to a particular wallet like they didn't ask necessarily um for you to approve or identify that particular self-hosted wallet is that kind of the difference here because i guess tell us about what we have been doing and submitting and then like what what it's going to look like moving forward should this move forward yeah so that's right so so ryan let's say you have an account at coinbase right coinbase is already kycdu they know who you are and they have all of your information related to your account with them but when you go to withdraw assets from coinbase to any other address on the bitcoin blockchain or the ethereum blockchain they do not ask you for information about who owns or controls that public address that you're withdrawing to so this new rule would require you to say you're withdrawing to an address that is controlled by a certain person whether it's you or let's say you want to withdraw assets from coinbase to david's wallet you would have to give coinbase david's name and david's physical address or else they would not allow the transaction that's interesting because we do that all the time with um you know a lot of people use exchanges as a poor man's version of a mixer if you want um your transactions to be obfuscated from one etherdress to to another you can kind of route it through an exchange um so something like that i guess you'd have to prove do you have to prove it or you just have to identify what the wallet is on the other side if i just say yeah this is david's wallet and here's his address and information do i have to prove that it's genuinely david's wallet it's a great question and and it actually gets to one of the biggest flaws of this rule which is no one knows and the rule doesn't say so what the rule says basically is the exchange has to verify you the customer so ryan if you have an account at coinbase coinbase coinbase has to quote unquote verify your information but they do not have to verify the name and address of the person who's on the other side of the transaction they simply have to obtain an electronic record of their name and physical address so basically this is very uncertain what that means it's possible that you would just have to tell coinbase who the the person is and where they live and coinbase wouldn't have to do any diligence to see if you're lying to them it's sort of hard to believe that fincen would be okay with that because of the two requirements that this rule has one is that that a coinbase or other exchange or custodian has to collect the name and physical address for transactions over three thousand dollars if the transaction is over ten thousand dollars they have to submit a currency transaction report to fincen so they actually have to turn over that information automatically to the government and the problem with this is um someone like coinbase can't turn over information to the government if they haven't done any diligence to see if that information is correct so they would in theory have to do some kind of verification or something like that to see if you're lying to them it's just totally unclear what's actually sufficient in order to satisfy that role so the person on the other side of the wallet say david might have to somehow verify his identity associated with that account before coinbase would release the funds to his wallet let's say that's a possibility it's certainly possible and you know one of the sort of disappointing things about this rule is whenever we have new rules we want them to be clear so that the institutions that are subject to them know how to comply when they don't know how to comply we end up in this world where you have lawyers like me trying to give them good advice but not really knowing what's good enough and what we see in traditional finance often is when you have this element of uncertainty institutions decide we don't know how to comply we don't want to take the risk that we're going to get this wrong so we're just not going to allow this type of activity at all because that way we know we're not going to commit any kind of violation this is known as de-risking so in the worst case scenario someone like coinbase says look we don't know what's enough to verify or be sure about the name and address of someone who controls a public address on the ethereum blockchain so we're just not going to allow any transactions with those addresses at all that way we know that we're not going to violate the law and maybe jake that's where your tweet came from a while ago where you said uh you know maybe now is a good time to get your money off of exchanges because perhaps you were fearful that exchanges didn't know what to do therefore that they would just start restricting in an abundance of caution is that maybe that's where that tweet came from that's part of it the the other thing is um aside from the actual text of the rule i think it's important to consider what government is trying to achieve here and specifically what secretary mnuchin is the really uh the brains behind this idea what he is trying to achieve um that end result where it is impossible to withdraw assets to your own wallet where you can use them in a censorship-resistant fashion uh that is what secretary mnuchin wants he believes that uh crypto addresses are swiss banks in everyone's pocket he is fundamentally opposed to that concept and i think that if he could pass a rule that says self-custody is illegal period i think he would um i think that you know not to get into sort of the inside baseball here but uh you know there have been a lot of reports about how much lobbying went on behind the scenes to stop something like that from happening and thankfully the rule didn't come out as bad and restrictive as that but ultimately we have to understand that there are policy makers who think that is the solution here to mandate custody so that they can reassert the ability to censor these transactions and so i wouldn't be surprised if we had aggressive regulators that they would try to use a rule like this as a smoke screen to disguise a desire to prohibit those transactions so i want to back up real quick and and kind of go over the the technical details of what we think this rule is likely proposing so if you we when you get a coinbase account you actually get one specific coinbase wallet uh one specific ethereum address one specific bitcoin address they can they can change but until they do you have one address right and if you want to according to this new rule if you want to send outbound money you have to attest to the ownership of that wallet either by you or somebody else and it seems to be that if you are an individual who uses coinbase frequently this won't really impact you if you set up another wallet an outbound wallet say your ledger or your metamask and you say that this is my wallet and you are free to transact between your coinbase account and your wallet that you've claimed ownership over and then from that new wallet that you've outbound all your money to you can use that as you've normally had you don't have to register uh transactions out of that wallet so if you are trying to get remove the impact of this rule from yourself you can just simply send all your money from coinbase to a wallet that you own first to get out of the walled garden of coinbase and then you can send it to all your friends and family and smart contracts and those transactions don't require any reporting requirements you just have to get your money to your wallet outside of the coinbase wall garden first is that correct that's right so the way to think about this is current law applies to transactions from institution to institution this new rule would extend those obligations to transactions from institution to wallet it would not extend any requirements at all to transactions from wallet to wallet so once you're outside the world of regulated financial institutions there are no anti-money laundering obligations on you as an individual i think that's really the scope to be paying attention to to me what this is is a constricting of the unknowns about how regulatory guidance wants to treat cryptocurrency transactions it's it's con it's restricting the unknowns down to just a few types of transactions but then then ultimately we find ourselves in like across the outside of the wall garden in the crazy world of defy where they're still we still haven't gotten regulation on that it seems to be there's just like this approach this incremental like uh uh concreteness about what the state wants and now it's getting further and further into the world of defy and now it seems to have just gotten one transaction closer right that's kind of how i view this yeah i think that's right for now i think it's just important to keep in mind as we look at a policy battle that i think we'll be having for years to come that the ultimate world that many policy makers would like to see is either one where assets are very difficult to get out of that wild garden so that they can maintain control over as much of this financial activity as possible or a world where there are some requirements that are imposed on wallet to wallet transfers we haven't seen any jurisdiction at least that i'm aware of uh you know in the world try yet to impose some regulation like that um but you know like i said i think as a policy matter there are some folks in government who would really like to see that so this is a battle that we are going to be fighting for a long time yeah let's be clear i mean this is this is absolutely the the final boss raising its head right it's not unleashing hell and all its torpedoes and all its firepower on crypto yet but this is absolutely the final boss kind of like peeking its way into crypto and the interesting thing about this jake is this also could have been a lot worse right well we could have gone down the path that switzerland has gone down um which is a bit more arduous as as i understand it uh in terms of identifying like self-custodied wallets um we could have gone down the path that maybe minutian wanted to go down which is sort of like prohibiting self-custody wallets all together and ether dresses all together so this is definitely the final boss raising its head uh and poking around at crypto um but it's also not as bad as it could have been i'd love your thoughts on that and also your thoughts on is this um i guess more arduous is this kind of rule proposed rule more arduous than what we see in the traditional financial state have they have they specifically targeted crypto um so yes to both of those questions yes this is the final boss right this is government perceiving peer-to-peer financial networks as a threat both to their monetary sovereignty and their ability to track our financial transactions for ostensibly law enforcement purposes but also any other reason why the government might want to have insight into our financial activity this is the big fight that we are going to have to have and i think it's coming now because especially over the course of the last year the importance of cryptocurrency on the global stage has increased significantly right we're seeing bitcoin hitting new all-time highs now there are a lot of um people who are expressing support for the future of crypto networks there are other governments that are setting up their own blockchain-based systems as in china for example so this is us getting to the final stage and having to fight the the final boss um is this more arduous than what traditional finance uh institutions are required to do yes it is this is i think uh not the same rule for the same activity which is how regulation is supposed to happen in the traditional world if you consider paper cash for example when you go to a bank to withdraw cash the bank knows who you are right you are ky succeed by the bank you have an account with them you prove who you are by for example putting a debit card into an atm and entering a pin you can then withdraw cash you do not need to prove anything about where the cash is going right you don't have to prove that your pants belong to you before you put cash in your pocket this new rule though would require basically that right proof of pants for uh for crypto withdrawals right you are already kyc'd by a crypto exchange you prove who you are by logging in and hopefully using two-factor authentication you should then be able to do whatever you want with your money and it's an atm it becomes an atm that's exactly right and you know as we all have talked about since the very beginning of of bitcoin with satoshi's whitepaper this is peer-to-peer cash it is a bearer instrument and there's no reason why it should be subject to additional restrictions beyond how paper cache has been treated for decades and centuries this is very much to me jake the macro battle here because it very much feels like and this applies to crypto absolutely but not just crypto as the world as our society transitions more to a digital world from an analog world it feels very much that those in power those in control whether it's a large corporation like facebook or whether it's a nation state want to strip away and take away rights that we previously had in the analog world because it's digital because they can because it's easier because you can put it all in a database this is one of my biggest worries for our world as we enter the 21st century right we need like a digital bill of rights that spells out our individual sovereignty and our rights inside of this digital landscape because if the nation state and like the powers that be get their um get their their their preferences in place there will be a stripping away of rights that we previously had in the analog world as we enter the digital world it's my big fear for all of this stuff as we enter the 21st century you are so speaking my language and i think this is so important to understand that as the world transitions into the digital era we are losing rights that we used to have and that should be guaranteed especially here in the united states by the constitution so just as an example when you walk down the street now you are captured basically every step of the way by cameras everywhere in cities right you basically do not have any privacy the second that you step outside of your home 50 years ago that was not the case right and similarly with money and finance uh there were many more ways to transact 50 years ago privately that we're just losing now because so many of these transactions are moving online where records are naturally kept and where they're being shared with government thanks to the bank secrecy act and the question is as everything comes to be online in one fashion or another at what point will we say our rights still matter and we should still be able to protect them in the digital space just like we had in the physical space for so long they're boiling the frog guys um we have to actively stand against this stuff let's talk more about this this rule um jake because so it it feels like um it's it's definitely inconvenient for exchanges and and like anyone who runs a custody crypto service provider the coinbase bases the circles the bit pays definitely inconvenient uh it feels also inconvenient for users but there's something here that is is also hidden that could throw a wrench in things and jeremy lear from circle mentioned this siraj from coin center mentioned this niraj used the term i think i'm gonna look up a tweet he said this might break smart contracts they might have broken smart contracts with this ruling and what i think he means is that we so far we've been talking about the very simple use case where you're withdrawing from coinbase to another uh etherdress or bitcoin address that an individual owns or some organization owns that has uh some physical location right but we all know in d5 this is this is not the case often in fact like we think the use cases are going to be uh you withdraw to protocols you withdraw to money robots right you withdraw to some sort of programmable dow that doesn't have an address there's all of these use cases because if there's an address it is therefore trusted and that's not what we are here for exactly so so and we've also talked about um very often the protocol sync thesis right which is basically this idea that um the world will build on these credibly neutral uh protocols and that even even crypto banks so the coin bases and circles of the world will stall start to build on d5 protocols but this might throw a wrench into things from a regulatory perspective can you tell us about that like what if the address that i'm trying to withdraw to is something like a protocol or you know compound or uniswap or something that doesn't have a physical address how does the rule affect that um no one knows so uh sort of similarly right uh one of the big flaws of this rule is it just doesn't say there's no answer to that question at all uh the rule is drafted to consider that very basic use case of ryan is a customer of coinbase ryan wants to withdraw assets either to his own hardware wallet or to a hardware wallet uh controlled by somebody else and coinbase is required to collect the name and physical address of the person who owns that hardware wallet whoever that person is the rule does not even describe the concept of a smart contract so when the rule says that this record-keeping and reporting requirement applies it it says it applies to transactions with quote-unquote unhosted wallets and it defines an unhosted wallet in the way that we would talk about an ordinary non-custodial wallet it's a public private key pair where an individual not an institution is in control of the private key um it is of course theoretically possible that a coinbase could figure out how to get comfortable obtaining the name and physical address of the controller the owner of a private key it's totally incomprehensible how they could do that for a decentralized protocol right decentralized protocols are not people they do not have physical locations i think there's there's maybe three ways of looking at how this might apply and this is a good point for me to throw in my usual disclaimer that although i am a lawyer i am not your lawyer nor do i represent anyone listening to this uh and so nothing that i say here is legal advice just sort of my thoughts on where this might go um but you know i think there's a couple ways of looking at this one is um because the rule does not talk about decentralized protocols it doesn't apply to decentralized protocols right there just wouldn't be this requirement at all to obtain any records related to those protocols okay d5 protocols don't have private keys contract addresses don't have private keys right so it may be that this rule just doesn't apply at all and it's no problem at all for for defy or for smart contracts and we don't have to worry about it that's one way of thinking about it another way of thinking about it which i like that way i like that way that sounds reasonable yeah me too i you know whether this is this is the problem when you have a rule that just doesn't say which is you could imagine a regulator trying to make some argument that a decentralized protocol is a subset of an unhosted wallet and they really meant for that to apply and hey exchange are you sure that you feel comfortable sending customer assets to that protocol or do you really want to de-risk that activity right this is where you're giving leverage to individuals working in government to scare their uh you know subject of regulation out of out of doing certain things and by the way that also scares the innovation away from jurisdictions like the united states for instance right so binance might feel perfectly comfortable building on top of defy but maybe a u.s jurisdiction-based exchange does not as a result of this they try to de-risk things right sorry there are other ways to interpret it yeah tell us yeah so the first is look this rule doesn't apply to d5 at all everything is cool a second way would be to say um the rule technically applies it says to the count to you know exchanges to collect the name and physical address of the counterparty to the transaction the counterparty might not be the decentralized protocol or the smart contract it might be some other person who is using the decentralized protocol or smart contract so imagine an institution for example that is conducting an exchange through a decentralized exchange protocol like a uni swap or something like that well maybe the government could say the rule requires collecting the name and address of whoever is on the other side of that trade it's not the protocol it's the counterparty right and that i think would be probably impossible because how do you figure out who the counterparty is it might mean a specific individual it might mean something else i think the the protocol the contract is the facilitator of economic activity between one and another party or one in multiple parties and there's no there's no way that we really see any ability for these parties to actually like coordinate outside of that contract in some sort of like email fashion or telegram saying hey here's who i am because the whole nature of the protocol is to not really require that right there's just no infrastructure to to make that happen i i think the third and um maybe the worst way of looking at this is you would say every single user of the protocol is a counterparty right so every single liquidity provider in uni swap in theory is a party to every single transaction that goes through uni swap i mean that's how ethereum works there's no way to tell which liquidity providers you're purchasing through uni or something like that so then you could say the rule requires coinbase to get the name and physical address of every single person in the world who is using a protocol so who knows because of this ambiguity right every single legal team as part of these exchanges as part of anyone who does custody of crypto asset is having that conversation and it's probably pissed and they're and they're but they're probably saying like their legal teams are probably saying like something along the lines of what you just said where there's ambiguity here what's what's your risk tolerance you could interpret it in these three ways how would you like to proceed basically so what that what that ends up doing is it has a chilling effect on exchanges doing work with decentralized protocols is that a valid take that's very valid i think i think it does a couple things one is yes it scares people away from activity that isn't clearly prohibited but that they're just not sure how they can comply it's it's really the worst thing about regulation is when there's uncertainty right businesses don't mind complying with regulations when they know how to comply and avoid the risk of a violation it's uncertainty that chills innovation the other problem is it pushes a lot of this analysis and to the extent that there is any clarity it pushes it into behind the scenes conversations between specific entities and the regulators that they're talking to in private conversations behind closed doors so it may be that coinbase would go to fincen and have a conversation with them and work out some deal of how fincen is going to apply this rule to coinbase specifically but no one else is going to know what that conversation sounds like so the process becomes private as opposed to public and this is really the biggest issue with this rule is is not even so much the substance of the rule it's the process it's that the public is supposed to have an opportunity to participate in this rulemaking the industry is supposed to have an open public conversation with regulators about what rules make sense what's what they can actually accomplish what's going to achieve the goals that government wants to accomplish in the end and that's not what's happening right now right this is just a last-minute rule that secretary mnuchin is trying to force through before he's out of a job in 30 days so why why is he doing this right so so there's a number of things going on first off it's extremely unclear legislation so we don't like that also we have this very very shortened comment period which apparently is unusual uh where we just as a as a world we don't really have much time to communicate about this so jake i want to i want to see if i can get you to get into the psychology of the people drafting this proposed rule making like why why are they okay with the lack of clarity do they do you think that they understand how unclear it actually is and maybe they don't care and and what's with this shortened comment period what's up with all of this this is this is weird like all of this is has a through line of kind of you know giving the middle finger to our industry right that's what i'm interpreting it as it's very weird it's it's totally out of order it is not how policy should be made in the united states it's it's very unusual um in terms of the policy process we usually see but first let me just make one quick correction david you said this was legislation uh it's actually not legislation and that's an important distinction legislation comes from congress it comes from our elected representatives our our representatives in the house and the senators in congress that's where this kind of thing should be done right these kinds of very significant rules should go through the democratic process they should be considered by our representatives who are accountable to us this is administrative rulemaking that's coming from one individual who was not elected but rather was appointed who is not answerable to us at all and that really is sort of what's what's behind all of this um it's a personal passion i suppose you could call it of the treasury secretary who is in charge of the entire treasury department this is something that steve mnuchin thinks is important um why exactly with everything going on in the world with everything that the treasury department could be focused on during a raging pandemic while we're all trying to figure out if if there's a stimulus deal that's going to help americans feed themselves instead of standing in food lines why this is the priority i have no idea and i think a lot of people are pretty confused and surprised that this is how secretary mnuchin wants to spend his time right now um i think it's it's important to note that there is not consensus in favor of this rule uh within government broadly or within the treasury department specifically uh fincen which would be tasked with enforcing this rule is actually fairly friendly to the industry the folks over at fincen are really very supportive and they understand the need for innovation and they spend a lot of time talking to us in industry to try to figure out how we can work together to accomplish their objectives which we all think are important right no one wants cryptocurrency to be used to finance terrorism or to obscure uh you know illicit activity or anything like that we want to help to the extent we can stop that kind of bad behavior um fincen i think is is unfortunately having to take its cues from its boss secretary mnuchin who's decided that um with limited time left the only way that he can get this rule in effect before he leaves office is to do it through this very hasty very inappropriate process and that's just what we're dealing with if you are looking for the front page of defy look no further than xerion.io xerion is your home base for managing your d5 portfolios xerion offers a central place for you

have to comment on this but i i this is a rule coming from a banker for the worst the worst of bankers let's talk about like so the problem and jake you don't you don't feel like you need to comment i know you have like to um talk to people in dc but like guys what's the problem here we're getting a banker to regulate the banking industry and he's putting in place pro banker rules that's what's going on i mean steven newton's his his dad worked for goldman sachs like 1995 85 excuse me he graduates from yale and he goes to work at goldman sachs an investment banker just like his father like this is this is a guy who has a very pro banking agenda and either doesn't care about d5 or or like doesn't see it i mean that is the macro problem here i i'm curious jake like how is it possible that we uh in in the american system that regulators have this level of power that unelected officials have this level of power to force something like this upon uh the american citizens right like tell us about the checks and balances i mean could could some legislation come out that overrules this you said this was not the proper process or the traditional process to follow but it seems like uh treasury has the power to push this through and enforce it what's like what's going on with our system that like we allow this kind of thing to happen um so i'm not convinced that they have the authority to do this actually uh and i'll tell you why um in a little more detail but first sort of how do we get here uh in the first place the answer is from the start legislation as i said comes from congress it comes from our elected representatives congress makes laws in making laws congress can delegate some authority to administrative rulemakers and that's what's happened here in the bank secrecy act congress sets some of the requirements that's the general framework for the anti-money laundering regulations but then delegates the authority to the secretary of the treasury to pass these implementing regulations so congress has authorized a lot of this administrative rulemaking um you know over the course of time and what i mean is you know decades and centuries since the founding of our country the power of the administrators of the executive branch has expanded significantly and a lot of that is uh as congress has sort of become less effective they've wanted to push off a lot of these tough decisions to someone else who's not going to be challenged or won't have to take you know difficult political positions in order to implement those rules there are also good reasons this happens right it's it's really hard and really not necessary all the time to go to congress and get all of our elected officials engaged on the minutiae of the definition of a money transmitter right it's okay to let uh to let administrative rulemaking take care of that the thing is administrative rulemaking is limited by something called the administrative procedures act the apa which is another federal statute that outlines how rule making has to be done the apa has requirements called notice and comment rulemaking requirements which says when the executive wants to adopt rules it first needs to give notice to the public of the proposed rule and then it needs to accept comments from the public to give the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process and only after it's done that can it implement a new rule and then after implementing a new rule they have to give at least a 30-day period before the rule becomes effective right which gives people time to figure out how are they going to comply with that new rule i think that what we're looking at right now is is the treasury department in violation of the apa by passing a rule like this and giving the industry only a 15-day period to comment is that a genuine opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process as federal law requires or is it just a pretext to jam through a rule that secretary mnuchin is going to pass no matter what the public says about it and if that's the case if this isn't a genuine notice and comment process then it's very likely we could challenge the rule in court and that a federal judge would strike it down as a violation of the apa so we have the the macro problem is we we've invested a lot of power into the executive branch and therefore this gives you know administrators the ability to push things down the pipe like this we we might have a chance to get it um struck down by the courts right um however it seems to me there are kind of two big things that are outstanding i guess for this bill so um the first is what will congress do right in the future will they be pro crypto pro or industry or against it and that's a longer legislative path right which i don't know how many months or years that that will kind of take to get some clarity around but the big most immediate thing is of course um we've got a lame duck executive branch right now and the new treasury secretary uh will begin in january and that of course is janet yellen if if i'm correct right biden's pick is janet yellen so there's the possibility that she could take a different administrative posture to this proposed rule or crypto in general but like what do we know about janet yellen because it's not clear to me that she is um much more much more crypto friendly than steve munition is what do you think happens when the biden administration takes over to both this proposed rule and then like projecting forward into her tenure um so first of all you're i think you're right to think about this as a 30-day sprint to try to stop this from happening before secretary mnuchin is gone and then after that a very long and protracted policy discussion and hopefully not but potentially battle over our ability to transact peer-to-peer which will definitely go on uh for years in terms of of janet yellen she is biden's pick i think it's fair to assume that she will be confirmed everyone seems to support her she's a fairly moderate voice um you know i i don't think that she'll be challenged so i do expect that we will have a treasury secretary yellen at some point probably february maybe march um to say that she's more positive on crypto than secretary mnuchin isn't saying much uh you really can't get worse than secretary mnuchin in truth but i do think there are reasons to be hopeful um and if nothing else uh i do think that a secretary yellen will be open to having an adult conversation with industry and with the people who have input on this issue will be willing to listen to reasonable voices and so i think if we can just survive this 30-day period hopefully without this rule going into effect we'll have a fresh slate starting on january 20th at 1201 pm eastern and we'll be able to uh you know have have a real discussion about what types of regulations might be appropriate right we are going to have to have that discussion we're not going to live in a totally unregulated world forever uh in terms of d5 specifically um but we just need to get to that point and and start having that conversation and see where uh janet yellen is on these issues you know what matters to her and what we can accomplish maybe i'm overly optimistic or overly bullish about my industry but i feel like if we got a person or set of regulators that could have what you just said jake which is a an adult conversation then that is bullish for our side of the debate our side of the conversation and and again maybe that's just my bias but i feel like an adult conversation benefits us bodes well for us uh as representatives of the industry due to some very sound arguments that i hear coming out of people like you jake and people like uh just the whole cohort at coin center um simply arguments like if if the if the status quo is to create regulation that mimics uh earlier regulation then crypto has a lot going for it that could be protected by legacy regulation and i feel like if we could just get a quote-unquote adult in the room that we can help regulate this industry appropriately that seems like the best path forward for both sides does that resonate with you very much so i completely agree i think that if we can have this conversation out if we can get all the nuance out and discuss the cost-benefit uh analysis of um you know preserving financial privacy and improving the ability of individuals to get access to financial services and having more resilience financial infrastructure for the modern era right all of these things i think are very persuasive and i think the weight of the evidence and the weight of the arguments falls on our side obviously i wouldn't be here doing this if i didn't believe that very strongly um there is a really uh big conversation that we have to have i mean just for example you guys are going to talk to rohan gray about the stable act um you know it's coming out tomorrow so that's awesome and you know that there's a very different view among some policy makers um on the left about how the financial system should operate just like there are very different views on the right not all in favor of the world that we envision but i do believe that we can convince the majority that what we are building is net positive for the world uh we just have to have that opportunity and that requires adults to be in the room and and you know in charge uh of making policy and enacting regulation yeah that hopefully that's something that we can get done with this new administration jake i want to see if i can get you to speculate here on something do you think that this bill this this proposed rule making proposed regulation whatever uh would still have come if the latter half of 2020 didn't see the crazy price action that bitcoin and ethereum and the this whole entire space has do you think that the noise from the bullish cohort of crypto people kind of uh kicked uh this regulatory in movement into high gear do you think that noise from the crypto space made this happen um this would have happened anyway uh in fact um i think it's the opposite i think that if not for bitcoin setting new all-time highs and getting a lot more support and becoming front of mind for a lot of um people who in past years weren't interested in this i'm thinking about the stan drucken millers of the world right the you know big investors who've gotten into this i think if not for that then the regulation would have been worse um this was always coming and we've been hearing signs of this for a really long time i think the last time i spoke with you guys we we had a chat about this a little bit uh you know going back to june of 2019 the fat f uh the financial action task force and international standard setting body was already talking about money laundering and terrorist financing concerns of peer-to-peer transactions so this is something that's been on the radar for a long time i think it was always coming and frankly the more successful we are and the more sort of reputable credible folks from traditional finance express support for what we're working on the less aggressive i think regulators can get away with being but look back to ryan's point about who secretary mnuchin is you know i don't want to um disparage him personally uh i i think that he has genuinely held beliefs about crypto um being for criminals i think that's what he thinks i think he believes that honestly but you are right to point out that he comes from a world that probably doesn't want to see this technology succeed in the way that we want it to i'll be very curious to see where he goes after he's out of office but a lot of this does come from sort of the traditional world um you know to the extent that they're not accepting of what we're working on trying to sort of tamp it down i'm gonna guess he doesn't go uh work at a d5 protocol startup after his tenure here but we will see i think that's fair yeah the other thing is just like the lack of understanding or care about like d5 that that sort of comes through and that makes sense in the in in the banker world you know every bank account is owned by an individual or an account or a company in the d5 world that is not the case so it's a new paradigm too so some of this is just so ham-fisted in its last lack of specificity and it comes from that place too i want to get your prediction on something else too jake so you said the next 30 days is sprint time right what's the probability that the crypto industry rallies the um folks that are anti this particular rule uh when and it doesn't go into effect what kind of probability do you give that and what needs to happen for that outcome to happen um i think that's all told the probability that we can stop the rule from being effective as of january 20 is more than 50 percent maybe not by much 51 percent um there's two reasons for that one is um there is still a chance as as committed as we think secretary mnuchin is to this that we can still convince him this is the wrong way to do it uh it's at least worth trying and what that means is we need to be very active in making the most of our very limited public comment period even over christmas and new year's um so the one thing i'll ask the audience to do is please submit a public comment if if you don't know how follow me on twitter i will put out a thread at some point soon with some general thoughts about how to do this how to write an effective public comment but we need to rally the troops and make sure we are heard loud and clear about how bad this rule is and how bad the process behind this rule is there's still some chance that we can convince uh the treasury department not to put the rule into effect at all if they do i think it is highly likely i wouldn't say guaranteed but highly likely that a lawsuit will be filed immediately the moment that the rule goes into effect and that lawsuit would seek from a judge a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the rule and if we get a preliminary injunction which again who knows but i think the chances are pretty good i think the arguments for an apa violation are very strong and the rule would not be effective as of january 20th so i think we've got those two shots convince treasury not to do the rule convince a judge to enjoin enforcement of the rule and if it's not in effect as of january 20th i believe very strongly that fincen will walk away from it so that's what we need to do we need to make sure vincent can walk away from this uh on january 20th jake you know bankless nation is going to be behind helping to comment on this and um like make sure make sure that it doesn't go into effect to the extent we are able to can i ask you about the comments themselves does anyone actually read them if if a whole bunch of bankless members who uh are using d5 protocols submit individual comments about how they're using you know defy and you know um does that really matter like do people does mnuchin and the folks around him are they actually going to read these things and does it make a difference um it in general it does make a difference i think it makes more of a difference than people give it credit for first of all the law requires uh this to be a genuine process right the law says that public comment is not a mere formality so someone does have to read these comments and they are supposed to at least under law uh be considering these comments very seriously and really looking for input from the public i also think that um as much as we may you know bash regulators for having their own ideas and you know not really wanting to engage with us there are a lot of really thoughtful people on the other side of these decisions and if you have intelligent respectful and persuasive public comments if you come in in volume a lot of comments and with substance right deep thinking then i do think that that can make a huge difference and also look if we submit hundreds or thousands of really well considered comments and then five minutes after the comment period is over the treasury department puts this rule into effect and doesn't address any of the arguments made in those comments that's going to make our lawsuit a lot stronger so it is really important that we do that there's some chess playing going on with how to approach this it sounds like yes definitely it's uh it's a complex game but uh that's the game we're playing so we got to do it right ryan you're muted it sounds like we have some action items here then so jake how how long do we have to comment is it 15 days yeah so uh i think at this moment the comment period isn't even open yet so the rule was was not yet published in the federal register so that's the moment when the comment period opens i'm guessing that's going to happen today or tomorrow once it does we can all make sure that the place to submit comments is easily accessible so i'll make sure that's available i'll send it to you guys too to to send out to the bankless nation and then yes it seems the comment period will be open until january 4th um it is best for people to write their own comments write their own unique thoughts that are personal to them but for people who can't do that or don't feel comfortable we will also try to create a template uh with suggested language that people can use it's like it's less effective to have a thousand comments that are all the exact same language um but it's it's better than nothing so we'll try to get that out too jake here's what we want to do i think so um you know it sounds like we'll have at least till the first week of january maybe into the second week to to submit one of these comments right so maybe come the first week of january if you put out some resources we will publish a how-to in bankless that is how to create an effective comment uh on this on this kind of proposed rule and we will rally the troops and um get as many folks as possible to you to comment on this and and see what we can do at least we will make our voices heard that is what we are here to do um i i tweeted this out it's to me it this kind of thing long-term uh it's not really crypto that has to worry about it right like it's it's it's the us it's it's crypto will be fine whether or not very um severe regulation goes into place like long term crypto's gonna survive it's gonna be fine other jurisdictions other nations will adopt it that at least is my belief this is kind of like more for the u.s does the us want to put a chill on this industry and get left behind the rest of the world right that's the question as as an individual that lives in the u.s i don't want that to happen i want like the us to take an active role in promoting uh cryptocurrency so so that to me is is another reason why we why we comment uh and why we try to push this this through at the nation state level um i think that's kind of it guys well we we covered it because it seems like the summary is this is not as bad as it could have been right um you know as far as folks taking their funds off of exchanges feels like they can do that now it feels like if this goes into place there's the possibility jake that uh some crypto exchanges could take kind of a a fully de-risked line and stop exits off exchanges right like that's a possibility that exists um so you might want to use this this period of time to think through the implications of that and like maybe withdraw some funds from exchanges um comment period yeah coming up it definitely feels like this turnover from mnuchin to janet yellen could be another opportunity for us it also feels like um the fight is not over yet so this 30 day sprint is going to be a very important period of time for us to try to try to get this um proposed rule out of the the conversation and and uh knock it down so is there anything else in summary uh david or jake that's all i've got i you know i just want to say i really appreciate your support i think this matters a lot to all of us and uh you know maybe the last thing i would say is what gives me hope is everyone in our world has banded together to fight this this is one of those moments where it doesn't matter if you're a bitcoiner or an etherean we are all together on this and it's been amazing to see everyone band together so we will get this done and in the end we will prevail so thanks a lot for the chance to come on and chat about this yeah thanks for coming on and then helping us walk through it drake as always you are a light in a dark night when it comes to things like this and i think the only thing i want to leave the listeners with is like this is likely not the only time we're going to be doing this this is not going to be the only piece of legislation that is proposed or something that we don't want to see uh happen and so this is this is a battle but there is a war to be fought and so it's really important for the bankless nation to actually be participating in their civic engagement in their civic duties right this is going to be a marathon not a splint sprint and we need everyone to be in on that with us together so if when we put out some sort of like how to write a public comment that is your training for the next time that we have to do this too because it's going to come and so we might as well get into the habit now yeah it's a good point and look you know not to drag this out but it is good to learn how to write a public comment in general because there are going to be good things that we want to comment on too right someday the sec is going to solicit public comments on an ether etf and i'm guessing folks are going to want to know how to write in favor right in support of the ether etf approval so this is something we should get in the habit of we should engage in our democratic process um and make the most of it yeah i mean some of these public comments likely led to the the possible cme listing of ether futures um so it does matter it does have an impact last thing guys um we have uh a podcast kind of a podcast a youtube only i guess it's not going on the podcast with rowan gray uh and and david um that comes out i think tomorrow on on tuesday um yeah so could you t maybe that up because that's almost an extension of of this conversation rowan comes at it from uh a left progressive movement in the u.s perspective and the thing that struck me about that conversation is he's very mmt he thinks basically the uh the nation state should be the kind of the sole arbiter of money as a public good uh he also thinks transactions should be private right so privacy preservation so my guess is he would be anti this kind of minutian um type of aml kyc enforcement can you give like tee up that episode yeah yeah i do like that character characterization where there are people in government that want the government to do things that are completely the opposite or totally alternative to what mnuchin is proposing with this so like we have to fight the fight on different fronts i guess but also there's different reasons or different arguments that we would have to put up against rohan where we would against uh something like coming out of mnuchin uh i actually really like between mnuchin and rohan i actually much prefer rohan as a as a uh he's much more fun and and friendly to engage with and he's really smart the guy's really smart people in the crypto space think that he's like this dummy guy that doesn't know i understand our industry and they're wrong uh and the conversation with with rowan uh for me was really valuable because he does understand our industry he does understand what can happen out of the technology here yet he still wants a state's top-down money system alternative and so understanding those arguments i think is really valuable and it's again just another angle that we're going to have to fight from the nation-state side of things and so totally different from what mnuchin is is proposing but still the same because it's coming from the central government so um i guess uh this week is just a a crypto verse nation state type of week i would i would almost want his his comments on this this uh minutiae proposal because like we should we should tweet this out to him because one of our challenges at the end of the episode with rowan is basically like hey if you're asking us to put all of our our eggs in the nation state basket you better make sure that citizens have their privacy right and that that that comes intact because well he's doing that and centralizing things on the mmt front there are folks in government like mnuchin that are you know make it so that that individual citizens don't have don't have privacy so uh one often goes with the other anyway this is an ongoing conversation on bank list as you can tell jake trevinsky thank you so much for being with us thank you for being the crypto lawyer for for the bigless nation today we appreciate it thank you guys
