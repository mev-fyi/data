It's Never As Good As It Seems it's never as bad as it seems in crypto we've been through things like this before right we went through Mount gox we've been through crypto Cycles up and down we went through three arrows capital in Celsius and Voyager and Terra Luna so look in any kind of marketplace or economy or in capitalism in startups right like a thousand ideas are going to be tried and some of them aren't going to work but others really will and they'll rise to the top and that's that's what capitalism is about it's about trying many different ideas and seeing which ones work and those grow and they get to allocate more Capital into the next things so this is incredibly painful I know some people are probably experiencing financial hardship due to it and they are in the traditional economy as well with down markets so I want to be very sympathetic to that and also send out a reassuring message that crypto is resilient we're going to get through this and we're going to build the future in an even more powerful way
