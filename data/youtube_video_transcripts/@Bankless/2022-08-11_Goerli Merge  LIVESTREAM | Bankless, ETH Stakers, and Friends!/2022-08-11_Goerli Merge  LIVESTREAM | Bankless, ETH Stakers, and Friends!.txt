lot they're all just they're all just one poet people all right we're live guys where's danny they're all just they're all just when we need danny do we want the developers in here or do we want them you know at their at their stations you know what do you mean imagine like developer like station ready looks like laptop in bed [Laughter] this is how ethereum was made so wait is it are we live yet we are live we are live hudson yay you are in the point zero one percent of people that have been on a live stream while inside of the plane [Laughter] he's not really on a plane that's just his backdrop it's a lie yeah you have this is just a really really good zoom background okay so you uh i showed you guys what uh okay for the listeners and for the viewers uh they the the people here in the chat don't know what my screen looks like so you guys should go to the youtube just so you can see the screen looks like we have the uh beacon chain slot visualization in the top left corner we've got the eighth price in the bottom left corner because of course but i know i know how the east price chart works i don't know how the slot visualization chart works so to kick things off can somebody explain what the hell we're looking at yeah so we're looking for two things um we're looking at block production and participation and so uh right now we're going to continue on the girly beacon i'm sorry the girly uh proof of authority test net um and everything will sail along fine then when we hit total terminal difficulty uh that's when the execution layer will switch to uh the crater network and this will hopefully continue like it is we will expect to see some changes in participation like we're going to expect to see a slight drop in participation some people aren't going to be configured right they're not going to be updated right that's okay but we're hoping for at least 66 percent of continued uh participation and that will mean that uh the uh the merge chain can continue to finalize the other thing we're going to be looking at are these blocks and we want a lot of green blocks those are block proposals we like we like green we don't like red we don't we do like green we don't like red but you can see there are a lot of red blocks here that's no big deal as a test net there's nothing at stake so a lot of people um will set up a validator and forget it and so when that validator is selected for a proposal it's not online it's an empty slot and we just keep going uh so what we're looking for to happen uh after the the total terminal difficulty after the merge in about 30 minutes is that this looks pretty much like it does if we see a bunch of red slots if we see participation below fall below 66 percent we'll start wondering why and also we'll see a lot of red candles right well so here's here's the thing that i i keep saying every time um right what we see is is literally a visualization it's not the network it's a one view of the network by a piece of software developed by beacon chain to help us interpret uh what we're seeing but really what this is tonight this is a show this is a a way for us to come together as a community and watch it but we won't really know until like late tonight or tomorrow how successful the merge actually was so this is just for show this doesn't actually matter sweet i mean it does but it's i wha what what i i get concerned about we what we don't want are for journalists to um take what happens today yeah and then ethereum marriage failure or or they say it's a complete success and then tomorrow the devs are like ah things went really bad we don't want anyone to interpret until you find uh postmortems from developers who are saying you know this is this is what actually happened and it went well or it didn't go well okay cool thank you for that very helpful and now a word from our sponsors kidding i'm kidding [Music] we're not doing that all right somebody else make a joke the sponsor tonight is actually rocket pool if you'll notice i don't have a rocket i need one i have i have a joke thank you thank you wait what was this joke yeah i didn't hear it oh i said i have a joke tron low blow i've heard that joke like four times and i'm like damn it that's joke is so dumb why am i laughing it gets me every time uh so for people who aren't are kind of new to this we are watching uh bordell.wtf for timing um you can find seamonkey's twitch stream at twitch.tv twitch.tv seamonkey1982 where he has a bunch of clients kind of cycling through and we're also watching the uh proposal uh visualization from beacon chain okay so bordell.wdf this this graph automatically scales right so this it doesn't look like this blue bar is getting closer but what's actually happening is these these graph the numbers on the x and y axis are actually getting closer and closer and closer is that right yeah i believe okay so this is this we're approaching the blue line is going to the red dot when the red when we hit the red dot that's when we merge but the blue line doesn't look like it's going to the red getting closer to the red dot but it actually is getting closer to the red dot who knows which is a really funny thing um and i'm sure thorsten will be able to explain this to us better i think a lot of us believed that the um the girl emerged will be very predictable uh because it's a proof of authority network and we're like well they'll they'll target it you know a month in advance and we'll know exactly when it's going to hit but there was still variability in that and that is because of that there is actually difficulty on um gurley um cool cool all right david yeah you wanna do you wanna make someone co-host i think there are people in the waiting room oh oh my god oh oh oh geez oh geez oh geez oh god all right here we go how many people oh 11 people oh god oh god here they're all coming in they're all coming in in here sorry sorry everyone i was making jokes about sponsors and showing the youth chart price i was getting worried i was going to have to explain something but now we got all the core devs in what's up everyone you are all live by the way so everybody be perfectly silent yeah no one's saying anything i was gonna i was gonna say the blue line is going to the red dot all the blue lines uh so i i was going to say that didn't offer aren't you responsible for developing or implementing girly that was several years ago right how did that all come about good morning hello did you just ask me about the developing girly yeah i kind of remember the launch uh of that like um i remember seeing pictures or even maybe a video clip of it how how did how was girly uh conceptualized and instantiated oh yes that's actually like a short clip on youtube on launching girly um yeah the idea was um it was like four years ago when i met with the chainsaw team in toronto and we were talking about like this separation of test nets back in the day because there was like parity ethereum which was exclusively offering the kovan testnet to their users and there was the goes here which was exclusively using offering lecturing b testnet and there was nothing really working in between these clients except for robson which was fairly unstable at times and um there was this idea like floating around to um have a stable cross-client test net for application developers that is much more reliable than proof of work and so we first tried to implement like uh the parity um proof of authority uh consensus algorithm and gas during east berlin in 2018 it was a lot of fun but we completely failed and in the end disqualified at the hackathon uh but nevertheless we had a lot of fun and this idea was born and eventually like half a year later we were able to um with some community support uh able to launch um girly um the other way around so we implemented the the guest consensus engine which is called click uh we um we're able to implement this in parity in a variety of other clients so we were able to launch it in early 2019. we even had a small conference in berlin it was called girlycon girlycon zero and um we we yeah made some fuss around it we had like a red button on stage and someone had to push it and then we created the first block and then it kicked off and yeah that that was a long story short yeah very cool yeah gurley is now like it has come a long way because it is i guess the de facto test net so um congratulations on getting that up and running yeah i'm super uh uh excited about this and i mean uh they just said that we pushed this red button so i was basically around for the first block on my uh on my machine and um tonight and probably half an hour i would see the last block produced by this very same authority so um yeah i'm looking forward to merging this and i'm also um i want to say um i'm super happy about like how visionary the prison team was back in the day they said if we want to launch a new testament we need to like um be sure we have a test net and there's an enough resource allocated for uh um eth2 testing and development and um apparently so gurley was always the go-to test net for east 2 development and testing um because we had the chance with launching a new test net to allocate a lot of resources um uh with regards to like available test net ether to the client teams and um so that yeah here we are now merging it and i'm really happy to to just look forward the next three years after the match thanks so much for sharing that that was that's a really great uh history of girly and and why it's still so relevant today like it is um it's going to be carried forward and i i think the excitement of tonight is uh gurley will be or crater will be uh the the flagship um test net for the beacon chain and so after tonight we'll have a much better idea of what things are going to look like look like for mainnet merge but actually be good if someone wants to describe what's going to happen after today like tomorrow there's going to be i guess it's a consensus call who wants to maybe talk about what the flow of decision making is going to look like after this i can probably jump in on that um so yeah tonight my time tomorrow for most people uh is the consensus layer call and all core derms last week we said what we'd do there is look at how the gauley merge goes and assuming it's going smoothly at that point hopefully it will be then we will try and pick a tentative four key pop for bellatrix which is the consensus layer upgrade that kind of gets it ready for the merge so that's already happened on goalie a few days ago or a week or two ago um and a tentative ttd for mainnet so basically the aim is what six hours 12 hours um is to actually schedule the merge from main net it's tentative though um because there is an increase in the dag a part of the mining the proof-of-work mining that's happening which will just push it over what a five-gigabyte card or asic could handle and we're not 100 sure how many of them there are so we want to see how much of the hash rate drops off because that will affect the ttd that we we ultimately pick so that we can time the merge at least reasonably well if it drops off a lot we pull that back so it doesn't take too long to get there but essentially we're you know we're monitoring and seeing how things going and actually we're in the deployment phase of the merge now um where we'll set configs so for what users should expect um you probably won't see client releases for another week or so but be ready from about there that it's probably a relatively tight timeline um between those releases going out and bellatrix activating because we don't want too long between when we have to set total difficulty and when it's actually going to happen because the longer it is the harder it is to predict the time in the greater time range that might go on um so could i ask you to do something risky and and sort of um offer a prime date that people should sort of be willing to say to pencillin on their calendar like this is the day that that would be you know and i know because in other words when merge no no no no like when when they can kind of expect for those client updates with ttd baked in to be out but also before the merge when because there's going to be a lot of gray space in there but one of the questions i get is um is fizz when can i update and know that i'm i'm gonna be ready without having to continually fuss with it yeah so um the aim is that kind of 18th 19th of august so that's in a week's time we should be seeing client releases come out which are fully merge ready now we don't have commitment on that from all teams that they can kind of prep the release with the tentative thing and get it out quite that quickly so it might slip a bit but around that time you should have those final releases and you should then be able to do all the merge ready preparation switching to using the execution engine api between your consensus layer and setting a fee recipient that kind of thing and not seeing any warnings in the logs about uh you know configuration not being called or some of the stuff you might have seen if you've tried to set up mainnet early and once you're there once you've got those updates in place you are ready for the merge the only thing that you then need to to do apart from the usual monitoring of your node is keep an eye out for additional releases or changes to the total difficulty it isn't a case where we can really easily predict things we are expecting that we'll set these values and they will stick and that's fine but um validators should absolutely be prepared and ready and everyone really should be ready for us to say possibly fairly last minute hey something's happened all the miners have dropped off earlier than we thought we're never going to reach ttd we're going to bring it in closer or hashrate suddenly spike someone's trying to attack the chain um we're going to push it out or whatever it is there may be changes so just be ready for that and watching for client updates thanks very much adrian uh and so adrian is from the tecu client uh if you ever have any interest in um setting up a client adrian is extremely knowledgeable and glad to help so uh we always appreciate your time thank you it looks like sassel is in the waiting room david no i'm here he let me in okay how'd he get in here [Laughter] oh man is that the guy that won the dance i think he i think he did he wanted to dance this is a very good point hudson this is sassel's opportunity to dance while we do jonathan man's song because i think it's gotta happen wouldn't it be better on the on the mainnet stream though would you guys want it on there we wouldn't want to run everyone off on maintenance i'm the master of kicking this can down the road if you watch the merch is called you have to do the dance now people need context about this dance oh god someone else can give the context it's giving me ptsd now every time someone mentions it we didn't have a bear market we had the biggest bull market ever after i tweeted that and i wasn't going to get a better market and then we had a bear market because he didn't dance i get it yeah yeah i'm responsible for all ball and bear markets i am the god of the market no you're not responsible for the bull market it's just the bear markets ah okay okay i'm trying to give myself too much credit david brings us the bull markets anthony brings us the bear markets that's how it works this is this is known well david moved to places like five times during the bull market so that's responsible for the bear market for making arbitrary lines in the sand [Laughter] next bull market i'm moving to to the moon i'm just like oh you guys still haven't made it to the moon yet i live here move here move to move where i am we can we can be real life friends sir you cannot pay me enough money to live on that side of the globe [Laughter] oh can i pay you enough eighth though i'm getting closer heading in the right direction how press tweets why do you all have the eth price chart up on the stream lol this ain't about price there's plenty of free white space on the on the screen so what am i gonna do uh it's more interesting than the the green squares somebody yeah how the uh hold on i'm gonna dm the link eight people are in there god damn how many people are we letting you need to get up hey make somebody a co-host yeah make a co-host i will not share my power he's not used to sharing power with anyone but ryan another people on the youtube chat are asking what the green and red and gray boxes mean so somebody should explain that and it's not going to be me super fizz that's you i'm sorry i'm messaging how explain the the boxes again people are asking they're not they're actually qualified people here now oh um someone qualified me anymore i already did it uh green boxes all right i'm i'm gonna call on puja well i am not sure if i'm the best person to explain this i see marieth on the call and other jabs but as per my understanding green means it's all good red means something is going wrong maybe bad blocks or something but obviously um if any other deck would like to shine in i can handle this one i'm good for something so each uh row of blocks represents one epoch there's 32 slots in each epoch and we get a green square if the slot is filled with a block which means all good we get a red square if there is no block which means whoever validator was responsible for proposing that block is offline so we're looking for green and then gray i think is just uh like network latency and beacon chain struggling so does that make sense thank you for that nolan are those those are late proposals that could still be included in this epoch like they're not missed yet they could just be late yeah i believe typically they end up being red though youtube comment says if you get four reds in a row then you sink their battleship [Laughter] how much time is left does someone have the have that up i think four reds in a row is it bullish divergence is that about right all right youtube chat let me uh hang on i'm gonna do some logistics real quick so i have like everyone on screen all at once and there's like two panels of speakers and we're all really small youtube chat i want you to know if you want me to switch to speaker view and so you only really see one person but you'll see who's speaking but then if that happens somebody else is gonna need to share a screen cause i can't do both so we'll take a moment and wait for youtube 11 11 minutes left i also want to point out we have two things that we want to accomplish that is uh the song a day and the ho app um with 11 minutes we can squeeze them possibly squeeze them both in um actually maybe we should do one before and one after how does that sound i'm down for whatever whichever folks want to do okay um are we thinking like a three minute song is that fair yeah somebody just just go like this when we hit three minutes because i'll lose track of time wow so yeah so this will not be can you pull up the website and share that for anyone who remembers the absolutely awesome uh robston call where jonathan mann performed for like seven hours straight i i don't think we're gonna be in that mode tonight um we we do want to obviously mark the time with a great song but uh it's it's going to be a a shortie and uh did we decide that we're going to use youtube comments i think roopsten call it was three minutes as well but we had a bug and we had the decimal point off by one so it ended up being 30. yeah and today we're going to be using um folks in the youtube comments are going to be providing the lyrics for the song so everyone pray pray for us yeah leave the obviously nasty stuff out [Music] why don't we do the po-op stuff now super fizz why don't you do that why don't you get that stuff out of the way oh yeah that's great um that's absolutely perfect uh who is who's rolling up poep um i just i just dropped the slide in the chat is nick's presenting dicks can pull that up awesome thanks thanks so in order to qualify for the po app tonight uh we're uh using this part to celebrate this important moment in ethereum history you need to send two dollars worth of usdc rye die eath or matic to coincenter.eath on either mainnet polygon arbitrim or optimism so hopefully there's lots of flexibility there for folks and you need to do that before tomorrow or depending on where you are in the world 23 59 utc which is around 8 p.m eastern time on august 11th so that's the instructions on the po app and i'm going to be doing the analytics on that so please qualify uh by sending in your transaction and then get you added to that delivery and we'll tweet it out i'd love to hear someone qualify why we feel like coin center is a great uh recipient of these funds and david you might actually be perfect for that sorry was the question uh yeah so why coin center why do you think the coin center is worth the funds well uh the current time can i do uh never mind well they can't see me talking uh well if you guys noticed uh they uh finn said no not vincent treasury banned tornado cash uh and so now we have this whole like is open source software free speech and is that uh is that worth defending or not and i think everyone who's in crypto is like yeah we should totally defend that and coin center is the agency that is really like going after and and promoting these ideas that open source software is a human right that we should not be able to ban uh and so since in the spirit of tornado cache getting on the uh the ofac sdn list i figured coin center would be the appropriate uh place to donate to at this present moment you know what's frustrating about it too is we already went through all of the code is free speech stuff i think mostly before i was even born and now we just randomly have to run it back and do it it's different with money this time but yeah it's more or less the same it's more or less the same you're talking pgp right pretty good privacy and printing that out into books and then shipping it that was interesting back in the day how do i go to zoom settings why do crypto guys keep saying that it's different this time it's always the same history rhymes yeah well i mean last time it was just cryptography and this time it's money and so like i mean but you say so every bear market it's different this time we have an option yeah i mean the patterns are similar but i mean now now we just have to draw the line okay okay last time was data and this time it's money you know i was trolling you i know you know along with a coin center thing we mentioned receiving or making donations in rye i think it would be awesome and i i don't know this will happen or i can't guarantee it it would be neat if we were able to provide a supplemental co-app to the people who uh donate to queen central that it's pretty yeah we love you it's pretty white evil me evil making trees it's many of us that will jump through the hopes for that silly thing you you know i just said it so i can get two co-apps uh yeah so obviously i don't know how to work out but um we will have the on-chain data to say to find out what you contributed to coin center with if you choose to do that and there is a very small possibility that uh that we will be able to provide a uh a supplemental poep to the people who contribute with with rye because as we understand right now it is the most censorship resistant um stable coin in ethereum i mean if you are promising the pop you have to honor it because through gold now it's you now super you promised it it's gonna be if sam will pull the data i'll do the delivery how's that all right po-appathon i'm i'm coming your way to uh to request a poep all right we're getting should we should we should we sonify i think yeah we need a song we need music okay i'm gonna be singing the youtube comments so jesus lord uh let's just go all right everybody in the youtube comments be nice [Music] how's going everybody who's right i'm not singing that comment i'm not singing that comment i'm [Music] that's going too fast for me to read that's going too fast for me to read santornato oh puppet puppet this is my favorite [Music] tornado [Music] rocket rocket pool party girly girly party flip a name we can do it oh nancy pelosi merchant converge yeah i like girly girls [Music] emerging flipping [Music] ready [Music] [Music] is that about three minutes i don't know that was awesome that was about three minutes that was a great timing thank you good timing those comments were so freaking fast i don't know how yeah i like literally it was moving faster than i could well when you engage with the commenters you you you you know you encourage them yeah yeah it sets it off it's like a lighting a fuse can we just appreciate that the uh sealers on girly mash to make this an aussie friendly merch time for a change really nice thank you this this light on the side of my face that's sunshine i don't think an ethereum caller has ever seen that before i have no i haven't seen i've seen that in person only oh who got danny in here what's up danny hey johnson what's that on your cat what's the logo that's clock nft it's a really great uh company they back up your they help you back up your nfts really great idea right on thank you i couldn't tell my buddy art gnome yo bank lists a lot of money for the ad spot by the way yeah it'll send you the invoice later it looks like we're really close to ttd payable and pretty difficult so let's switch to the um if we're not already there to the visualization slot visualization um one or two blocks to go now and so actually no we want to see pandas uh take us to a panda view that's the important thing we've got the logs i think we're on that right i don't know what we're seeing on the live stream oh yeah okay see the logs down there and so the big thing we need to remember is this is not going to tell us success or failure this is for fun to be together to watch it uh but we did it yeah where are the pandas trent says we can mention after i see terminal block detected [Music] so i think we decided that um nimbus had the best i see panda yay abandoned probably gonna have to up our panda viewing game for maynet that's really like we'll get some we'll get some live pandas and we'll make sure they're on the stream is that is that a promise from you anthony is that yes i'm going to bring two live pandas to the main net stream you can count on that i promised that like i promised the dance i'm sure something interesting everything now every one of your promises is a promise like the dance for promise [Laughter] the first block has 299 transactions that is great we know that one of the bugs we kept seeing was empty blocks after the merge so the first block having 299 transactions is fantastic on geth logs i saw filtered out non-terminal pow block which i think means you know some of the clique signers are continuing on which is expected and interesting but you know fine is uh i don't even have a drop of peers here which is impressive guest terminates after three minutes i think is that right marius pow i don't think so i don't think they'll turn off the gossip stuff until at least finality okay nobody stops mining right yeah it should so the last time i made some mistake and i'm not sure if i actually fixed it um but i um i need to set up my own network and try it again to make sure that we actually shut down the miner but nonetheless yeah i mean we we iterate over the same block we iterate over the the so we build on top of the last terminal block but it's it's actually not easy to shut down the mining software from within gas because we can only not provide web packages and if we do that then the mining software will still uh query us so it kind of depends on on your mining software whether your gpu miner will actually shut down but the click miner should shut down automatically i'm not sure we also know a number of the clique signers didn't even upgrade so like their software doesn't even know about ttd and they'll just keep mining until someone turns them off uh apparently not because in click you need at least 51 of them authorities online and i think this is not the case for the non-upgraded so we have less than 51 percent not upgrade so the old chain will just stop at this block so they'll be attempting to continue to do their job but won't be able to basically wait for someone else to sign hey i actually heard a great suggestion um since since uh many of the uh since if we wait you know for two finalized epochs could we go ahead and maybe just do mainnet tonight since everybody's kind of here just like yeah i mean if you say so that's probably the reason why legit that's rough consensus of that's a literal suggestion traitors ask for the merge this whole time and you guys would have done it yes yes the basic team here we're thinking no yeah i mean i think if our like main threat model or is our our main goal is getting the uh pow wtf made then it would be a great idea uh but it's uh probably not the best for security that's yeah vitalik that's probably the reason why you're not the benevolent dictator right because i'm wondering whether beacon chain actually updated their code because they don't seem to be yeah it seems like baking chain is struggling here yeah i think that happened on the last one too yeah that did happen on the last one i'm seeing a lot of blocks um what was the percentage participation pre-merge just so i have an intuition for what it should be post-merge it was around 90 90 okay so we see about one in 10 slots missed and that would be stable remy can you or someone summarize uh so i i've kind of zoned out since since the pandas uh what's our progress in the first epoch uh is it what we expected to see is it significantly different like from what i'm showing here um it seems like maybe we're struggling a little but um we're progressing we'll see more in a few minutes how these next epochs are being justified and finalized i see that epoch 734 was just finalized is 734 the first merge epoch i believe it is yes so we have it looks like uh beacon chain is showing 88.2 participation looks like three missed blocks um if if beacon chain is is up to date then that is uh that's pretty impressive like that means we would have lost three percent and i was really predicting like 10 percent um due to missed updates yeah we're not sure i don't think beacon chain shows us the epochs after yes and we have a good metrics dashboard i can see sync aggregates are down by about sig aggregate petition participation is down by about 25 percent so for people who are watching um we're in this kind of post-merge phase where now um we saw the pandas that's the fun now it is kind of uh waiting for everything to to come in all the data to come in um watching epochs uh it takes um it takes 6.4 minutes for one epoch to final or well to justify and then another 6.4 minutes for it to finalize and our real goal here is to see a finalized epoch after the merge which will take about 12 minutes so uh right now it's it's really a watching and waiting and seeing um what the data looks like and again we never see the whole network any any person or any dashboard only sees a a slice of the network that is their slice and that's why we can't really assess the entire network until we're looking back at it all right do we want to talk about the po up again for a second yes always i am going to share real quick the co-app you want to talk us through it this time next uh sure so um to get the pull up all you got to do is send two dollars um two dollars equivalents of usdc rye dye eth or matic on mainnet polygon arbitrarium or optimism to coincenter.eth um if you don't know how to use an ens address go to etherscan and look up coincenter.eth you can do that for the next i think 22 hours until 2359 utc on august 11th okay well it's gonna be more than like 48 hours because there's a typo on this um uh so it's actually going to be for almost two days you can send uh usdc raidai eth or matic on any of these four chains um and could you explain why you would somewhat do that at all why would they care about having a collective of such this time get out of here no it's fine like why why does boat matter it is um so i do you mind if i say apparently we had the founder of poep on the call to tell us why it mattered i couldn't ask the question yes yes so yeah so the funny thing is patricio is the founder of poep um he he really is supportive of uh the beacon chain of of proof of stake and he really supports all of our efforts to incentivize the community to participate um by by helping us offer co-apps and so uh people think of poeps in a lot of different ways many people the idea of them is their bookmarks of your life i i call them kind of a grown person sticker collection and so really what we want to do is give people who were here an opportunity to kind of bookmark that moment in their life by receiving a co-app and so we can't just open the floodgates and give them to everyone because then they end up being meaningless and so we found a way that we can kind of slow that down to people who really want to receive one by asking for a donation to a worthy cause and so that's why we asked for a donation to coin center in exchange you get a po app that you get to add to your sticker collection and it's it's really just a fun thing that we do to kind of mark time and it's really great to look back at your poep collection um i can see my poeps from like the prism topaz net uh test net uh thanks preston uh and arrow uh like seeing that historical sequence of events is is really a way for us to uh emotionally connect with the chain and that's that's what's fun about it and i'm just going to say if you guys don't like that that there's a spam um prevention mechanism that we're doing right now um there's a pull up call every week and then you can you can come and talk about what you think would be a better method to prevent spam on the po-ap network or you could uh dm michael on vatica and just yell at him more trolling seriously heard about merge art can we talk about merge art yes i'd love to um i don't know if anybody can share a screen but if anybody has a candy you can grab that link that i just dropped into chat but yeah so um where do i start so i'm a member of staple works which is a cultural let's say it's a cultural organization that does creates artifacts around ethereum upgrades and just celebrating uh the work that four devs are doing thank you for sharing um and previously we've done two projects uh beacon book and 1559 nfts and many people were asking if we're going to do something for the merge and i'm excited to say yes we are doing something for the merge and it's an exhibition called new home of the heart if you're interested you can go to statefulworks twitter there's a thread there and and um yeah i'm working uh with jpeg which is an nft uh curating platform and as well as sofia garcia and we are putting together this exhibition of a bunch of different artists we're hoping to get to 10 we're gonna announce um five of the artists tomorrow but yeah so all of these artists are participating in this we're gonna have a mix of old work uh and some new work that's gonna be auctioned off there'll be some additions and all of it goes to the protocol guild which is a collective of 119 protocol contributors so um that's my spiel um it's a really awesome project and i'm excited to continue doing art and public goods funding type things so if you're interested in participating go check out that thread there's more details and um this actually is completely uh stealth until this moment but we're also doing something similar to the beacon book where it's going to be a collection of uh commentary and perspectives from four devs who worked on the merge so a lot of amazing stuff coming up go follow staple works and jpeg linkedin that thread and hopefully we will have you uh you know participate in the exhibition read the read the upcoming collection of uh core contributor perspectives when it comes out hoping hoping it to be live um uh maybe a week before ttd on mainnet so yeah thank you for letting me uh talk about those projects so it has been a while um it looks like oh interesting uh it looks like uh slot visualization for uh epoch 113735 if it justified with 68.42 which uh is is actually great um we would obviously like you'd want that higher but all you need is 66 uh and so um there there there's going to be some question about what uh led to um lower participation uh and it does look like it's weird yeah like we have this well the weird thing is that it like we dropped from 90 to 68 in the middle of an epoch so we've we've seen two two different terminal uh terminal blocks basically in click you have you either minor block with one difficulty or two difficulty and we first had a block with one difficulty i think and i was late switched to a block with two difficulty and so in the locks we also saw two different pandas uh two different times and the beacon chain react um so it might be expected that like the participation within the epoch is different like changed let me see what do you mean dropping down halfway metallic are you ready like yeah i mean like say stick for dissipation is what i'm looking at right like i feel like that like predator not being changed three seven three five like the numbers dropped from 90 to 68 about where yeah wait so basically we're you're saying that what's uh what what's going on is that we had uh like two different uh chain tips and the beacon chain reorg from one chain tip to the other chain tip in the middle of an epoch and that's why the merge also happened in the middle of an epoch like it happens at a slot boundary so that might also be what you're seeing oh i see it right right what was the merge slot the last three digits 734 i believe yeah but the drop is uh at 3 6 3 9 5 2 9. 5 2 7 presumably is the merge block right right i also have a merge block on five five seven that's the like the second one and so it seems like roughly five five seven yeah i slot three six three nine five five seven thirty slots later than five two seven yes and it looks like roughly fifteen percent of uh better ditches might be on the wrong fork but we should see them come together when we finalize wait but shouldn't they just agree because of the fourth choice or yes isn't fifteen percent more like validity that's not being upgraded yeah do we know of this alternative persistent chain or is that a guess because there's also i think there were some clients there's a client team that had some resource constrained machines and that was an issue there might be another issue as well i can't see any blocks on top of the 557 um block it's still listed as a head like an alternative head in lighthouses um right yeah i'm not sure why but i have like three lighthouse gap notes that are all listing for 15 that's why my guess was that they're all on the wrong fork the um the way that those metrics work is that it kind of just remember it just the graph sticks to whatever it saw last so if you see the good fork and then you sort of see the bad fork the metric will stick on the bad fork until it sort of hops over it's kind of tricky without costing a lot of um processing power make sense i'll switch the logs check that yeah i can see mine just like went in the trough of 15 for a while and now it's bumped back up to 66 so i'd say that that's it um following the the correct majority chain um until it reaches an epoch boundary and then resetting the metric terry what's the estimated percentage that is controlled by um ef client teams etc do we know i think we're between 17 and 1780 and do we know the percentage of that set that we were that has known issues like the resource constraint issue uh i don't know yet so i think we're we're nearing that point where um we observed the merge we saw um so i believe epoc 113734 was finalized which is the isn't that the first epoch after the merge and now we're seeing some things that that may take longer to interpret um but i do think that that kind of that is our our girly merge yep so um what we'll look for people to do over the next 6 8 10 hours developers will kind of dig into this they'll take it apart they'll continue to analyze the chain as we've said as i've said a lot of times during this call the things we're seeing now aren't necessarily the best way to interpret how the merge went it would be easy to jump to a conclusion now and say uh well we're we're down to you know 66 percent final participation even though we're still justifying and finalizing um what we'll really wait for our tomorrow i really look for tweets from um people like uh tim biko danny ryan um vitalik perry uh and marius those are really the people that i would follow uh to kind of see uh how did it work out uh and how did it go so yeah uh let's thank everyone for coming tonight uh do we have any other um any other programming notes hey guys uh mariano here i just want to say that tomorrow east latime begins it's going to be three days of ethereum talks in buenos aires uh if you're not there it's gonna be live stream ethelatam.org so uh yeah just wanted to say that it's gonna be a cool three days uh mine is tomorrow at maybe 3 30 p.m i'm closing out the first day how about you um saturday i think great yeah there's going to be some cool guests so yeah thank you yes thanks mariano uh and tomorrow morning will be i think it's a consensus call is it consensus danny yeah i can sense their call in about 12 hours in about 12 hours and if if you're interested that would be the juiciest place to tune in uh on the easter yeah you'll you'll get all of the nitty gritty um and uh yeah thanks everyone for coming tonight thanks to bankless david for hosting um and we're all looking forward to something kind of like this in a few weeks for uh maintenance it should be a really exciting event yeah how many weeks did you say how many weeks more than not months i i like to say you know it has always been measured in weeks right like it's it depends the unit you choose to use hopefully not too long if you measure it on weeks it is a floating point yes can we push it into october though i'll be back from oktoberfest then yeah uh don't forget that uh jonathan mann's song will be um for auction on songa dao what is it sanga jonathan remind me the day dot world it'll be up for a day.world it'll be up for auction um and uh feel free to claim a po poem in the next i think 48 hours we have um and uh yeah it's it's been a great time i'm glad everyone came out thank you all thanks for joining us guys and thank you appreciate this is the biggest uh biggest zoom i've ever been a part of so i'm going to speed run through all the things that we say at the end of bank list ether is risky kryptos rescue defies risky you can lose what you put in we're heading west around the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you're with us on the bankless journey goodbye we're glad we're here too bye-bye all right thanks y'all thanks all right thank you
