welcome back to the station to the ecc experience on this particular episode we are talking with evan mcmullen of disco and disco is of course building off the world of off-chain verifiable credentials uh we're all obsessed with soul bound token these days but very verifiable credentials are kind of the same same but not on chain so evan is a pioneer and a huge advocate of what she calls minimal disclosure uh which is actually not something she calls it's a it's a standard set by i believe the web3 consortium which is not something she's named but it's actually a set of ethical standards set by uh some internet three-letter agency a standards agreement committee that talked about this idea of the the least amount of personal identifier identifiable data that is released into the world the better because that preserves user sovereignty so there's been this whole like debate about soul bound tokens or verifiable credentials uh and evan is a firm believer of the verifiable credentials movement and that is what she's building over at disco and you can just hear that in her passion uh she's just a very eloquent speaker and i think every everyone has a fun time talking to her whether it's listening to her on a podcast or just hanging out with her in real life she seems to have everything that's ready to go in her brain so from a content perspective it's very very awesome as a content producer i quite appreciate it so let's go ahead and get into that very wonderful conversation with the fabulous evan mcmullin we usually do our pre-recorded ads for the episodes like these but since they are so short we are speed running them and so here that goes and we're going to start with rocket pool rocket pool is ethereum's decentralized validator network where you deposit eth and you get r-eth in return and you can take that re into it defy and if you run a node you let other people deposit their eth into your node and you get to charge them 15 for staking rewards as payment for your node operating services and then you can take that reath and use the across bridge to join over 2.3 billion dollars in the arbitrary ecosystem across of course is the fastest cheapest and most secure crosstrain bridge and one of the safest ways to bridge your hard-earned assets in the world of crypto and of course arbitrary is where you want to be with over 35 000 contracts and 1 million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of rollups you know how i know these numbers because i watched the arbitrage talk at ecc which you should also go watch but not before you're done watching this but when you do watch that video make sure it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web 3 wallet and it puts the user first the web3 way you know what else puts the user first ledger hardware wallets and the ledger live ecosystem i know ledger is a great product because i have literally nine of them and i have 99 of my crypto assets on my ledger wallets and the ledger live ecosystem is all you really need when it comes to living a bankless life such as buying with fiat swapping and staking but for the rest of you that are sitting on stable coins because the market is scary right now make sure you're using a decentralized bankless stablecoin may i suggest die from maker down the most tried and tested stable coin in existence but with maker you don't have to hide your stables on the ethereum layer one maker is building diportals so you can mince die natively across all the layer twos so you can make sure that your assets don't go down another 90 but you still get to go do all the d5 things across the l2 verse so i hope you use these sponsors on your quest for going bank list and right now i bring you my conversation with evan mcmullen evan how's it going uh gm david or bj as i guess we're saying here bonjour um it is wonderful to be here at ecc i'm so happy that you're the gonna be the person that introduces that to the banquet nation because i have not not as we available gm is agnostic of culture time of day so we love a good universal greeting evan how has uh this conference so far we're still on day one so there's a lot of conference left but uh you've like risen uh quickly onto the scene of being the queen of web3 data so how's this conference been for you uh it has been a wonderful adventure david um there have been a few events leading up to today um and the theme that i'm sensing throughout all these side events and my experience of the conference so far is that we are ready for account abstraction people are thinking about identity of the human beings who sit behind wallet addresses so it's really wonderful to see the ecosystem coming together in service of non-financial utility especially given this very unique opportunity we have in the build market you know i've been thinking about all day reflecting on ecc last year where vitalik gave his talk about how we need to focus on non-financial use cases of blockchain and then that was like kind of just like an idea for six months and then lens protocol came about and then we had this resurgence and decentralized identity and disco has risen uh come on to the scene uh and so like like a year later we're finally doing the thing that vitalik talked about a year ago uh and so like there's there's so much to unpack in the last like year and the lessons that we've learned uh but also vitalik's giving a talk again uh on on thursday in two days so i'm and i'm thinking i'm hoping he's like kind of helps us nudge that even further uh because we all seem to be perpetually behind the talk by about like six to twelve months uh but how much more is there left to do in the world of non-financial use cases of blockchains how much left is there to build most of it i think you know so obviously we know public blockchains are really wonderful place for data that has a double spend problem that requires global public availability in perpetuity you know until the heat death of the universe but for all other kinds of data for which that is not optimal we need to build a similarly rich ecosystem to what we can enjoy with smart contracts and on-chain interactions so love vitalik's foresight um i take issue with the fact that he canceled kim kardashian last cc but like it's fine um but i yeah i think it's a really wonderful moment for us to come together not only as the ethereum ecosystem but also to find common ground with other base chains that are reaching the ceiling of fun and utility that you can enjoy with only public data i was talking to uh stani earlier today uh and one of the things we were focused on is like we've got like this blockchain tech stack that everyone is generally familiar with right we got the ethereum layer one we got all these layer twos we got zk roll ups go we got optimistic roll ups we got application specific chains but also in completely separate to that we have this new stack that's coming about and it's like this data stack where we have like file storage we have like ceramic network which i'm not actually sure how to classify that so that's the first question to you is what the hell's ceramic and how do we classify it but then we also have like disco which is like the top level funnel for all of these things can you just like uh share your like your vid an illustration or your vision for like this uh tech stack that's being built in parallel to all of our blockchain stacks so i would say the way the way we make this cake is hardware network infrastructure application and so when the in that infrastructure layer which is like the very substantial center of the cake um that is going to be where our data goes to sleep at night so uh teams like ceramic are building decentralized storage um that we at disco use uh in a manner encrypted against the user's keys so they're in ownership and control of that data but what this allows for is you know increased censorship resistance so you don't have a centralized authority lording over a given centralized set of data it diminishes the risk surfaces um that we typically associate with centralized data storage as well and it offers a unique facet of composability you can build upon this data and many apps can engage with it but it doesn't need to be publicized in the same manner that we do on chain so this word data is so generalizable because it literally means like everything and when i was first talking to you about this like data stack i was like okay decentralized data like verifiable data it was so like it was so broad that i had a hard time visualizing it until like i just got it repeated and repeated and repeated so like what's an example of like data that would be put in like ceramic for example that we could like iterate on or tinker with or build upon like is there a use case that we could talk about oh my gosh so many so one that we're really excited about working on right now with the disco team is issuing um membership credentials to members of daos that attest to their membership in good standing so for those communities that don't want to have an unfettered secondary market for their membership having you know qualifying traits experiences contributions that um that represent your membership in a community should uh should come along with a proof of that good standing that you can use in web 2 contexts to unlock things like tickets content merchandise discounts in a web 3 context to access permission d5 pools and interact with smart contracts as well as in physical spaces you can use this very same credential that you've used for web 2 and web 3 to even enter a physical party as we've tested um before with the disco team and so having independently verifiable user-owned data that can be implemented in multiple contexts to unlock a broad variety of experiences not just a single piece of data for a single experience um that's the the beauty of having interoperability here right so if we um you know this week we've spent a lot of time filling up forms to go to parties uh if you've ever been to a crypto conference you probably know what that's like and so um we can save ourselves a lot of time and agony if the basic information about us is readily available so we can essentially autofill these forms but rather than inviting google to do that for us by holding a copy of our data which they're conveniently also selling monetizing using without our explicit consent we can't be in control of that interaction and this is something that is just totally agnostic to the crypto world it just so happens to use cryptography and so we kind of think of it as like you know inside of crypto inside of web3 but there really is no like uh boundary between what you're talking about in this data stack towards the whole rest of the world actually has very little to do with the blockchain i'd say exactly you can't um you can sign independently verifiable data verifiable credentials with keys that you get from a blockchain but just because your keys come from a public chain doesn't mean you have to use them to interact on the public chain alone and so we now have two realms of capability for our existing key pairs in web 3 as well as many in web 2 we can push on chain public transactions we can sign independently verifiable private data that we pass around via api or off-chain means and so what this allows us to do is enjoy interoperability across web 2 and web 3 across chains without needing explicit bridges without needing to pay gas fees without our concern for security of assets being locked up on one side and information not being able to flow and so when we think of the web 3 that was promised right banking the unbanked enabling smoother experiences irl all of these things require an identity layer who is this user behind the wallet um and so something we're talking about a little bit earlier today is like what is the atomic unit of web3 right now we think of it largely or talk about it largely as wallet addresses but i'm sure you probably have more than one wallet address and i'm sure you do too because that's good opsec but what that means is you know you're the same david who shows up for all of these different wallets there are different facets of you but as far as the ethereum protocol is concerned you are a different person every time right and so in order to enable greater you know seamlessness in our interactions and to avoid building a whole bunch of silos on a slower more expensive database we need to reorient our design choices around the atomic unit of a human being ethereum is a human coordination tool and if we are not building to optimize for the human experience what are we optimizing for right right yeah there's that that meme that you know ryan i'm pretty sure has a scheduled tweet out every six months is that your ethereum wallet is like the passport to the web three metaverse uh but uh and also some other people have talked about this use case for nfts in the same way we're like you know nfts are like your identity or like then an identity and ft can represent who you are but that doesn't really make any sense because i can have as many ethereum wallets as i want and i can also have as many nfts as i want and so when we talk about like when you say the atomic unit of of like web 3 you're talking about like a human spirit like a human soul and there is no way to get that on chain and so it has to be created in like this more like bottom-up type fashion can you talk about like the representation of like a human person in a bottom-up type fashion versus how other people think of it as like ethereum wallets or nfts so ethereum wallets and nfts are very concrete specific bounded entities and so they're easy to count so when we're you know telling our venture capital investors about our traction we can count the number of wallets count the number of nfts um nfts are easy to buy and so we can obtain them readily we can choose to self-select into communities but nfts offer a very low assurance around who their holders are right if you can an nft only shows that your public key has somehow attained a relationship with a token id um and that doesn't it doesn't mean that you earned it bought it you know made it yourself or airdropped it stole it and so um you know nfts offer the same assurances around identity that your watch does that your shirt does these are objects you have purchased to represent your taste profile but they are not david the person actually my watch does say is a hoffman watch okay well clearly well selected as you know as your pool cats as your crypto punks you choose the aesthetics that you like to represent you but you cannot be contained as a human being inside of that now what a bottom-up approach in terms of identifying a human being looks more like i think is is you know how do we think about the data exhaust you create as you move through the world you're generating all kinds of you know moving kinetic energy around creating all kinds of uh of data trails and the apps that you interact with the spaces you walk into the metal detectors we walked through earlier today and so the unique pattern of data that you emit as you move through the world that trail is a description of what has made you you yeah as opposed to proactively self-selecting items to purchase and demonstrate your taste profile instead a bottom-up approach to identity um can look a lot more like capturing the actions you have taken the contributions you have made the qualifications that you enjoy i'm sure kevin o'walkie will appreciate this metaphor but you talked about like data exhaust which is probably like the most unique thing about you there's no way to recreate your own data exhaust and the time of the day that you listen to this music on spotify while being in this physical location engaging with this app at that particular time like that is a sybil resistant bit of data exhaust and i think in the world of like this decentralized tech stack where we can make that data private and capture it and then also make that composable with something like disco all of a sudden you're like recycling that exhaust into a greater purpose and all of a sudden we can just like use this recaptured data exhaust and start to plug it into other places so when we do plug it into the uh like web3 apps that we use like our d5 protocols that we engage with or our dows that that we govern over how does that experience become richer as a result of being able to leverage all of this data that we would previously just like exhaust into the atmosphere so when we think about d5 protocols often we run into challenges because we end up playing with bots and discerning who is human who is not identifying anti high assurance anti-civil proofs has long been a challenge fortunately one that we are tackling along with kevin and the git coin team um so you know you as a human being do all sorts of activities all day that a bot can't do right a bot can't drink wine on the sun here in paris a bot cannot eat shredded cheese by the light of the refrigerator at 2 a.m you are doing all kinds of activities throughout your day that a bot can't do and so why do you have to suffer the indignity of filling out a captcha when you visit a website like you've already done all kinds of human activities today you've proven to the world that you are a human being but you have failed to capture them in a form that can be read by the interface you're interacting with and so your ability to capture your actions of humanity the unique stride of your walk the distribution of your weight in a chair all of these idiosyncratic expressions of self are more than enough to start to you know define the data shape of your person but because we don't have a meaningful method of capturing those and um we haven't yet agreed on sort of a standard language for how to treat this we are still in the world of silos um and so you know endows obviously we are reaching the ceiling of fun and utility that we can have coordinating around group chats with bank accounts um moving from one dow to another is an extremely costly ordeal right it's like your first day on the internet when you show up to a new discord to join a new dow there's no independently verifiable way for you to prove that you've been writing the newsletter that you have been organizing events that you have been doing you know ama sessions or whatever you may have some contextual proof social proof but certainly nothing cryptographically reliable in the same way that we trust the data from our public chains um and so in an instance of a dow you can receive independently verifiable proofs off-chain private under your control of those non-financial actions perhaps of your accountability as a member of your contributions as a leader and so once you're able to bring essentially that dow resume from one dow to another we lower the switching costs of moving from one organization joining another we increase the liquidity of our labor as it were and i think this kind of unlock is necessary to enable a dow based future of work because otherwise we we maintain a system of silos built on slower more expensive databases this is also something i'm seeing in the metaverse space as well where we have a bunch of proprietary so-called metaverses where people can purchase or display nfts but without interoperability among them it's just having a bunch more user profiles that don't talk to each other where we're filling out the same forms over and over again when we onboard right right right right yeah so uh that user onboarding and just like filling out forms i think is something we can obviously relate to that but i want to use that as let's like fast forward to 2025. we've built out this like decentralized data stack uh disco has issued a bajillion verifiable credentials everyone here at ecc number eight i think in 2025 has their disco profile they've got their vcs in it uh and for the and for all the conference scores and you've already alluded to this like you know you've got to sign up with eventbrite or maybe it's party full or maybe it's like whatever you also have to apply to ecc and there's like an application process let's like role play and go forward like a few years what will the crypto conference experience be like under this new paradigm when we've fixed all these broken things well one of the initial challenges with ecc was that many people were not able to get tickets because they got bought it and so being able to have a civil resistant ticketing platform to allow people to attend a conference who have demonstrated sufficient qualifications um i think would be fantastic now that said you might argue that being able to bot the ticketing site demonstrates your technical aptitude but whether or not that's going to make for a good community is another question entirely um i think it is also an exciting opportunity to solve the discoverability problem of these spaces so identifying one's way through the talks throughout the day finding the right people to collaborate with identifying other folks who share your team's ideologies or even finding side events has been a very odd asymmetric totem pole of alpha so we are all atomic units buzzing through this conference center and the search process is very laborious we have to review these you know these schedules we have to seek people out and you know certainly based on the number of people like running down the hallway yelling my name the search process could be a lot more efficient um and so i think the time we spend here can be much better suited to our goals and we can spend less time searching in earnest and more time finding the experiences that we came here to vibe with beautiful uh i think we've already been talking about most of your answer but i'll just lay it out to you anyways we need to build our way out of this bear market what do we need to do in this world of decentralized identity to build our way out of this bear market i think that the way we build out of this bear market and the way we decouple the crypto markets from the traditional finance markets is to add another access to the graph um so right now i think of you know blockchains the sort of flat databases that map uh public identifiers with tokens and interactions but we need account abstraction in order to achieve uh you know capabilities that the traditional financial markets cannot and so if we add in the ability to have user-owned off-chain contextual rich data that can be much more expressive and and much more specific and narrow and plentiful than what we typically enjoy on chain then we will give ourselves a new set of superpowers that extend beyond financial interaction and it is that reputation and identity system that will you know allow us to bring forth the future that we all grew up watching in sci-fi movies so during this last bull market there was like a ton of crypto hate that came from like oh these nfts are just for like rich kid toys or like you know game gaming was like get these nfts out of my games i don't wanna like i'm already being uh succumbed by like overburdened my micro transactions but just a bunch of just hate from just like the financial side of crypto in this last bull market do you think this this world of like decentralized identity and all of this like verifiable credentials can like win the hearts and minds of people that just aren't not like turned on by all the money side of crypto i think that making things suck less for people in their daily lives is a winner every time i think that the hyper-speculative financial environment of nfts and of you know tokens and and defy rightly turns a lot of people off like we call them ponzinomics for a reason that doesn't slap with everybody and that's okay but what that means is that we need to stop building for ourselves we need to stop having backlogs filled with what we want to make that day and start orienting our product practice around how do we intervene in the problems that real people face and make their experiences better more frictionless cheaper and easier you know we in the web3 space have long relied upon emergence as a fetish to give us new ideas but emergence is no substitute for good ux research historical context and appreciation for your users and so you know i know i'm often mentioning the human part of human coordination tools like now is the moment we've got the protocols we've got the infrastructure we need to design for people which means that we need to redouble our commitment to user experience design and research that means that we need to take on product testing in iteration in a way that we never have before because eating out another copy pasta amm is not going to win the hearts and minds of the people who are not already in this building evan thank you for joining me at ucc always a pleasure thank you david cheers [Music]
