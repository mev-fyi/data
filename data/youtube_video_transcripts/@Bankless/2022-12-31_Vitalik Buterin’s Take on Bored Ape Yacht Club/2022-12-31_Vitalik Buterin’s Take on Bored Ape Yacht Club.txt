I have a thirty six thousand dollar monkey and that's my pass to get into some kind of elite New York City nightclub it's like if I were to go to a New York City nightclub I'd almost wants to I'd say what would one out of a New York City nightclub one is that I would want it to open at 4 AM instead of closing at 4 AM because I think people who have the discipline to wake up in the morning or probably are possibly more interesting um I would want to possibly exclude people who have a monkey that cost more than thirty thousand dollars pretty much the exact opposite of uh what the the New York City monkey seeing is is doing right now all right so you're just not going to get a a great culture when you have people that just don't have problems for themselves personally that are that that cryptocurrency can solve other than get getting rich off of other people's problems right
