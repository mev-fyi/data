all right everyone welcome to episode 7 of state of the nation so what we do on state of the nation is we talk about what's happening in the nation i'm talking about the bankless nation of course we related to big picture stuff and then we drop some insights and action items this show comes out on youtube because we like to show the visuals when we can it's all about the visuals seeing david's face seeing my face seeing our special guest face being able to peek inside the graphs and some of the analytics behind the things that we're talking about and we leave you with a list of resources in the show notes to check out so this comes out on tuesday so it's tuesday when you're watching this on youtube you get it earlier when you subscribe to the channel make sure you do that and then we release it on the bankless podcast stream on wednesday so you can catch it via just audio that way david how are you doing today sir absolutely fantastic the the bankless nation has a lot of energy in it uh and so it's been absolutely wild seeing that energy grow and there's also just a ton of energy not just in a bankless nation in greater ethereum and even in the greater crypto sphere at large lots lots of energy to talk about so lots of topics to get through uh we have yeah like like you mentioned we did bring on a very special guest to help us dissect where some of this energy is coming from but we will get to that later yes yes the secret intro all right before we do and before i ask you the question david so get your get your answer ready sir we should talk about our fantastic sponsors i want to start by telling you a little bit about argent so argent is a smart contract wallet for ethereum for all of these d5 protocols these money legos that i personally use david uses it everyone i know in the bank list community uses this wallet in some form or fashion because it is just drop dead simple to use you get easy access to ave you get easy access to compound pool together kyber token sets you can do all sorts of things with it it's secure and easy to use so this is actually a great entry um wallet for your friends and family this is like a venmo type experience it's all mobile there's no seed phrase involved you can even set up social recovery which is key it's non-custodial most importantly so this thing is ultimately bankless uh you can check it out at the link that will include the show notes or you can go to argent dot link state for a state of the nation special deal so that's argent.link state and check that out ave is a borrowing and lending platform on ethereum definitely responsible for a decent chunk of that energy that i was talking about uh so if you want to supply collateral and earn an interest rate ave is the place for you if you want to borrow assets to participate in yield farming liquidity mining all of that energy ave is also the place for you and developers who are are leading the charge you can check out their flash loans protocol where you can borrow any amount of assets with zero collateral so long as you pay it back in the same transaction there's a lot of potential here with money legos uh there's the ideas and ideation that we can go to to think about how you can leverage this thing uh is endless uh so developers check them out you can go and find out all about ave at dot com uh one of my favorite features about ave is their stable interest loans which is such an important thing to be able to replace the existing financial system with bankless financial systems uh stable interest loans help people think in the long term they help businesses make business decisions and they just will help the bankless nation go faster ave just been climbing the charts with on on d5 pulse with value locked up in their contracts so roaring success so tip of the hatch to them for for everything that has happened uh to their protocol in the last few months so check them out at ave.com all right david we've got some exciting things happening just in the bankless nation that we should maybe start with before i ask you the question we had joey joey krug podcast that we released yesterday that was absolutely fire um i know i say that this all the time but it's one of my favorite podcasts that we've done we've got eric voorhees coming tomorrow so that's going to be um exceptionally interesting eric of course is um you know he's came from bitcoin but he's non-tribal and um he's very interested in things that are getting built in this bankless landscape it's also mint week for the bankless badge so bankless badge if you've been keeping track is something that we issue to bankless members uh give some unique privileges and rights within the bankless ecosystem will include a note there um and then david we've got something something coming next monday right i you know i don't want to talk about this too much maybe you should take over from here what's happening next monday yeah so you know the crypto land is for has fertile grounds right the bankless nation is fertile lots of green pastures that's why we're so excited about this there's lots of things that are potentially awesome things to do and so we found one we think and so uh that's coming uh a brand new wing of the bankless revolution is coming to uh to the bankless door i'm super excited next monday's gonna be awesome and uh you find out about it first because you are tuned in here on tuesday next tuesday make sure you catch that episode we will um show the big reveal then um david let me ask you the question what is the state of the nation right now sir the state of the nation is explosive okay which is which is uh you know it's kind of a dangerous word to say in the world of cryptography and smart contracts but yeah right now it's a controlled explosion uh okay so hopefully we can continue to uh control it i kind of see it as like a slow motion explosion is it controlled explosion is that a demolition isn't that it hopefully not a demolition um we're paving the roads with explosives okay and so that's what we're doing hopefully everything goes right but you know ether has been in this long drawn-out bear market it's been hitting this descending line over and over and over again and it finally broke through it uh just on the 22nd of july uh and there seems to have been just this massive pent-up energy in the eth price and it seemed to have been kicked off like like some people have been saying by like the the d5 mania which got kicked off by comp so so people have been saying this for a while the comp token new paradigm of tokens that all of a sudden there's more of them all of a sudden there's liquidity mining all of a sudden there's yield farming all of a sudden people get it d5 tokens go wild uh our previous state of the nations were bullish and then and then exponential and now it's explosive uh i think that these state of nations have been pretty damn accurate with describing what is coming uh dude we'll get to that because last last tuesday i feel like you called it man i feel like he called it but we'll get to that all right so explosive that's what's happening but not explosive in a bad way well listen leaving on the table for for what is what is potentially explosive but right now like values of things are going up like really fast and it's so far it's a good thing we're successfully controlling the explosion but you know there's always risk there's always risk yeah absolutely and i think we'll get to the rest too but let's talk about um some of that explosive behavior again explosive we think in a good way but we brought on a special guest to tell us a little bit more about a defy asset that i think is um super unique something we haven't seen before and it's called yfi if you've been tuned into bankless newsletter even our podcast earlier this week we talked about it um and we brought on uh daryl lau who is a writer in the space he's a researcher and he wrote um i think the best article that i read this week on uh yfi he's also a i don't know if he'd call this like a core governor of the protocol uh daryl how's it going there there he is great to see you uh thanks for thanks for all your work in yfi you know what my first question is is um what is this thing called is it is it yiffi is it giphy is it is it wi-fi is it wifey like wi-fi what are we what are we calling this thing so i personally been calling it wifey like i've got it i thought it wi-fi to like three or four people right now on calls okay it's wi-fi then for the rest of that david we're going with wifey all right i'm gonna have to re-learn where should we start with this you know david so so like um should we just talk about like what it actually is how it came about like what the products are yeah that's kind of what i struggle and why i want to bring daryl on to help us describe this where is the beginning of this whole project like where does it start at yeah so i guess it started in early this year where they launched andre andre the developer he launched this protocol where it's a yield aggregating aggregated protocol so basically what it does is that it chases the best yields for across the ui dx compound and rv so let's say let's say compound is giving like about 10 apr and rv is doing like about 15 apr obviously you want to move your funds over to rv for that so what i what the iron did was that it automated the whole process i made it uh a lot easier so you just have to put your money inside and then you get you'll know that you get the best yield possible at that time so that was the whole start of the whole project i would say then it worked it worked quite well i was it worked quite well got about 8 million aum and then in i think march in march there was this whole drama about andre having holding the entire admin keys for everything so like quite a few people on twitter were attacking him saying that he shouldn't have all this stuff and then he decided and at that time he didn't he couldn't even afford the audits because they were quite pricey i think it was like 50k to 100k at least so he decided to like decentralize the whole thing give burn the admin keys away and then from there he stopped he stopped working on it because it was at the time the project the whole product was complete like it had all the features you could ask for it automated rebalancing it had the best yields and had the most am across all the projects that are doing the same thing so yeah then in more recently in about the last month he came back from stealth like he's decided to launch new products like y swap high leverage i trade on all kinds of new d5 products all leverage leveraging on top of existing building like this money that goes on that exists today yep so darrell um andre some people are calling him the satoshi of defy who who is this guy what do we know about him why are they calling him that so i guess the the comparisons with satoshi of satoshi and andre right now is because that andre decided to do a completely fair launch like he didn't he didn't mind any tokens for himself he didn't have any tokens allocated for a team for a team or any pre-sale or what whatsoever he just decided like i'm gonna launch this protocol everyone has same rules and that's stuck basically that's the start like anyone could if you read the post at the announcement you would have been able to start mining immediately with by providing tokens and there was nobody else that had a head start i hate romeo except if they read it earlier so yeah yeah sorry yeah so this is one one thing that we talk a lot about on on bank list where like the compound token like went public in a way faster rate than what like a traditional company would have gone public on a public stock market right so there's one or two rounds of funding and then there's liquidity mining and that liquidity mining is the way that in instead of going public on the public stock market it goes public on ethereum via liquidity mining but what what andre did with with the uh wifey token is he just went straight public because he didn't have to worry about minting anything he didn't have to worry about securities issues he don't have to worry about anything because he went straight to the liquidity mining first and so that's why this is so incredibly elegant he didn't mint any himself he just went straight for liquidity mining for instance there was no instance of this token not ever being public it was public first which is absolutely insane and he also didn't take any for himself so how can they blame him and he said it was valueless if i'm recalling correctly yeah so in his blog post he put that the fair value for the token was zero because there was no same challenge all right so you know what i think is uh an interesting thing for our audience to see is um the thing that andre called valueless let's take a look at the uh value of it so daryl so first of all let me just say um in all the time i've been in crypto i've never seen a chart that looks like this you know we've seen some pretty crazy charts right um so when you were talking about the the announcement was made was that on a saturday saturday the 18th saturday yeah okay so this value was when i was camping that's when david was camping in the mountains he missed all of it yeah never take vacation in uh in d5 that's is that what we're learning from yeah i would have been a retro man but it turns out yeah okay all right so all right so uh valueless token he said you've got to earn it so people started earning it but what they did of course some of them a subset of them uh created a market for this and because ethereum is a global permissionless system they listed on exchanges like uniswap and balancer and that sort of thing right so we start at a price of thirty four dollars okay and then wow well look at something like two dollars three dollars okay okay all right so this is like the earliest coin gecko reports is uh 34 but this started at three dollars all right so uh and then and then we're traveling up here and then look at this like this is just crazy crazy right so we top out at least locally one week later at forty five hundred dollars so if you're saying three dollars right we're talking over in a thousand percent gain in seven days yep okay like if if you showed this chart to anyone outside of like crypto they'd be like okay that's in it that's a scam what's the scam so let me ask you darryl what is the scam here is there a scam i guess basically like a lot of people are talking about how the token was complete was considered cheap comparative to the total value locked so the whole point the whole theory is that the any token any governance token should be able to command a valuation such that it's higher than the total value of the protocol otherwise it could be otherwise it could be easily manipulated and everything like that but at the same time like everybody wanted to get more wi-fi so they kept depositing into the protocol so the prices kept going up higher and higher but yeah it reached about a 400 million total value locked at let's peak around 450 you said that you've never seen a crypto chart like this and i actually uh think that you're wrong i think you have seen one crypto chart like this before and that's bitcoin that's what exactly this is this so it's not in a week though no no not not in a week that's totally true in different time frames because like what we're talking about is like the token value started at zero because they didn't have a market for it and then over it and so that's why this thing is so incredibly exceptional like bitcoin also started at zero because and that's why we're calling uh andre like the satoshi of ethereum because it started in the same way where you can only earn it there was no pre-mine and that's why this token value started at zero because and so like the pricing of wifey has only come from people buying it on the secondary market and yeah any sort of like perceived valuation it's a great point like i do think obviously the time horizon this is super compressed this is seven days bitcoin did not do that but at the same time bitcoin did not have permissionless markets to list on right like it didn't it how could it list it couldn't list it couldn't list anywhere there were no it first got evaluated by like two pizzas exactly but now we're in d defy world and you list something like this without any founders and immediately there's an exchange permissionless don't have to ask anybody don't have to pay an exchange fee it's there that's probably why price discovery happens a lot quicker what do you think about that darrell is that is that sort of the right analogy here yeah i think it's perfectly fair like we started off with it's a lot of a near zero valuation and then you just pop up from there from free market valuing it at so much higher than it should be yeah and you were saying it sort of traveled the um the total value locked right which has become kind of a metric for uh relative pricing between various d5 tokens so explain this chart okay um we've got that saturday uh let's see the saturday was the 20 what let's see 21st saturday was the 18th right so uh on friday there was 9 million locked yeah and then i'll try yeah before the launch okay and then by saturday we've got 62 million locked and then a week later we've got 330 million locked you said this topped out near 400 million locked what what's going on here why all this this fun all of these funds is you know starting to pour into the the wifey protocol so i guess at the start very start of the wi-fi mining like when he was trading around 20 to 50 the apr you would get for it was about 500 at least so areas of the areas of the piling in and started buying up like buying up wi-fi to get the in order to get some of the returns which made the price go up even higher and the returns are going up even higher so at one point it was about two thousand percent apr out at the right like first or second day so like when you saw the large price the last price increased from fifty to one thousand something it was about one thousand two hundred two thousand percent apis so that i think if you you break that down to break that number down it's about five percent a day if i if i'm not mistaken and so this is just to distribute the wi-fi token right and this is how people got their hands on it uh and so we we see that massive explosive rise in uh in assets locked in in the urine finance protocol but then then it's also fell off it fell off a cliff so it hit almost 400 million and now it's back down to 100 million so where did all that go so basically the whole distribution was based off 10k tokens displayed 10k tokens distributed in each pool for one whole week so there were about there's triples there's triples and basically the last the last of the triples ended their distribution distribution yesterday so that's why the whole total value dropped quite a bit okay so let's go a little bit more so there were 10 000 uh wi-fi tokens in three different pools three thirty thousand wi-fi tokens total yeah thirty thousand total and so uh and these pools you could liquidity mine these pools at different times all right so the first pool would run out and that would start the second pool and then the third pool can you explain what these three pools are and why they came in the order that they came in yeah so the first very first pool is basically that using the wire protocol where basically you when you provide liquidity the tokens you get a shared opening return so this share token is about somewhere around a dollar stable because it's based on silver coin so then all you have to do is just stick that token into stick that token into the government's contract and that was it so you'll get your mind some wi-fi to open based on the time that you have staked inside the protocol relative to the share of your tokens so let's say if you had 100k for example and the pool only had one million you'll get ten percent of all the wi-fi tokens at that time so that was the that was that was the very first pool then i think the second pool launched like a few hours after that well basically a balancer pool incidentally program so you if you provided 98 percent die and two percent wi-fi tokens as a liquid provider on balancer you would get the balancer token correct so that as then you just take that balance and boost you're going to get a share of the wi-fi tokens so that that's cool and that's cool too then again about two or three days two days after that those two was launched they launched the governance taking contract so what did what it does is that basically they wanted to incentivize voting for voting for on the platform for government's decisions like the inflation schedule as well as the burning or staking which i can get into later essentially they just wanted to incentivize the voting so what they did was that you have to you have to supply liquidity to a balancer pool of 98 of the wise ycrv token and two percent of wi-fi token so then you get a balance again and you stick it there yeah so that there's also the three pools that will launch and those are the three initial distributions of tokens for yeah for the whole 30k so the way the way i've been i described this in my mind is like this is like the tutorial of like some video game right where like your user is like going through these steps to learn how to use the system and then they also and as they progress through the tutorial they're getting like the equipment that they need in order to play the game right and so the first step is to provide a stable coin liquidity to the the urine protocol which gets you the iffy token and so that's like you got your shield right like first step you got your shield and then you go into the next pool and then you supply uh the the uh wi-fi token to the balancer pool and then that's the second pool of wi-fi tokens that are distributed out of the thirty thousand now there's twenty thousand so now you got like your sword and then you're ready to move on to the next pro the the final step in the tutorial which is uh learning how to govern the protocol which is staking your wifey tokens to the urine governance portal so that now you have your armor so you have your three things now you're ready to play the game and then that's also how the wifey token was distributed and so it's like it's both like fostering a community like by showing them what they need to do in order to earn because these three things also come about as to why this thing is valuable at all later after all these tokens are distributed and it's also showing like the community how to do the thing and it's also distributing the wi-fi token all at once i thought it was genius it's like the scavenger hunt on ethereum where you have to go do all the things so you can get the wifey tokens yeah it was perfect when it started incentivizing users first and then started with incentivizing holders and the third pool is just genius that is advising everyone to actually actively participate and actively participate and as well as reward them with all kinds of incentives like wi-fi crv and balancer tokens so daryl we were talking about the the market cap and the market cap right now is um of of wifey is based on a set supply of 30 000. um can you that sounds like a fixed cap right so i guess maybe another bitcoin analogy but the difference is this can be changed via governance can you talk i know you've been involved from the very beginnings in waify governance can you talk about why the 30 000 cap and some debate around that and how that sort of thing is decided so right now the 30k caps just basically from the distribution that's already happened so 30k 30k was the max limit and then it stopped there so the discussion after that was how do you want to incentivize future books right now if you if you were to maintain the same schedule as before they'll be giving out like more than 50 million dollars in tokens in a week so that's not that's obviously not sustainable so basically the community will decide to work vote for it like what kind of inflation schedule makes sense so yeah i wrote the first input i would say the first proper information schedule where i i decided to use the synthetics model so about 150 inflation rate and over a period of a few years with the trailing inflation so the problem there was that synthetic starter of their replacement schedule because very high because they wanted to attract users and the difference between wi-fi is that wi-fi has already attracted all the users we've attracted 400 in aum without without much marketing just the height of the returns so really it wasn't about the attracting the users but it was really about incentivizing users to stay on so the community like substrate and delta tiger for example who designed the original synthetic inflation monitoring policy they decided to take a spin at it themselves so they decided to work out around a 22 percent api 22 inflation rate which should cap the supply at the 50k instead so that's still being discussed on with the community but i think we're going to launch the on-chain protocol on chain vote for that soon okay so we've been talking a lot about the wi-fi token and how it's gotten distributed in the different mechanisms uh as to how that came about but we i think we kind of we haven't yet talked about like what the urine protocol actually is like what does it do and so why is everyone so incredibly excited about this protocol like what is unique about the actual system that has been developed which of course then finds itself in the valuation of the token but what is the urine protocol what does it do for its token holders so there's basically two parts to this like for example if you're a wi-fi holder you'll get complete you'll get the values in governance of the protocol and then there's also the fact that you can get a claim to the reward to the fees distributed to the protocol so wire has a bunch of different products launching the first product was the iron yield aggregator then there's a few other products launching like the leverage stable coin swap and leverage stable coin yield farming protocol and and a couple more of upcoming but yeah so these are all different products all based off of existing d5 protocols but andrea just made its own spin on things like a single a single asset asset am for example like you can see in balance you can see in bangkor and a few other projects that launch so android is always going to design and oh go ahead no keep going and then i want to ask you a question about andre yeah so why why fee holders would if you voted in protocol for example you would get a claim to the fees and that's about i think it was about 60k in fees alone for the first week so that was about yeah so that was about 10 return on the token which was like 1 000 at that time okay so there's this yield farming mania that's going on and what the urine protocol does is that it uh creates this products to make it easier to yield farm right it makes it uh more formulaic more algorithmic so that you don't have to like pull out your calculator and find out what is the best returns you can just deposit your assets into the urine product and it will do that for you and then then and then the yiffi token uh is this uh governance token slash cash flow ownership token because just like compound just like balancer it's a governance token that governs over the cash flows and so what yiffy is is this token that is farming the farmers right and so it earns the fees that some of the farmers are earning the fees as well so like people like me i didn't really participate in the yield farming thing like you know kind of over my head i'm kind of way too busy but now i can just buy the the wifey token and i can farm the farmers right and so like there's these three tiers of things where people are submitting their their people are leveraging long ether by depositing ether into compound they're borrowing dye and then they're buying more ether and then maybe they're also sticking that to compound and then they're earning the comp token and then those are just that's like tier one right that's just normal uh normal people like my friends doing this like it's this is just the the basic activities on ethereum and then there's people who are doing this with the intent to actually farm comp right or the intent to actually farm balancer and so they're going recursive trying to find the best rates they're borrowing back even though they don't care about bad they're borrowing like tether even though they don't care about tether because they want to farm comp right and these people are using their calculators to try and find out what the best yield is and so that's like tier two right and now tier three is you just submit your assets into the iffy protocol the wifey protocol and it does it for you right and you don't have to do your calculations which is also fantastic by the way because then you don't have to pay for gas because the the wi-fi protocol just pays for the gas for you so you're already making more money that way as well and then like tier four is just the the wifey token itself where you can just like buy the wifey token you don't have to worry about all these things did i get that right yeah that's perfectly right like andre when he first developed all the protocols he decided that i'm making all this so to make my life easier like before this everyone was manually doing manually checking their calculators and stuff like that changing changing product products depending on rates so andre just made this protocols to make his life easier and if you want to use it you can use it to use it that's basically entire logic that's not can i kind of make a uh i guess a comment here or a couple couple things that kind of pop into my mind as you guys are describing this and david i think that was a great explanation um that was like a deeper level than i think i understood it going into this um well done sir so okay some of my abilities yeah so two things so two things here um first i am like in awe amazed that one developer from his garage to use the analogy was able to come up with a d5 protocol incentive mechanism like this that works and grow it to 80 million in value in seven days like that is the power of open finance defy it blows my mind uh and i think that's incredible i think this is a it's a real capital asset right at the same time i'm somewhat uh terrified in a way okay and and here's why uh so andre is a fantastic developer um but he also makes no secret of he tests and prod i'm looking at his his twitter uh handle right now he's like i test in prod that's the one thing you shouldn't do with smart contracts right that's the one thing like testing prod no make or doubt you formally verify that [ __ ] you know like what are we doing okay so he tests and prod okay so that's the one thing the other thing is what david just described wild genius does something that um i don't necessarily love which is it chases yields right so yield chasing is okay that's an efficient market however so to look at the real yield what you have to do is look at adjusted yield so it's very easy to see which of these various protocols are throwing off returns and just formulate a calculation say i'm going to go in that one because it's the highest return however it's harder to assess risk on that side of things so one thing i worry about um a little bit on the like more macro side of defy with all of these kind of lending protocols which i love by the way um is that we get into a habit of chasing yields and then like we we're we're not looking at the risk of these some protocols have more risk than others and we get trapped right something catastrophic happens and it's a great unwinding and a lot of people who weren't aware of the risks are now pissed off and and you know kind of tainted by it um yep i'm not saying andre is responsible for any of that i think this experiment is fantastic i think the way he approached it is absolutely fantastic and i think it's net super positive but what are your thoughts on that daryl so i guess the first the first thought about testing a prod yeah that's what andre has been doing but since the whole time he's been building the whole protocol like even before in january when he was first testing our iron protocol he decided to launch it entirely on mainnet instead so he burned about 30 to 50 000 in development cost alone because he wasn't familiar with how you could fork maintenance and launch our instance of it so he burned quite a bit there but just testing out everything a minute and yeah it it does he always does put the disclaimer saying that there might be risks involved don't deposit all your money inside you might lose it all which is which is still i'll say good to see like some people just say trust me trust me all your money out i am 100 believable but that's not true at all like i don't trust every 100 of money then for example i would say i just bring up my example from two days ago i think two days ago he launched this he launched his pool where you can deposit your usdc and it will supposedly get the best rates supposedly yield fund for you across all the weather protocols and he didn't even say anything about the apr because he didn't want people to just just randomly deployed money inside but in less than an hour after he's launched the protocol there's about a million dollars inside already yeah so that's that's the amount of crazy i would say that people are doing now to yield chase like they're just depositing a million dollars to something that doesn't have the documentation really written up properly yeah and if i'm if i'm correct i i'd seem to recall recall that that uh thing that he launched the new thing actually had a fatal flaw in it that was discovered by a talented smart contract research analyst which on the one hand it's awesome that the community is like self-funding and self um like doing these sorts of audits but on the other hand oh my god right people putting a million dollars in this thing and it's not even audited and it's just he pushed it into into prod without testing wow you know yeah this larry we spotted the vulnerability pretty early on like when he first launched it but at that time there was about 300k 200 to 500k inside of inside it already so we started warning everyone on twitter and everything starting there's a vulnerability that might but at the same time like when we found the boundary we already told andre about it so he just fixed it almost immediately like by the time the trees were out he already fixed it he just hadn't updated the ui so there's there's a conversation here that i want to get into where one of the beauty one of the beautiful things about the wifey token and the urine uh system is that um it doesn't depend on it needs defy it needs yield farming d5 protocols in order to work right but it doesn't need any one particular d5 protocol in order to work like compound could blow up and you know metastable could blow up and balancer could blow up but there could just be the new yield farming d5 protocols that come and replace them that the urine system could leverage right and so uh urine isn't dependent on compound compound can die and if and urine can stay like balancer can die and urine can stay and so one of the beautiful things about it is like defy itself can come and go right like we've seen different components of ethereum like die off and be replaced like ether delta died and got replaced by unit swap right and like i think there's always going to be this replacement of protocols and churn over time as new innovations come and the fantastic thing about urine and the wifey token is that it will just be there for these new protocols and it can freely plug in or plug out of these protocols as they come and go so to some degree you know the contract risk of compound doesn't actually impact the contract risk of of urine however there are parts of the urine system that are completely dependent uh and can have to work and have to not blow up can you talk about which components of the urine system uh first off obviously it's urine itself but like i think also curve needs to work uh and can't can't go away for for the wifey tokens to work is that right and can you kind of just go into what are the what are the core dependencies of the urine system i guess for smart terrorist side for example if i don't remember i don't know if you guys remember but way back in i think february or march when deep there was this protocol called defos so they basically they basically fought compound and there was this large vulnerability where they lost about 30 40 million dollars i think so at that time as at that time when it happened the iron protocol automatically stopped deposits into the system like it didn't allow for any deposits into the system because it detected like a large large amount of withdrawals and andrei was on top of things to check it out but if you talk about like risk adjusted returns you will always be using the main protocols like pydx the is compound and rb so those have those are quite i'll say quite good quite good research profile because they've been audited multiple times already and i guess in core dependencies iron doesn't really have much core dependencies like curve is just one interface to interact with the protocol like you could or you could use the ions main website itself to deposit and withdraw rather than using curve because it's just a popular interface to use yeah fantastic this is this is so incredibly cool one thing that this reminds me of is it it feels like the dow 2.0 right where like the dow 1.0 was this system that could pool capital together and like as a distributed set of governors could elect which uh protocols or which things to invest in but like at the time it was way too early right there was like people i think people at the time of the doubt i wasn't in ethereum at the time of the doubt but people were like okay we're going to invest in like equity in companies and that's going to be part of the dow right and like that doesn't work right and they didn't even have a chance to try it but like it was very it was very much skeuomorphic right it was the wrong uh kind of system because it was just too early on ethereum but it was it does resemble some of this early urine components where like there's this pool of funds and it's investing it into the greater ecosystem in order to get a return and it's the great thing is that it's got this formula to always make the same return and it's it's it's a little bit like central in the sense that like it's not a it's it's a product of products rather than just being one product right it's it's like it feels like a very central token on ethereum because the rest of ethereum can come and go like the edges of ethereum can come and go while the urine dow can stay in the same place and the reason why the urine dow works is because there's actually things on ethereum to do now like in in the 2016 dao there was nothing to invest in on ethereum now the dow model actually works because there's on-chain you know governance tokens there's on-chain equity capital assets this yeah on-chain capital assets that's a right word i know i always use the word equity i know that's not right but it's good metaphor um but and so like this does feel like the dow 2.0 like a re a revamp of the dow in a way that works uh is that a fair comparison darryl yeah i would say that a wife wired protocol is basically like proving how composable the entire d5 ecosystem is because it leverages off of everything you can see online right now like it leverages off of compound dydx away and builds up so much more things that you didn't know could exist prior to 100 years writing up something and defining it and just proving that it could work so yeah things can go and come and go things can just die off but but i'm pretty sure that why it would stay just because of how composable it is and how central it is to the whole ecosystem so i want to yeah darryl this has been fantastic i want to maybe end with um with this i'm going to share my screen one more time and let's take a look at the organic community here um these are can you can you you guys can see my screen yeah um these are this is the governance board for uh wifey and the activity on here has absolutely blown my mind look at this one's uh you know 4.4 almost 5 000 views here on the issuance policy uh that's about a good campaign it's crazy so that's crazy because there's only four and a half thousand people that own the wifey token yeah right now that's crazy all of the the the the uh tokens and projects that are doing kind of vc launches um they can't get a community like this like they would they they spend millions on on sort of marketing and um like b2b conversations and sales people and slick stuff and this is really what you need to pull a product off the ground you need a grassroots organic community and to get that community you have to reward them early and have a have a founder's story and give them a reason to participate and that's what i think is the magic uh behind behind the wife token the with the yv token um daryl okay so we actually put a governance proposal in here didn't we david somewhere yeah this is absolutely fine fantastic it's going really well so the governance proposal came as a result of like we wanted to get andre on the bankwest podcast and so i tweeted at him andre come on the banknotes podcast and he didn't respond and then 12 hours later he sent out a text message saying i've gotten a lot of requests for interviews uh it's up to the token holders to determine if uh if i go on an interview or not like i live and live and die by the protocol like the protocol determines what i do which i think is a fun experience yeah and so i immediately rushed to the governance portal and be like should andre come on the banquets podcast yes or no we got 114 votes i don't really know if he's going to uh force or request a actual on-chain vote with actual wifey tokens uh the the yes to no ratios like 95 percent yes five percent no how can i tell can i see it here uh you would you would have to vote for it yeah oh i have to log in i did i voted yes by the way i logged in and voted yes because this was important to me i didn't vote no yeah so i i do why do you if you can speak for andre if he does end up coming on the bankless podcast which according to community sentiment sounds like he will be if that's how if that's how he listens to the token uh but uh can you comment as to why you think andre uh wants to live and die by the token i mean it's actually the token is like his baby i would say like he built the entire thing from scratch without much external help like yeah so it really is just like his baby like he wants he wants it to he wants it to fully control his life and then it's up to him well i i hope he comes on i i think it sounds like he is because 95 people said yes we'll see how that works out um uh i hope that we as a community i'm i'm a wifey token holder uh i hope we find a way to uh reward this this man um because he he took no reward and he definitely deserves something so that's a i think that's a something that i'm going to propose to the community do we know that though let me ask you do we know that so so uh satoshi definitely mined yeah right so andre did not take but if i'm andre just being a rational actor and i'm not saying like andre is a different person than i am i would not do things the way he did because he's like clearly doing this for altruistic reasons but you don't think he liquidity mind totally that's the question for the podcast about 200. i think he only mined two two wi-fi tokens like that really you said at the beginning that like he's not like this wealthy crypto investor he's not somebody that got rich off bitcoin or ether so he didn't have like that much capital to deploy into his own system yeah at a time like when ryan first launched he was he broke he don't spend quite a lot of savings just testing out ethereum that's testing out the entire protocol i mean that like i said like and he couldn't even afford the audits because they were so expensive yeah yeah all right well i take it back i i need to learn more about this andre uh individual it sounds incredibly interesting i do hope he comes on the podcast and um yeah i would i would log in and vote for a uh for a reward for andre certainly i'm sure that he has tremendous community goodwill at this point so i would have probably have no problem passing yeah yeah so we're actually planning we're actually planning for that so like uh one of the inflation schedules that we're passing through about 75 percent tokens will go to the providers but 25 of us will go through like a multi-second dial and then from there we're going to decide how much percentage you're going to stream back to andrea because he definitely deserves it he actually deserves some kind of developer funding and everything and i just think that's great because like uh obviously i think that's great because that's fair but also at the same time like it shows you that you can take zero you can be like the satoshi and you can take zero tax at the system you can take zero founders reward and you can still get wealthy like if this does end up playing out like i hope andre makes like a million dollars and a million dollars is half a million dollars two million dollars i don't know but like he can he's still hopefully going to make a lot of money from generating this protocol and the value that he returned to the community because he didn't take a founder's reward will be so much more the the total value created because of his actions is like a hundred x more than if there was like a vc backing this thing totally yep cool daryl thank you so much for coming on the bankless state of the nation we really needed the help in hand-holding learning about the the urine protocol so thank you for for walking us through it and you have been a great guest so i appreciate it oh we're always happy to help just reach me all the time yeah so if people want to find out more about you like you do you want to share your twitter handle uh how can people reach out if they have questions yeah just reach out to me on twitter um they're allowed tk uh they're allowed to get on twitter then i hang out a lot on the wired unofficial discord and unofficial telegrams so yeah just tag me there any time fantastic we will have your twitter handle twitter handle in the show notes sir so thank you for your thank you for your contributions thanks daryl all right wow that was uh that was insightful that was a lot yeah um dave we should talk about our sponsors okay again our second set of sponsors so why don't you start yeah so uh ample foreign is one of our fantastic bankless sponsors speaking of things that have been explosive lately uh ample fourth is a new monetary experiment which i sort of think is totally fascinating it's one uh i can't really think of any other m0 on aetherium that's not ether other than ample forth and that's what ample fourth is trying to be it's an experimental money m0 on ethereum the way that it works is that as price changes every 24 hours the token quote unquote rebases back to closer to uh the value of 2019 u.s dollars but in the same sense that uh kind of in the same areas bitcoin it's non-dilutive right and so it will mint more or less but into your wallets if you own them and so there's no there's no dilution event so you will always own the same share of the ample currency which is what makes it an m0 as it rebases up and down so the thing slowly tracks a dollar over time it never completely tracks its dollar over time it's not a stable coin uh but it's a if i'm interested in how it becomes a a d5 denominated debt right you will always be comfortable denominating debts in ample forth unlike denominating debts in bitcoin because you don't know what bitcoin's price is gonna be in in five ten years but you know the ample fourth price is going to be about a dollar in five to ten years so that's why it's an interesting monetary experiment so you can check them out at ampleforth.com very cool we are in a 100 way plus world and um gas prices show no signs of going down that's good from one perspective it means ethereum's being used a lot but it's bad if you're trying to get a trade done diversify solves this diversify is a new class of next generation layer 2 exchanges it's non-custodial so it's defy it's secured by the ethereum blockchain they do some really cool things with roll-ups to do that it's for serious traders this the experience with diversify is similar to using something like coinbase so they can support 9000 transactions per second they also have a governance token that's very interesting it's called nec it gives membership voting rights and it also gives discounts to diversify traders so take a look at that as well neck and diversify started the original liquidity mining back in 2018 they've kind of perfected their exchange in their product and really excited to see you use them and for for their success and to see layer two d5 exchanges thrive check them out at diversify we will include a link in the show notes yeah i've actually used the diversify exchange and it is as lightning fast as advertised right and like the cool thing is is like every time i make a trade like i have to press a button on my ledger which makes me feel good because that's non-custodial right like i'm not just trusting somebody to to do my order i have to verify it first so that that just is fantastic and like you said it's like a centralized exchange experience but it's also bankless right because they will never they can never do anything without your pressing of your ledger or your metamask or whatever so it it returns sovereignty to the user so it is slick guys absolutely uh david speaking of sovereignty to the users can we can we talk about topic two um price let's talk about price so what happened with price what and what price are we talking about our show notes just say talk about price talk about price yeah so how can we not right so ether is at 320 right now when the last state of the nation it was at uh what was it at 235 245 right and uh and ryan you you made this joke uh we we were talking about how like d5 tokens have absolutely mooned and one of our topics of the last state of the nation was like the ratio of the aggregate market cap of all tokens on ethereum all erc20 tokens on ethereum to ether like the total market cap of all tokens surpassed the total market cap of ether yeah and then you said something you said some security concerns we're talking about okay subscribe like right so like ether protects ethereum but now the things that it protects are higher than the walls that are protecting it so it's it's a risk and i and and so we were talking about like does this invalidate the fat protocol thesis like what is ether going to track this thing like is this insecure and and what i said it was that you know like sure we can talk about the invalidation of the fat protocol thesis but that just goes out the door the moment ether like moons to 300 i've got a chart up and i show the chart yeah go for it and ryan and ryan you asked me like okay so when does that happen and i go uh tomorrow and i was three days ahead of schedule i was three days ahead of schedule yeah okay so i was not purposely doing that i was accidentally right let it be clear all right i don't i don't think you should be modest david i mean all of your predictions on state of the nation to my knowledge have come true so far so why be not modest about it i mean you you just call the plays and then it happens this is so good price on tuesday when we when we publish was 236 and then maybe you're moving markets maybe that's what you're doing because um then we a week later uh 322 and you totally called it even close to the number right i think you said from 230 to like 300 or something like that in the last day of the nation um so well done sir i look forward to really reading the prospectus for your new hedge fund that you are initiating it could be exciting but yeah look it's been a good week i mean we've been talking about this uh for a while on bank lists in general so um what we saw if we just kind of like like zoom out right well i still have the chart here right um let's look at the three month so um yield farming is only two months old right now at this point right and that's been sort of a new template uh a new catalyst for the entire d5 ecosystem that started around may right and then what we saw from may until like june was um defy tokens absolutely take off and basically leave ether in the dust so people were saying things like well does that mean um ether is just just used for gas that it's not it's not correlated to the success of d5 we could have d5 worth you know a trillion dollars and uh little ether is worth 16 billion still you know hovering at 200 uh per eth um and then you know that was the conversation for the past two months and now we're starting to see a bit of a rise that we've been talking about for a while i i do think that um the bankless thesis is pretty bullish uh on eth as a monetary asset as the reserve currency for this entire d5 experiment as the the uh the lowest layer in the protocol sync thesis the economic bandwidth for the space if you've never heard those terms before um you gotta check out bankless material and take a look at the guide and read up on those terms listen to those terms because it's kind of a core part of the thesis so far it was good to see i had a lot of fun with this one david so um it started so every every uh every time the price went up ten dollars i just tweeted out like the price at this is hilarious because i do think it's hilarious even the price now to me is not commensurate with the value that ether is bringing the growth of d5 or even like the relative val the value relative to bitcoin i think it's all underpriced i just kept doing it every 10 every 10 10 every 10 dollars and you can just dig into this look at this oh man here's 283. i didn't see this i missed this you missed this oh it's fine man i was just like you know and and people said i had a bot i didn't have a bot i was actually looking at things um it started with this though and that's kind of the core tenet when you did when you dig enough um staking plus d5 is going to put more demand on eth than icos ever did um this is about the scarcity thesis of eth right and i mean you wrote a fantastic article about that but um that i think there's some market validation that maybe this is coming true yeah absolutely and like the the d absolutely the defined narrative caused this price increase and and uh i think eric and anthony on the ether podcast call this a long time ago where they said that the comp token may just kick off a bull market and i think that that is exactly what happened and it wasn't necessarily the comp token itself it's not just about comp token although that comp token is a core component of this it's the token model right the governance token model that governs over the cash flows of these protocols are valuable tokens and like we've talked about with chris burniske like we talked about with dan elitzer we can evaluate these things on the ways that we've always evaluated capital assets throughout time now like d5 has gotten to that point so that's bullish and then the liquidity mining of people really striving to provide work to access these tokens created their own mania and then now this mania has just topped off with the urine protocol which is still nascent right but like it's all coalesced into uh you know this defy mania this growth of this gross of defy which is just growth of finance this new finance it's banquo's finance and finally it's being reflected in the ether price like ether price is always going to be a lagging indicator of what's going on on ethereum and now after the d5 tokens have mooned now it's ether's turn and more importantly actually i'm going to share my screen um more importantly we have had this massive drawn out bear market where the ether price has just been suppressed suppress suppressed over time i'm not in the right time frame let me zoom out um i am not a charter so hold this with a grain of salt but other people that i listen to and know are charters and they have all been looking at like this line and maybe their line is placed differently but they've all been looking at this line and this line is also present in bitcoin right and so like you know here is 20 the top of 2017 uh you know two years ago and over time like this line has just been bullying the ether price up until like the 20 20th of july wow look at that boom we ripped right through it right and so i'm not a charter i'm not a savant i'm not a guru but like quote unquote out of the bear market like bear market's over bear market wow you're calling that yeah bear mark is dead um and and so like it's really a matter of like does that mean a does that mean the bull market started and if you know if yes does that mean it started today or is this going to be a long drawn out because if you go back to the bitcoin price coming from uh 23rd to 2015 to 2017 that was a two-year crescendo before it really started to get bubbly right so like what's that like i don't know but like but bear mark is dead i mean we've talked about this being 2016 right which which was basically how bitcoin and ether were sort of viewed then it was a long grueling bear market in 2016. coming out of that uh there were signs of life it wasn't a full-on bull market yet but there were definitely signs of life this does feel again we keep talking about like 2016 uh so another thing maybe it's early actually 2017 because you asked last time i say the nation have i gotten any texts yet yes the answer this time is yes getting texts i got i got two right um so somebody's like hey let's go for beers you know my portfolio is like you know and he gave details of portfolio like two percent xrp like five percent eos and like you know forty percent and like you know another thirty percent bitcoin something like that yeah he's like how would you realize pretty good as far as normies go right yeah i'm not bad so um you know so there's that i also got a text from a friend this is this is really cool he's like um you know i want to i want to buy this thing uh it's an erc20 token how do i do it right it was popping um he's like how do i do it he eats coinbase who talked about it before and actually within like 30 minutes um he figured out how to move his eth from coinbase to metamask and complete a transaction on uniswap and buy a token um and he bought it at a time like right before it moon so now it's like price is up i don't know double since i mean he is d5 for life like i don't think he's going back um so the learning curve i mean people say it's steep but it's a lot less steep than it was i don't know two years ago people can you could figure out how to use how to secure your private keys and you know figure it out in a couple of hours um and you have here's the thing it's like that entire time when we were talking to daryl about wi-fi and you were like you went on a camping trip and you missed it my all of the people who don't know how to use these tools right now they don't even know this conversation is happening like you have to be here you have to have been putting in the time to level up to actually understand these assets in order to get exposure to an opportunity like yfi um if you weren't here if you weren't playing the game like you just you didn't get that opportunity that is why we talk about leveling up it's not like you know it's not like a step gain from week to week or month to month it's like you're investing this time and then suddenly something happens some catalyst and you were there at the right time and you had the right information and you leveled up skills you had the skills you could sort the bs from the like actual you know assets that and then and then you made the move you you only had that ability because you had put in the time to to level up or the past you know months i'm sure daryl i mean he's been in the space for for a while doing that with absolutely no return and then suddenly he's like this thing could be big and i know it's big and i'm using it and then bam like he knew how to liquidity and he was there he was there yeah and this is just a leads into the conversation of of user self-sovereignty right like you are learning the skills as an investment into yourself like the the value of your own person is your greatest asset right and learning these skills learning how to operate in the decentralized finance future like a a it's a long it's a long bet that d5 is actually real and actually going to be a thing that's but we're assuming everyone listening to this has already taken that bet right like we all believe that's real and so now it's just a matter of honing your skills learning how to be think critically learning how to evaluate defy risk contract risk and communicate that and then also take the opportunity when it presents itself like and and this is going to come because you have invested your time and energy into the space in order to figure this out right totally that's the reward on the other side of that um we talk about that a lot okay so uh last thing david we've gone on for a while these shows just keep getting longer man should uh should we start closing down how long are we in here uh yeah we are in to this for about an hour okay all right all right so let's let's kind of wrap it up one thing i just want to say and this can be a show notes thing uh to take a look at is just to re-emphasize the risk that we're talking about here um some of the re the least risky assets you can purchase in crypto are probably going to be like bitcoin and ether like core critical type things that have established um records but even those are incredibly risky right um when we talk about something like yfi or yield farming you start to get into a place where you're compounding risk not just risk on ether yeah you're just stacking your your money legoing your your risk right and uh people need to be aware of that when they go into these systems it is the wild west out there we do say you can lose everything uh very important that people are aware that something could go wrong andre one developer could have a bug in his code that causes the price of wi-fi to collapse or or the the thousands of dollars you put in liquidity to just evaporate into nothing it's risky um because the state of the nation is explosive yes this is why we chose this world wow yeah you know full circle here and uh so there there is there is some good news though i would say is there are ways to hedge against that risk nexus is one we're actually doing putting out a tactic on nexus today about you know staking with nexus and it basically ensures against one type of risk there are several but there one type of risk is smart contract risk i saw with nexus they are insuring about um 0.4 of all of this the value locked in d5 okay so still super small i mean this is millions this is millions of dollars right now but all of the value locked in d5 only 0.4 of it is um insured by nexus and of course things could also happen to nexus ideally we'd we'd have multiple providers of insurance in this space um all that to say before you get in the stacking protocol smart contract risk and start chasing yields know what you're getting into if the reward is high enough okay maybe it makes sense but i mean vitalik said this right if you know if you're making a three percent uh you know um earnings on something like die then you're basically assuming that die doesn't have a cataclysmic event in like for for decades basically and is that a good return for the amount of risk that you're taking uh so so question that um insurance can help and take a look at nexus and the tactic that we're putting out about that um anything else you want to say on that david yeah the main to some degree defy is speculation and gambling to some degree like it's it's also finance and it's also like this new paradigm that we're all hoping comes comes about but like it's speculation that it comes about like it's a risk that it comes about and to some degree that it's also gambling that it's comes about and the first rule about playing poker and the first rule about gambling is that you always position yourself so that if you get wiped out you can still play like if you lose the hand you can still play and so that's that i think that is a a rule of thumb that everyone should follow like if you buy a bunch of yiffy tokens wifey tokens are you investing your entire net worth into it and then if something goes wrong are you effed or are you responsibly investing a amount that you can lose that leaves you able to stay at the table like always position yourself so you can stay at the table or otherwise it'll just be bad it'll be bad it's totally right on man and there are multiple tables you've got your traditional world table then you've got your entering crypto table and then within crypto there are levels of risk right right so you know eth is less risky than iffy yeah one more one more comment on that right so some of these some of these listeners maybe this is their first cycle uh this is i have not yet completed a cycle i came in in um june of 2017. so i feel like i can on the horizon as we go full circle into these cryptocycles i feel like i can see on horizon where i started in the last cycle some people haven't yet gone a full cycle and let it be known that when prices go up and you check your block folio and you're twice as rich as the day before like your mindset changes your psychology changes and you need to account for that and be cognizant of that who you are changes in a bull market and your risk appetite will change and you need to watch yourself as that changes and so be responsible be introspective be mindful and make sure that as the bull market uh goes on that you don't succumb to the mania and you stay rational it's going it's not easy it's not easy when you see your portfolio double in a day you think you're a genius but you also you're not so you have to be mindful you have to be cognizant you have to be aware of your own psychology know who you are know your limits be responsible because you have to stay at the table well said sir we we need to do a tactic sometime on dollar cost averaging out i think um i think people could benefit from that as this as the bull market continues this has been state of the nation explosive is the word that's the state of the nation today guys this is um episode seven again it comes out tuesdays on youtube make sure you subscribe you get this and other videos last thing i'll say about risk of course eat this risky bitcoin is risky all of the tokens we talk about are risky wifey is super risky yes ultra risky um don't lose more than do don't put in more than you can afford to lose but we are we're headed west and we're excited that you are on the journey with us state of the nation signing off
