[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and today on this episode of our Zoo zalu series we are exploring some New Frontiers New Frontiers and new technologies all of which are poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything about the operating system that Society is currently running on this episode we are exploring the frontier of synthetic biology or sinbio for short understanding synthetic biology is hard learning synthetic biology is a little bit like learning crypto first it's very confusing and then you have an aha moment and then you see things like you've never seen them before and there's no going back so I'll do my best to First give you a primer before we enter our conversations with three of the biggest leaders in the synthetic biology world including Drew Endy the father of modern synthetic biology so here we go synthetic biology combines biology engineering and computer science to design and construct new biological systems with synthetic biology you can manufacture biological components using biology so synthetic biology is all about manipulating and reprogramming the DNA of living organisms to create new functions or traits that do not occur naturally yet are still produced with Organic means we all know DNA as the instruction manual for living things simply put synthetic biology is the act of rewriting DNA so that we can write our own instruction manual like how we would write our own computer code DNA is a turing complete computational platform so the products that come out of synthetic biology are quite literally Limitless we can do anything it's just a matter of how do we get the biological components to actually ingest the new DNA that we write like like computer code there are simple and down-to-earth applications of synthetic biology such as engineering bacteria to produce medicines more efficiently we can modify crops to make them more resistant to pests or drought but the real reason why synthetic biology gets so crazy is that it is a brand new computational and Manufacturing platform in which its limits start to quickly approach our own imaginations biology is a general purpose technology and synthetic biology unlocks an entirely New Frontier of technological production that we've never had before so bankless Nation take a moment to look around you do see all the material Goods that you have I have a desk here there are some lights behind me I drove in a car today these are all physical materials that are produced in some Factory and will all ultimately Decay to reach the end of its lifespan and re-enter the outside world possibly perhaps most likely through a landfill with with synthetic biology instead of having a laborious resource intensive manufacturing process much of the material Goods that we use and consume on a frequent basis can be grown not manufactured with synthetic biology the dichotomy between human produced material goods and nature grown organic material really starts to blur and are extremely inefficient analog methods of manufacturing can be replaced by systems that are hundreds of times more efficient and 99 less resource intensive so if you believe in the future of synthetic biology we will be able to grow new cities and everything inside of them well there are immense challenges and obstacles to getting to this point the magnitude of abundance that is unlocked has attracted the efforts of some of the brightest Minds on this planet some of which you are going to hear from right now Frank listenation I would love to introduce you the three leaders that you are going to hear from the synthetic biology World starting with Drew ND the father of modern synthetic biology followed by John cumbers founder and CEO of sinbio beta and finish up by Jennifer Holmgren the CEO of lonzotec Drew ND is going to continue this introduction into the broad landscape of synthetic biology and will continue to open up your imaginations about that world that could be if only we had synthetic biology we'll talk about the emergence of wet wear as in Hardware software and now wet wear we'll talk about the read and write functions for DNA and progress towards the programmability of cells and then we'll zoom out and get into the world in which we can grow buildings planes cars and if Drew ND is correct this is all happening in our lifetimes if you're on the younger side then we'll get to hear from John cumbers who will continue the conversation after Drew and give us more specifics about the technical details about how this all works how everything starts with fermentation why nature from first principles is massively more efficient than anything we can manufacture with our own hands or even with robot hands and how we actually get to the point of programming multicellular organisms and then lastly we're going to hear from Jennifer Holmgren the CEO of lonzotec which is perhaps the largest in production efforts of synthetic biology lawnsotech is a company that depends on an additional facility to a carbon emission Source like a steel mill or a landfill and lonzotec captures the emitted carbon and using fermentation that pollution is converted by bacteria into very simple composable chemical Legos that can be produced into almost anything during Jennifer's presentation at zuzalu she pulled out three Adidas jackets that were made in partnership with Adidas that had all been manufactured using emitted carbon carbon emissions coming from from like a steel mill or some sort of carbon emission source and so they captured the carbon and they turned it into a jacket three of them uh one of them was given to vitalik uh it was a black and white jacket and when Jennifer gave it to vitalik he immediately put it on because everyone was watching but then vitalik saw that it was actually reversible and instead of having black and white on the outside you could have this purpley rainbowy pink color and like I I knew I was watching vitalik do this and I realized that he didn't know that it was reversible because knowing vitalik he would immediately put on the colorful side and like I saw his face like light up as soon as he saw that he could make it like pink and purple and light it was a very very classic for talk moment anyways small small little

metamask.io Bank location we are here at zoo zalu and I'm talking to Drew Endy who I I've been told is the father of modern synthetic biology is that do you accept this title is that right uh when something gets going there's many parents so I could be one of you know and some of the things that are happening with stem cells by the way you can uh have interesting parentage these days sure sure so we're going to try and go down the synthetic biology rabbit hole which is a domain of knowledge which I did not know how incredibly expansive and revolutionary it can be uh and I think the The Listener base will know how optimistic I am about the world of crypto and now I am slowly getting uh pilled by the world of synthetic biology if you will so so Drew I mean I'm sure you've explained synthetic biology to 10 000 people at 10 000 different times how do you how do you explain it in the fewest number of words possible so get rid of one word right away get rid of biology focus on synthesis and go back in time and let's use the Greek version synthesis with the U what does that mean it means composition or a putting together so synthesis is about putting things together when we put that word in front of biology you get synthetic biology which is putting biology together at a fundamental level it involves research to improve our ability to compose living systems does that make sense as a start yeah yeah so um a lot of times when people encounter biotechnology it's very much as an emerging technology a doorstep of Last Resort you know like you have a horrible disease you can't cure it by going to the hardware store and buying nuts and bolts you know you can't cure it with AI yet right and and so it's like well maybe we could cure it with biotechnology um and and so normally when people think about biotechnologies like what can you use it for right now the medicine the food the fuel the shelter and what that's led to over the last 50 years is genetic engineering and a bioeconomy which we could talk about but but just to come back to it what's been missing is lower level work to make it easier to engineer biology to put biology together and so synthetic biology starting 20 years ago is really throwing some elbows in the cultural political space to say hey wait a minute we've got to develop a a more solid foundation for working with living systems to solve problems and to do that work we have to take a big step back from the application layer and just get down underneath and say how do we compose living systems um and so that's that's what's been going on and then because of that it's becoming easier to compose living systems and so if you're not paying attention to what's underneath the surface you don't see anything but then suddenly all these apps start popping up it's like oh like something's changed but you don't know what it is so it sounds like uh to regurgitate some of this back at you I'm getting like ideas of like building blocks right and where it sounds like we're going very very deep in the biological stack to be able to kind of produce building blocks that can assemble themselves and the applications of this seem kind of endless when we go down to the very building blocks of what makes biology and understanding and going through the learnings of some of these talks really it sounds like synthetic biology has found a way to use modern day technology computers code perhaps even AI to actually create the building blocks that we need to compose living systems um we in the crypto world we use this idea of money Legos as in building blocks of money and finance and it sounds like What synthetic biology is is with technology finding ways to get down to the basement level of what makes a cell a cell and be able to turn that into building blocks that we control is this a fair summary yeah it's a fair way of representing it but I I wanna give everybody a sense of where the frontier is right so so we're doing that work we're about 20 years into it um it's not a done deal right so there's been significant progress which you can quantify to say how much better have we got at composing living systems from the inside out from the molecular cellular scale we can come back and talk about some details or examples but but we're not we're not done right so for example you know biology is a general purpose technology anywhere you are you could look at what biology is doing it's like well could I partner with Biology to do more of that or something different like think of a leaf on a tree it's a self-assembling solar panel that recycles itself it's like harvesting photons fixing carbon so that's a really interesting technology right um so we've got this GPT not chat GPT but general purpose technology in biology we're trying to unlock biologies at GPT the fundamental unit of life is the cell there's no cell on earth that is operationally understood completely right so the best understood cells have about 20 to 30 percent of their componentry absolutely essential for cell viability and nobody on Earth knows what those components do and so what that means is if you're trying to build with Biology for any purpose you're encountering this low-level ambiguity and it means that your workflow is going to be edisonian it's going to be tinker and test tinker and test which is why you see this investment in foundries and bioworks that allow for high throughput tinker and test as a long ago structural engineer you're like I don't like I prefer design build work to design build test design build test like if I'm going to build a bridge like I'll design it I'll build it the bridge is going to work unless I'm incompetent right so but because we've got this ambiguity and the fundamentals still at the cellular level for all cells on this planet um the where the job's not done right at the root level right and so that's where you know like my academic day job with a lab is like pushing the frontier to get to operational Mastery of the cell and and that n which which by the way I think we'll get to and of order a thousand days like I said this decade sort of thing then we begin to see um an even more interesting domain of Biotech I think where these worlds uh that where these Two Worlds Collide biology and and computers uh and I think our listener base is pretty intimately aware with how computers work where they where they Collide and what you're saying is that cells are decently like computers except we are missing like 30 of the motherboard we don't know 30 of the components that make these things work and that is the obstacle that the world of synthetic biologies is currently facing yeah but can you um just unpack the metaphor of like SL as a motherboard or a cell as a computer and how that relates um I prefer the metaphor of a cell as a cell cell like beef and just be like I've metaphors are wonderful and they're dangerous sure so so like something to think about is um you know Computing is operating primarily at the intersection of Jules j-o-u-l-e-s and bins and it uses Hardware to render that interface living system cells are operating in the domain of joules bits and atoms right like life's harvesting energy from a source we've got bits in The genome and then we've got the self-mixing milieu comprising the cell um so so um and so I think of it as wet wear you know like there's Hardware there's software there's wet wear and and so a cell is a cell like let's use the metaphor like let's just let's just let a cell be a cell um and but we can we should talk about it more specifically so for example um let's say I took a bacterium that's microscopic one millionth of a meter long a micron and I'm just gonna have a magic wand I'm gonna make it 100 million times bigger so now it's 100 meters long and I'm not adding more atoms I'm just like magically making everything bigger so we can see it it's like the size of a building all right now now we can say well look what does it look like um I've let's say I've got a protein a green fluorescent protein that makes a green light right that protein is the size of basketball all right and and then the ribosome which is a collection of molecules that makes proteins is two meters tall right and then the genome the DNA it's going back and forth in this building 1 600 times right it's really thin thread and so it's cross-sectional areas like four square meters all right and and then there's many other molecules in this building all about basketball size and they fill 30 of the space of the building right so it's 30 we call that volume fraction it's 30 packed with molecules and and this is just like now we're just building this instantaneous mental image of what a cell is and and of course it's alive and and what that means is it's self-mixing you know like Brownian energy is causing all the molecules to jostle around through collisions with water so that soccer ball that green fluorescent protein is moving with an average this is where it gets crazy is moving with an average velocity of 500 meters a second it's instantaneous velocities faster probably it's like all right so what that means is the molecular molecular Collision time is a nanosecond so I've got this self-mixing milieu that's 30 solid 70 water with a gigahertz Collision rate and what it's doing is it's being encoded by The genome instantiated as a physical mixture it's receiving energy from the environment and within a period of 10 to 20 minutes it can make a physical copy of itself right so it's like that's wet wear right and and I know it's like a lot to think about right and and I like making it macroscopic by the way I would love for somebody to take a visual turn that into it turn that into Minecraft like build a cell on Minecraft right and like let's let's like have empathy for it there um but but I I love metaphor I fall I fall into the rabbit hole of metaphor all the time but but like we just gotta get to wetware on our own terms so like that's sort of that's what I really want to just yeah get for that and I I think the the motivation behind why you uh presented that illustration is to really put the idea of the power of wet wear that we just do not have in our current technological landscape as it relates to like computers and chips and Engineering like wet wear biology the promise of synthetic biology is that the the the the wet wear can become the orders of magnitude more powerful than what we have there's there's two things that are going on one should be a parent already and then there's something that's synthetic biology uniquely unlocks so so the one that everybody can see hopefully already or begin to imagine from what we're talking about is I've got an object that can grow a copy of itself right like my phone does not organize matter from the environment and grow off and Bud another phone right so biology begets biology right we've got reproducing machines in a Johnny Von Neumann sense right right but it's like the wet wear is is a self-reproducing machine right so that's where there's profound power um the other thing that's happening is the Technologies of synthetic biology include things like reading DNA or DNA sequencing and writing DNA or DNA synthesis all right so so let's just dive into that for a second please okay when I sequence DNA I have a physical copy of DNA the atoms and then I read it out and I turn it into a representation which I can atcg and so on right and so that that can be represented itself in zeros and ones so sequencing of DNA lets me goes from atoms of a piece of DNA to bits all right so that's a translation and how that that link allows us to do things as humans that's how we can move a representation of the genetic code onto the network onto a computer we can compute upon it all right and so that we could learn about it right right and and then we can redesign it in the bit layer how do we get back to atoms well it's DNA print synthesis right and so DNA synthesis is a tool that lets us specify a sequence and then dispense chemicals in a particular order to reconstruct a polymer of DNA encoding whatever we specify right so it's like t a a t a c g a c t c a c t a t a g g a g a like what's that oh that's a promoter that turns on gene expression um by the way you can memorize sequences by making them your login password right so like that's a real sequence it's a functional sequence that gets genes expressed um but but like zoom out for a second atoms to bits with reading bits to atoms with synthesis so those two technologies DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis make genetic material and genetic information interconvertible right and let us take the superpower of the internet which is to move information around in space-time by decoupling and recoupling it and combine it with the superpower Biology one of which is growth and reproduction but the other is biology grows with the materials that are where the biology is you know the leaves on a tree don't come from a factory in Detroit and are shipped on pallets and then taped and stapled to the twigs and branches like ah the photons arrive the nitrogen arrives the water arrives the carbon where the biology is so like all atoms are local is another secret superpower biology so it's the ultimate distributed manufacturing platform so what happens so this all of a sudden now synthetic Bob G Rabbit Hole hopefully you're seeing is like crazy interesting right we're gonna take the superpower of the internet decoupling information from space-time and then we're gonna and connect that bio information with all the power of compute but then we enable biology superpower of growth and reproduction and local manufacturing right and so now we've got a bionet we can foresee uh if we wanted to push the limits of deglobalization we can go for that um and so on and so forth I I hope what um listeners are starting to see is like first we have this read and write layer which what you talked about first we can read DNA and that was a technology that we unlocked a number of decades ago then we upload that information in byteco in uh in uh in bytes in in binary yeah and we have that expressed in digital form yeah and this is when other Technologies AI the internet open source can start to influence those Technologies and then we can start to write DNA and then we have another technology that actually lights that right DNA to actually manifest in actual DNA creation and then this is what's the next and so that's the the read and write stack of this layer what's the next what's the next higher order stack what happens next yeah I wanna I wanna backfill something just just in case it helps people Ponder um every a lot of people know about 3D printers right think of a DNA printer as a 1D printer all right it's making a polymer of DNA it's a line it's a 1D printer right however that 1D printer programs the molecular Machinery of cells including ribosomes that get you to three dimensions right so I've got a 1D printer that programs uh actually a three in four dimensional with time you know manufacturing platform right so so it's kind of interesting we've got a 1D printer hidden in in DNA synthesis the next level up is cells and ecosystems and and you know what's beyond that is is microscopic and macroscopic Manufacturing um you know so what can you do with a cell right and and the answer is anything biology can do um my wife's work for example is to reprogram yeast saccharomyces um it's by the way it's like these words might sound strange but it's like right in the word is it oftentimes a description of what it is um sugar loving fungus saccharomyces and then cerevisiae beer like sugar loving fungus beer right so that's brewer's yeast right so normally you take that's a cell uh you know it's a it's a reproducing wet wear machine right it's like four to eight microns in diameter um normally it would take in glucose and it would make ethanol and carbon dioxide all right and some other things um you know her team can reprogram the metabolism of yeast to take in glucose and make scopolamine or morphine right chemicals that would normally be found in plants um by the way you know what's really cool about plants tell me they don't have feet they don't have legs they can't run away no it's like so crazy like when you stop and think about it like imagine being a creature that's a rooted creature that you can't run away from stuff like what would that be like and how would you protect yourself and and so because plants can't run away from insects or mammals over evolutionary time scales they've developed defenses and modulators of insects and mammals which are these crazy chemicals we find in Plants right and so what you're saying there is that they have been rid of the opportunity of running away so in as a reaction of that they have instead created a an explosion of other compounds and proteins that we can now upload and learn from and those are our building blocks well an inspiration of chemistry basically like a whole molecular keyboard right that can that can be like used to program like you know you ingest certain plant substances they change how you feel in your behavior caffeine you know but many others but but so we can take inspiration from the chemicals found in plants but how would we get those chemicals traditionally we'd grow the plants right um do you know where morphine comes from uh once upon a time I did but no longer poppies right yes yes yeah right right so of course there's an illegal market for poppies right but you know like if you need a pain medicine it's very you know properly you know derived and supplied like how does that get to you what does it start with and the answer is we have legal poppy fields in certain places there's not too many places where you can grow poppies due to climate one place is Tasmania right and so we'll have poppy farming in Tasmania the poppies will be harvested after a period of time a year or so then you have to extract the active ingredient out of the plant and then move that around the world under careful scrutiny and Regulation and then formulate that into a medicine right um so what if instead of all that you could you know reprogram the metabolism of yeast to take in sugar and make morphine or taking sugar make Scopolamine Scopolamine is what's in the motion sickness patches right or take in sugar and make any plant natural product found on Earth and you didn't have to do that in Tasmania you could do it in Minnesota or Montenegro or Indonesia or Micronesia or pick your place right and so now and importantly not with puppies anymore that's right with yeast with saccharomyces the sugar loving fungus it's no longer Sarah visier it's Medicine of vissier or something right and so and so you know the neck to your question you know once you get up up up up above the molecule scale you get to the cell scale and What synthetic biology unlocks is routinization of programming cells and I just want to be careful again we have not yet made routine the programming of cells but we've made significant progress towards it and we can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train coming at us it's like oh we're we're this decade unlocking biology as a general purpose technology I think the the main point I think literature really uh put emphasis on is that okay so if we want to make morphine we don't need a poppy field if we want to make X we don't need to harvest the environment we can create this at scale in a lab without and the only thing we need is we need to encode the DNA of the molecule that we want to produce we need correct that's right we need the biocode that can instantiate the process right and once we have the code then we have the scale right a couple other things the go to market reality around all these Technologies right now is framed within the context of talk about metaphor industrialization both metaphor and practice now what does that mean concentrated Capital concentrated manufacturing if you want to create a synthetic biology company today you're going to get 10 100 Megabucks and build a team and so instantly right there you're accessing centralized Capital traditionally and then the biology you're making is going to go into an industrial fermenter somewhere to supply the industrial economies with the drop-in replacement supply chain for the same stuff right so that's it's kind of boring and then it also has an obvious deficit going forward which is the Industrial Supply chains only provision on this planet for two billion people more or less right so if you actually cared about getting essential medicines to 8 billion people you know that's not going to get it done however in what we're talking about already like how many people can run a fermentation right everybody right you know you could be in a rural Hut in India with a fermented breakfast bread idli idli and within that context you know if you needed to brew a medicine you should be able to enable the Brewing of medicines the issue right now is that person might not have very much money so you know we're not going to supply them through Amazon Prime or whatever like what they need so synthetic biology as it's maturing this decade is is gonna have to confront like this transition to flourishing and abundance which is like how do we get beyond the metaphor and practice of industrialization and bring to um a lot of people talk about industrializing biology I like flipping that around like I like biologizing things so what does it mean I don't want the fourth or fifth Industrial Revolution like it's horrifying right right I want like something different I want biologizing you want the first biological Revolution that's right yeah maybe you could um just help us imagine what that actually means what does a biological Revolution look to you yeah okay so buyer before the year 2050 we can enable 10 billion Homo sapiens to flourish on this planet in partnership with everything else on here right so so that's the opposite of what I've been experiencing for the first 50 years of my life um the human population has doubled over my lifetime and the natural biodiversity indices have been cut in half is that correlation definitely is it causation for sure right changes in land use pollution introduction of invasive species so so at a planetary scale um what I'd like to deliver is working together with as many people as possible is a functioning Planet that's got 10 billion Homo sapiens flourishing along with everything else it and I don't mean this as by day I'm an academic by night I mean we're getting this done right like buyer before 2050. and um it looks to me like for the first time in human history we can pull it off you know not in some wishful thinking like no we're going to do it like buyer before 2050. so what biology repres sense is the intersection of Jules bits and atoms everybody listening and we are operating on energy about 100 Watts we need to be instantiated via atoms we have knowledge and information it's like at the lowest root level of what it means to operate and exist um you know it's like Jules bits and atoms and so how do we how do we unlock that and because biology is right there at that intersection it's it's a critical Tech right to get to flourishing so let's let's just talk about numbers for a second primary driver of of biomanufacturing from an energy perspective is obviously photosynthesis there's 90 terawatts on average at any moment in time of photosynthesis on the Earth right Sun landing on the ground no sun not landing on the ground being the photons being harvested by chlorophyll to fix carbon Sun landing on Plants that's being utilized by plants like 90 terawatts like it's like think about it like solar panels right right but it's like photosynthesis how much energy is being harvested by leaves right it's like of order 90 terawatts 70 on the land 20 in the ocean civilizations running on 20 terawatts to keep it simple sure right so 90 is four and a half times 20. right so just just the napkin math right there just like hmm we have enough juice powering manufacturing via biological growth that's like four and a half times what civilization's consuming like right there it should feel pretty good right like should be enough right right you know it's like it's not like it'd be better if it's a thousand times more right but like that feels pretty good here's where it gets even better um I Heard maybe you know I mean it's like I heard that um on this planet the the homo sapien tribe did a terawatt of photovoltaic panel manufacturing last year did you hear that no I heard that yeah at Stanford we've installed a million solar panels okay um that offsets the entire campus electricity load um I've heard that you know the return on energy for a solar panel went above one sometime in the last decade a lot of people think of Roi like how much does the panel cost how much is the electricity worth and when do I get my money back right right I'm a nerd so like I like return on energy right how many joules j o u l e s does it take to make the panel and how many joules does the panel get when do I get my energy back what's my Roe so apparently in the last decade Roe for solar as a sector went above one and now it's now it's averaging 20 to one oh great so that means in Menlo Park I'm getting my energy back in a year oh that means we're transitioning to electricity generation abundance right and if I'm doing a terawatt of panel manufacturing this year um you know like how many years until I get to 20 right it's 20 obviously right but then it's interesting everything else being equal and who knows where it goes off the rails we're increasing panel manufacturing um you know it looks like we're going to run out of silver and other things with current Tech but but we can get a couple more doublings so my prediction would be if that Trend continues sometime in the 2030s we're actually electricity generation abundant what's that have to do with synthetic biology so wait for this so like a lot of times you think about electricity generation but you got to transmit it you got to store it in batteries that's fine that's valid but but let's bring it to biology so you can take electricity and you can split water and you can use that to fix carbon from the atmosphere and you can make simple single single carbon organic molecules like formate f o r m-a-t-e you can make other things but like formate's an easy one and so a kilowatt hour of electricity might get you a gram of formate well remember those organisms that normally eat sugar we can bioengineer them to eat formate all right so now I go electricity however sourced to fix carbon formate and now formate to biomass a medicine or whatever biology grows and when you talk to the material scientists and chemical Engineers they think they can improve the front end to kilowatt hour of electricity to 30 grams 30 grams of formate I don't know this is going to pull a lot of carbon out but what it means practically for me is I can lift the ceiling on how much biology can grow by energy electricity generation and and more importantly you know I can only do farming in places where I've got good soil or an enclosed shipping container like Hydroponics and a reasonable water supply but I can do Electro biosynthesis anywhere I can put a panel right because I'm going to have carbon in the air and I'm going to have other things I need that I can Source locally and so and so like I'm just feeling like I got line of sight to Abundant jewels and I can connect that to biology directly and now I can do not only agriculture I'm not against agriculture that's amazing but now I can do Electro biosynthesis in various places locally right to get even more biological manufacturing and so it looks to me like we've got a line of sight to solving the joules puzzle and the atoms puzzle and so then the only thing that remains is how are we operation operating our our knowledge networks right it's like we've got a pretty good platform for that already and so when you say you see line of sight what I'm hearing is that everything seems to be a known quantity to get to the point of the only constraint is our imagination and the data that we can get from DNA and the the building blocks that we know how to build well and we've got to complete the fundamental engineering work right to unlock biology as a GPT so so like let me let me come back to Metaphor in a hopefully not too risky way right um um do you care about longevity yeah all right so so let's talk about um longevity in the context of um a Linux server all right so we're going to talk about server uptime that's like server longevity right and like Linux is pretty stable now and so like remarkably you know high uptime like Long Long Live server uptime um imagine if you didn't understand 30 of how Linux or Unix worked and it wasn't just you nobody on Earth understood that and there was some memory leak or some other thing and you know like like inevitably you'd have to reboot right right so like you could go work on on server up time or longevity and no doubt you'd like hack together some things that were like oh the uptime's gone up by a factor of two right right and like everybody yes like we're living twice as long our servers are living twice as long be a practical advance to be a big deal but you really wouldn't crack the puzzle right because like unless it was like total dumb luck and you probably never get there or let's say you cared about um security of your servers right you need to secure your server and you don't understand 30 of how the operating system works and nobody on Earth does right right like but but the things you don't understand are each little thing that you'd understand is absolutely essential for Server operation right like if anything that you don't understand goes wrong the entire server crashes secure your server right like okay you're gonna air gap it and pray right right like that's it so so so the the I wanna it's like what we're confronting in synthetic biology is massive cultural challenge to represent and communicate that we've got this low-level ambiguity you know at the bottom of the stack at the cell and until we can overcome that right no matter what you care about provisioning medicines or living longer or biosecurity it's like good luck you're going to be on your heels reacting and hoping and praying um so so like we've got to get that part done right okay so so this is the the current Frontier of knowledge that we are at with uh synthetic biology um and so I want to assume that we solved that problem because I believe in uh human Ingenuity and I want to um kind of like move forward into the into 2040 2050 where we start to really Leverage The Best of this technology some of the metaphors that we were talking about um in the in the when we're having this and the sinbio uh block meets blockchain uh weekend this weekend I found a piece of the blockchain or Watchers that's why that's this block is here I found this on the beach is the only part of the blockchain I understand like fell off fell off the block well so I I wanted it so a lot of like very big sci-fi ideas got presented in this this last week and we talked about like growing buildings or there was this uh demo video that is where we had a what was it a helicopter but it's actually a b and we're got this guy is like driving a b around except it's a mechanical B and we grew it can just I know we're running out of time because I believe you have to catch a flight to get out of here maybe you can just like leave the listeners and myself with some imagination about like when we really Master this technology yeah what does the world look like what what can we do what can we really do with it well let me just give you a sense of staging sure right so I think the remainder of the 2020s is developing and proving out the fundamental tools to unlock biology as a GPT and then the decade of the 2030s is seeing those deployed wherever they need to be and then the 2040s is filling in to flourishing right now we could accelerate that but like that's a lot to do right and and like it's like develop deploy do is how I'm thinking about the timing of it and it won't be segregated so cleanly but you get the ideas um there was a have you seen the Lithuanian synthetic biology movie called Vesper I think it's on Amazon streaming for like five bucks um it's a dark movie it's not a wonderful future it's synthetic biology dystopia well I mean there's a heroic sure protagonist she's amazing um and there's hope at the end but it's like a dark setting sure but I want to give credit to the world Builders and others who conceptualize what it's like when we have biotechnology um we think of biotechnology like hidden away in a fermenter right right or it's something that's inside right but like like like you know we I talk with um my kids about like the purple booger project right it's like I've got a commensal microorganism that doesn't make me sick it lives up in my sinuses and it's always doing embedded surveillance about what's infecting me and if nothing's infecting me my mucus is its normal color but I've got an influenza strain in there suddenly my mucus is bright orange if I got a coronavirus strain in there my mucus becomes bright purple like why do I have to go somewhere else and send my biology somewhere else like in plastic stuff to get like no no like I should just be able to use my biology to tell me what I'm doing um so so it's like biology that's embedded within us on us and and within our environment the Vesper team that this really nice exploration into World building and I prefer that over the wonderful like Formula One bee helicopter thing like that's very thing um you know the artist Phil Ross really pioneered micro texture building buildings using um mushrooms right so so I had a dream I was I was back at MIT I went to the um used to go to lunch in the architecture Department up on the fourth floor there's crazy poster one day Fab treehab and some architect had done speculative design about this living tree house it was like a four bedroom two bath like yes like I'm gonna make that right and I didn't know how to do it and so when I was moving to Stanford that's near Half Moon Bay and we've got the giant pumpkin competition I'm like okay like thousand pound pumpkin that's like almost as big as like a trailer right so I'm like I'm gonna have to figure out how to make giant programmable gourds that grow and differentiate into a four bedroom two bath and that's how I'm getting my now here's where it gets better if you walk around the main quad at Stanford you can find hidden on the pavers the only corporate advertising on our buildings it says and it's hidden away like George Goodman's artificial stone 1890. what's this and now Mr Goodman was San Francisco's best purveyor of artificial stone like that's reinforced concrete or concrete and and artificial is not a pejorative in the late 19th century it's like point of Pride brand marketing oh we've got the good stuff it's the artificial stone right and and well what is artificial stone we grind up Natural Stone and reform it synthesize it compose it put it together to make stone with the properties we like when and where we need it quickly it's like ah what does this mean in terms of like growing a house or how would I ever grow a mature Oak Tree in how long does it take like 72 years I can't wait that long I need to make a mature Oak Tree in 72 hours right only way to do that is like I gotta grind up trees and then quickly make a new tree right now turns out there's organisms that eat this type of material it's the wood fungus right and so the artist Phil Ross brought me to uh this family farm in Monterey called Far West fungi which is the local supplier of gourmet mushrooms and when you go to that farm it's it's just hanging out in the Strawberry Fields you know near the Pacific Ocean they get piles of wood chips uh for free approximately and they mix that up with the organisms that eat wood but because they're wood chips they're super surface area right they very quickly transform that material into a new material right and so you can do mycological manufacturing and Phil was building tea houses out of mushrooms that you can use to make tea and so you could go to the Museum of Art in San Francisco and step inside his mycological tea house and break off a piece of the tea house and make tea from the tea house and drink the tea in the tea house right and so and then David Benjamin in New York uh he's an architect in Colombia did a pop-up uh like three-story Tower right at the Museum of Art in New York um and so and so it's like yeah like biology operates at the nanoscale with atomic precision and it can grow macroscopic objects like here's a fantasy that's beyond what I could promise but I can imagine it right um inspired by you check out and search online for The Living Root bridges of India you can find these double decker suspension bridges made from rubber tree roots um so like Golden Gate Bridge all right like here's a Golden Gate Bridge super gigantic coastal redwoods um of course they need to be reinforced with some type of uh Advanced polymer that we're gonna have to biosynthesize uh for buckling and stuff like that and then we're gonna do the main suspension cables with um spider thread right but instead of making Spider thread in a fermenter I actually want to have choreographed spiders who are friendly and they're actually just weaving and maintaining the suspension cables right and so like I don't know how to actually do that but I can imagine that um but I I can show you and point you to things like a three-story Tower right right or a house you could sit in and have tea uh you know working with with wood fungus and and things like that um what I'm focused on personally is um the more boring part like let's just deal with the stuff we got to get done in the context of who and what we are now and take the jewels bits and atoms layer um off the table as an issue like check right and if we can get that right then first we can say well we're not trashing the place so things aren't going extinct right over and over and over and over again with the increasing pacing all right and and then we can get to the more interesting thing I'll leave you with um uh one last metaphor right because because I think it's much more interesting than I can imagine um in the 1960s there was a space race to get um a homo sapien up out of the Earth's gravity wall right so we're familiar with the idea of a well as a metaphor and we're down in the gravitational field of the earth and we're stuck here on the surface um we use a rocket to get up up and away right we're also in a life well right so we're constrained all life on Earth is constrained by the life that came before the lineage and by needing to physically reproduce we come from parents we beget children and in a changing world we have to be able to evolve right so there's three profound constraints on all life on Earth lineage reproduction and evolvability when we unlock synthetic biology we remove all three constraints getting to a fully understood cell that work will involve learning to build cells mixing molecules together so we won't have construct we won't have created Life we'll have constructed it and that's getting up out of the Earth's life well perched on its lip it's much more interesting than the vacuum of space because now you can compile back down to anything life could be which is way more diverse than what could ever be on any one planet right and so it's it's like actually impossible to imagine all the things that could be made right it's impossible to imagine because uh like a computer biology is also Turing complete so it doesn't have any limitations it's yes and it's operating in the realm of atoms right right Drew unfortunately we've run out of time but this was a fantastic first start into the the very very dense and deep subject of synthetic biology I hope to continue

Twitter at Xerox mantle bankless Nation we are at zoo zollu and I'm talking with John cumbers of sin bio beta and we're going to explore the world of synthetic biology which listening to John and listening to him MC the sin bio event that happened last weekend really blew my mind and I'm hoping we can convey some of that information here today John welcome awesome good to be here David thanks for having me yeah John yours give us a little bit about the background of how you fell down the the sinbio rabbit hole and what you're doing at Symbio beta sure the rabbit hole light fell down was the actually the longevity rabbit hole and the space settlement Rabbit Hole so about 20 years ago I was lying on a bench uh in in Malaysia where I was an exchange student looking up at the stars and uh trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life I think I was 21 at the time and just looking at all these beautiful stars twinkling out there and thinking there's got to be more to this there's got to be other civilizations out there other life forms and I'm an Explorer I love to travel I love to explore so I wanted to go find other life in the universe and that led me down the longevity rabbit hole because it was like well these are really far away these other star systems how are we going to get there well let's figure out how we can live longer how we can put the body into homeostasis you can travel through through uh food through time through the Universe um and that got me into biology at the time I didn't know how a gene related to a protein I didn't know what a gene was I didn't know what a protein was and so I then went back to the UK where I'm from switched my career from computer science into into bioinformatics and then and then I went on to do a PhD in the USA um and then went on to work at Nasa for seven years I started their synthetic biology program um so I fell down and then I started sinbio beta which is this Innovation Hub that brings together synthetic biology entrepreneurs and investors and the biggest thing that we do is a conference which we've done for 11 years in the Bay Area um about two to three thousand people come every year and we bring together the whole ecosystem everybody who's doing Reading Writing and editing a DNA programming with Biology designing building and testing a biological systems and circuits to make things with Biology so uh yeah that's kind of a a 20-year uh rabbit hole that I that I went down and just so excited about learning about what you can do with Biology and what the potential is yeah and bankless listeners will of course be familiar with the idea of a rabbit hole we talk about it all the time in Kirby though and one thing I'm very much learning here at zuzalu is that there are many other rabbit holes out there uh very and a lot of this is very interdisciplinary you said that we're here to about to talk about synthetic biology but another big rabbit hole that is here at suzalo is longevity and so I think this has really been the theme of zuzalu is these uh interconnections these rabbit holes are starting to weave together now we're finally getting crypto involved uh but I'm hoping you can kind of give us the lay of the land for the synthetic biology Rabbit Hole uh kind of like show us the map if you will where does this whole thing start where is the Genesis of the rabbit hole how do we enter this yeah it's a great question I think we can enter it about 50 years ago when Genentech was founded and Genentech is a biotech company and the first product of recombinant DNA that is recombining DNA was insulin and if you were a diabetic 50 years ago your insulin would come from the abattoir pigs would be slaughtered for food and their pancreases would be extracted and the insulin in their pancreas would be bottled up and sold to people who had diabetes they have a pancreas that can't produce insulin so they need to get it from somewhere they got it from pigs now if you're a diabetic your insulin does not come from Pig pancreas and it's not Pig insulin it's human insulin but it doesn't come from humans we're not harvesting humans not that I know of not in this country um instead it comes from a process called fermentation it comes exactly the same process as we get from a craft brew so a Craft brewery takes in sugar and it takes in yeast and the yeast convert that sugar into alcohol through a series of chemical steps a series of enzymes that are made and that comes from the DNA of the yeast cell the Genome of the yeast cell all the genes in the in the yeast make enzymes which are three-dimensional molecules which can make and break other chemical bonds and outcomes alcohol well it turns out you can program that DNA now and that's what Genentech did and they changed the genes so that instead of making enzymes that made alcohol they made enzymes that made insulin so they took the human gene for insulin put it into the yeast cell and now they can Brew insulin and so that's at its core What synthetic biology is about is about being able to read write edit the DNA find things that you want to make put them into cells that can make them and now you have this amazing production platform for making anything you want it could be insulin or it could be a material like a nylon or it could be a chemical or it could be a polymer it could be a food product and this is why we're seeing this boom in synthetic biology over the last 10 years of people now building stuff with Biology so the theme I've noticed is that fermentation really seems to be a very key part of this and that also seems to be where we apply this word programming into we use this fermentation progress as our programming bed so that we take this organic process where instead of producing alcohol we are able to reprogram this the uh the fermenting process the the microorganisms in this fermenting process to instead produce alcohol produce something else and my intuition from what you said is that okay we started by changing from alcohol to insulin but it almost seems like the product of what can be made from the this fermentation process could be anything and that's just because of the adaptability of biology is this the right intuition that's right if you look around us anything that you see that's naturally produced in nature by biology theoretically we can now engineer it and produce it in any way we want why help me understand why fermentation is such a key element here can you explain that a little bit Yeah so fermentation is the process of converting one kind of molecule into another and it uses that there are different types but the the the primary one uses oxygen in the environment we're we're aspiring right now we're we're breathing in oxygen and we're using the energy in the oxygen to make and break other chemical bonds inside of us and we're breathing out carbon dioxide so that's just a process and that's the same process that goes on inside a yeast cell for example to make alcohol and so how to how I return this fermentation process from from just like this natural thing that happens and then we were able to reprogram it to do insulin how have we turned that into an industry like what what are the next steps along this process to really harness this power so we've turned it into an industry because some of these products are quite difficult to produce in nature or they're very expensive to produce one of the canonical examples is the artemisinic acid which is this molecule that is used to make anti-malarial drug and this is by the work of a guy called Jay kiesling a professor at Berkeley and he started a company called Amorous and amorous biotechnologies made this anti-malarial drug and the way that it's made right now is from this plant called the a tree called the Chinese uh wormwood and you have to extract you have to grow tons of this tree to extract this tiny amount of the drug and so what they did instead was to find the pathway that made this molecule this anti-malarial drug and instead they put it into a yeast cell and now they can just Brew it in a in a brewery instead of having to grow thousands of trees so that that's kind of the principle of of why this thing could be more efficient but if the environment lower cost is by taking that principle of of fermentation and genetic engineering and producing these things via cells rather than things that are much more resource intensive out in in the land so the idea here is like using this fermentation process which we've been able to harness if we find a compound that's out in nature we can take that information back and put it in and put it in part of this process that makes this scalable right so are we constrained to only be able to produce components that we can find elsewhere in nature or can we actually kind of create stuff that's net new without needing to like Source the DNA or the solution elsewhere we can find things that are new so there are it's easier to find things in nature because the there's such a great diversity out there in nature I'll give you one other example which is a company called checkerspot and checkerspot has a platform for the production of oil and oil is being used um industrially bio-based oil there are only a few production platforms for it soybean is one of them Corners is one of them canola is one of the more rapeseed as it's called in Europe and checkerspot is creating a brand new platform and they're using algae as this platform and the algae are taking in CO2 and there and they're spitting out this this oil and what this allows Checker spot to do is to go out into nature now if we if we sequence this plant behind me you would find all sorts of interesting oils in it but this plant isn't very good at producing lots of the oil the algae is good at producing lots of the oil so what do we do we sequence the the genes inside the leaves of this plant we find out this interesting oil that we want we we transfer it Gene edit it or engineer it into the algae and now you've got as much of it as you want and so checkerspot is making these new performance materials from molecules that are found in nature and they've made a set of skis cross-country skis that have performance properties that cross-country skiers have been looking for uh for for you know for decades they can now tune these properties of these materials using things that they find in nature editing them to make them better you know stretchier stronger more resilient so it opens up this whole palette of what's out there in nature and then you can build on top of that um but right now there's so much diversity out in nature that people can use um but people are starting to now look Beyond nature and see what other kinds of things we can come up with yeah I'd like to try and um put some uh like Fast Forward perhaps a little bit in the trajectory of synthetic biology where we're at right now we're talking about pretty granular specific use cases but I want to kind of zoom out and see if we can strike the imagination of listeners about how extensive that this could replace previous systems uh and so the the gista that I've gotten is that we have now this ability to take the best of Nature and nature as a problem-solving mechanism can run circles around humans now humans have our certain capacities we have computers and like the internet and things that we can do with that and that's unique and combining these things is really the world of synthetic biology but nature really can still run circles around producing cool things that we still haven't not able to dream of and so when we extend this out just like beyond the granular what can how can we explain to listeners how revolutionary this is and how scalable this is and how much it impacts the world around us it's a great question and I'm glad you asked it because the rabbit hole that we're we've gone down is is like one percent maybe 0.1 percent of what the future holds for biology the rabbit hole we've gone down is talking about single cells that can produce single molecules or single products right and you are not a single cell right and it you are not a single product you are a body that's made of trillions of cells all connected together all communicating with each other from the neurons that are produced in your brain from the um from the bones that are produced from the calcium that's just in your bones individual organs are Symphonies of cells your body is also a symphony of organs too as well you got it yeah and they're all singing and they're all communicating with each other so what's amazing and this blows the minds of computer science people computer programmers is that inside each of the each of the trillions of cells that you have in your body is the operating system for that cell and it's the same operating system running in every single cell in your body but it's different different subroutines different programs are being run in the cells in your in your eyes to say turn into right cells that can sense uh light turn photons into neurofiring exactly to to the to the cells in your in your fingernails which are saying grow grow some calcium you know some some uh some some molecule to make my fingernail it's the same it's the same genome so these things that evolve you know from from the moment of conception of of the sperm in an egg where you get two copies of the genome half uh one from your mom one from your dad recombine to make the unique molecular properties of you then when they divide and divide and divide in every single cell is the same copy but they're turned on and off in different ways and so now if you imagine well what does the future of biology hold it's not just about picking one gene that's going to make an oil or one gene that's going to make a plastic it's about how can we actually learn to program multicellular systems so that you can imagine you know what does if we wanted to program this iPhone and and make it using biology we could do that we could you could look at all the sophistication that we have in in my body and in my brain we can absolutely think of a biological iPhone as sophisticated as as the machine that it is but then the correct the amazing thing is that iPhone would be able to produce another iPhone I think the the thing that really struck my imagination when I was listening to the talks the other day is that um uh silicon and computers and metal are and that is and they're they're similar in that they have patterns of activity kind of like a brain like computer is a silicon uh brain a brain is an organic computer these are kind of similar and then if you look at the underlying structures of like the neural activity of a brain and compare that to the neural activity of a motherboard like you know which one's which right one has like 90 degree angles one looks like you you just know like the one a motherboard looks like a motherboard a brain looks like a brain it's chaotic the brain and organic is uh the brain's very chaotic and organic and like hard to understand and then the motherboard is very rigid and like very much made in a factory with like you know right human created angles like all this kind of stuff and like the um Imagination that I was able to like uh kind of get what I was listening to these talks is that what's going what's happening here is that we are with what synthetic biology is to me at least my understanding is of it is that we can actually program gram nature the chaotic nature of nature uh using our using our computers but that we can actually understand and harness the organic and efficient ways of like neural network the the neural activity or the way that cells grow and so we can actually like nature seems chaotic to us but to me synthetic biology is that we can actually start to create that chaos in ways that work for us and that ways that we can understand is that is that a fair uh like a summary of this yeah and I'm glad you bought that up because up until now your listeners might be thinking if they know about genetic engineering or bioengineering or metabolic engineering then they might be thinking well what John just described is no different to what we've been doing for the last 40 or 50 years since the discovery of recombinant DNA the ability to to read write an edit edit DNA and they'd be right so what is synthetic biology what's the difference well synthetic biology came about 20 years ago and it was from a group of Engineers coming into biology and saying biology is not an engineering discipline biology is is more discipline of science asking questions about about how things work and so they came up with a name called synthetic biology and I think you're going to have drew Endy speak on your podcast later on and Drew is one of the founders of the field and he's one of the people who came up with with calling it synthetic biology and so I like to say that synthetic biology is a movement to make biology easier to engineer Drew looked at the process that was going on through genetic engineering and bioengineering and he said why does it take millions of dollars to get a product to Market why does it take seven years on average to get a product to Market why when I'm engineering a cell does it take months to iterate through one single cycle of the design build and test Loop in biology and this was 20 years ago now it takes weeks um why is it and it's because nobody has ever put in the investment to say how do we make biology easier to engineer so all the examples that I gave you are wonderful examples of biology of engineering but they're all really expensive and really slow and so nobody Drew said is is looking at the system holistically and trying to turn biology into an engineering discipline when you look at structure engineering or civil engineering or environmental engineering or electrical engineering or software engineering they've all developed into a mature engineering disciplines so that now my 11 year old daughter could write an iPhone out in in a few hours um and we want to be that situation with Biology and so the field is is a movement that has a vision that in the future we're going to be able to program biology as easily as we can program a computer or a motherboard as you said and we're not there where Maybe one percent into that into their ability to do it and what you saw at the meeting this week and at the talks and whenever you see a synthetic biologist talk about it there's this Burning passion that we know what the future right is gonna is gonna be like and we want to get there um and so it's this movement of people who are so passionate about how do we engineer biology um and that then enables and opens up a whole range of possibilities for the future of humanity for the future of manufacturing related to climate change related Equity related to economy which broadly speaking we we call the bioeconomy and that's the big vision for what this all of this will enable yeah um John I think we've we've we tackled the first part of the story which is like talking about how we can re-uh engineer fermentation to make specific cells that we want yeah and then we've also done the other end of this spectrum which is uh talking about like the future Grand Vision of synthetic biology and I think we skipped the middle ground and I want to try and illuminate some of the not not Grand Vision topics of synthetic biology but also more complex in single cells and maybe I can try and start that conversation with like nature does some things really really well that we have found useful for Humanity since the dawn of time we like wood is a very strong structure that we build very big buildings out of and that is biology it's not synthetic biology but it's an indication that Nature's can do some really important things naturally yeah and think about how many trees there are in the world versus how many things grow steel not very many things grow steel we have factories and there's a you know a low number of those in comparison to how many trees there are that are growing growing wood and so like maybe we can start to illuminate some of the the use cases of when we apply synthetic biology to more complex systems than just cells and how that can start to change the landscape and of the world that we live in as any use case come to mind so I've got a couple of examples I could show you in in terms of cement or in terms of uh materials would that be useful to talk about those now so I bought a couple of props with me uh one of uh one of the speakers at the event this year and I'll show it to the camera is uh was Ginger Craig dossier and uh she's with a company called biomason and um so uh we can maybe you can open that up yeah and you can talk about it yeah so this is um this is a pretty rad example it's using microbes to fix cement and concrete so uh this is a this is a a lumper cement that's been uh calcium carbonate that's been fixed using microbes and so if you know anything about the cement industry you'll know and feels like normal cement by the way I wouldn't be able to tell the difference right um this uses five percent of the amount of CO2 that regular cement uses regular cement is one of the most damaging processes in the environment I think it's responsible for I think it's 11 of global CO2 some something around that I think the figure I heard was four times more than the entire airline industry yeah which is nuts because um it's just giving off when you cure cement it's just giving off CO2 all the time so this is uh this is biomason they're not using any genetically engineered microbes in this right now but they have a big program where they're looking at how they can tune the properties of these naturally occurring organisms to make them to make them better and there's a video that Ginger showed in her talk yesterday showing how these microbes just kind of wrap themselves in in calcium carbonate and use it to crystallize and fix other other microbes to make this cement so rather than a chemical process it is a biological one exactly right yeah and all all biology is chemistry ultimately but but yeah this is uh the the kind of catalyst to get this going is a biological one instead of a chemical one instead of using blast furnaces instead of using giant Kilns no sorry blast furnaces is still production Kilns is uh for cement production but incredibly energy intensive yeah I I think the pattern here is that we are learning through synthetic biology to work with with nature rather than brute forcing against nature right exactly in order to make um cement we need this massively 2 500 degree Fahrenheit or maybe Celsius I don't know really really hot uh Kiln in order to just make cement happen yeah with synthetic biology it's more of an organic process like of tree of forest growing it just kind of happens and it happens without much effort and without having to inject energy into it yeah and so it's working in harmony with nature to produce these compounds that we kind of already have but now we have the same the same ones with uh five percent of the energy it took to get there exactly and look around us in nature look at my teeth look how hard they are right is it going to last me hopefully you know another another 60 years um look at the bones in my body look at just being able to regrow things like when when my daughter's tooth came out last week well she's gonna have another one grow and she's and I told her this is the only thing we're only going to get that chance to do it once um so uh but why not why can't you reprogram uh the cells in your mouth to regrow another tooth you totally can well why can't you reprogram um the limbs in your body to grow another one and we heard an amazing talk by Mike Levin about the potential for that as well so yeah there's there's a whole bunch that we're going to be able to do with these living materials and if you think and it sounds like science fiction but remember the size of a pterodactyl remember the the size of a T-Rex I mean biology can grow big things right look at a sequoia tree a giant redwood tree and then compare it to the structures around us well I mean we're in a beautiful location it'd be even cooler if we could have grown this location right and then at the end of its life you know have it maintain itself during the life and then at the end of the life have it go back into the soil and think about that the the again the climate resiliency that we need and the you know this place is beautiful but imagine how much concrete went into building this place right so we can build these beautiful you know imagine an Ewok village right grown from from biology imagine an oak tree or a giant sequoia where the the seed is programmed to grow into this beautiful sofa that we're sitting on is that crazy or is that sci-fi or is that like do we know the steps of how to do that it's crazy it's sci-fi we don't know the steps how to do it but by biology is we are entering the century of biology and chat gbt Dali the iPhone itself the Apple watch these are all pretty sci-fi things if we went back even 20 years ago and I mean we were all imagining it um now it's a reality all of the biologists are know what's what's capable we don't know how to do it right now there are still we still don't know what like 60 of the genes in a single E coli cell do and there's still a ton of communication that goes on between sellers that we don't understand and can't measure but we're getting there and particularly with AI the problem has been that we can't do these Loops of design build tests quick enough to gather enough data many people think we're still at the punch card phase of biology where we're putting in the 60s they were using cardboard Punch Cards to program computers we're about there with Biology right now but in the 20 years that I've been in the field we've seen these giant Leaps and Bounds in our ability to engineer biology and now also you're seeing a ton of tech money come in there was like 18 billion dollars invested in the synthetic biology industry Street in the uh in the in in 2021 um about 10 billion dollars in 2022 um and and I write a Weekly Newsletter we put out an annual investment report so I know the numbers and I see the trends and we're entering the century of biology and our ability to to do this is just speeding up no end yeah you said uh you talked about how we could grow this building or we can grow this couch and that probably threw at least a handful of listeners through a little bit of a tizzy because that's a crazy concept but I want to remind listeners that like the DNA that they have grew them and I think that's really just the idea of synthetic biology is we can reprogram DNA to grow things and because we have this Computing platform that's open to us which is now biology we can create DNA that grows into a couch or grows into a building or I mean maybe it's kind of hard to imagine but that is the vision here is that we we have this very tight packet of data that when you let it grow like a tree it grows into the shape that you want it to become is that that's the idea right yeah and it's it's called programmed pattern formation and it's an area of research and again we're not we're not there yet it is science fiction but uh but I believe that we're going to get there you've got another example over there the a jacket that came from I don't know what it came from maybe you can show it tell us that the story of how this jacket came to be we did not this jacket was not grown uh but parts of it were I think right absolutely so this is a this is a beautiful Adidas jacket we'll do some product placement here free product placement for Adidas but but even more importantly it's made by a a polymer that's made by a company called lanzotec and uh Jennifer Holmgren was the was the speaker and I think she's going to be on the podcast yeah we've had her she's got an episode as well so you'll hear from her soon okay so uh she gave one of these to vitalik buterin uh during the uh the conference yesterday and um so this is one of the one of the products that I love on one of the stories that I love because this is my made from poly polyethylene um and polyethylene is made by lanzotec and Lanza Tech um it's a reversible jacket so it's kind of a it's kind of got a funky uh futuristic uh I think we know which side metallic was wearing exactly exactly so um so Lance attack is doing what we were talking about earlier they're doing fermentation and they're growing things inside of steel mills so steel again through blast furnaces is just producing a ton of CO2 waste CO2 and they're taking the off gas of this CO2 coming from steel mills and they're putting it into their fermenter and they're bubbling this CO2 through the fermenter and inside the fermenter they're growing these specialized organisms and these specialized organisms are feeding off of that CO2 and they are producing a whole number of different molecules they can produce polyethylene like this they can produce ethanol which can be used as fuel they have a partnership with Virgin Atlantic they have another partnership with Alaska Airlines they have another partnership with Lululemon another partnership with Zara the clothing brand so they can have this versatile platform that takes waste gas of CO2 coming out of the power plant bubbles it through these microbes and the microbes now are producing the enzymes from the DNA that's in their genome and turning that CO2 into into this product that we can see here so it's a wonderful story of showing how we can create these circular ecosystems and Jennifer made a good point in her talk yesterday she said we have enough carbon in the atmosphere we do not need to be sucking this up and burning it we do not need coal we do not need oil we can be producing things from the CO2 in the atmosphere and this is a great example of it yeah I think really the message that I got out of that is with synthetic biology in this new like Computing manufacturing platform which is the cell which is biology not only can we customize the outputs but we can also customize the inputs too right and so it doesn't that's the the full the full cycle right that's how we have a cyclical economy a cyclical ecosystem exactly because there's you can compute on both sides yeah and so it's it's the full Suite of possible applications both on the inputs and on the outputs to create the products that we want exactly and let me give you you talked about compute and and a lot of computational people a lot of computer scientists they've heard that biology is programmable I want to give some examples of how biology is programmable and the kinds of things that we might be able to do one is the Circadian rhythm in your in your body we're probably both a little bit jet-lagged having just flown in um and uh you know it's like why am I waking up at 2AM Wide Awake well it's because your body has an oscillator in it a a cycle that goes up and down up and down um telling you when to be awake and when to be asleep and it's all going on because of the way that the molecules bind to The receptors in your brain to tell it now's time for bed and then they release over time and it says now's time to wake up the same thing happens with dopamine and with serotonin the drugs that make you feel happy if you've ever kind of gone through real kind of you know we've been very stimulated the last two days it's just been you know kind of a little bit like okay now I want to chill out because when you go to a conference and and there's just so much stimulation so much coffee or good food or great conversations um or alcohol or what have you well your body's being kind of blasted with all these all these stimuli and you don't want to you don't want to overdo it you so there's systems particularly for dopamine for the reward system where you have a natural cycle and this is you know this is why some people get depressed and some people get into these episodes of of mania is all to do with The Binding of dopamine to the dopamine receptor so you have these oscillators where they bind and then they release slowly and then they bind again and so this is why setting goals in your life is is really important and uh you know I want to do that a simple example is I'm hungry I can smell some food okay my brain is like go towards the food and it puts the dopamine trail out there now as soon as I've eaten gone right I'm not the dopamine is gone I'm not interested in in eating anymore it's an oscillator it's the The Binding of the dopamine to the receptor and then the slow release of it and just to kind of close the loop fully this is why things can be so addictive drugs um gambling sex people can get addicted to these things because they just want more and more and more and and it kind of breaks the natural cycle of the oscillation so it's a simple example of how oscillation Works in terms of setting up a comput computational system inside of a cell of what's really interesting that in the year 2000 there was a an important paper published by by Micah ellowitz at Caltech which showed creation of a synthetic oscillator inside a E coli cell and he produced glowing bacteria fluorescent bacteria that that on this beautiful 20 minute time lapse you can see videos of it online uh made these fluorescent bacteria glow and shrink and glow and go dark and glow and go dark it was just a beautiful example of a very simple pattern that we knew existed written into a gene circuit that didn't exist in the bacteria and program it to do something very simple in an engineered way and that was one of the first examples of synthetic biology it was 20 years ago and on the front page of I think nature or science it said you know the the welcome to the era of synthetic biology beautiful beautiful okay so here we are in 2023 um Place us into the Arc of history of synthetic biology like where where what is this moment that we are currently living in and how can how can listeners expect synthetic allergy to find their way into their lives in perhaps the next few years yeah you know what the I think the term will disappear in in 10 or 20 years just like the term uh you know look at the terms like like uh high tech right look at the terms of Web 2.0 right these things come and go and soon it's just going to be biology it's like well of course this is made with Biology why on Earth would you want to make it with a petrochemical right um well of course we're Antiquated so inefficient exactly it's like it's like really you made this beautiful wooden wooden sofa by cutting up a tree peel the tree exactly yeah um there was a paper like a big announcement last week about uh plants hearing being able to hear plants scream when you when you hurt them I don't know if you heard that no no I did not know that was pretty rad um so uh so yeah I think we're gonna look at things and and the bioeconomy and biotechnology are just going to be integrated into our everyday lives um so I I think that's a really important thing I think the other thing that's important to recognize the reason that we're here the reason why we ran this Workshop this weekend and and the workshop to be clear was on the bio Network State how can we create future network states that are built with Biology because many of us in the synthetic biology industry see the potential of biology and and we see these incumbent Industries like the oil and gas Industries and we see a much brighter future and so a future that's literally built with Biology where we can create economies that link their funding to to scientific advances and particularly the scientific advances of biotechnology and then can use those Technologies to create sustainable economies so for us it's all about sustainability it's all about Equity it's all about the means of production and reducing the impact of climate change and so what we did this last couple of days was bring together the DSi Community the decentralized science Community which is all looking at funding of science publication of science commercialization of Science and how that can be done in an equitable way because all of these systems are broken that the economy is broken democracy is broken science funding is broken publication system is broken peer review is broken all these things are broken and I look at the decentralized Science World and believe that that is a technology blockchain is a technology that can fix it and it can spread out the benefits of these uh of what we're doing to the people who are participating in the network so that's why I'm big on decentralized science the network state I'm big on because I think that solves a lot of the core Tools around our democracy that are broken and then the the tools of synthetic biology in the community of synthetic biology I think has the ability to fix it so that's what I think is is so exciting about the next decade uh is is the combination of all these things coming together to create a better future and one that's built with Biology well John we started at the top of the synthetic biology rabbit Hall and we are ending and you are dropping us off at the network State and DSi Rabbit Hole so thank you for ending us and putting us there because I think that is going to be exactly where listeners are going to hopefully Venture off into these new information Frontier so thank you for for guiding us on the synthetic biology Rabbit Hole I really appreciate it absolutely I'd like to welcome all of your listeners to the conference that we do it's coming up May 23rd to the 25th uh 2023 at the Oakland Marriott and we have a whole section on decentralized science and we have a whole section on all of the other areas of synthetic biology there's about 2 000 people that come together at the conference each year and there's also a Weekly Newsletter so if they want to geek out and we also have actually two in two courses on the first day of the conference one is an introduction to DSi decentralized science and the other one is an introduction to synthetic biology so we're completely welcome to new people coming into our field and and getting excited about what the potential is one more time on the dates in the location it's uh it's uh May 23rd to the 25th in

having me Jennifer I watched her talk this morning and it was extremely inspiring and a lot of the content and conversations that's been going on here at zuzolu is really a systems level thinking and I'm hoping we can start with the problem and the interpretation of the problem that I got from from watching your talk was that the way that we have our materials our Goods our manufacturing and our our energy yeah the basic pattern is that we pull carbon out of the ground to make our widgets to power our planes yeah and then we consume them and if when we need more we pull more out of the ground right and so the to summarize the problem perhaps it's a one-way flow of carbon from the ground into the air yep uh and so can you just elaborate on this problem and and what it means for this world and and we'll eventually get into what we need to do about it absolutely so so the first part of the story of course is that we need a more circular economy right that we need to be able to not do exactly what you said take something out of the ground make it into some something waste some of it along the way and then dump it into the air or into our oceans right because some of the solids end up floating in our oceans it is a systems problem because it's impacting our entire ecosystem and all of the things that are interrelated I think that the most important thing that we can start to do is to say we're going to reuse everything we do we're going to be more like nature naked circular right even a tree will drop a bud and the bud will become the next three right nothing is wasted we waste a lot of things so our view is that we have enough waste carbon above ground that we should just keep reusing that rather than taking more carbon out of the ground and this circular economy approach this new carbon economy if you will will be less wasteful and will stop dumping carbon into our atmosphere helping us with the climate crisis I think one of the the big problems about that problem is the universality of the way that we do this in that all Goods be it Plastics or materials or clothes like pick your industry it's the same problem which means it goes to such like a root level uh to the problem is so deep which means the solution also has to be similarly as deep this the solution needs to be equal or below the problem yeah and so can you talk about this like just design space for making sure we go all the way down to the bottom well first of all I don't think most people know what you started with right that all of this pollution all of these things that we have actually come from fossil carbon most people don't know that that's where the tennis shoes come from right um and so I think the first thing we need to do to have a system solution is to really say look people need to understand where everything comes from everybody knows Power Fuels come from fossils but what about things and and then we just need to be conscious of that but I think then the next layer is okay if we're going to make all these things and we can't make them from fresh fossil carbon what am I going to make them from and and that's where I think new technologies that can use waste carbon things that you would call pollution like we use Industrial Waste we use solids like trash that's where it all comes in right is is that but if you're going to use waste you have to use distributed system right there's not enough ways to aggregate in a massive refined relocation if you're going to use waste you need to be very selective because you don't want to put too much Steel in the ground in these distributed systems that's too expensive and that's where biology has a fundamental Advantage biology is selective biology can handle inhomogeneity like in waste and therefore biology is ideally suited for a new carbon economy where we use pollution already above ground to make everything right so going back to that original one-way flow of carbon uh what you're saying is it's biology that takes is the missing piece of the path that goes from a one-way flow to a circular flow can you just elaborate on that well I think I don't think biology is the only thing that can do this but I think biology can have a big role to play and you know biology is very selective okay when you use biology you make one product and you make exactly the product you want and so what that means is that you can go from a waste resource and make only one product which helps you with economics if you're making a variety of products it gets very expensive to then continue to process and continue to process so biology is important and I think the second and perhaps even most important part of why biology will help us here is biology handles chaos really well it's like you're driving down the street and there's a scar here and this car here and you know this guy is going to cut you off and you can maneuver around it and you know waste is chaotic and so the ability to interpolate the ability to think across things as they change like a waste feed stock Will Change is Gonna enable is going to be enabled by biology processing those inhomogeneous feedstocks biology will help yeah so just to really um say that in different words to make sure I understand it's like you said waste is not homogeneous it's it's different like what you throw in the trash yesterday is going to be different from what you throw in the trash tomorrow and that is true on a Global Perspective absolutely and so the solution of making sure that we actually recapture our own Goods needs to be able to account for that chaos and you're saying that biology is good at accounting for that chaos exactly exactly organisms living organisms adjust and so they can handle chaos okay so let's go into some specifics because we're talking about like uh very large we're zoomed out and I want to zoom in a little bit uh lonza Tech and this actual biological solution what is it yeah okay that's a great question so um we ferment gases okay so you used to making beer out of sugar right which used we make beer out of carbon dioxide you know waste gases antibacteria and we've developed a very efficient way of doing that and so literally we have gas in to our bioreactor bacteria eats it and basically produces ethanol quite efficient ethanol ethanol yes and we've made that from Ferro alloy gases they're waste gases and paralleloid Mills waste gases and Steel Mill These are gases that would normally go up into our atmosphere as particulate emissions and CO2 we're preventing that from happening so the first application of your company lonzotec is in um like Mills like large scale factories yeah so we're going first for the industrial gases and the reason for that is you can just take an industrial gas and put it in a bioreactor if we wanted to use household waste or trash we have to turn it into a gas and that costs more money and so you know when you're doing a new technology you need to get down the cost curve and you do it in the cheapest way possible so you've gone out to these large Scout factories that are producing the gas because that's your input they're making their output is your input exactly and we put our plant right there right so we we don't want to move these gases they're already waste right and we don't want to clean them up and move them around so we just put our technology right there right so it's like a little like Plug-In or an add-on to a different somebody else's Factory and that is your input do you work are you just uh uh do you buy their gas or how does that work yeah so so you know if you use something like carbon monoxide it has residual energy and so you pay for the gas at its energy value right um and typically we pay for the gas we we pay for the land we pay for the utilities you know power Etc and and away we go but in many cases we license our technology so we put our Factory up to your factory but you build it you own it you make the product you use it so we use different approaches but typically most of our partners today have licensed the technology so it's actually their plan we're plugging in a plant that becomes their plant into their plant okay system so you capture their their exhaust yep and then it goes into a fermentation system yeah to produce ethanol yeah and this is this is the beautiful thing about a thinking in a systems level solution is that the fermentation is the biology part right yep and so uh this this works for all all these generic gases that are coming out of power plants and then out your system and your technology outputs ethanol yes and then yeah and then we take the ethanol and using no own Technologies with known Partners we take that ethanol and make things like the jacket you saw today we make polyester like for Zara dresses detergents for Unilever so basically what we're doing is we're taking that ethanol and not using it just to blend with gasoline um because hopefully there won't be that many gasoline cars in the future but also it becomes a raw material right the ethanol is an intermediate to make sustainable aviation fuel to make materials to make things we need yeah so is it fair to call like ethanol does a very basic building block that is in so much of our world it's actually ethylene so ethylene is the very basic building block it's the largest used chemical today and it's the raw material for almost everything we use from foam to polyester to plastic and so what we're doing is displacing that by using a recycled carbon ethanol that ethanol is converted to Ethylene quite easily actually and then the ethylene is used for everything yeah and it really becomes obvious how deep we are in this stack where we have carbon output from exhaust from a plant going into a carbon another carbon output yeah that's not a gas anymore but is now an actual solid exactly and that it becomes and there's uh what we're what I'm learning about is that this ethylene is the building block because it's I'm assuming also very deep in in like the the carbon stack as in it's a part of so much because it's such a useful compound absolutely absolutely it's it's it's one of the key raw materials for all of the things we use and and so we're just finding a different way to make it some waste carbon to a key wrong material that is used to make everything we need yeah viewers or listeners of this podcast are at a slight disadvantage because when I was watching your talk this morning you were able to put up a slide that had all of these use cases and it was uh you also brought this Adidas jacket that was made from from uh from this process that we're talking about and then there was perfumes there was jet fuel and I think maybe even just like listing these use cases is also kind of missing the point because the idea is that it's generalizable for everything right it did it is the world around us absolutely I think that's a great way to think about it and and you know you have to get past the yuck factor this was going to be something disgusting that was going into our atmosphere and instead it's this beautiful Zara address right and um you get past that and then you realize well why aren't we just using all of the carbon that's already above ground and recycling it and I think that that's really the message and and the system is that we've knocked our planet a little bit out of whack because we have this linear economy and mother nature is not linear at all so we just need to be more circular and be more like nature and not waste anything and we'll get ourselves back in equilibrium and so the I'm assuming just because it made raw business sense you start by plugging in your technology and your factories into other people's factories to capture that because that's just easy but the next step is to capture other materials and I'm assuming can you take us out on that path sure so so we can look at things like taking trash from a municipal solid waste site and converting that and we've done that we've done single apparels so like shoes we've converted shoes back to material that could be turned into shoes again and we've got a relationship with Bridgestone trying to go from tires back to tires because tires there's a lot of wasted tires out there you see a lot of trash that has tires so so those are the types of use cases with solids we also are doing a use case in India on agriculture waste you know they normally burn the fields in India creating a lot of pollution and here instead of burning the field we're gonna take that prod you know that waste Agri residue put it in a gas fire convert it to a gas and then convert it to ethanol very cool very cool yeah and so how does this scale out to the world and so maybe we can talk about the economics of this solution and just the overall plan of uh taking this from just a few factories to all the factories and to everything else like carry us forward for the next like 10 years or so well it's a little bit like solar right and and cellular phones right you start with some very expensive units these units are under order from 50 to 150 million dollars each so it's very Capital intensive but um the more you build the cheaper they get because you learn how to make them cheaper so we've done a tremendous amount of work in reducing the amount of metal we use when we build these plants and making the process more efficient right we're just at the beginning nobody had ever done gas fermentation so we're just at the beginning of the learning curve and so I kind of think of it as as you go from one to two to three and then eventually you you get to 25 or 30 and then they really just start going exponentially everywhere because you reduce the cost and you made it efficient and you made it easy for people to use right the first time you build something like this a bit clunky so you also improve that and make it easier for a lot of people to to run it are there any specific big obstacles in in the way like what what are the big uh why aren't we there yet for example or is it just a matter of time I think it's just a matter of time um I don't think there are any major hurdles there's no like regulation there's no like resistance from nation state stuff there's no incumbents well there's always incumbents right that don't want you to do this and everybody wants to compare your approach to the incumbents and this isn't going to scale the way an oil refinery will scale because waste is distributed and so you always get a lot of negativity around whether distributed systems can work but you go through that with everything we've been talking about here do distributed systems work quite frankly when you see success of farm to table and all of these other things those are all just distributed systems we're all just learning to create shorter Supply chains right rather than these massive centralized structures certainly yeah and and uh I think one of the cool things that I saw from your slide is idea that this technology I mean just technology right it can be in Asia it can be in in Africa it can be in America it could be South America and that's really where we go and and because we have to fight this front wherever we pull out carbon instead there needs to be this technology yep um and I'm wondering if we can just like end this end this uh interview at the very beginning which is going back and talking about cells and the fermentation yeah it's so crazy that that's such a small part of this conversation I'm just like oh we just ferment we just ferment it yeah how it's crazy that that it's that simple can you talk about just like let's go back to the biology because I'm on uh my the listeners of this podcast will understand I'm a big plant guy I've got a lot of plants in my apartment okay yeah and so like the fact that this is a biological process I think is just extremely compelling uh how why why did it take us until like 20 well I'm sure you've been working on this for quite a long time but why haven't we discovered the science sooner and is it really that magical that's a good question so I'm gonna say you know there's a lot of things we have to do to make it work right so we had to really optimize the bacteria it actually normally makes acetate not ethanol we have to optimize it to make a product we wanted to sell we had to develop a bioreactor so you know sugar soluble in water right you know so yeast can grab it and eat it and make ethanol these gases are not soluble in water so one of the tricks of the trade is actually the bioreactor the engineering work that goes around the house that bacteria and make it happy and make it grow and then the third thing is how do you wrap a whole process around it to make it cheap you know you're not going to pump this bacteria full of vitamins because if you do it's going to be too expensive and the process will be too expensive we recycle the water we do all these things it took us 17 years to get to where we are so it it's a lot of work and and it's something by the way that everybody said couldn't be done everybody said you people knew about gas from taste you can't scale gas fermentation well we did and um with some time yeah exactly we kept working at it and we had a lot of very smart people both in the biology side the engineering side and we got it to work Jennifer maybe we can just put on our sci-fi Storyteller hat here and what does the world look like in 20 years when this technology and Industry just becomes the status quo tell us about this potential Utopia that awaits us well I I think it's Utopia in that that we need to get to Giga tons of of you know we need to prevent gigatansa carbon from getting in our atmosphere and I think the only way we're going to do that is if we make a conscious choice that whether with our technology or other technology our technology is not going to save the world we need a collection of Technologies and and and we imagine Technologies where everything is recycled we imagine that you're not going to throw your shoe away You're gonna send it back to the store and it's going to be turned into another shoe and different business models different ways of thinking about how we use things how we dispose of them that's my Utopia is there's no such thing as as waste we like to say welcome to the post-pollution Future Jennifer thank you so much for guiding us there I appreciate you coming on and giving us your time it was a true pleasure thanks for asking me foreign [Music]
