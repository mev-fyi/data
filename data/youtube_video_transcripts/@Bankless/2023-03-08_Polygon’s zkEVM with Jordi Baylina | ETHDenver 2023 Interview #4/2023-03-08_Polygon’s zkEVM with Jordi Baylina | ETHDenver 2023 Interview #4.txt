[Music] thank you we are at the axelr interoperability series and next up in this conversation we are talking to Jordy of the ZK evm used to be ZK Hermes but then it was acquired by polygon to make the ZK polygon evm which is now one of the hottest wars in the layer 2 space so that's what's coming up next right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you're a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of D5 where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrum the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the eth layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrim is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview bengalization we are at the interop summit and I'm talking with Jordy from polygon Hermes Jordy how's it going my man very good very excited to be here in December you know it's uh it's an important event in the year absolutely and we I managed to snag you right before we are going on to uh to talk at a panel uh what's that panel about what are you going to talk about well we are not talking very much about connecting roll ups you know this year is going to be the year of Roll-Ups we're also seeing and we are going to be talking about how we connect all these Roll-Ups and how we create this community we keep the ethereum community uh together sample so that's uh that's going to be probably the most the biggest topic on the panel but we'll see yeah yeah and there's a big conversation going on of course it was at the interop conference there's also interrupt between layer twos and I think is this about specifically interoperability between ethereum layer twos or is this even broader than that I think it's about layers but I mean to any discussion here I'm not that I'm not the moderator yeah so so uh Jordy uh was polygon the first eke evm uh I mean it's just seeing the first and and so we are not even the first yet so we are gonna launch a mainnet uh on on the on on on on on March 27 is everything goes okay uh and this is not oh it's something important Milestone but it's not the only Milestone so it's like we will launch this in minute it's gonna be a better uh it's a lot of improvements needs to be done we still need to add a lot of pre-compiled smart contracts we need to grow in the scalability so this is not a matter of who's first whose life okay I know that marketing people they love this stuff but this is content producers also live by the way yeah and this is but this is not about that you know this is about building here we are a strong Community many projects that we are trying to scale ethereum each one is building the you know the the solution they believe anymore we are experimenting we are learning a lot and and we are moving forward on that direction the evolution uh we as a community with it in the last two years uh has been huge and uh but still a lot of things to do in all you know in all the sides so I mean we are going to be the first pro we're going to be the first in having a complete uh what's called compatible uh um ebm ckbm uh in mainnet in production open to everybody and with uh uh zero zero friction for the users where you can use so I think it's an important it's a very Advanced system what we are going to launch but again it's it's an important Milestone but it's just a milestone yeah so when um Business Development people or Builders or even just users what questions do they frequently ask you what's the frequently Asked question when they come up to you and talk about the polygon ZK evm all sorts of questions but questions about the scalability how the Roll-Ups will scale if uh you know and compatibility what if this is going to be compatible or not what can be done things about that availability there is a lot of dopes still in the community there it's a new thing system so it's normal right the people don't um fully understand how everything uh how everything works all together there are some confusions we are trying to clarify some confusions last week in Twitter I was just trying to qualify for example things about scalability no the the approver is not the limitation on the scalability okay this is one of the topic okay but things about the sequencer when we are talking about a centralized sequencer what that what that what it means okay that doesn't mean that's uh yeah it's centralized but it's not you can you can you can still have uh some properties of the centralization like like a censorship resistance and uh there's a lot of things that we need to explain and uh hold this how this works so walk us through the timeline for the polygon CK evm when when will I be able to go play on it so right now you can already play it you know it's a test net it's been running for it has been running for uh um we next week well tomorrow if everything works okay we probably will do a Regenesis of this test net it's like Regenesis is when you like shut it down start it back up again and that's and that's now it's mainnet yeah it's going to be very close not what should be in Maine we're still running the final outage and finding even now just finding things security is a huge topic the thing is this is the the well it's the thing that's have more concern on that again we are doing we're spending a lot of effort inside the team and outside the team on on on on that and it's everything again if everything works uh as it should uh we should launch on on March 27 this beta version of uh of a maintenance and what is that better beta version mean like what's the difference it's mainnet but it's the first main ad deployment so expect that there is bugs there respect that it is the first version okay it's fake that we are probably going to change things in there so it's a it's an important step because at some point you need to launch and at some point it's like training wheels training wheels we are going to start with the training wheels one um we are going to have a kill switch no it's we're gonna remove that as soon as we can but it's going to be a kill switch it's going to be you know it's going to be some Central points uh on there we are trying to keep uh you know as prevent as plenty fun as safe as possible there is always a risk it's important that the people understand that this is in our first versions first versions of anything it's easier to have bugs we are you know we're running we run it a lot of audits we run it internal audits we are going to run a back Bounty we're gonna continue running audience we will spend as much as we can on security we need to to to to to to to to launch this just to to spin up this and to to to have this in production uh we'll see so it's it's an important it's a step it's an important step it's a step that at some point we have to do but the people that's using these uh this network needs to understand sure uh what they are using and what's uh what's the status uh of this network so it's that's why it's important to say that this is a beta that is the first version that please pick out shows on how you are using that uh or that I think it's important the users understand what it is don't go crazy you know don't do some airdrops billionaire eye drops or staking or whatever in there okay because I don't want to cure it's a lot of mistake it's not only polygon steak it's also the ecosystem mistake and the theory mistake so here we should not go crazy in in in in this new technologies uh that just uh out of the oven uh uh either could you help me understand what does it mean to have a bug in a ZK evm I think that's the whole ZK world's a new frontier for all of us and for the non-technical people like me when you say like oh there could be bugs what what kind of bugs could there be so here we categorize the Box in four four four categories okay and uh let me explain let me just name the four first one is a smart Contour box just normal smart contract this is normal thing no not at the protocol layer this is then we have uh the others are in the proverb box okay the proverb will have three three types of marks we have the uh correctness bags we have the soundness bags and then we have like uh situation where you cannot proof it's like a stop stop the problem it's not it doesn't move forward okay so that's another kind of box of these three of course the smart contracts is any other smart contracture that's a technology we know about so that's a known quantity yeah yeah exactly so but here the the most critical one is the correctness one right correctness one means that you are executing a normal transaction and maybe at the final distance section you get an infinite amount of ether right that's something that would be a bug and it will be a really a bad bank because we could not do very much okay but we could press the kill switch right in the magnet if we see that and just try to avoid the the the the withdrawal to have some mechanisms to monitor that and so on but it's it's it's it's uh this is a really hard but here we need to say here that I'm quite confident uh with this uh with this kind of ax because we pass all the ethereum tests on all that theory of tests that applies okay so the statute test about the smart contract that we are not implementing of course this doesn't pass but that's not because there is a problem right okay but for the relevant uh test all the relevant tests to the ckvm which is our which are the most most of them they are passing so this means that the the correctness of the of the protocol is is very well uh proven sure okay of course there are some still some specific things on the IBM that you don't have never the 100 warranties okay but here I'm quite confident that this uh this correctness together with all the audience and all together we should be okay on that but again uh never 100 like smart or drugs you never are 100 confident uh on that but the degree of confidence is I would say is high enough to to to to launch in a innovator then we have uh soundness sourness is I mean this is probably the one that time it's so it's the one that's easier to be so it's very easy that we find some saltness error we did a lot a lot of work just checking on that but we find a lot of them so it's easy that maybe there is there are some more that that we find in the future for this okay this is we need to move forward and try to find them and and move but the good thing of this box is that if one of these bugs is in the system the the user will not lose phones right so we are going to be at the beginning the the only proverb and we are not gonna prove something wrong so it's uh literally is uh impossible or very difficult to for one of these errors to to impact in the in a user funds the problem the system will become centralized so the idea is a the system for Max and centralization we probably will have to update to upgrade the smart contract but the user will not impact in the user phones or something like that as far as we are trusted which is not we are building okay so that's right that's why it's important to go through all the uh all these bags and find all of these Southeast bikes so it's important to to to to go to all these sound spots but from the main Network launch perspective this is less critical right because these these ones and the last one is that that you just stopped the network right and here is just a timeout so if the network is stopped for six months and the network will just hold and we'll just upgrade the contract so like soundness uh but this would be a maybe a bigger impact but more in the operation because the network maybe would be stopped for maybe one week so what's the timeout right uh on that but that would be the impact so it would not in one week the we just upgrade the smart contract and the users prove it will continue running and there is a good color so these are the four uh categorizations of the Mac I think I explained you very much the concerns and the hear the balances and the trade-offs uh for launching um I think it's important here to be very very very transparent and explain is uh very clear especially for early users but again this is you know we need to move forward on that you know if we need to wait but this is this happens to any blockchain project so if you need to wait to be 100 sure that your system is safe you will never launch right yes but in the other side you can also not you know you cannot be crazy you cannot launch things that right you know that's the probability of being bugs are going to be high so here finding the right trade-off on when you launch uh what's this how much did you minimize the risk this is I would say probably this is the most difficult decision making that any blockchain project right needs to take at some uh at some point and this is where we are right now in in in polygon certainly well I really appreciate all that thought process and the idea of just some natural balance between Order and Chaos comes to mind where you can't be too ordered because you'll never launch but you definitely can't be chaotic because that doesn't go in crypto uh they'll and the bankless metaphor of this is the frontier also comes to mind and so uh you know to the rewards go the Bold but also you don't want to be too bold because you might die and never come back and so Jordy I know you got to talk to run to so I appreciate all of your time and watch us through the polygon ckm evm I really appreciate it it's a pleasure cheers foreign
