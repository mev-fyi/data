good start welcome everyone to top signal top signal is the crypto show that brings you the same guests and personalities that you know from the podcasts and shows that you listen to in the videos that you watch but instead of information data and analysis top signal is entertainment comedy and live ship hosting keeping up with crypto is work and top signal is not that the only rule we have on top signal is that there is no fact checking everything you hear on this show by the guests or the host is in a superposition of a [ __ ] post a factual statement psyops or perhaps the world's greatest alpha we don't know because we won't check i'm david hoffman here with my penguin co-host michael wong and we are helping we are here to help serve you crypto comfort comfort food we have a great show lined up for you guys today none other than cyrus unesco former head of risk at maker dow now just a yield farmer leighton cusack founder of pool together currently in the pool and of course last but not least alexandra botez chess streamer extraordinaire who's about to wipe the floor with all of us here on this stream and not long every important role of a referee on this show is of course michael wong welcome all three guests to the show thank you for being here yes thank you everybody so yeah thanks for having me before we get started with this chest which is going to be a fun little atypical format called hand versus brain we'll we'll get to those details here shortly uh the teams are going to be me me and alex for cyrus and leighton and before we get that started uh cyrus what makes you think that you can go up against alex in the chess like what uh no i mean it's not that i can go up against her i just think that uh you're gonna drag your team down so substantially though it's gonna level up i would definitely do me and leighton so that's really awesome serious the correct answer is because i'm on your team [Laughter] for the record uh cyrus and i have played chess against each other he wins about 70 of the time but it's really because i've been i got a beer on the side so yeah you've been waiting for the right moment to strike back and now it's going to happen in front of an audience yeah live live audience yeah the stakes are real this time look folks we got just to remind everybody we got alexandra botez you're wondering why is the chess superstar on the new bankless show top signal it's because she's almost you know still wondering the same thing just when i was checking discord a moment ago but listen it's because she she's just entering um the ethereum space as well as a media producer um with her new show and i just wanted to give that a quick shout out and thank you alexandra for joining us on top signal today we appreciate it yeah thanks for having me michael don't forget to send over that um penguin nft after that you promised as my appearance so i i guess i gotta do what she says now okay let's play let's let's do this like fast and the fears okay we're playing for pink slips we're paying for penguins today folks uh david why don't you give us a quick intro to uh what how what the format of the game is today yeah so chess is usually played one verse one uh but today we have four players and it's gonna like i said it's gonna be me and alex versus cyrus and leighton and we are going to do a hand and brain format and so one of the two team members on the same side is the brain one of the other team member is the hand the brain says the name of a piece and not a specific piece but just a piece such as pawn or bishop and then the hand has to pick up a pawn or a bishop and then they make the move uh and so the decision as to how the game is played is split roughly down the middle between the two team members uh and that will hold true for the whole game uh and then we will uh after somebody wins probably us me and me and alex then we will sw swap and play another game and then me and alex will win and there will be no need for a tiebreaker uh so that's roughly how this is going to go down uh and are there any questions aren't there isn't there history with you and cyrus and chess um and and if there is what is that history uh yeah like i said cyrus b has beat me like 70 80 of the time i think we played like eight eight games a lot yeah i was drinking so so you know drink drinking yeah i thought that makes you better yeah alexandra says alexandra says so um wait alexandra i actually have a question for you um do you recommend the better person is the hand or the better person brain uh the better person should would have an advantage if they're the hand because they can fix somebody's bad moves hmm right most of the time um nice one well do you guys do you guys like playing for anything any stakes you know just uh to make it a little bit more interesting or is this a nice yeah we should definitely play we should definitely play for a penguin yeah i was going to say this [Laughter] the winners the losers have to send some some freaking nft to each of the each of the um of the winners it doesn't matter whatever the frick you got a dick but a freaking if denver stupid you know whatever i don't know yeah that's why it's gonna be worth a lot i didn't mean that excuse me yes um bless those so you know losers you're sending nfts over to the winners today all right let's do it let's do it all right mike can you sit on your screen i'll do that i was just watching like a bunch of videos of alexandra b and you know the old dudes you think about in new york city that are just out there just grinding chess out alexander's beating those dudes i don't know why leighton and uh cyrus have agreed to this but let's watch uh okay i sh should we not be listening to you oh why is this oh oh no we are you're commentating yeah oh yeah that's what i'm doing today that's my only role um is to provide some color commentary where helpful so yeah all right i'm gonna start the games then all right uh wait uh we need to decide who's who um uh wait the advantage is the hand okay so i'm the brain uh alex i'm the brain um i i think we should swap maybe for this one you could be the hand and then for the next one i'll be the hand okay all right because the hand also has to be playing so there we go fair enough i'm hand for this one okay cool yeah your brain your brain okay cool all right let's do it dodgeball all right so white needs to make a move or you're gonna lose a bit of time there oh so we're playing to a bad start we're playing five plus five yeah did you did you see the game okay here i'll set it up again i got i got it i got it yeah you got all right gary let me move cyrus give me a move am i on the wrong one dave am i sharing the wrong thing uh here yeah i don't think again well i'm not i'm not saying leighton moved the lane it's going to be yeah yeah i don't have the right one though [Music] or let me ch oh is there a new one in chat okay give me one i got all right i got it yep i'm all right okay so it's our turn so uh knight wait mike you gotta find the right move or the right game i'm clicking the one which is the one that you sent me in the in the dm um michael you should really click slash follow pawn in brooklyn if you just type that out then it will oh you have it right here it's in a different tab got you i see i'm just talking about chess.com great oh okay here we go yeah all right all right okay uh let's do a night here we go there we go here we go we're in the game we're deep in the game now and i'll add a little bit of time for that there we go okay off to the races hi are you feeling good so far david i feel pretty good this is an opening i'm comfortable with all right let's do it what do you call this opening uh this is called the sicilian yeah okay there you go i do you get a lot of probably okay yeah no never mind we won't go there right now no please where are we gonna go i was gonna say you probably get you probably get um you're probably tired of this queen gambit talk oh is this the right pawn move oh i don't know everything you do is the right move just do it with confidence we're gonna win don't worry david you're kidding me it's too early in the game to ask that question even if it's not the right move i don't know if they'll know how to punish it so fair enough um let's do pawn michael as much as you can just try to distract alex please okay i can do this take a look take a look at the penguin don't don't think about anything but the penguin right now bishop so uh why why are the penguins so popular right now that's a fantastic question if you know i answered the question i do uh tonight i think i i think it lies in the fact that you know i when i showed my mom this when i first found out about it she was like these are so cute she didn't even know what the heck they were and she wanted one she didn't even know about nfcs or anything so i just think they're so cute they were really cheap for a while and uh yeah what do you say what do you say if you want a castle you just say castle king i think you say king yeah uh let's make a bishop move oh beautiful wow you've been you've been making all the right moves all right yeah there you go all right that's all we needed from the show ladies and gentlemen we're done where are you guys all playing from by the way from the i'm in san diego at the moment oh oh i have a great perfect one i am in italy oh wow what time is it it's 2 30 in the morning prime chess hours layton excellent yeah so that's another thing do you know what better things to do you should play chess 2 a.m in italy what's going on um well the thing was hang on do you oh man yeah i definitely do wow what does he want me to do tension in the middle of the board i think stop burning time probably um razzled by the bishop wrassled by the [ __ ] let's do a king move it's too late for a bomb cloud huh it is but if you want we could we can go for it next game the power is yours as the brain to tell [Laughter] cyrus what's going through your head right now buddy sarah how am i doing tell me how you're doing great you're doing great i'm doing terrible so no you're not let's lower self-confidence cyrus we're a team that's impossible yes that's exactly what i was thinking wow absolutely same person so far does that mean incredible i've been playing at like a 2000 level whatever or whatever you're at yeah what's your chest rating at chess.com alex on which category but my blitz is probably like 21.50 right now ah nice it's it's gone down that's really good those of you for those of you who are watching who don't understand chess that's like really really good yeah yeah if you saw my i'm really embarrassed i was flashing my 500 whatever but i was showing the wrong screen for a minute for a minute i should what i should feel embarrassed i do no no you guys need to do a move oh yeah i saw her move oh yeah sorry sorry um it's working leighton i gotcha bishop only one of those developing chili oh wait no just kidding there's more there's a different uh rook hmm what is the commentator penguin sitting in the process [Laughter] bishop bishop oh uh okay all right who here i call real real talk who here on this call owns a thing i don't know penguin yeah that's been made apparently discord and i feel bad for you i don't know i've been i've been off i've been offline for the last two weeks because i got married oh yeah you you have congratulations i hadn't thank you i hadn't yeah i heard a penguin and i was just like yeah it's probably a bit of a shock to come back to or actually you're not even back to just kind of clocking back into some hotel wi-fi uh yeah dude you got to tap in i know cyrus has one in his open seat somewhere it's just it's just chilling right now bishop osiris is clocked in bro i can't i can't crack cyrus right now either or maybe it's just his wi-fi oh yeah i can't i can't hear him either uh let's do a let's do a rook move move yeah this is hard this is hard it's hard doing it this way hand in breaking you don't know what your opponent is trying to do i don't even know what my teammate's trying to do yeah yeah sorry that's what i meant to say okay let's do a um let's do a pawn move oh no i'm scared oh man i'm scared for you bro i'm so old i'm scared for you options here okay cool okay dude okay not bad i'm happy with that one i didn't want to lose the e5 pawn i was actually thinking rook to e8 instead of rook to c8 um but now we save the pawn and you know it's all good yeah and i always think read the book chapters that's okay um that's i i thought of that after i made that move i was like that's probably what he meant so yeah just so you know i i did eventually get the right answer that's perfect just for the record oh man um queen was all was that joke worth all that time leighton it wasn't it was it definitely was not uh yeah i guess you're taking too much time that's a nice move though um thank you i needed that very very nice move uh let's make a pawn move oh no no oh boy not again so many pond moves oh god we're going for it she's disappointed dude i'm sorry for you i feel the tension in the air right now that was beautiful that's what i wanted that was the tricky part of anything she's so nice that's not true okay night moves oh there's only one of those hmm yeah i like it we're we're kind of messing up our pawn structure but it's a little bit fun we have some ideas it's it's very fun wild and free yeah yeah yeah yeah is it called the fun defense exactly let's see cyrus is in deep thought both of them are in deep thought leading with his hand over yep bishop what do you say oh yeah sorry i'm talking over you guys go ahead oh i don't like that in the slightest oh yeah a lot of tension in the center of the board uh let's do a pawn move okay cool we're kicking the bishop out quick with it all right let's see bishop again it's getting tense a minute on the clock night oh yeah your clock is fine guys um okay uh let's do a king move nice i just wanted to get out of the pin of the bishop on v3 yep out of the pin defending the pawn yep yep david knew that david knew that david knew even more than that david's a great work wow look at cyrus's face right now let's do rook the great thing is that leighton and i are actually really evenly matched on chess.com he's 10.94 and i'm 11 19. oh wow and what is cyrus no but that is wait 1094. i'm not queen do you think let's do this like on 1094. this is because i never play this i never play this type of chess okay bro that's like my default okay bro i don't know what to do wha what time format do you guys usually play against each other uh me and cyrus usually go ten minutes i think no we need ten minutes okay there's a lot of pressure you go tracy's oh nice all right so this works a trade can help here they have thirty two i don't think i don't think i have any options uh the queen pawn bishop oh my bishop oh my gosh it's all going yes yes nice oh man the scene is set folks the scene is set broke rook i'm nom nom there you go she is composed right now so she must see every single every single thing is about to just be said rook over and over again it's all you david it's just rookies there's only rooks on the table that's so funny that's a funny part of this game yeah [Laughter] king mixing it up look at that little cubby nice nice yeah that's a nice cubby you're posted up right there oh [ __ ] uh okay yes yes yes so nice oh man she's impressed by the move dave i'm so impressed that was awesome she thought you were going to e1 yeah you thought you were going to e1 for sure rock crack king rook king rook oh god oh no oh i can't i don't know how to finish it we got a runner we got it yeah the end game is tough for dave this is not good dave is razzled in the end game all he could hear is rooks in his ear what will he do did you say i didn't hear you right yeah brooke you know you know the drill uh bro beautiful [Applause] let's go [Music] that was amazing but i will say david why does your chess.com profile photo look like you took it in a college dorm uh it was the first apartment that i was in after college yes okay that's not what does it have to do with over here i actually remember i was pretty i was on my way out of uh this is gonna be a terrible story i was on my way out of the apartment that we were pre-gaming in to go to the bars and i was getting in an uber and i had a chess game going on my phone and for some reason i decided to snap a pic and put it at my chest.com profile picture i love it i love it yeah there's a good story behind it this is no it's a terrible story all right i think we have time to run that back um all right let's flip the switches so if your hand you're gonna be head um i think cyrus we're excited to see what you're gonna do as hand sir um yeah very methodical as hell but you're also on me do i need to be controlling a mouse though or can i just like verbalize my moves to somebody [Music] um we can you can verbalize them if you want and i can i feel like it's gonna be a lot easier if you're controlling a mouse yeah you're right so then you have that pop into a game i do have an account but do i gotta pop into a specific game um just make sure you're in chess.com live and tell me your username and i'll put the game on boom that's simple yeah that's that's how you know that's how you know we're with a professional that's right yes i put my play to it's my username this is also a good username king cyrus dude we got a king we got king cyrus with pawn in brooklyn uh you put in the zoom chat right yeah i'm definitely using my phone as it's king cyrus one three four okay you're killing it too cyrus one two three four one two three three four one three four okay okay cool um and make sure you guys are following him and then you'll see it oh accidentally i accidentally put a rated game i am not ready to take that risk oh come on i'm not playing with my rating has gone down enough um didn't i'm not thinking about i'm glad we didn't put a penguin on this game penguin costs about six thousand dollars right now that's a lot no it's it's a chunk it's a chunk of change for sure it's so yeah yeah yeah yeah but we suppose hey wait somebody gotta send nfcs to david and and uh i don't know if we're gonna pull it off all right david whenever you're ready for a move okay uh okay all right uh i need to flip the word how do i do that there we go okay you're wasting time pawn okay i needed to flip the board to come to that conclusion all right taking notes here wow okay i love how you put your punk even as your chest.com avatar he did that he did that two seconds ago you can use those avatars on call that's a great idea in fact i i would like an nft for the for different matches that i've won too that'd be cool do i just sabotage alex and just like pawn over and overtake him let's see it oh sorry pawn pond pond pond i was half expecting you to bong cloud but it's too late now is this called the sicilian here what's happening on white uh white is playing a queen's pawn so sicilian is against king's pawn but it looks kind of like it because it's kind of the opposite with the pawn on f5 and d4 quite quite oh wait it's our turn uh all right let's go at night all right i was thinking that dave great choice great choice yeah that was great that was great i'm mixing it up i'm putting the knight on the side yeah that's what i say if that was really great why is the knight all the way along let's go knight let's go night cyrus cyrus just as dialed in as hand as you want one okay let's bring this pawn to the center oh yeah there you go i like those pawns uh um bishop i mean david you played like the first game so well i have no fear here uh okay cool this is why he wants to use this i'm just racking up this is the only reason he wants to do this episode is so he could get these comments on free i'm gonna send him right to the clip editor too hey get this one get this one and it's just going to be alexandra compliments let's do uh which one will it choose uh pawn okay digging the pawn moves all right uh bishop you just see the white meter just go down pawn oh man bye bye bishop see you later yeah we have the bishop here you know our knight's on the side but that guy is going to get into the game later all right he's posted up he's supposed that he's chilling he's on the right side that's for sure why do you guys decide to do the podcast oh sorry it's archer youtube instead of twitch um not too much of the crypto world i think it's on twitch but you're totally right that could that could be a total mistake well yeah well you could also just stream it to both right instead of just one so like most of bank oh this is our turn uh let's go with bishop bishop uh i mean most of bank list is like news news and information and that just feels right on youtube plus our live streams are right alongside the videos that we upload so youtube kind of just feels like home i don't know how much of our people would also be like twitch people as well um let's go let's go bishop i was listening to the episode uh about china today it was really good so far that was a fantastic episode yeah it was awesome i was listening to um your bite-sized ethereum stuff too topher he's uh super good at synthetizing oh yeah topher is incredible yeah that fella is pretty good at some heady concepts so absolutely oh gosh okay uh let's go come on let's go king king king okay beautiful did i do this right [Laughter] um night [Music] bishop bishop okay she don't want to do that bro you don't want to do no i'm just i'm just good i'm thinking i kind of want to do a move i probably shouldn't wait cyrus did you do a move yeah i don't see it no i move the knight to the center of the board to e4 it's not it's not showing my screen all right i'll probably refresh or something oh interesting uh you can't you can also watch the zoom screen that's actually the one i am watching i should i should try and watch the other one oh my hit refresh [Music] oh um wait sorry mike are you are you re redoing the screen for me or for this yeah wait layton is watching the zoom screen share and the zoom screen share is a couple moves behind somehow oh okay i i expected david and alex to sabotage the uh the game for their uh their own advantage i was i was you guys hard questions uh what's the position what's the last move position on okay right what is the last move that mike sees the bishop took the pawn i'm a limited backup right here guys sorry about that no worries uh and i'll fix the clock too i'll put it back to three there we go so i have bishop to d2 oh okay yeah and i put the clock to three minutes so cool thanks all right um let's um how much can i say anything i don't know i think the answer is no i'm pretty sure yeah hands can't talk bro [Laughter] read a book [Laughter] all right let's um let's let's let's go king okay um think i have no clue what to do so i'm just going to go ahead and say pawn okay great choice take your pick super choice all right um let's do this pawn let's like how can i how can i do something weird no this is fan this is fantastic this is fantastic let's keep 1607 from the chess.com chat says why is he thinking for so long and murph says he's counting his crypto seriously there you go thank you chess.com oh [ __ ] i forgot yeah your brain my bad i totally gotta switch yeah i know hmm nice little pawn wall there yeah uh bishop bishop okay going to keep this picture okay she did not want the trade [Laughter] i i i respect let's go queen yeah that was very respectful move we'll suck it up to that yeah well uh queen queen okay cool we are up a minute so i feel pretty good yeah this is just [Music] let's go rook right okay gonna ignore that pawn and we're gonna bring our rook out into the open pawn opening up a file let's see that pawn yeah i said pawn again for cyrus sarah's spending seconds like you got him he's counting his crypto that's a good move but which pawn move should i do uh let's let's fix our fix our double pawns here i like that idea all right here's some of this mess out oh uh i guess i should have said knight that would've been a lot better pawn okay let's attack a little bit push pushing uh um rook have you guys done poker on top signal already no no it's coming up it's coming up so we have to do it now so yeah exactly exactly bishop bishop she don't want to do it she said stop saying she said stop looking at that part of the board yes that's what i wanted uh okay um i guess go pawn pawn pawn okay uh pawn i have a feeling that we're gonna win on time bishop pick your nft's boys uh night nice deep and even thought here bishop bishop okay she's gonna save her yeah you got you got to give her an opportunity to keep the bishops on the table you know she wants that brooke rook i mean uh you know leighton has a vision here we'll start to see it out uh my vision is to not run out of time hear that i feel that oh queen tension in the b file tensions file green she capture the knight no she'll let him leave uh not going to capture the night night uh oh uh night okay um let's try this right row um it takes your time to take your time this is a tricky position actually let's go queen yeah the meter just went very very in favor of black so if you guys can yeah let's make this happen oh really is that is that what that does yeah that's what i realized is it's trying to do there yeah which is pretty interesting yeah i mean it but they'd have to see some very scary tactics here uh okay you really want me to trade bishops i feel like okay here you go uh let's go with rook no that wasn't very good yeah okay [Laughter] it does work it's okay we're gonna win regardless whoa time bro yeah 13 seconds um uh we gotta go with brooke okay okay interesting choice for alexandria here keep up the commentary can i say can i just say my next one it's just to get him thinking yeah go bishop bishop yeah you can tell him to move yeah it's like a pre-move go ahead uh correct queen green sorry no this is uh there's oh okay yeah let's do this oh no oh my god let's go wait are you saying queen here i think i am saying queen here wow during the last few seconds wow dave do we have any soundboard stuff right now let's like get the there we go it's beautiful you cheesed them yeah all right guys everybody that was the first half of the show in the second half of the show we're gonna have a little bit of conversations around some nfts we're gonna make alex pick her favorite nfts as well as some broader conversations about what's going on in the cryptosphere so stay tuned for the second half of the show it's coming back in about two minutes but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible here we go alchemix is one of the coolest new defy apps on the scene it introduces self-paying loans allowing you to spend and save at the same time deposit the die stable coin into the alchemics vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates borrow up to 50 of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of al usd stablecoin here's the craziest part the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defy savings account and brand new to alcmix is the eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alcomix.f that's a-l-c-h-e-m-i-x dot f-i follow alchemics on twitter at alcomix-fi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon binance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets one and we are back for the second half of the show uh we would have had a third game but alex and i absolutely swept the board with cyrus and layton who i think are just generally banned from chess.com moving forward uh and in the second half of the show we got a little bit of a prompt some around the horn q dot mike you want to tell us what's coming down the pipe what's up everybody if you remember around the horn it's the game where we are going to show a number of prompts crypto related prompts probably um where everybody's gonna be able to respond for up to 30 seconds we're trying to be polarizing don't need to be just try and give a hot take on the prompt everybody gets their own 30 seconds i'm gonna give points to comments that sound good i'm gonna take points or comments that sound silly and it's arbitrary these points don't matter but the winners at the end of the round is gonna get 30 seconds to talk about whatever they want to talk about at all don't need to be crypto related so you just have the floor that's the game do you have the floor um and we did that already and this is what we're doing now so let's go right into all right this is what the board looks like i'll be updating the the points on my phone so here we go who in d5 would you absolutely dominate in a game of chess think about think about these mofos that you see on your twitter every day which one of these would you just absolutely freaking pwn in a game of blitz let's go first leighton cusack who do you got in your mind i know you're thinking about somebody i'm thinking i think i'm thinking of um mike mike damaris give him some dings dave need some things that's that's what i'm thinking i think i could beat him wait wait wait wait have anything to do with the fact that he fat fingered the soldier boy ens was that was that a part of your analysis yes it was because he gave soldier boy to coinbase permanently wait no it wasn't permanent it was just that coinbase has isn't retrieving it right is it i thought that was right hey you're not saying why are you talking right now bro it's semi it's semi-permanent yeah okay do you want to say anything else you got some time left no mike damaris mike demaris i challenge you okay there you go you heard it here on top signal why don't you go next cyrus who would you who in d5 would you want to be or would you think you could be in a game of chess um i think i could destroy uh sam bankman freed um i think he's maybe one of the more p brain sized uh folks in beef i just don't think he'd be uh very good it'd be down to a challenge in the game does he count as d5 oh wow even more deadly there you go okay uh let's go with the david next who who would you absolutely slaughter in a game of chess in d5 so fun fact the synthetics discord throws friday weekly chess tournaments uh and that means that i would absolutely slaughter kane warwick he would not know what hit him and it would just be cool to be to be kane in a game of chess i don't even know if he shows up to the chess tournaments and so i'm kind of taking the gamble that synthetics hosts the chess tournaments and kane is just like kane maybe he's actually terrible at chess and doesn't take part but yeah i'd be kane he'd be kane okay okay very confident and and hey alexandra is there somebody in d5 i mean you could probably throw a dart at this point but who who do you think you would absolutely dominate in a game of chess other than the people on this call yeah everyone though no kane was pretty good he played in the chess tournament robert leschner was pretty good also um but i don't think there's i i who's the highest defy chess person you know you could do david daith the person that owns david.etha beat whoever owns david he he brought a chess board to east denver and i also thought about bringing a chess board to eat denver and i decided to not keep it in my luggage and that's how you know he's good at chess because he actually did it that's true yeah big truth is he better looking than you or nah just just because he has your enos bro all right let's go to the next one and i want to start with alexandra on this one which defy app would would be that says it would be the queen piece in chess which defy app would be the queen piece in chess and alexander if you want some time to think about this you can play as well which okay let's see how people answer it and then i'll think of something okay sure let's go with uh layton yeah which defy app would be the queen piece in chess because time starts now i think i think i'm actually gonna man oh he's dragging his brain off the top of my head i was gonna say compound because it's very versatile so when i think queen i'm like what's versatile actually honestly though i should give a shout out to maker like die what's more versatile than die that dye fits into all that all the deep i have so masculine yeah those are both those are all queens super you're going very good choices all right cyrus why don't you go next which uh which do you fight after the queen peace and chess uh i guess in terms of uh power and versatility and being all over the board i'd probably have to say urine was kind of uh general in my in my point of view they kind of uh got their hands all over the board nice answer my friend urine good one for cyrus dave why don't you go next uh which d fight app would be the queen piece in chess and why i'm gonna have to go with um tornado cash because it's literally a tornado right like think of the spiral that that or the the lines out and it can put ether anywhere right you can go all over ethereum instantly inside of one move mm-hmm that's kind of a heater that's kind of a heater my friend i give back my time okay thanks for the eight seconds alexandra with that do you have any idea which d5 app you think would be the queen piece in chess uh metamask because the average normie loses access to it pretty wow let's check in on the status of the board um wait do i have this thing i thought it was going to show up oh here we go it's synced i just have to do a little refresh wait am i winning this is what i have on the board right now oh man after the first two games who knows on my phone right here baby i was just giving them like free like they're they were free because they were they're just pixels on my screen just like these nfts just like the nfts all right so uh we got leigh and alexandra in the lead right now these points mean nothing we're going to continue going um all right hey alex oh you got to move that the countdown timer i i actually really like board apes oh you're picking okay so she's saying she's yeah so she's saying she has an affinity even ahead of this round to have board apes so she's saying she likes board apes yeah do you have a party i don't i don't i haven't bought any of the avatar nfts because well i i feel like they're a little bit of a status symbol on twitter because i don't want to be flashy and then it feels like it's too hot up a market right now so i'm just kind of sitting on the side watching and i feel like if you are trying to do it to flip them you have to pay a lot of attention to them which i don't know the difference between you know the penguin who has the eye on his forehead and the one who has a monocle and all that stuff the thing is like no one else knows the difference either like no one knows the difference between these things so her choice is board abe is that what i heard board yeah yeah okay whose is this lucas's that's lucas this is the uh the bank list team this is from from left to right that's lucas me michael wong and then william piecer on the on the far right slightly covered you have a very nice me bit sir i'm sorry about the countdown timer yeah mm-hmm all right here's the next one so one of the one of them is david one of them is cyrus one of them looks like is it a mean no that's not his i don't think amino is a crypto punk no he doesn't but i recognize these all from twitter i don't remember who they are though which one is the best looking what's best looking here obviously the third one and he's good at chess yes bro thank you now i know why you why you made this episode you're like hey bro we're gonna have an episode of alexandria beautiful to play chess look people are gonna get it it's just and i get it smile man like everyone likes the smile right like how you have today and you have to guess you have to guess your your partner up that's how you play good team sports good point thank you you don't even wear hats though bro i used to once upon a time on time let's get back in the game here i'll get cyrus going first on will normies adopt nft avatars will normies adopt nft avatars and will my play button work here yes let's go i mean yeah of course i mean avatars have been huge on the internet for like 20 20 years now right we serve avatars as kids so yeah i think it's obvious that they're gonna adopt them um whether they'll pay you know six thousand dollars for one probably not so i think we'll have like an explosion of 10 000 of a kind generative avatars or whatever and then they'll go from there uh yeah there's these projects when we have 10 000 or 8 888 for all of them and that's not that many so also a lot of like lesser attractive looking people like david you know they need something to find on their on their twitter profile so there's only so many anime characters you're so right about that why leighton you got you have anything to say to that uh i agree i think normies normies already are putting nft avatars on there um i just think it will probably happen in like the worst like it's probably i don't know i feel like these things when they go mainstream they always go mainstream in like the worst way like i don't know if they'll be on ethereum like like i think they might just be like they might just be not on a blockchain at all they'll just be like people are just gonna start putting random things as their avatars because that's what you know influencers are doing sir dave what do you think i have no clue but uh i mean could you totally imagine that like when we all were like trading pokemon cards and had like show and tell in first grade first grade for me like it was it was it feels like the same thing right and so i i feel like you could just transpose show and tell of your pokemon cards to like whatever the hell is going on these days the thing is like there was only one pokemon cards right like there was also yu-gi-oh but the difference was like pokemon cards were collected and people didn't play the games people that collected yu-gi-oh cards actually played the games so like i'm working yeah we played in the game baby playing the game talking about there's only one pokemon card bro yeah you're cut off also by the way good good game everybody on that one let's look at the let's look at the update on the channel wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait we got to get alex oh excuse me yes okay please i was it's because i'm looking at the current scores right now and uh okay go ahead please norman's like already given me points because i'm doing so well right i'm kidding let's see you earn them right here um i i do think normies will adopt some form of nft avatar because i was reading yesterday about how we're becoming a digital first species and more and more of our life is being lived online and i think people are gonna start to value their online possessions more over time and you already see a lot of people valuing things highly in gaming like their fortnight skins and things like that so i don't see why it wouldn't eventually go to avatar since social media is a status and popularity game anyway where everyone's showing off why wouldn't they show off the collectibles they're most proud of great point um did you keep coming back to this idea of status symbols and nfts uh especially avatars i think that's all it is so here here's the current status of the board folks what's happening um yeah yeah doing this because i'm the guest but i like you know well no cyrus and layton are also guests there was two rounds yeah that's true there was two rounds where you could only only you could earn points so that was part of it as well you guys are more you guys are more in the crypto sphere so you're welcoming to newcomers let's say that we're trying hey maybe i'll be hard on this next one let's see yeah we're just gonna do it you got an airdrop an air drop of points think of it that way nice one cool so uh let's go for let's see we got this thing this last one is is congress discussing crypto a good thing is congress discussing crypto good thing dave why don't you start us off absolutely and because the if all the legislation that actually did get passed first off the markets didn't care the market straight up went up and i feel like to some degree the conversation ends there the terrible legislation got proposed and passed and the markets went up like the markets reacted positively uh anything that's in the news anything that's in the news cycle anything that indicates that regulation is happening and the conversation is happening and trending towards the right direction bullish i'm blessed on that answer why don't you go next uh cyrus um so one of the one of the craziest things i didn't realize until like way late in the in the political process was that like the crypto bill was was the only thing holding up the uh the infrastructure bill and i thought it was like one of like dozens yeah right no holy [ __ ] this like multi-trillion dollar bill is being held up by crypto for like three four days is like absolutely crazy and probably not a good thing right if like there's a lot of normies out there who are like why the hell is this crypto garbage like holding up this um this critical spending but it's interesting to see anyway congress should have increased the gas price faster it was stuck there you guys being late yeah can you give the guy anything else to say have you been following this for me to lister uh i i actually wasn't one thing i did follow a little bit and yeah i think it's good i think it's a good sign though of why we need things like the d5 education fund i know a lot of people have been critical that i personally have always been a big supporter of it i still am big supporter um but uh fun fact we have jake schrambinski coming on the podcast next week well jake's jake's the saint and uh and he's an amazing person but yeah we need we need we need more of that and um i think i think anyway i think the the process in congress really illustrated why we need that and why it's so urgent right now so i'm excited i i think i think went well we're we're coming out stronger even though the legislation was bad big agree cool and alexander wanna round us out here is do you have an opinion on this is congress discussing crypto a good thing i'm actually surprised because when this was originally trending on twitter everyone was really alarmist about it you know like call your senators the crypto industry is going to be in so much trouble every everybody's going to be a broker if this passes and then um i was actually really impressed to see the entire crypto community just rally together and you know come to call their senators i called mine as well actually because i was from oregon um and then it ended up going through anyway and then the community went positive again like oh actually it's going to be okay um but yeah i know i think it was a good thing and it shows that you know people who are interested in crypto are going to have influence in the government and that they're actually funded and they had three senators who were moving forward to support the bill um and at le even if it didn't go through the fact that it's starting and it's showing that the crypto community is trying to work with regulators in a way that makes you know the crypto community pay its fair share of taxes but actually makes sense was really cool to see and i don't know what's going to happen from here but it's it's a good start so yeah i guess i'm in the community we're all my friends excellent so let's see where what's the point shook out here you probably already can tell um also my dad is in your chat that's pretty funny andre hi dad which dad what's good dad what's good dad i can't believe i can't believe these scores right here i can't believe you did this three people why now absolutely brain buster of absolutely crazy i want to give everybody a shot to talk today except i don't know about dave i think he gets enough air time so we'll give every one of the guests some time um let's go also another plug for bite size ethereum here folks um and maybe that's not what she wants to talk about today with every 30 seconds but i want you to go ahead and uh oh i see how you did that sorry um did we do a free game or is that just did we just make this a did slide delete i might have deleted one of your slides sorry that's okay why don't you go ahead and talk to us for 30 seconds alexander about anything you want we'll keep this in the background while you do so i appreciate that you have that there um i actually did start a podcast with one of my really good friends he's been an ethereum developer for the last five years and we would catch up and have a call every you know two weeks or so where he would teach me about the crypto industry and it was really helpful so i decided to record it and make podcasts i'm gonna be putting them out less frequently now because things have been extremely busy um but there's three episodes and they're supposed to be kind of evergreen and also cover current events in a way that you don't need a technical background to understand and it just kind of supposed to be a way to get anybody into learning more about it without selling them we're talking about like price goes up we just like no this is how it works and being as objective as possible yeah the guy toe for that explains a lot of stuff on the podcast shoots it really straight not not doesn't speak in a lot of metaphors so it's pretty helpful um thanks alexander we know you're busy so thanks a lot for your time please this is super fun i'm actually a big fan of the bankless podcast i think it's it's great and so thank you so much for doing this cool thank you appreciate that leighton and cyrus you're also going to get 30 seconds each go ahead first lady and say whatever you want uh i just want to say i think i think um with with the wave of nft speculation i feel like there's been maybe a little bit more of a current of like of like oh i just made a million dollars and i just want to say to people who maybe haven't made a million dollars that that's okay [Music] that's actually totally fine and um the the signal to noise on that is is much larger than you think great point i actually really appreciate that you said that for everybody on that on the podcast right now liam thank you cyrus you want to round it out 30 seconds show whatever you want to show my friend uh no she'll just want to say thank you to david and the banquet's team for bringing me on this was uh tons and tons of fun uh thanks alex for coming on huge honor to play against chess uh yes oh thank you it was fun to play and uh yeah david um i'll round it up by saying
