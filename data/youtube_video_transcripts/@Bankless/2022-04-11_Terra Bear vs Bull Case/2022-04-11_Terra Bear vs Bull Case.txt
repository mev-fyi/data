the bear case for luna first there's a lot of risks the the btc bridge risk hasn't been figured out there's market risk my full bear case is that we are very far away from that end point there's a ton of stuff to figure out even with having such a good team working on it we have no idea what's going to happen even in like in a few months when anchor yield goes down there are so many unknowns we can't just consider it a foreground conclusion that we're going to get to this end state all our best investments have always been controversial and how controversial this is and is is one of the things that makes me super bullish i think people just over index and focus on this pegaris can just repeat it over and over again without focusing on the upside what happens if it works is you have the ust as the biggest decentralized stablecoin and ust currently is the is the fastest horse in the in that race if we agree that stablecoins are a network effect business then you want to bet on the winners and you want to bet on whoever is growing fastest and ust's model allows it to grow much faster
