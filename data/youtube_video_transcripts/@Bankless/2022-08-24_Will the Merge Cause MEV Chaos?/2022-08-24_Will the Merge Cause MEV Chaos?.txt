there's this other thing that's happening of course with the merge and i'm curious it seems to be the case that there's going to be a lot of mev type of opportunities maybe stuck on the proof of work chain in this transition to proof of stake what would you say about this at merge time are there going to be some like weird mev things at play and what do you expect to see i know there'll be a lot of chaos i know that a lot of very smart operators have been thinking about this for a long time and like building strategies because there will be a lot of one-off opportunities one-off arbitrage one-off things that can be done there's going to be some mvv chaos i don't think it's anything that's going to compromise the stability of the system or like compromise the merge from from happening but it will mean that you know operators who are prepared to capture it will will make a little bit of money at that time
