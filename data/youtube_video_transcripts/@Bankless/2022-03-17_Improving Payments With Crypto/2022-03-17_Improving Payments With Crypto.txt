there's this common trope in crypto where you like you come for the money and you stay for the tech is that kind of the trajectory that that you've seen yourself on is like oh first there was arbitrage then i found discovered i could build this this business but then you just recently alluded to there's more and more use cases that you can see crypto helping create more and more real world impact yeah i think that sounds about right i think one piece of this is like how how does a payment work you know one person wants to pay another what does that mean what's it entail and i think part of the answer here is like well that payment only works if there are two people who both respect the same payment method right like they both agree on what it means for that payment to happen but in order for that to happen there is some payment method if you're talking overseas which is well it's probably not run by a country because it's cross-border it's probably not run by a company you need a third option and i think blockchain is one of the first times that we've found a another way to do you know to have ledger right to have some ledger that you reconcile between two parties and so i think that's that's super compelling
