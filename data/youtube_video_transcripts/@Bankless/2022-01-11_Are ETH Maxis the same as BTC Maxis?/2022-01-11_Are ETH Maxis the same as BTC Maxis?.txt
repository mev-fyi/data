there's a line that's going around in the crypto twitter sphere about how ethereum maxies are just bitcoin maxis 2.0 but vitalik as somebody who originally forked off of bitcoin how do you feel about that line i definitely think that maximalism is something that's uh very unhealthy like there definitely are tendencies i think among some people in even the ethereum community to try to kind of brand everything outside of the ethereum ecosystem as being boring and illegitimate which i don't think is true i guess my my view there is somewhere in the middle like i think it's definitely important to also have our eyes open and look at what's going on in all of these other ecosystems at the same time like we do have to remember that a lot of people do like support ethereum not just because they got their bags in earlier because like ultimately like you know if you have your bags in ethereum but you decide ethereum is worse than you can just move all your bags to something else you know it's a it's a free mortgage
