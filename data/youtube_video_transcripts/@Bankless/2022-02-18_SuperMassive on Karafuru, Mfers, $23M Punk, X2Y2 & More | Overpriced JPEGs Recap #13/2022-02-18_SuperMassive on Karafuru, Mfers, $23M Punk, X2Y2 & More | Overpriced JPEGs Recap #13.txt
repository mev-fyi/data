more than ever i feel like the nft space as vast as it is is just making its own rules up now and i'm i'm excited by that because it's it's the way it should be [Music] hello gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and this is the weekly recap episode but we have a special guest joining me for the recap episode i want to give a big welcome to should i call you supermassive you could be seen massive you can go with whatever you want really like how people know that annoying english guy that's fine sir dude with the face in the accent [Laughter] super massive is what i will call him because that's how i was first introduced to you uh supermassive is here supermassive from the defiant for folks who don't know he's an incredible content creator producer ceo i don't know you you you tell us well i'm definitely not the ceo uh my boss at the defiant uh yes i'm the head of video and multimedia at the define which is kind of a loose term but basically i make videos and films i try to make more films and videos these days but it's it's tough and we talk about d5 but we also cover the intersection of d5 and nfts but d5 has kind of become the tip of the spear in terms of regulatory pressures and stable coins all these other things so literally defy as i said has become the engine room of the metaverse and nfts and everything now so i have to be plugged into all of that plus dows plus i mean it's it's insane but there's a story every day just don't worry yeah yeah yeah well your content is fantastic if anybody isn't familiar with supermassive's videos at the defiant i highly recommend checking them out i will say like i think the first video of yours that i watched maybe was the board ape yacht club it was like an explanation of why the board apiac club got big and and like why it's relevant and i i think it's excellent and folks should check it out if they haven't seen it and if you have like that friend who's like what f is this ape thing it's stupid that's an excellent video to show people because it it i think it really captures the uh why this is culturally relevant well it's fun it's funny this this space in general when you look at it doesn't have that's not the greatest content creators it has a lot of very samey content creators that produce the kind of content that will make people think okay this guy knows what to buy next and there's very little of the kind of chronicling of the space so what happened and why did it happen more kind of historical stuff that you would look back on in five years ago oh my god i can't believe that this happened there's very little of that it tends to be very day by day so it's not it wasn't intentional but i feel like the thing that i'm best at is taking a story and really bringing it to life and telling it to you in a way that you go okay and what we try and do which isn't always feasible is we try and make it entertaining because i spent 20 years as a filmmaker i was doing music videos and i shot a feature film i just love filming stuff and telling stories visually blockchain is not visual it's code it's impossible to visualize so you always end up using these metaphors you have food you have props so we always try and bring some kind of visual element in that makes it come alive for people otherwise it's just it literally is you're just talking about formulas and that's so not interesting so when nfts came along i was like oh my god thank god i can actually see something and we can look at it and we can have an argument about whether it's any good or not and of course all of that exploded but that that moment in time when board apes arrived there was so much less than there is now it's it's amazing looking at the just the the glut of stuff that we have in front of us to pick apart and evaluate and then you know measure against what's happened before and go oh actually we were totally wrong about the artistic merits of cool cats versus board apes now we have to kind of judge things by the izuki standard and that's what we're going to do you know it's like oh god make it stop like you know armistice 48 hour arm sisters no no drops can you imagine yeah yeah oh we should do i also love the we should do that and we should do i think betty nft tweeted this at one point like i am once again calling for a universal nft time zone you know like let's just get on one one time zone we can all adjust our sleep schedules accordingly um but let's get into the glut of everything happening as you say uh you know i was gonna make a joke but then you said a bunch of other good stuff but about you're like there's not enough content you know it's so day by day and i'm like and with that though the weekly recap let's dive in what happened day by day this week um excellent okay let's just start like macro picture you track everything what's going on this past week where are the markets how are you feeling about things what are you what are you watching well the macro market at the moment is deeply uncertain and there's a lot of chat about regulation there's a lot of chat around the block 500 million dollar sec settlement and the implications of that for u.s traders that one's going to run and run i think with nfts they had a great run when everything else was going down and that had to come to an end at some point i mean you're looking at the clone x's the zookeys the volume on those was immense and it is it is dropped by about a half and it just wasn't sustainable what's interesting though is that the the projects that we're doing well don't seem to have dropped that much which is kind of interesting so again i'm looking at azuki's and clonex's and and some of these new ones like kirifura the mutants the board apes don't really drop that much people kind of just going yeah i'm sticking where i am and i don't know what that's reflecting exactly um what do you use to track your energies for tracking volume and things like that yeah dap radar uh i use um i use delphi digital has a really good like weekly insights um newsletter it's not for like tracking volumes every day but it will give you a nice summary of like top 10 projects by volume this past week um and it's sort of in a more condensed format but i tend to use dapp radar uh as a way to look i had been using for a while it wasn't as much a volume tracker but it was a good floor price tracker xenica put out like a nice spreadsheet that just tracked projects new projects old projects like across the whole space he stopped publishing that publicly but i may still like bug him at some point for it kind of privately because i really liked that cleanness of it i don't know about you but like i find with your adapt radar because of the wash trading now one looks rare like the the the data kind of gets messy if you're just looking these like pure kind of volume aggregators um what do you use so i started using this tool called watchtower i was using wgmi with those basically because it was a lot easier to track everything that was going on with that in my own personal portfolio than it was with anything else what sounds good though because it basically allows you to set up dashboards you can set up um comparison boards what have i got at the moment i'm just gonna have a look and see where my boards are um so i can basically uh track for instance blue chip listings so i can check what's being listed in real time but it the boards are set up like i don't know if you ever use tweetdeck so you can in tweetday you can set up columns of like you know search terms you're looking for so i can compare right now doodles cryptopoints board apes cool cats clonex's cybercons all in the one dashboard in front of me and i can see exactly who's listing it how frequently they're listing what they're listening for and so i can tell you yeah there's a punk this has been listed for 74 east another one for 77 those in the last half hour but there's you know in the last 20 minutes or so there's been at least 10 doodles listed for around 15 to 22 wow doodles are doing well and so this is yeah and it just gives you a sense of where people are pricing where the kind of the thickness of the pricing is going i mean that's really yeah send me a link to that i've been using nansen for a little while but it was too overwhelming oh my gosh oh my god you're like wow and you're like i'm never gonna use this why because i had too much else to do i was only paying for it for a little while i know and it's like i can i can see the data and now i have to really think about the data whereas with this i can just go oh yeah okay okay yeah that sounds much better send me the link we'll link to it in the show notes for fun it is paid but i did pay for it because you know whatever i can do to make my life a little bit easier it's a write-off thing um so i know you were thinking about what's in the market right what's macro for me there's this severe kind of reimagining of what a blue chip is that has happened in the last two weeks we've seen projects which have looked at what we've previously considered blue chips and said but we can really set our stall out and do something amazing and i i was tracking artifact for 12 months before they even launched clonex but they are delivering something unique and weird and very uniquely them and of course they have the nike partnership what is that worth does that make them a blue chip i think irrefutable but yes azuki is just like how can how can you not like uzuki they're just there's something for everyone in there they're delicious and weird and what we're seeing is this kind of emergence of a manga flavor or manga styled images and we kind of moved away from the cutie cartoony or the sort of the idiot cartoony stuff and this is more of a style interestingly enough i've been playing around with v tubing have you ever come across v tubing no no so tell me so v tubing is basically where you you take your physical self and you replace it with something else but it's an animation that tracks with you in real time so you can have a manga character that you i've zoomed with people yeah yeah you've seen people who have done so exactly so v tubing is just doing what i do will you do but doing it as one of these characters but doing it in real time when you do the show later i'll be youtubing so okay so i i saw one on one of your live streams yeah yeah exactly exactly so i i play around with this stuff the whole time so i have characters in unreal engine that i'm using but i'm also using these v tubing things because i'm trying to explore what this is for me v tubing is where pfps come alive and so i'm trying to understand how the technology works and how it will translate to pfps because with v-ride studio which is a free piece of software you can design you know a character that looks the way you want it to look and it has the floppy hair and it has kind of weird eyes but you have immense amounts of customization to do that with and then the software to to stream it to obs and then out it's like it's all free and it's really easy to set up and really really easy to use you can do things like you can have one of these which this is a magic leap hand controllers really old piece of technology but with this it's so janky you strap it to your chest and then it'll track your hand movements so the the really hard things to do like tracking facial expression head rotation and an iphone can do all of that now and like the software's sophisticated enough with facial recognition to do that tracking hands really damn difficult but with this thing you can get some expression so your hands can be tracked as well it's a little janky but it's pretty amazing that for me the translation pipeline for people to take their avatar whatever it is and then be that in that way that for me is where all of this suddenly makes sense and if you if you look at these 3d models like hate prime like clone x's like me bits to get them workable in the metaverse in any meaningful way is an absolute ball lake v-ride studio vc face one of these simple it's half an hour's work that for me is where suddenly all of this is going to explode and you're going to have just any number of projects coming in offering solutions to enable you to do that but once we can plug into those you know that that freeware like it's all going to change that's fascinating so your argument is is is that the way we start populating the metaverse is not actually like 3d running around renderings of amiib for example but rather us you know as human beings sort of going into these spaces with this technology strapped up to us so that we actually just physically represent the character well you i think you have two is that what you're doing i think you're saying you have two as well it's probably three but you have three essential problems that you have in in terms of all of this one is we want to represent ourselves as our character and there's a certain amount of expression that comes with just being yourself and if people want to be anonymous they want to be able to emote as themselves with these these anime characters that i'm working with they are full 3d so you can rotate and it's you have the entire body so this is a very lightweight file format called vrm that allows you to do that and it's amazing but none of these avatars really can work that way you have to do kind of weird mechanics and go into mixer mode and and then sort of download thing and it it it's not for for everybody but these simple kind of vroid studio versions they really are so that allows people to be themselves but as the character that's fun then you have all these social interactions and things like decentralized where you can just go up and talk to somebody you don't need full functionality of an avatar to do that and then there's this idea of exploring a world as yourself and going and playing a game and just being there you don't need a fully fleshed out avatar to do that what's important there is the quality of the interactions and the quality of the gameplay itself like what is the world like and that you can have a very stripped down version of your avatar the trick is going to be making it possible to be all of those things wherever you are in a format where the game can recognize oh okay you've got this now i'm going to give you this version of yourself but that for me this this simple ability to kind of emote and reflect your own kind of personality but through this character in real time for very little effort it's amazing which is why i spend so much time looking into it because i feel like this is this is it's just it's just like months away from being integrated and fully ready to go yeah that's fascinating i'm almost embarrassed that i haven't thought more about that about these different forms and how they're going to show up in the metaverse i like you know i've been on zoom calls now i was on a call with dees who i think is a non who or mostly an honor and he and that was the case for him like he was you know just fully a character as we zoomed and i was like god this is so preferable to like you just being off screen with like a stupid little you know image there in in lieu of you and it's really just like an audio call at that point um yeah jimmy money does he's got a punk like he just turns up he's like this dude from puerto rico you're like huh it's so it's so cool and i think the reason people don't look at it is because youtube is people think they're really dumb and like they're generally like that and it's it's all come from japan it seems very weird the software itself the the the ui is really badly designed it just looks it just looks cheap and stupid but you know if i think about like gen alpha or whatever they're called now they don't care about any of that stuff like my daughter's wants to start youtubing and doing minecraft videos i'm not letting her put her face on camera hell no but she wants to design her own little manga character with pink hair and make it all girly i'm like yeah go for it and then we can do a little bit of voice changing make her sound like an eight-year-old colonel you know it'd be great so that's you know what do you think what are your thoughts on um like like and what's his name fn mecca right like these like fully these like music stars these stars like these kind of celebrities in this world that are like totally just ai that feels very depressing to me and i feel like the boomer in that situation being like that'll never work like people want to connect with people but like i'm probably wrong and i don't have kids so i don't have like a reference point is that also gonna be a huge thing do you think yes it is and but the thing is i don't think you need to look at it as anything depressing because it's fiction and it's narrative like when you see a model on instagram is that real no when you see the way people present themselves is that real no like even this none of this is real i'm actually you know 50 50 years old and covered in doritos and stinking of red bull you know that's that's that's the reality no i think it's it's all just entertainment it's a it's a piece of fiction so whether it's an ai or not there is an inherent intrigue in seeing how that story plays out and how realistic it is and i think that's absolutely fine when you watch netflix is that real no of course not when you watch tiger king is it real well so sure but there's a real human there we won't we won't go too deep in this this is the recap episode we'll do another like meta thoughts on the metaverse but but uh that is something i've been i've been thinking more about polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their d5 goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their axes there are and will be many varied gaming experiences for axes many of them having players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources others will have them complete quests defeat bosses and unlock in-depth storylines there are countless unique axes that players can collect with varying body parts and experiences the axi universe is a player-owned economy where the players can truly own buy sell and trade the resources they earn in the game through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem it's a digital nation where people come together globally with their axes to play earn and live join the axi revolution at axioinfinity.com bankless uh okay let's let's pull it back i mean it's funny you're mentioning these these like youtubers and coming out of uh japan where a lot of this i guess originated i mean it's striking to me and it's a little bit less of this this past week but like in the week prior i think like all like half of the top 10 projects by volume all had like an asian influence and you still see this here uh azuki obviously mentioned still absolutely crushing it clonex obviously has like a sort of asian inspired feel to it and it's um oh gosh uh murakami um yeah murakami thank you so much yeah takashi murakami who did the art there um and then kara furu which i think is such an interesting project i think it's something it's one you're you're somewhat interested in do you want to tell folks a little bit about this project in case it hasn't well i i don't i don't know a huge amount i don't know but i i dropped it to my radar and i looked at it when this is wild this kind of reminds me of arcade machines in hong kong you know had that kind of real visceral fun style to it and i didn't end up minting any because when i saw them i was like i'm not sure if i want these and i was also kind of still going through the uzuki collection and trying to determine what i would what was the right course of action there so but but i think yeah they're genuinely they're really fun but i think what what you picked up on was that the the collections tended to cluster around this this anime i'm sure it wasn't just that it was just that people were noticing them and i think that's because azuki had done so well people were noticing that you know if you remember only force last year that project had that same kind of only forced the sevens the sevens right so it's not like this is new but i think azuki's just put it on people's radars but generally what you will see happening is that suddenly all these projects will come out of the woodwork oh yeah we can just we can knock up ten thousand of these in no time and it'll be fine i don't think a lot of these projects were like that i think they were quite considered and well designed and there was a named artist in there and someone who was actually been probably spending three four months putting this together at least so yeah there just feels like there's a lot more quality now there's a very big difference between having a nice web page and having ten thousand quality assets and having a quality project then sort of almost nothing to do with each other so remember to be seen how they evolved but yes that was definitely a trend yeah so carafuru i believe is it comes from indonesia you were just telling me indonesia uh museum of toys which which is interesting it sort of has i mean institutional probably not the right word but like a certain amount of institutional backing that's interesting like something with like a reputation to lose it's sort of not people who came out of nowhere i loved their their website like their website is bright and colorful and i totally i i looked at it i think before mint but like i wasn't on their allow list et cetera and i was like oh this is i get why like this is cool and it doesn't feel to your point like i think what we have seen with a lot of these projects that have sprung up they do feel considered and i was like this feels fully like a considered project let me ask you this uh azuki's obviously still like reigning supreme and you you sort of started talking about this but why has it done so well like why has it been you know one of the very few projects that doesn't just that like was super hyped before reveal stayed super hyped just keeps climbing like what what do you think it is or in your i think i think a couple of things happened one of which was you had a good kind of birth story and the narrative when you read the website it was like well i can sort of understand where you're coming from with this and and again it felt considered i also think a lot of people overlooked it completely they didn't even think about it because they weren't they weren't paying attention to it and i know a lot of big collectors that i [Music] have the privilege of hanging around with from time to time suddenly you saw it late so they they came in late and and decided to kind of put some serious capital behind i know sven we've had on the show a couple of times loved them just completely fell in love with them and and was committed enough to go and buy like the number two ranked one and i think that sent a big signal to the market but i also think again come back to clonex clonex has set a new standard in terms of what a mid-range not blue you know not board apes or punks project can be and i think that's dragged everything else up with it probably um that there is a there's a realistic and sustainable price range around 15 to 28 and again that's a lot of money but some people you know that people can kind of just about get one of them and that one actually might end up you know being worth 50 to 60 at some point and that as an investment decision is cool but from a community perspective like all of these projects have to deliver some kind of experience some kind of journey for owners and if they can't then people will sell and that's just the way it's going to be but you know there's there's definitely this middle class of nfts now i think we can call it that is thickening out you know fairly significantly and even if you don't call them blue chips they could definitely contenders with some um decent prospects for the future they're they're knocking on the door of blue chip status i hate that honestly i don't even know i don't even know why we call them blue chips like we have blue chip d5 projects blue chip and ft what does that mean it's like well it's it's so funny too because right it's it's borrowed right from from traditional finance world of like a blue chip company like a coca-cola and you're like yeah because coca-cola has been here for like 100 years and isn't going anywhere this thing got blue chip status it's been six months like in some ways it's too early to call anything blue chip in this space except for maybe punks right but like like blue chip companies are companies that have been around for again truly like 50 years and have like have a brand moat that's so incredibly untouchable that like that doesn't get built yeah even in six months or a year in in that vein there is one blue chip nft project nobody ever talks about it and that's the damian hurst dots because damien has established artists established brands and like that project was worth so much at one point they were trading for like 45 50 000 a pop come down significantly since then but that that that was a blue chip moment a big brand that did really well with with a kind of interesting dynamic and i'm curious to see what's going to happen with those once the window for redeeming the nft for the physical artwork starts to close and people go oh what should i do usually but like you know that's fallen off everybody's radar but that that for me that's blue chip um board apes yes of course bugs i didn't yeah yeah they they get the status yeah i uh i i have friends who i didn't get into the damian hurst drop but i've friends in it i was very jealous at the time um okay you said you were debating the azuki what what the right course of action was we'll move off of this in a moment but what did you decide do you own an azuki did you buy one what's your i haven't i haven't well no i bought the beans so i had some i had some pre-reveals okay because i just kind of fell in love with the art that i saw actually i don't think i'm allowed to you did well well what a yeah i i have a nine-year-old daughter and my buying decisions these days tend to be around what would she like and if i put these in a vault for when she's 21 well you know would that be a fun thing to do so we she and i kind of decide what we're going to do and i i don't tell her how much they they're worth or how much they cost and then to kind of just see what she might like and then we kind of decide on something i think i've heard other people do this and that's a decent strategy you know that gets you probably cool cats like yeah that gets you probably like a a whole bunch of things yeah i i don't really know it's like some of the things that some of the decisions that i have made have turned out really well but just coincidentally they've also been things that the kids have really liked so and i've have a seven-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter and like i i'm able to share that with them i can't share anything about d5 with them because they don't get it but like this stuff this stuff they're like yeah daddy you've got a new nft and i'm like yes i do yes i do would you like to see it so i got i got a nazuki that looks exactly on my daughter and um oh i love it yeah that's very very cute uh i i think we'd be that's very cute uh i feel like we'd be remiss to not uh mention mf as we're talking about the past week uh because they sort of like they've been the last two weeks i feel like really kind of on the climb but uh do you have any thoughts on mfrs do you own an emf no i do not i do not but i'm aware of them and i'm aware of satoshi and the story there is pangoji but um yeah i mean it's it's it's it's like another one of these crypto things it's like it's just capturing a a meme of a moment of a sentiment of a thing that that represents how people are feeling and i doubt it will last that long honestly but i think it's it has the cco component yeah it has the cco piece which people are you know like and i i i like it too i've talked a lot about cco on this show and sort of my feelings on that but i was talking to david hoffman last night because i was seeing some some article that was like i'm after sort of like you know out of nowhere started to do really well and i was like i think bankley sort of started this because ryan and david got very into the mf and were like like posting about it on twitter and that was like i feel like there were some other factors that play as well but they definitely were like a precipitating moment and so i was talking to david last night i'm here in denver for eat denver and he was like they're just so perfectly facetious like they're they're just like these little stick figures and they sort of have the like you know the middle finger thing but then they have like a smile on their face so they're also just like happy and it's just it's funny hearing you talk about them yeah it's funny you're talking about that because i i i seem to remember earlier on that like david and ryan were not so hot on in a teaser we're like yeah this is dumb oh yeah so that's changing they're coming around they're coming around they bought cool cats they bought mf eventually everyone i mean you you can't we will not be ignored at the nft world i mean it's funny right because they brought me on in part because they were like we need a show about nfts in the metaverse totally focused on that but it's not going to be us and slowly but surely like you know they're they're definitely talking a lot about nfts and getting kind of into it um okay the 23 million a dollar punk sale before the vein of my forehead pops open go ahead don't have incredibly impressive thoughts deepak.etha it was the chain protocol founder he bought it for a crazy amount of money is it a marketing scheme i you know truly this is like i i want to hear your thoughts i don't have anything uh brilliant on this well yes deepak sapli al who is as you rightly say the ceo of chain chain's an interesting company they one of the massive success stories of of a time when there weren't that many massive success stories and they bridged the gap between blockchain and big enterprises they worked with visa they were bought by stella when stellar was a big deal and they brought themselves back but like in the course of that you know that dpap made a [ __ ] ton of cash like a lot of money and he's a really interesting guy he's i want to hate him genuinely because of what of all of this nft buying and the message it sends but you hear him talk he's really considered really smart and the chain message of what they're trying to do is you know they're trying to change standards for humanity they're trying to make a difference and yet you see this and in total the guy has spent around 31 million on mutants and serums and this uh this punk this alien punk i mean it's astonishing this is like 31 million dollars like projects were raising that much at ico in 2017 and it felt obscene at the time this is how much money he spent and the way that he raised the money was using compounds so he took a took a loan out went longitude and took a loan to pay for the punk interesting enough this is the guy that bought the m3 serum for 1500 or so he's now put it on sale for around 21 million and like punk bought for 23 million now the serums going on save there's a bit of balancing going on there like who yeah who's going to pay 21 million for that m3 serum nobody it's i'm sorry it's not worth that much it's and and i i just can't figure it out so i went there's a forbes article about him that came out about four days ago and in it he talks about three specific things that founders and cryptocurrencies should think about and one of them is like narrowing down your niche one of them is about you know making sure you're in it for the long run and the other one is be more visible like he said the biggest challenge we have right now is to be more visible i'm like dude you've just done that because i'm now talking about you and like i said i want to hate him but i i think honestly when you see his tweets raise and you see everything else he's very considered i keep using that word but like i respect people who are considered and don't just go i bought this thing and it's [ __ ] amazing you know and like there's i don't know i'm very conflicted about it okay so your tension is partly the conspicuous consumption thing and the sort of uh uh well i guess you could call it kind of reckless way which is going about it i mean like i would tell everybody don't ever like you know borrow money basically go go you know leverage yourself like that a guy like this who's got i'm sure infinity money it doesn't really matter but so you're you're kind of chafe against the conspicuous consumption and the absurdity of these prices because they are just absurd at a certain point but you like that he's considered and clearly this is a marketing move right like he he is just trying to be this is that obviously this is his way of of being seen and it it's working is that am i capturing your feelings on this yes so if your mission is to to do some good in the world but everyone's ignoring you then you need to be seen and then you can do some good in the world and there there's charlie munger came out with a quote today it's like cryptocurrency traders only you need to get rich for themselves without doing anything good for humanity and i suspect that most of them are but i think there's also a bunch of them that like they'll get rich quick and then they'll do something about it and i want to give deepak at least the chance to to do that and try try to do that but then i like my wife's a teacher and like how much money does a teacher need and how much how many teachers could you get for 31 million i don't even know the answer to that question but that's what what are the back of my head like the education suffers but these guys are getting rich it doesn't add up for me and at the moment there's so much scrutiny on this space and particularly nfts and so much negative pressure from particularly the gaming world but then by extension the metaverse world i talk to companies that are building in the metaverse from the gaming side like um like ubisoft for instance massive amount of pushback on ubisoft for proposing nfts as part of you know their publishing strategy and that it's getting really really irate and unpleasant it's getting ugly and that is that's this doesn't help you know it just it just reinforces it it absolutely is it's the wrong image to be putting out to to call it the mainstream because i love charlie munger i've been to a berkshire hathaway shareholder meeting warren buffett and charlotte like i like it's i have a as like a 27 year old woman i have like a weird amount of like love and obsession for for both those two humans um so i and i understand i mean they're they weren't into attack either right like this is obviously the kind of thing they would they would absolutely hate um but yeah i think i think you're right i also though i'm like in the long term it'll it'll wash itself out like you know in the long term we're here to stay this is the bubbly part it'll all there'll be a huge collapse at some point and you know it'll it'll find sort of an uh an equilibrium so in the short term we're getting a lot of bad press and this [ __ ] doesn't help it in the long term i think it won't matter yeah attention that you say that because i think you're right and you're wrong there's so you have these increasing kind of levels of category of of types of coin types of project it used to be it was bitcoin [ __ ] coins and the two were kind of correlated and sort of went against each other but it sort of they went as one group nfts are proving that they they don't want to play by those rules and d5 also has its own weird cycles but within nfts of course there are just an enormous number of different types of application of nft it's not as simple as it being a [ __ ] coin then et i mean at the end of the day it's nothing to do with art it's just a simple wrapper for information that can be proven to be unique on the blockchain that's it so what an nft is and where it wants to be can be whatever it wants and we've talked about on on the fire this this idea of btc resistance and it's not necessarily resistance to um you know maximalism or anything else it's more about if btc takes a [ __ ] does this category take a [ __ ] as well stable coins do not on the whole they they sometimes d peg but only mildly nfts are starting to to form some kind of culture they're starting to decouple yeah but it's cultural the way they're doing it so if you if you watch a tv show you don't care what bitcoin is doing and if your tv show has these characters that you love but they also happen to be nfts then why would you care what bitcoin's doing so there's this cultural resistance to the movements of btc that i'm i'm keeping an eye on it's just a theory at this stage but there's this anything that's btc resistant i'm interested in because it means a bear market will not affect it as badly as everything else so i don't know anymore i think you know we always go yeah there'll be a big bear market and there will be for bitcoin and all coins because it's the four year cycle it's what happens but for everything else i i don't know but i'm excited to find out well and yeah yeah we're on this ride i think where my head was going was more right now we do have an image problem to the outside world right like we're obviously just getting the world kind of hates nfc people and i i totally understand why and they hate us in part because they see these things like what deepak has done and they're like 23. like that is so obscene like all the problems in the world and you're putting 23 million dollars on this like stupid jpeg that to me is a short-term narrative problem that we should do what we can to fix right and and we should tell other stories and and you can maybe judge deepak for helping to reinforce that narrative but that to me is is going to be a short-term narrative because you know in in the macro macro sense because at some point i think your mortgage will be an nft and your bianca concert ticket will be an nft and our perception of what these things are in the broader world inevitably will expand i mean i don't know maybe we won't be calling them nfts at that point so maybe you know the most of the world they'll be called something else and they won't even realize it's an nft but i think in terms of that image issue inevitably the tech becomes ubiquitous enough that again it's sort of like i mean not that tech doesn't have an image issue right but like but it's sort of like the internet boom like internet doesn't have an image issue at this point i don't know if it did it won't because it's just so ubiquitous well what was interesting was the whole super bowl thing so there's so many crypto companies were there yeah and i did a podcast just yesterday where one of the co-hosts said well it was really amazing you had these two ape owners on stage well yeah they were rappers you don't call them tesla owners because they own teslas we do call them nape owners though i thought that was really odd it's like wow this human owns an ape and of course they have these apes as their twitter avatars and that that is more of a thing than owning a tesla but it's still it's still it's just a possession you know but we have kind of come to this point where we're defining it as this thing and it's bizarre and i wonder how long that's going to continue do you think yeah do you think though you know that's the people who are in this space we're so excited when the mainstream recognizes us right and that we feel like we're we're finally trojan horsing people so to speak like you know again the comparison to the internet if it was like uh you know hey there's two people up on stage who both use like broadcast.com or you know like whatever it was that like do you think it's really just that or there is something more fundamental because nfts are tied to culture where like we will forever more like associate people with the nfts we've seen them have well i can compare it to 2017 where bitcoin suddenly kind of took off again there were quite a few things that that were interesting about that time first segwit got switched on and that we sort of opened this door to the possibility of bitcoin becoming a lot faster and a lot cheaper to use as it turns out it didn't really go down that way but suddenly everyone was interested in bitcoin and what bitcoin could be so then we had the iso craze and there was literally everything had a token everything could be tokenized and there was this massive excitement about that and then you started to see this idea of mass adoption like macedo who's going to be mass adopting this stuff it turned out to be a complete smoke show whatever you want to call it but the every little moment where somebody you know there was bitcoin advertised at a boxing match you know did you buy launched a minecraft server like everyone was like oh my god it's real it's happening everyone it's now and then four years later uh yeah this is all [ __ ] it's you know nfts i feel like they have they have more graspable tangible ownership value to people than a than a [ __ ] coin and it's a lot more fun to own them than it is to own and trade [ __ ] coins and it's a lot harder to sell them so people generally huddle because they can't get rid of them in a hurry if they need to so again speculation but i feel like we're just you know we're just gonna have to see and i more than ever i feel like the nft space as vast as it is is just making its own rules up now and i'm i'm excited by that because it it's it's the way it should be absolutely yeah yeah we've talked on this podcast a couple times about the kind of decoupling are we no longer really pegged to the the bitcoin and that sort of market in terms of what happens here everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axi infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto.x or dot nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log into web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com okay uh another topic i think you would you would want to talk about this i'm really excited to hear your thoughts i have a couple on this x2y2 marketplace um i want to give folks sort of on an overview there and and your thoughts this is a another new nft marketplace that sort of springing up trying to be truly very like community owned decentralized well i think you've summed it up though it looks rare it looks where it proved that the vampire model which you know famously sushi swap vampire uniswap and so x you know x2y2 trying to do the same thing go i think it was go and list 50 nfts or nfts from five different collections and you'll be eligible for an air drop as it turns out the air drop wasn't that valuable and the the edge of itself the mechanism was problematic so they had to pause it but there were people who it was like seven percent of the the people who were eligible were still able to stake even though the air drop itself was paused and there'd been a few different problems with it i actually when i looked at the x2y2 site i actually preferred it to looks rare it felt it felt very much like an open c type experience it was very very much easier to to search for you know the items that you wanted to find looks rare was like just i mean it was a sexy airdrop right and then the wii rewards for everything else it was just like it was a fun thing but then you know you get the other side of it which is you know the team dumping their weave and not their tokens that's a new one so yeah i mean there's no doubt that openc is is not the greatest marketplace in the world it is difficult to navigate around it always goes down but it is the best that we have and like if you're going to disrupt it you need to bring your a-game and it's fine to give teams an opportunity to get up to speed and get going and you need to kind of scale in and you know and the vampire attack is a good way to do it but like you know once the volume drops off or the wash trading goes away then then what have you got left you know yeah well that's what we're seeing for folks who haven't been tracking this so looks rare looks very volume was massive but it's really been based on uh the wash trading and so there's there's a ton of volume but there's actually not a like the daily active users are are kind of far below what opens he has and you had i think it was last week uh exactly they they have the rewards you get right they're doing this having where like the rewards you get for trading on there are you know becoming less and less and you have the rewards and the activity drops you know quite precipitously so it you know it does seem like they and there's plenty of time left but these these new marketplaces who are trying this vampire attack and trying to just steal openc users um so far hasn't proved to be a lasting no and and we're all we're all just kind of waiting for the coinbase nft marketplace um is that coming along like what were we looking at someone else is setting up an nft marketplace um i sent you a link to it who was it oh oh um the the new york stock exchange new york stock exchange yes what what are they going to be selling as nfcs well it won't be art probably it'll probably be financial positions or some kind of um derivative that they can represent as an nft that makes more sense to me than than it being jpegs um because yeah i mean that's fascinating i i didn't get a chance to look at it but like i didn't even know is the new york stock exchange like privately owned i didn't even i would think of it as like well that sounds to me like yeah the government is setting up a marketplace like it's that's a story for another day um because i haven't done enough homework on it so i would look foolish if i tried to comment on it but yeah the new york stock exchange does some strange things from time to time but that's definitely something to take to take notice of but i think the the coinbase nft if they eventually even get it off the ground because who knows who knows what is poking around in their books at the moment you know they've just announced they're hiring 2 000 new staff this year do you know how many staff they have new york stock exchange they've got about two thousand one hundred staff at present they're hiring two thousand more this year doubling their doubling their stuff oh wow there's an interesting story there i'll i'll dig more into this cause i actually am fascinated what is going is there do you know what's going on i know well you know exactly what's going on it's this it's it's go time there's this is that level of expansion is very reminiscent of facebook this extraordinary just the world is now opening up and it's every single person on the planet is a potential customer that's that's the coin based narrative right now and so the vcs and whoever is advising them is just like that's where they're pushing them you can feel the same thing this is like a robin hood thing like the number of people now trading stocks is just ballooned because you have yeah yeah well there's an interesting stat that came out yesterday which was the number of people who hold crypto is higher than the number of people who have a savings account in the u.s it's like 24 to 23 something like that so yeah i mean this is why the u.s government is just gargling its own teeth trying to figure out what to do with it because they're behind both china and india now russia is going to make a move at some point so you know there's going to be an international kind of arms race for stable coins and these kind of things and then that's all going to bleed into these other products and the u.s is going but we don't know how to regulate it well and then you know becomes a by you know becomes a partisan debate and all these kind of things you know you're in you're in the yang gang you know all this stuff yeah well i know i i know i have i i i should say because this is coming up tomorrow so i have to plug uh the fact that andrew yang announced today lobby three uh this is a project i've been helping him work on uh and it's it's really about building out a lobbying infrastructure for web 3 for the people of web3 there's sort of industry lobbyists out there there are other groups that are doing great work as well so this is intended to complement the work of groups like the blockchain association and and really taking a anti-poverty stance um and and using that at the talking to sort of our congressional representatives about the anti-poverty benefits of crypto and you know talking about that you know bringing the unbanked or underbanked into a financial system i mean that that's fascinating to to know that you have more people holding crypto than have savings accounts um and really using that as the the story and the language we use as we approach you know folks in congress so uh lobby three dot io gotta gotta get people to go check that out as we're talking about all the you know the regulatory risk and and you know well i think you you've dc and governments everywhere trying to figure this out i think what you just said though this the language we use it is it's way harder than you think it's really hard to detoxify crypto the moment you mention a token or a coin or anything like that you're just in this world where it's very very difficult to wipe the stink off and so the communications question here nfts have the same issue right now like you just you just have this this patina of nastiness and grime around everything that we're doing that requires a very light touch in terms of how you communicate it it is it's a really tough challenge and so i think what andrew is trying to do is gather together people who can come take that challenge on and also just really attempt to to bridge the gap in knowledge that there is because the information asymmetry is insane uh so i'm not surprised that people are having a hard time with it but gotta move fast and congress just doesn't move fast yeah we if you're not yeah if you're when it's also the uh if you're not at the table you're on the menu right like if if if web 3 doesn't really make an effort to educate lawmakers around this in an effective way like we're just going gonna continue to be their piggy bank right like i think that's what i've said this but i think that's what we saw with the infrastructure bill this past summer right where where that was sort of a disaster and it was really like the broker definition made no sense but it was born out of like hey we have this huge spending bill where can we get money for it i don't kryptos got a lot of money sloshing around like that's that's gonna be the piggy bank and i think that's what you'll continue to see if folks don't actually understand what's happening here it's just bad regulation partly born out of just disliking crypto and the whole thing but also born out of like there's a lot of money we want that money to pay for the stuff we want so um okay a couple other things here to to maybe talk about i don't know we can pick our favorites we sort of talked about super bowl commercial takes uh disney hired uh mike white sort of tech exact exec to lead their metaverse strategy he's at a very senior level i might do a whole little mini episode about this john rogers who's been on this podcast keeps me up to date on what all like the big media companies are doing on this front and has very smart as he always does analysis on like what that means about all their you know which companies basically are hiring a senior senior person to work on this versus the people who are like the companies that like have an intern you know like thinking about it um and he seems to be very bullish on this move by disney because it's somebody in la he has a whole again i'll maybe bring him on don't know if you have thoughts about that but um a sign that disney really understands what what's happening here well i mean you have to respect disney they are incredible at identifying talent and then bringing that talent into the disney universe you may feel that it's a juggernaut that is so commercially driven that it's almost impossible to ignore but you have marvel you have pixar you have the the you know the star wars universe that's all disney they build theme parks if that's not a company that is literally tailor-made for this extraordinary exotic vision of the metaverse that we have then who is and you may want to resist that and go somewhere else but like i think a lot of people enjoy just watching disney product or being in touch with the disney brand it's extraordinary how they manage to evolve they are deeply respectable company and the amount of talent that's working there is extraordinary absolutely extraordinary from when you know from someone that's made films for the you know half my life it's like like so much of the stuff that i use now it's born out of people who work for disney it's it's a it's it's i have a lot more confidence that they can pull a metaverse off than meta than the the artist formerly known as facebook yeah um yeah the hardest one i know i i don't think it was with you but i was listening to something yesterday where where it was somebody you know making that point like facebook has has innovated so little true like they've bought innovative companies but their actual capacity to innovate since their kind of initial product has been so low the idea that they are going to tackle one of the most like creatively interesting and and challenging problems of our time and do it well and win that race feels very low um yeah they're they're the biggest innovation was designing the algorithm that tapped the social graph and understanding how valuable that social graph was i noticed actually you put you put lens protocol on the on the roster here and lens is the decentralized version of a social graph that you can then build social applications on top of i'm fascinated by this so i think it's a really interesting idea and it and it's sort of the tree that spreads out is all nft based which may be a good thing maybe a bad thing but you know it's it's this idea that a comment could be an nft could be a valuable thing if you write it well and you're a good commenter and then that nft could then in the future become collateral to get a loan because you write great comments i mean this is wild and this is like when people talk about this people talk about the over financialization of everything i agree but then this like your your reputation as someone that comments thoughtfully or badly maybe as well could then become you know a rationale for you to to you know be eligible for a house like what what it's so wild and gosh i've i've said this on a couple of podcasts now i think back to back so i apologize if folks are getting sick of hearing me say this but there's the is it the f there's the financial financialization of everything argument and the the flip side of that is suddenly now people with all sorts of different talents and ideas and whatever can make money off of a thing that historically they couldn't right like potentially you're good at spotting the new up-and-coming young artist like you know like you're there's a world where you're better at that than goldman sachs and you can actually compete on that frontier in a way that now of course goldman will end up just hiring but the point is like the the flip side of the financialization of everything is wow now people can make money doing so many things that historically were not monetarily valuable and i think that's actually a really beautiful thing it ties to this anti-poverty piece which is like how can we get you know folks how can folks earn a living doing doing things that previously were really undervalued or unvalued from a market sense lens i want to quickly get people to go check that out lens.dev i think this is fascinating i read through a ton of their documentation and my brain still is exploding from it i think that's supermassive yeah what is it it's not even that hard to understand because at the moment basically it's a set of tools and what those tools are designed to do is take each piece of a social experience and turn into something that can be tracked can be verified and can be transparent on a blockchain and it's actually a very elegant piece of design to do that but nothing's built there yet it's literally just a protocol well that's the problem there's no front end right so like i under like i can understand it conceptually of like you have a profile and that profile is an nft and then folks comment and that con that engagement can potentially be an nft and but like how this will i'm like i need to play with it you know like i need to be able to go on somewhere and like watch it play out uh to really kind of i think have it sink in but i think it's basically if you think about it in terms of a pc that you would build every you know your pc can be has a keyboard it has a mouse it has a screen you can add more things to that pc to make it more valuable and make it work better for you and you can swap them in and sort them out it feels a lot more like that and over time you build up a kind of understanding of your machine but it really is it's it's about the reputation that you have and then different touch points being able to to allow different people who might not have the skills that you have to be a part of your journey with you but then because the social graph is transparent it'll allow anyone to see where the heat map is where the activity is but it also might be able to to show people where there isn't anything and the is underserved and then start to build things that might serve the community and then and then you know do a good job of drawing them there the flip side of this is it could be really easily gamed so you'd have to figure out you know where is the game of the gaming going on and you know where is the illicit activity going on but the great thing about the open the graph being open is that you'd be able to have a dual analytics style you know overview everything and then you would have armchair forensic detectives who would be able to just say well this is happening and you'd have the exact expertise of the space that would that would pop up and problems would get spotted a lot quicker i think that's one of the things that's that's not talked about enough in this space is the the citizen policing of the space that goes on like people spot problems fast they alert problems fast and then they sort them out and like the weird thing about the energy space is that it amplifies all the worst aspects of humanity but it also amplifies all the best parts but we never talk about that you know if someone has their their wallet hacked like invariably members of the community offer to make them hold again or give them something or they rally around nobody ever talks about that but that's part of that experience as well as much as the hacks and the rugs are we just talk about the rugs more because they hurt more but you know it amplifies the good as well as the bad and here end of the rant well i'm yeah beautiful rand uh i i'm also excited by and you know the idea of sort of transferable reputation and what that can do of course i think biology of austin talks about this quite a bit right but like and others but you know you are on twitter and you're big but that means nothing for your instagram which means you know you have to start from scratch anytime you want to create new content on a new platform and if if you have this transferable reputation where it's an open social graph and uh you know you can move from sort of one style of platform to another um with that reputation transferred that's a exciting thing and it means that creatives can dabble in you know being a wordsmith on twitter and and starting a youtube channel and you know all these things and it's um and that reputation follows you yeah absolutely i mean which is our journey in at the moment we we're filmmakers that cover defy and everything else and we try and add the filmmaker create a component to what we do we're trying to do it more and more and we're on this really bananas journey into unreal engine and producing virtually that is hard i mean that is seriously hard and so we want to share that journey and help other people kind of jump into that journey as well and that's why we're talking about the v tubing and this kind of thing but like our niche where we are has nothing to do with that and yet that's what we're doing so we want to be able to share that but it means a new channel and then we'd have to start from scratch and like i want to be present on instagram because i know that what we do is very visual and it would make sense on instagram i don't have time for that it's just impossible so i i totally agree i'm like i can handle i feel like i can hardly handle my once my one social channel which is primarily twitter i would love to be doing more on instagram but i'm like the overwhelm i feel at having to like dedicate to another channel yeah it's not possible it's kind of perfect it's not possible yeah but yeah i mean that's that's the exciting thing about where we are at the moment there's there are these tools that are growing up they have the kind of emergent at the moment but they all tie back into these pfps these nfts and the ability to use them like with fluff world you've got these burrows i'm really excited to try to borrow and like like download the model and or you know put a fluff suit on and actually pilot the fluff for real you know we're just starting to get to the point you'll see when you see the promo for the nfc show we're doing later um what we've managed to accomplish today in unreal engine got it was blood sweat and tears but it's just starting to get there it's our version of the metaverse and we control it and we have the basically the version of a holodeck here but you know if we can share that with people and show it to them and say well this is where we could be going and it's really hard but like you know we're going to try and see what we can do with it then then that's fun but again it's all entertainment that's all it is well on that note i think we we made it through moses i'm we're at the hour mark i don't know if you have uh i don't want to take up more more time than well i have to give i'm also aware that i think my my airpods are dying well no i think just one last thing we should just talk about what are we excited about coming up because i have two projects that i think are worthy of ever mentioned um one of them is cyber brokers from josie badini so josie is a like really like really renowned like pioneer crypto artist who's been a little bit quiet of late but she's been putting together this i hate to call it a pee pee project but it will have that element to it there's a whole story behind it but it's all cyberpunk and the characters are really interesting and there's a lot of digital fashion involved we're going to be interviewing her later on today but she's just someone who's got so much respect from all corners of the community in terms of what she's done in the space and everyone's really excited to see what that's going to be the other one i'm really excited about is the akuvas so this is michael johnson this is aku um and he's doing a whole bunch of um pfps as well but like the story behind that he was a former professional baseball player but it's um kids of color going to space it's a beautiful story and like i just think like it's one of those projects i really don't mind telling people about it doesn't make me feel dirty this you know it's it's a good one so that's what i'm looking forward to awesome uh i'm looking forward to the parallel pack drop which i've mentioned before i think it's like a week or so away february 26th um i i don't own any parallel cards and i like every time i go to buy them on a secondary i just get overwhelmed by like where do i even start so i feel like a pat the pack drop is where i'm hoping to start yeah there's the there's the se versions there's the sc versions of the regular versions and there's like the para sets and there's 66 you know and i once was trying to ma and i was like oh god you know and then there's the different parallels themselves and i'm like and they're gorgeous they're all gorgeous they're gorgeous i know so i'm like do i just buy the cheapest ones just to get myself in the thing in the ecosystem i don't know whatever because they're all cool yeah we talked we talked to them a while back about doing a fictional story that would be set in the parallel universe that we would that we'd build in unreal engine and then have a whole story we're not quite there yet but i think by the summer we might be ready to take that on which would be really fun that that there's such a meld there with like your brand and how you guys do things so artistically and their brand and their artistry that makes sense and would be very cool i i look forward to that hopefully happening this summer um timepieces are in their burn phase i i've kind of talked about this i'm i'm a fan of this latest drop from time uh you can basically you can could mint an initial like time piece which had like these slices or slices of time it was called and then you can burn it to to get like an artist's work of a time cover uh i'm going to burn mine and get a time cover but i haven't done it yet so that's sort of uh we're in that phase now which i'm looking forward to and then there's this project called ragnarok meta it's uh i'll link to it for folks this is very much not financial advice like there's more due diligence i want to do on this but it has me intrigued i like their their web page which is always like a a marker for me that's how i felt about kara furu you know i just get good vibes from the page i think the team the team has put out a number of like medium posts that i thought have been thoughtful it's a play to earn game um yeah it's it's it's pde but it's very much a you know it's a game and um i'm intrigued and they're minting i think they said now it's early march i think they pushed back their mint date um and i i think it's i think it's interesting so that's the other one that i'm kind of i again have to do more diligence on that's like on my list of kind of track it more closely but i'm throwing it out there for folks if anybody else wants to look into it and uh give thoughts truly truly this is like i'm not telling anybody to buy this project it could end up to be terrible but uh it has me it has me interesting you can go and play the game already so it's like a well you you can play yeah that's like on their home page you can play like the early version of the game which i liked i liked that like we already have a proof of concept thing it's not the full game but it's like you can go and they have like you know kind of fun music on the homepage there i don't even have it pulled out yeah no i was playing it before before we got on and it was like oh well this is fun this is fun i mean it's pretty basic but it's um it's it's super basic but the fact that they have something and and it gave me that fun feeling inside of like oh i kind of like this vibe felt to me like always a good sign yeah we we had a project on called pixel world i think a few weeks back and it was the same kind of vibe we had them on the stream and it was just like there was just a mob boom the whole screen was filled with people going i was like welcome to 2022 everyone the post-covered face of humanity in all its glory well there you go plato i also want to correct i don't know if it's played iron and i think i may [ __ ] that up it's it's like one of these mmos if it isn't it will be because everything will be i

awesome things yeah awesome not amazing awesome because like anyone can understand the word move fast is number one which is so telling like you know when you first start reading those lists you assume it's like not about how you are treating each other because like if if it were like you know just out of wanting to save face like the number one thing is like treat everybody with respect or whatever but he puts that you know you actually do put that there but it's number five yeah like his lizard puppet is doing a good job though but the the last one meta metamate me you could just see
