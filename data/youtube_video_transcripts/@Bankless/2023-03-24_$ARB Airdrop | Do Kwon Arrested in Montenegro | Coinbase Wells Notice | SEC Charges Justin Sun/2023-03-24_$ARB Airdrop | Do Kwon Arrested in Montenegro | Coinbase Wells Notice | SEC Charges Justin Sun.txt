dokwan was just arrested Montenegro David you excited about that ladies and gentlemen we got him bankless Nation happy fourth Friday of March David what time is it oh Ryan it's the bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto especially this week is uh absurdly crazy uh I feel like I say that every single week but it just keeps on getting crazier uh and so that's what we're gonna do today cover the entirely Weekly News in crypto with coffee yes and you have a new Vista behind you uh where are you today you're not you're not in your your place I'm very very far away from New York I am in the Dominican Republic I'm a pleaser Dow folk and other people around the crypto space uh tropical location and you're right and there's uh there's so much to cover I feel like the 2020s are just like this like every week is going to be a little bit crazy um that's how it's felt since uh covid maybe before that I don't know uh but let's talk about what we're doing we got some big topics of the week number one the arbitrum airdrop has now dropped did you claim it we got a price we gotta talk about that what else are we covered uh both Balaji and Hayes Arthur Hayes are signaling wartime for crypto on different time frames but both agree directionally that this is the big one so we'll talk about what that means and also all the people who think that they are both full of we'll talk about that uh and then on different front lines uh the SEC has issued a bunch of Wells notices and subpoenas uh these are real facts not just rumors this time so we'll talk about all of those um interestingly uh coinbase got a Wells notice but coinbase seems pretty ready for it so is this the sec's final push and then breaking we uh bankless broke this you wanna you wanna talk about what bankless broke around though Quan was arrested in Montana uh yeah well you know what he he kind of broke himself after he broke Luna and Tara uh and now he's been arrested I guess in uh we'll tell you where we'll tell you the location and the details when we get to it um all right David before we get into it this is a message for the dev listening to bankless if you are a developer did you know for you amazing developers uh out there that there is now an nft API that is being provided by infuria really cool new product from infuri David you want to tell them about it yeah so if you are an nft Builder this is for you this is a new SDK kit that provides you the tools to write across five different blockchains all the smart contract templates for ERC 721-115 to allow you to aggregate your data across all the chains so whether you are building something that mints nfts buys nfts sells nfts Etc uh inferior has got this SDK to help your Builder life get easier so there is a link in the show notes for you to access all of that SDK information you can register with inferior and then you'll be able to make an account and get that SDK and Builders thank you for being a builder make this space better this is definitely the the build Market not the bear Market uh speaking of markets let's get to the Bitcoin price are we up on the week or down oh we're a bigly on the week start of the week 25 000 a very respectable twenty five thousand dollars is where we started we are up 10 Ryan oh over 10 since I put these numbers in we are right twenty eight thousand two hundred dollars we were up last week too right green very very two very green weeks for Bitcoin I'm uh I'm zooming out on the Kraken charts here Kraken Pro of course you know what thanks to Kraken for providing these fantastic charts uh this is a another big week back to back two in a row we'll talk about Bitcoin a lot because I feel like it's narrative season and Bitcoin is in the spotlight but before we get there eth price what are we doing on the week East price starting the week at 1660 it was up six percent when I wrote These numbers down when it was 1750 but we have just hit a very large green candle we are all the way up to 18 15. so okay this is a moment bankless Nation pull out your price Checkers check yourself that's the actual price we are recording this at 11 eastern time on Thursday yeah so we are almost 12 hours behind you if you're listening to this Friday morning so uh right now for us ether price is 1818. for you guys I don't know what it is yeah well we're like 24 hours behind you guys probably um eat Bitcoin what about the ratio that tells a story of itself ratio David yeah what about the ratio are you sad about this because I bet the ratio is is it up or down from last week it's down from last week we were down five percent on the ratio so we are down to the low low price of 0.0645 we hit uh almost as low as 0.062 which is uh lower than has been in a long time uh uh not lower than it was for the three Euros Capital liquidation that was really low uh but uh it is pretty unequivocal that Bitcoin has won the last two weeks Bitcoin smash whole season for Bitcoin Bitcoin smash it's gonna be okay though David like are you are you upset about this or is this just whatever noise like this is a 18 plus long-term hold so like the a two weeks of Bitcoin narrative season is not I'm not sure my Reserve is not shook um can we zoom out Bitcoin ordinals does not change my thesis about about ether uh when in doubt zoom out David how far should we zoom out to uh to make these numbers feel better for you should we go all the way back to you 2021 right so on the far left of the screen right zoomed out all the way to 2020 when the Bitcoin ratio was down to .025.03 where we're over double that and so ever since this bull market when ether hit the went from .03 to 0.09 or so uh we haven't gone down below that so you can see the three rows Capital liquidation area uh in July of of 2021. uh so we are still at this flight plateau uh but we are at a local low in The Ether uh appreciation versus Bitcoin from the last bull market yeah do you remember this whole season here was this after defy summer where there was it was a huge Bitcoin narrative and the question was did you even need ether as an asset you could just buy tokens plus Bitcoin plus Bitcoin you got the money and you got the um the finance systems and then you get full exposure to the market that was the narrative and that's what we were seeing over here it's funny you can get into that age-old question of does price Drive narrative or does narrative Drive price which is like the answer that always to me has been yes uh they drive each other and uh so we're definitely in a good narrative season for for Bitcoin maybe we'll get to that in a little bit but uh crypto market cap is up on the week question mark uh slightly up on the week yeah we are at just below 1.2 trillion dollars 1.198 trillion okay well um let's go over to Powell's world and the central Bankers for just a minute um we'll talk about more Bank stuff later in the episode but the FED just hiked rates by a quarter so they had a meeting on Wednesday this was a much anticipated meeting what are they going to do the answer is they're going to hike rights by 0.25 or a little so yeah it's not the 50 basis points that some people said that they might do um lower than that and then they also signaled some things too um the increases might stop soon Jerome Powell said that the committee is considering pausing hikes but because this is his quote events in the banking system are likely to result in tighter credit conditions that's a interesting phraseology events in the banking system uh I'll say yeah a bank run might be considered an event a crisis is an event yes uh Janet Yellen is also weighing in she is of course Secretary of Treasury of another important monetary institution in the United States she said that treasury isn't even considering guaranteeing all Bank deposits without Congressional approval so that's been a question mark that people have been asking about so with with the bailout of of some of these Banks the deposit bailout of you know signature and Silicon Valley Bank depositors made whole does that mean de facto that the treasury is going to guarantee all depositor accounts in every single Bank and Yellen says uh don't go that far that would take an act of Congress right expectations we need Congress to give us the thumbs up on that one my question to you David is like um do you think she means it or do you think it even matters do you think that by the time you need to go to request to Congress for something like this they're going to rubber stamp it anyway what's your take here uh so uh the take here that I think is safe is that the powers that be be it Congress the FDIC the FED are always going to aim on the side of mitigating paint um the bank term funding program has this one year term on it as in at that facility goes away after one year uh but is it really gonna do that or are they just saying that because they want to Tamper expectations the best that they could tamper our expectations the more that we are pushed towards normal Market behaviors but I think everyone is ready to call their Bluff because ever since the 1933 Great Depression the money military policy and fiscal policy of the United States of America has been to mitigate pain mitigate pain mitigate pain so I think it's safe to assume that they are going to make choices that mitigate pain regardless of what they say that program that you mentioned uh what's that call again called again and say that again Bank term funding program btfp you might be hearing that acronym a lot btfp if it doesn't mean anything to you I encourage you to go listen to the Arthur Hayes episode that uh we published earlier this week was fantastic David was doing it solo I was busy and uh Hayes just gives kind of a run through and explains monetary policy he explains this new acronym that I think you need to learn about you need to know this this is like the quantitative easing of uh 2023. this is the big um like I guess stimulus this is the big money printing event that is actually happening in the background quietly you David said um I don't know if you actually said this but like it's uh they announced this last Sunday I believe the btfp was this last Sunday I don't know sometime in the last week or so and they said it was only going to last for a year people like Arthur Hayes are incredibly skeptical they're like they're gonna do this and they'll do it forever and it'll never it will keep on getting renewed up to infinity and anyway he has a much better way of explaining all of these things and the simple way to explain it is that like okay the bank term funding program is meant to be used by Banks Banks will therefore use it and settle into this new equilibrium that is created by the bank term funding program once the banks get accustomed to this program undoing the program is hard especially when everyone is ready to call the bluff of like yeah one year not if we use the F out of this new facility that you just created for us and lock ourselves into that new paradigm and so unwinding the bank term funding program after people get okay what is the bank term funding program all of the illiquid underwater long-term bonds that Banks bought they get to borrow against those bonds even though the mark to market price is down 30 10 whatever down something bad they get to borrow against those bonds at the full value of them at par at maturity so they get to print free money essentially unwinding this program after they have already engaged in this behavior is going to be hard and deflationary and cause pain which is why we are going to assume probably it's safe to think that they are just going to extend the term on this so if fully used the btfp would print about another four trillion dollars this doesn't happen to me 4.4 4.4 trillion and we eased we didn't print well we did print we eased QE 4.1 a trillion dollars in covid and the bank term funding program has 4.4 of available money issuance to it so covid the largest money printing 2020 episode in U.S history since World War II we're gonna do another covid it seems like that's what the covid plus another cherry on top plus a little more and then that's not even the end of it uh by the way you got to listen to the full episode on how we get from 4 trillion 4.4 trillion to potentially like something like 17 to 18 a trillion dollars of money printing if the next Domino Falls after this anyway a lot going on we'll get more to the banking crisis uh in a minute but let's uh talk about volatility well we're on the topic of markets Banks down coins up volatility up what are we looking at I think this chart really just tells a very different story without even understanding what each one of these lines are for the bank for the podcast listeners there's about 10 12 15 lines on this screen uh they're all going horizontal and to the right and then the crisis happens the banking crisis happens some lines go up and to the right some lines go down into the right uh the theme Here is the ones that went down into the right are all banks the ones that went up and to the right are crypto assets and volatility and I think maybe there's also a Chinese Bank in here Chinese Banks up into the right I could be mixing up my charts but basically the summation of this chart is that Bitcoin and crypto assets are up bankless is up if we want to use our own terminology for this uh bank banklessness is up banks are down and also volatility so yeah banks are so 20 20. yeah you know it's like this is incredible this is the bifurcation right bankless assets up volatility also up because things are crazy Bank bank stocks go down um that's all part of the story too that we we've been talking about uh this is a take that um you tweeted out which has been sort of um a theme of our episodes this week and it's not the the conclusion of the theme but I think has definitely been a theme of the past you know two three episodes that we did Bitcoin in times of war ethereum in times of Peace who tweeted that out David Hoffman what Bitcoin or eth Maxwell as David Hoffman tweeted this out is that is that really what happened David this is not the first time I've given out this take this is a take that I've had in my back pocket for a very long time uh and now this is a moment where the market kind of understands this a little bit better um Bitcoin the philosophy the design philosophy of Bitcoin is reduce reduce reduce the code make it more simple make it more invisible make it harder to track make it more self-sovereign remove all utility from it because you need to do one thing which is hold your store of value it has this wartime crisis moment mentality in the design philosophy of Bitcoin uh the whole idea even if you could add in extra features nft features and this is why some sometimes ordinals have triggered people if you could add in D5 features that would be extra baggage extra surface area if you added to nft Features smart contracts it would be extra baggage that would make Bitcoin less suitable to times of Crisis and so what does Bitcoin do it does one thing which is store your money in a way that's outside of the system adding in extra features in the Bitcoin philosophy is making it harder to use in a wartime crisis moment and so during times of Peace Olive leaks layer 2 smart contracts account obstruction nfts defy nft Phi identity these are all innovations that happen during peacetime uh when times are stable and we can invest in Innovation and progress and development uh and there's a pendulum in humanity between peace and War uh and so the claim here is that the philosophical design of ethereum is suited to peacetime and the philosophical design of Bitcoin is suited to War uh bankless is known at least me and Ryan not not the analysts uh of the newsletter but at least me and Ryan are known to be uh ethereum biased um some white say ethereum axes I think Ryan you and I are disposed towards peacetime growth and Innovation other people are disposed towards let's make sure that Bitcoin does the thing that it needs to do in the worst possible moments of time in crisis moments uh and that's not necessarily our disposition but I think that is a valid disposition and as the pendulum of the world shifts from peacetime Innovation to crisis capital controls uh restrictions uh Fiat inflation uh Fiat demise like all of a sudden that pendulum shifts into wartime and that is my I remember last week Ryan we were talking about I said like I don't know why the Bitcoin ratio is is versus ether is up so big this is my this is my answer for that uh we have shifting from peacetime into crisis time and Bitcoin the narratives of Bitcoin whether or not they're legitimate in the foundations the narratives in Wartime benefit Bitcoin and that is my take do you want my take on your take uh sure so there are elements of that that I agree with but I think that the last part of what you said is like what uh I agree with most and the rest um I don't um probably so I think that there is a difference between um product Market fit and narrative Market fit right product Market fit is does the thing do what it's supposed to do and provide like actual utility for what it promises okay and that's one component of it you know um everyone always talks about product Market fit when you're startup and technology is the same does it have product Market fit like uh iPhones had fantastic product Market fit for instance right um uh you know some other products that we thought were going to be revolutionary never never had product Market fit and then there is something else which is narrative Market fit which is like is this are we at the point in the storyline of humanity where this narrative is going to um specifically have a moment whether this is narrative is specifically going to land I think Bitcoin has incredible narrative Market fit for this moment in time but I actually but I actually think ethereum has better product Market fit for actual wartime all right so so like if you talk about proof of stake I would 100 argue that having um thousands tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of decentralized validators around the world that can run validators from their own homes locations wherever they have an internet connection and it's much more large-scale mining operations yes it is much more censorship resistant in times of War than something like uh proof of work for example um I think that uh ethereum provides not only the like the verb of transact which Bitcoin provides in a censorship resistant way but it also provides the verb of trade like how do I trade Bitcoin for some other asset that I want without going to a centralized custodian the answer is I can't with ethereum we have uniswap we have decentralized protocols so like both ethereum and uh Bitcoin are bankless but ethereum provides more money verbs more bankless things that you can do and therefore is a better system in times of War but here's the difference it has not captured that narrative at freaking all yes and then the culture of ethereum I agree with you here totally does not lean into that right you don't find that unicorns and rainbows yeah bitcoiners are gun people exactly they're they're like the um you know the doomerism like like let's quick let's grab all of the Bitcoin we can because the world's gonna end and there's only 21 million and then we'll get kind of these uh you know underground bunkers and you know like a theory is just not that little podcast out there called Bitcoin and guns do you know that is it really yeah so so um anyway I what I would say is that um what I think we are seeing is also a narrative trade we see narrative trades in the past David like remember when there was narrative Market fit for scalability on uh crypto networks because ethereum gas fees were way too high we got all of these chains that pumped on narrative Market fit not necessarily product Market fit now I will say narratives can feed product Market fit especially for a meme energy asset like a monetary asset and so that is another Wrinkle in this where if enough people believe Bitcoin is money then it becomes money and then it you know reaches greater product Market fit uh but yeah that that is the subtlety I actually think ethereum is um better in times of war from a practical product effective then Bitcoin it just doesn't have the narrative at all for that I think if I said that that ethereum isn't meant for war Justin Drake would like roll in his grave nothing yeah no because we have so all of these like cryptography Tailwinds to protect ethereum yeah maybe maybe there's an episode out there that is like the ethereum case for wartime just to just to tie off this last bit of conversation we can move on uh Bitcoin born in the banking crisis born in the 2008 financial crisis now we have another banking crisis imagine there's still more Capital outside of crypto outside of Bitcoin than there is inside of it and all of the Trad Phi wealth managers who I will perhaps unfairly claim are 100 IQ middle curve belt uh money managers I'm doing the thing they were taught in school exactly yeah right and so they're they're going to like think about this banking crisis and they are going to consider alternatives because that's what Arthur Hayes are saying is like you must consider alternatives now and so they are going to think in their brain banking crisis Bitcoin it even is an alliteration right which actually does sound better it sounds better and so just like Bitcoin not Banks that's yeah Bitcoin not Banks like oh there's this is oh this is what Bitcoin is for even Bitcoin I think it's a lot of Tailwinds be because it's more of an idea than it is actually an execution like Bitcoin is a grandiose idea for whatever oh yeah people associate all of the features of crypto into Bitcoin sometimes naively before they unlearn about the actual fundamentals of Bitcoin but for the people who are on the outside who just understand that crypto exists to the best of their ability they're thinking Bank crisis question mark Bitcoin and that's all they have to think there you go and uh by the way if if you're listening uh but neither David nor myself consider ourselves a maximalist ethereum Maximus if anything we are bankless maximalist decentralization maximalist uh and so I'm happy to the extent Bitcoin remains bankless which it is to uh support Bitcoin in all sorts of ways okay the crypto VC list moving on uh this was really cool here's a VC list from 2020 the top 300 Global crypto VC firms by Fun Size and investment activity Ryan Alice has been a guest on the podcast previously his firm uh coinstack put this out I wanted to highlight one thing okay here's a quote from uh the the report really even as the the bear Market is here is the moment there's three times as much Capital going around as last time the digital assets industry is maturing we're seeing much more institutional Capital stick around this time this is a big deal okay in the 2019 bear there was about 470 million million dollars going from VC into like building crypto projects and crypto infrastructure in this bear Market the uh 20 late 2022 and 2023 Market there is 1.5 billion dollars a nice little 3x on that that is so like the money that is going to build and invest in future crypto startups has never been higher and uh continues to flood in that was the big finding of this report and I think it's super bullish we've called this um the build Market not the bear market and like the capital inflows are reflecting that as well there's also bankless listeners a link in the show notes if you want to see who's moving the most money like it goes through uh you know a16z all the way to like Galaxy interactive all of the largest uh crypto VC funds and I I found that data really interesting uh anything on that David before we move on yeah uh We've we've talked I've gone back and forth I was like man this spare Market is not so bad to oh my God this bear Market is so bad at least in terms of capital flows into people's salaries to allow them to maintain to work in crypto during this bear Market that has been better than it's ever been so wow we've still had the FTX we've still had the alamitas and and the three hours capital and the dokwans at least we are still paying people's salaries that's right and look we needed a cool down anyway it was getting out of hand so um yeah so I feel like it's much healthier David what do we have coming up next oh my God we get to talk about the arbitrum airdrop uh the price has been I've been watching The Price It's been jumping all around so we're going to talk about what price is the ARB token uh well just a few hours later bankless listener you're going to have them more information so this is the time to pull up the art price and you can tell us but in addition to that coinbase and Sushi swap has received a Wells notice a sushi swap received a subpoena Credit Suisse we're going to talk about the collapse of Credit Suisse and the banking crisis that is hit Europe and we also have an Euler hack update uh it's good news we think so we'll talk about that and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially Kraken who according to uh biology and Arthur Hayes uh you need to get out of the Fiat banking system uh so I would suggest that you use Kraken to go from Fiat to bitcoin if that is your asset of choice uh so if you're going to flee the financial system make sure

gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop dokwan was just arrested the Montenegro David you excited about that ladies and gentlemen we got him um we don't have much information at the time of recording but uh we did find this out in Montenegro this is a translation I believe montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives Most Wanted wow South Korean citizen dokwan co-founder and CEO of singapore-based terraform Labs the former cryptocurrency King is that what he was who is behind losses of more than 40 billion dollars was detained the airport with falsified documents and South Korea the U.S and Singapore are demanding the same wow expanding the return of doe Quan uh interestingly enough uh we actually broke this news I think we were the first ones on Twitter to actually break this uh so yeah dokwan arrested falsified documents uh interestingly enough if you go back in time to dokwan's Tweet back in September of 2022 one of my favorite quotes now of all time out of dokwan is uh it's not like I'm on the run or anything he said this but then dokwan tell me how why how do you have falsified documents in Montenegro interesting look at this tweet uh September 17th I am not on the run or anything similar from any government agency that has shown interest to communicate we are in full cooperation we don't have anything to hide wow um classified passport seems like you might be on the run though uh so I'm gonna grape dance a little bit my first interaction of dokwan was telling him that I don't believe him that he was going to kill dye the stable coin uh here's Nick Kunkel a friend of mine who I used to work at maker goes how it started retweeting dokwan's by my hand thy will die and how it's going breaking don't Quan arrested in Montenegro and that's that's a wrap on that story moving on arbitrum they uh announced a token and they launched the token yesterday tokens at the time at the time of recordings yesterday so um this just launched now I think we have some pricing information but can you recap folks on the high level what uh what about the ARB token drop it's finally here what do we got what are the stats what are the big ones okay 12.75 of the arbitrum token will be airdropped to users of arboretum yesterday today for me and Ryan uh this is the inaugural launch of the Dow governance of arbitrum 1 and arbitrum Nova featuring on chain governance execution not just snapshot votes uh I think the maximum airdrop that you could get was 10 250 the minimum was 620 200 and 625 I think the vast majority of people got somewhere below 1 000 arbitrum tokens and of course the long tail approaches all the way to 1025. um in interestingly enough the details for there is this extra one point something percent that was airdropped to dowels on top of arbitrum uh the biggest Dows that got the Dow airdrop were the treasure Dao ecosystem the small brains ecosystem as well as GMX uh the The Leverage trading exchange on Arbitron uh unit Swap and Sushi swap got an allocation dopex and curve got an allocation and shout out to the arbitrum team that elected to do this protocol Guild got a large distribution I think three million yeah 3 million ARB tokens uh what is public goods public goods for ethereum core developers core development of ethereum fundamentally does not have a business model so they rely on grants and donations and the United and the EF uh and so uh protocol Guild is a place where people can donate money to to pay for the core development of the ethereum protocol and arbitrum as a part of their airdrop allocated 3 million arm tokens to the protocol Guild that is a great precedent to set and I'm a big fan of this I think what of the coolest things about this David is that the wallet addresses the number of wallet addresses that receive this and we're eligible for this 600 000. that's like the population of a fairly large size U.S city that's a lot of people that were eligible for this airdrop why was that uh that's a really large number that I don't know how many number people there are in D5 but that we all know the arbitrary airdrop was at least attempted to be farmed we all know that they also tried to prune to the best of their ability airdrop Farmers the 600 000 number might gut Reflex on that one is like that's a farmed number I don't think it so my take is even if it's like um like Forex farmed or 5x Farm we're still talking about like God at the low end a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand like it's a pretty well distributed airdrop and some people had you know multiple wallets for sure I don't know how well we can know that we need somebody to do who is like an on-chain analysis expert we we need some somebody to come in and do a report well I am excited about it because this is one of the larger airdrops in history in terms of distribution of addresses it's probably like uh uniswap ens and this would be probably a number three I want to say in terms of I think in terms of dollar value this is by far number one yeah but also in terms of like the number of people who received it can you think of another one like whatever the number is you know that we just got uh 247 000 addresses and that was probably like really close to that yeah anyway if you want to check to see if you received the arbitrim airdrop I recommend you go check out earnify this is earn I dot f i uh you could type in your eth address you can type in each addresses to multiple wallets and see whether you are eligible or not I've got my wallet pulled up here it looks like I got some some arbitrary tokens here four thousand two hundred and thirty dollars worth I can't wait to talk to you about price David because I think that that means some good things but this is my way to get tax liability Ryan yeah thank you this is uh this is my way to get notified of airdrop so I don't even have to think about it just put my address yeah yeah all the tax burdens that come inbound you owe the IRS one message yeah so go check that out guys and uh speaking of price though what is the arbitrum token trading at right now 1.17 ignore that down 76 that's because the Inception of liquidity is always completely arbitrary so we are trading at a fully diluted valuation if you scroll up Ryan I can read that number of basically 12 billion dollars uh what was my price prediction last week uh last year is uh last year last week I think it was between one and two dollars pretty wide range the obvious comparison is optimism here right which is what it is one billion dollars more than optimism so 11 billion is 12 billion not even actually it's like 800 million dollars higher than optimism look this is just such early days of price Discovery for Arboretum yeah this is just uh we are like three hours into this four hours no there are very big funds who got an airdrop which means they are not allocated and exposed to arbitrum who have not deployed Capital uh and so if if there are big funds who want exposure like they probably haven't fought yet I'm just it's just a extrapolation just yeah there's also investors that will have to sell at some point but that doesn't start for a year that's actually we can talk about that uh if you are an arbitrary investor you are locked up for four years there is a one-year Cliff what does that mean you get zero tokens for the next 12 months then at 12 months 25 of the total Supply unlocks for investors and then every month after that a linear uh amount of unlocks for the remainder of four years so that is the arbitrum investor token Supply um I'm not an investor uh I just know that because we did the show with the orbitrim team and that's what they said there uh there's a question I have for you though is so you got some airdrop tokens what are you gonna do with them Buy sell hold buy more sell brother you're selling the arbitrum airdrop in the middle of a bear Market one of the major layer twos you're gonna sell that thing in the in the in the bear market like what are you doing no that is what I am doing and not a financial advice of any sort of time but today is not unless you unless you need to like glow up your life right once yeah unless you have any reason to do anything about improving your own life which is a fantastic thing to do with any airdrop because this is free money and like maybe perhaps you should do that but but uh if you don't have to do that I am holding that so hard excuse my language that is not the only option though like you you could glow up your life of course but you could also just exchange it for eth if you think ether is going to appreciate relative to our tokens yeah if you do think that uh layer but ether the just platform of ethereum depends on layer twos and so it's actually like it's not like this is an application where an application on ethereum can come and go like layer twos and ethereum need each other and so this is a more formal relationship with ethereum so I'm not going to lump this into like a one-inch airdrop or perhaps even an ens airdrop like this is a more formal relationship with ethereum I'll go back to our old analogy as like ethereum is like the federal government and arbitrim is like a state in the in the union if you will so this is like a bet on California or something right uh and you know the FED in California are pretty tied together they're very interlinked economically in all sorts of ways like Jupiter and arbitrum is like one of its moons you know yeah there you go uh mixed analogies here but uh this is not a mixed message like that transition from the SEC they're coming after crypto in a big way it seems like today coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC focused on staking and asset listings this is from Brian Armstrong and a well Wells notice is basically a notice that the SEC is going to take enforcement action against you and your company at some point in time I am calling this and I call this on Twitter a war on crypto David some people were triggered by that Warren crypto he's being hyperbolic uh Enterprise synthesis said this please stop um here's my comment I just want to defend why I think this is a war on crypto this is not the only action that we've seen coming out of the US government this is part of operation choke point part of in choking off a silvergate part of maybe some action and silver Signature Bank I'm part of this whole plan it seems like to choke the entrance and the exits to crypto and so my reply is this no this is I'm not going to stop enough is enough it's absolutely ridiculous the SEC is ruling by enforcement Gary Gensler is an emperor King we need to speak out we need to organize we need to push back unelected bureaucrats don't get to make the rules and the reason I care David is because I live here I live in this country so uh this cannot this cannot stand uh anyway could you get into more details on what exactly the SEC is is alleging here and what they're trying to do with coinbase staking uh I really wish I could Ryan but that's one of the issues is that they're not giving coinbase the people that they are serving the wells notice any of the details and that's one of the big parts of this story a Wells notice is actually meant to be delivered in good faith to the company or organization that the SEC is about to sue to inform them of the reasons that they are about to sue them the reasons that coinbase that SEC stated to coinbase is that they have Securities on their exchange and also staking their staking product is a security uh and so coinbase in response was like which assets are they which which ones are the Securities and coin they've got no response from the SEC uh so which is totally asynchronous from what a typical Wells notice is supposed to provide which is Clarity and rationale and reasonings so that the cut that the the people that they're about to sue can actually like like prepare for an argument it's like actually a good faith extension but not this kind um Brian Brian Armstrong put out a Twitter thread where he said two years ago the SEC reviewed our business in detail and approved coinbase to go public coinbase runs a rigorous asset review process and has rejected more than 90 percent of assets although I will say they have some let some weird Assets in as well going forward the legal process will provide a public forum before an unbiased body where we'll be able to make it clear clear that the SEC simply has not been Fair reasonable or even demonstrated seriousness of purpose when it comes to engagement on digital assets so Brian Armstrong's saying uh we've been in compliance we are compliant we've always wanted to be compliant the SEC said that we were compliant when we have sec filings they they went public they have S1 filings right and then the SEC comes in and says hey we're going to sue you guys here's your wells notice and then yes and the coinbase is like why because you guys said this was okay a while ago but no you're saying it's not the rules have changed and we're not going to tell you how they also which rules have changed and how have they changed like like we're not going to tell you guys that yeah we don't have to tell you guys this is uh coinbase legal coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC after years of asking for reasonable crypto rules we're disappointed that the SEC is considering courts over constructive dialogue courts over constructive dialogue but this is some of the fight here but if courts are required so be it will defend the rule of a law wow this is uh coinbase is I believe Chief legal officer here saying that they're gonna go to court okay you're throwing down by the way we just had uh Brian on the podcast and this is what he said we asked him specifically about staking and we're like hey Brian you know Kraken staking has been banned in in the U.S what do you think the Fate is for coin uh coinbase State and he's like well it's you know different uh because of XYZ and also if they come after us we're going to fight them in the court system uh that seems to be the approach okay game on SEC we've got evidence here is uh Paul talking more over the past nine months coinbase has met with the SEC more than 30 times sharing details of our business and to build a path to registration this is like the kid in the front of the class the straight A student who's like abiding by all of the rules that they know about and like the teacher comes in and just like rips up their homework and is like this is not what I wanted like I mean I I don't think the kid I just don't understand um you know why this is happening other than again we had Hester person earlier this week and uh she said explicitly that this is about a land grab for the SEC and Gary Gensler in particular I use that name she didn't use his name but uh Gary Gensler in particular trying to get um land in the sphere of crypto I think it's I think it's that and also David I think this is part of a broader war on crypto right if you like just uh rule by enforcement and you don't provide any Clarity what else like what else are we to assume you know banks are getting choked off coinbase staking getting choked off they're trying to do all the right things they don't even know what the laws are so you can't even abide now they're getting choked off this is a war on crypto in my opinion I actually think that this is bullish believe it or not well I actually don't know if coinbase sock went down or not uh it went down it went eight percent down after hours but I don't know what it is now who knows like yeah that's because a bunch of Trad five people uh own it and they're probably not like exposed God I'm so mean to try to fight people well like it is bad in the short run right it means like your short run right okay but like here here's my case for this right the coinbase was not naive that this is happening right they were prepared for this they saw the writings on the wall uh the SEC is going for more and more people deeper deeper into crypto they came for Kraken not even a month ago and so they've been prepared for this they have legal staff they understand their arguments they already have their arguments that they're going to take to court ready to go packaged on a boat they they were ready for this the SEC and Gary gensler's maniacal behavior is he's icarusing he's doing his Icarus moment he's flying way too close to the Sun he's going against he became a main character he's doing the whole influencer thing he's like out on Twitter like trying to get for engagement Gary the influencer uh he's going up against the most well-capitalized well-supported well-constructed organization that is doing everything by the book to the best of their ability he's going to go to court the SEC is going to lose I'm not a lawyer they're going to lose uh and and now we're going to get clarity because coinbase is going to give it for us because they took Gary Gensler to court and Gary genzer is going to effing lose and so not only are we going to push back against the SEC manually over the front lines via trench warfare in the court we also just got the FED pivot bro so like the SEC is is on the defense the interest rates are are on the retreat that's bullish man I I look I agree with I agree with the long-term uh take and like so okay so I don't think that coinbase is going to do the strategy of let's settle with SEC because that would be the worst possible outcome I think and the easy way out well this band will just settle we'll pay the fine and we'll move on with our lives I think they'll take it to the to the limit to the brink yes and we're going to the Supreme Court if we can but David this will take years this is the pain of the court system right like we're talking at least two years maybe even longer for this all to get resolved and that's what sucks maybe Gary Gensler is just trying to like slow things down or something I don't know what a strategy is but that's part stuck yeah by the time when is Gary gensler's term up in 2026 or something that's what I'm saying and he doesn't care it'll be the next person who's uh the chair um and uh you know hopefully Hester Pierce you know 2024 2025 please please don't hold on Hester well she her term ends in 2025. actually yeah yeah I know so before Gary's you know yeah there's lots we could say there Brian quintends a former um cftc commissioner himself says the wells notices are intended to afford targets an opportunity to defend themselves in writing before the charges are filed that's what you said the vagueness of this note is deprives coinbase that opportunity lacks due process yes um this is Jesse who we had in the podcast um one of the the key brains behind the the base chain I'm proud to work for coinbase based in ethereum we've remain committed to updating the Global Financial system creating more economic freedom in the world while there you go Jesse um Sushi was hit with a subpoena this week anything you want to say about that uh yeah no I don't know I don't know any details I'll be above on this title uh I mean Sushi swap not too long ago they posted their like salaries for all of their team members and so it's kind of indication of like oh yeah there's this there are people being paid salaries there's a centralized team here there's also the sushi token so like you can kind of see how this would trigger the ire of the SEC um I don't I haven't read the details but yeah they are hit with a subpoena same week uh also Gary is going after influencers himself crypto entrepreneur and celebrity promoters face SEC charges So Justin's son was named Lindsay Lohan is targeted by the SEC charged by the SEC with Securities Law violation so this is like why this is hard as like well yeah Justin I mean there are there are definitely scammers that we like we we want our Regulators to kind of um pay attention to and check out and um but then they also do this so the double-edged sword uh I don't know if it's worth it uh in my opinion uh Ryan remember uh East Denver week was that two or three weeks ago and I was like oh yeah the sec's got like all of these subpoenas and and Wells notices that they're ready to fire I said we said and then as we said um what was it uh carpet bombing Wells notices those are all rumors here we are well uh coinbase probably felt carpet bombed by that last uh uh by what just happened here's some Banker news banks are under pressure the contagion is spreading to Europe Credit Suisse um gone under a shotgun wedding is a CNBC title What's Happening Here uh UBS has rescued Credit Credit Suisse uh I haven't been following the story too lately but Credit Suisse which has been like a bank hanging by a thread ever since for a very long time uh finally getting under duress because of all the banking crisis banking uh issues that are going on with the whole interest rate phenomenon uh UBS is rescuing Credit Suisse do you know the details about what that means to actually rescue them uh basically uh giving them money printing the money Government funding um yeah uh UBS and Credit Suisse uh stocks plunged of course this is just the contagion spreading Beyond like you know silvergate Silicon Valley Bank and signature is it contagion or is it isn't generalized just like distressed assets owned by Banks I think when I'm talking about the contagion I'm talking about that is like the root causes these distressed assets that are underwater right all of the treasuries that are underwater long dated treasuries underwater on bank balance sheets uh not just in the United States but across the world in a new Europe and who has to come to the rescue the only person that can the person with the money printer the Fed treasury is the US government and so that's what they're doing that's uh all part of what Arthur Hayes was talking about um there's also remember the Barney Frank rumor uh there's some more evidence that maybe he was right about signature Banks so Barney Frank this is the the Frank in Dodd-Frank a former Senator he was on the board at Signature Bank he claimed he alleged that signature was closed because the FDIC was targeting crypto that's what he claimed uh and it seems like we got some more confirmation that that could be the case oh yeah he was he was basically cut and dry it was like uh we'll acquire everything about Signature Bank but no one's allowed to acquire any of the crypto companies or like take them as clients uh I I wish I had more more in my brain what that details actually were so bankless listener go investigate that but it was like cut and dry it's like yeah everything else about signature all their customers all their clients everything that they own is totally fine for acquisition except for crypto well it's it's actually so the New York Community um bancorps of flex Star Bank is the bank acquiring Signature Bank and that's explicitly what they said they'll acquire they'll assume all the cash deposits is all the cash deposits except the crypto company cash deposits so is this acquisition that was basically they said yeah we'll take everything except for crypto and there's evidence maybe that the FDIC ordered that signal that the acquirer had to divest all of the crypto business so um yeah that again is not good and I think the public deserves to know more about it speaking of this David the last thing you got to cover real quick is this whole biology bet he thinks that the US dollar is going to hyperinflate 90 days he came out like after last week we recorded the roll up and he came out this tweet I was saying this uh we had him on the podcast because he was saying some very alarming things basically that this was a bank crisis of Epic Proportion this would be the straw that breaks the camel's back that the US dollar would have inflate and approach zero that Bitcoin would hit a million dollars and he called a time on this 90 day and he put a bet out around that um yeah so we had biology on we've been kind of like tracking down this claim and getting kind of the you know the pro side and the con side together but I want to ask you because we've had a whole bunch of guests on this week I've been doing kind of these emergency episodes give me your reaction to this biology take so he spent almost two hours with us uh what do you think like do you think he's right yeah people actually we were getting some Flack for even hosting apology people saying why are you guys he's just doing this marketing campaign he's just trying to promote his bet like don't don't give in to the doomerism don't give in to the Hyperbole and I'll push of course I'll push back against that and I'll say that it's important to don't uh this is balaji's mistake he's leading with the BET which triggers a lot of people the package biology has a very well he's not necessarily the most coherent individual but he's very smart he's got a good message the package that the message came in people really did not like this one million dollar Bitcoin bet inside of 90 days apology was that was probably not the best way to lead with the thing that you are trying to say although he did make that bet in his big grandiose bet if you actually want to get your learn on if you actually want to get educated as to what biology is trying to say whether you believe it or not you need to look past that bet and hear the message that he's trying to say we did the episode with Arthur Hayes in my mind Arthur Hayes's message and biology's message are almost synonymous uh difference in time frame difference in severity but directionally completely aligned and we are also going to host counter arguments uh anti anti-domerism anti hyperinflation perspectives so that is also coming but since multiple people biology and Arthur Hayes are pointing towards the same logical conclusion of very significant inflation if the in the United States dollar that I employ eubankless listener to look past the perhaps triggering 90-day one million dollar Bitcoin bet and just take in what methodology is trying to tell you and so I don't really have an attack beyond that I'm still in learning mode I think we should all still be in learning mode but that is that's my response yeah you got to listen to both sides of the argument for sure in order to make an informed opinion if biology is even five percent right like it's a pretty big freaking deal I I guess my take is like biology was more exaggerated he put a time frame around this Hayes was much more like methodical and like approached this as a like a neutral traitor on what he thought would happen just as he's kind of evaluating the system and those episodes together formed kind of like a a package towards understanding what the threat Factor might be and the inflationary case next we're having Ben Hunt on who I think is going to push back against a whole bunch of that uh on next week we're gonna have Jim Bianco on as well who's going to give us kind of the the tradify take and I don't know quantity Jim Bianco yeah like and you understand Jim Bianco I don't know where we're gonna go next with this but our role in this is to like like we say all the time we're on the The Journey with you we are discovering this uh we want to um hear both sides and understand whether it's true and then uh decide for ourselves and have you decide for yourself David what do we got coming up next coming up next we got an update on the Euler hack update good news everyone hopefully things are trending at least in the right direction we got some money back maybe we're getting more we'll provide the details about that immutable and polygon launching a new layer 2 a Matic staking immutable flavored Layer Two we'll get the details beyond that and so much more we got some Bitcoin stuff we got some IRS stuff Ryan's favorite subject we got some CBD stuff we got some bakeless stuff so all this news and more as soon as we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible uniswap

Euler vaults which is interesting I did not see that coming especially after they put that ether through tornado cache yeah I don't know I don't know I mean they could be fearful of going to jail uh I made a decline last week that it was definitely North Korea it was probably North Korea probably definitely um I guess I was wrong on that one okay one transaction of 100 ether was sent to an address of North Korean linked actors which is confusing and then also we have North Korea attempting to fish the exploiter trying to get them to basically sneakily give them their private Keys uh which is nuts so like this this has gotten from a very sad ex-toy of a very large exploit to a very confusing story like some money I don't know what's going on North Korea is involved trying to exploit the exploiter and then also importantly the big punchline here is that using a lot of this communication is happening inside of ethereum transactions so people are writing data into the ethereum transaction and there was a message from the exploiter to the Euler hacker saying we want to make this easy on all those affected no intention of keeping what is not ours setting up secure communication let's come to an agreement so all of a sudden the exploiter uh is growing a conscience or at least they're definitely I don't think it's a conscience I think it's definitely like something is happening in the background but like I don't understand only 3 000 eth is just a tiny fraction of the 90 000 something if they stole right why were they I don't know I this is confusing I'm waiting for more data to unfold yeah what's so crazy though is that these conversations are all happening on chain and we can like observe the negotiation process uh what a bizarre world we live in but uh yeah so that's happening uh what about the IRS what are they doing uh they are IRS who formalize tax treatment of nfts as Collectibles similar to other Arts school is this guidance we're getting guidance that's kind of cool is this bullish bearish you're the tax man it's what we would totally expect right um of course the the IRS treats nfts as property just like they would a baseball card or like art or you know a classic car or something like that it totally makes sense what's what's interesting about this though David is it's in complete conflict with how the SEC wants to treat tokens and nfts which is like everything's a security right well it can't be a collectible and a security at the same time so I think unless they deem baseball cards to be Securities with not putting it out of Gary gensors do you think he wants that he wants like the Mickey Mantle classic thing depends on how big the AUM is if it's big enough you know wow um yeah I mean what I would say to the FED is like just in general all the feds like get your story straight you have different agencies telling us different things and then you're like penalizing us when we don't understand what the rules even are uh absolutely ridiculous anyway but but good news from the IRS some guidance some clarity it's not that hard I don't know how that really materially impacts me but okay just keep doing what you were doing it's ready uh Magic Eden launches a Marketplace for Bitcoin ordinals okay so this was a huge problem in the Bitcoin ordinal space we saw all of the vitriol that was pointed at yoga labs for doing the thing where they say hey give us all of your Bitcoin will custody it run the auction and then give you your Bitcoins back yeah um so now we're starting to get infrastructure around Bitcoin ordinals which means that Bitcoin ordinals has further sticking power so like we're a month two point something into the Bitcoin ordinals World more sticking power more infrastructure more routes being grown ordinals more case for ordinals here to stay cautiously optimistic I'll remain I don't know I I think it's great um I don't really have a take until I own a look I was a little slower to the nft thing too and uh I'm gonna I'm just gonna wait until someone speaks to me uh it's it's down pretty bad David uh I don't appreciate it how can it be down oh yeah that's true go it went up and then it went back down again uh but you know I'm a forever Turtle holder so um I'll see somebody with a turtle pfp no you won't still random Discord yeah the Alfalfa Discord has a turtle pfp guy in there and I'm like that's Ryan hey look they're gonna damn it Ryan someday tiny turtles will make a comeback um sad news on the blockchain uptime front no not Solana this time the Avalanche C chain has stopped producing blocks for over an hour uh this tweet said not yet recovered but it was recovered I think within two hours I believe uh so the network went down uh and then is now back up after an update was very quickly written and patched I think this is the first time or at least the first time in a long time that in the Avalanche train was halted uh again I think bankless listeners have been listening to the weekly roll up and other podcasts understand our perspectives as what it means for a blockchain to go down it's not great um do you want to say any more it's back up though so here's here's what I was thinking about this like whoa wow they got that chain back up really fast yeah and then I was like well that just means that they were able to coordinate really really well right right yeah but then I'm like okay well but if they went down for a really long time I would also be saying that that's bad and so like if you're down for a long time that's bad if you're down for a short time that's also bad I guess I'm just biased against chains that go down in the first place which has been what I've been saying I mean it's hard to go down not layer ones they shouldn't be uh anyway a regulatory Governor Ron desantes announced legislation to protect Floridians from a federal federally controlled Central Bank digital currency this is interesting David just some like I guess fracturing in the United States of um you know he's a powerful governor for sure I mean in in the um candidate pool for uh president for 2024 and he is saying in Florida we shall not have a central bank digital currency first of all I don't know how this works if Florida is actually able to would do that and be like yo we'll take the physical dollar but we won't take the Central Bank digital dollar so I don't know if this is just a it's kind of cool can they do that yeah but can they do this right like uh every state like Florida bucks I mean what do you do if it can't be cut off regulate up as a state but I think it's and biology would probably say this it's indicative of um some fracturing in the various uh political alignment groups around something like a central bank digital currency um I don't think the United States will will take that uh without a fight at least some factions of um politicians will and I'm I'm anxious to see this how this this plays out for what we'd call free crypto money systems right will it be like um partisan issue where like one party is pro crypto and the other party is not or will it be I mean because I I see Democrat Republican there are wins for both sides on kind of their stated platforms anyway but uh I I wonder if one party or the other will kind of take the lead on advocating for uh for crypto and what their intents might be it's interesting to see I'm holding my breath for the Democrats yeah well you know what some of their Elizabeth Warren's too high up in the power struggle and she is way too anti-crypto very anti-crypto sadly um David we got some cool stuff going on a bank list one uh just an update about uh the green pill podcast that we come out with what's this uh bankless HQ the bank list you're listening to puts out too much content so much content that we are creating uh the green pill which we typically host on our YouTube channel greenpill is getting its own YouTube channel so if you are a green pill fan you got your own YouTube channel we're managing this one on behalf of Kevin owaki uh so it definitely go subscribe to that green pill YouTube channel if you are a green pill fan if you don't know what green pill is and you like the idea of regenerative economics Global coordination how to prevent Global coordination failures or overall are a fan of Kevin owaki perhaps listen to the green pill but either way there's a brand new YouTube channel called the green pill podcast go subscribe there you go you can find that on the RSS as well uh David this is pretty cool man this is a jacket I saw you sporting in the pictures anyway because I don't go to conference as you know at Eve Denver this is what's this jacket called oh gosh a sujukan oh I'm butchering this name look at this man GQ level this is David where is sporting the jacket shout out to Dave Krugman for the uh for being the photographer here yeah so if you are at East Denver you saw me probably rocking this jacket I'm biased here but I will claim that it was the coolest piece of apparel eastender uh and so this is being made by metafactory in partnership with manufactory uh for people that want to buy it it is extremely rare there is only 60 being made in production uh and it is literally right the coolest thing uh the coolest piece of clothing that I own uh these pictures don't show it but it is also reversible uh and so if you want to not be wearing crypto you just want it to be blank you can reverse it and it's just a normal black and yellow uh silk jacket uh emphasis on it is the coolest thing that I own people can buy this now is that what you're saying it is available now yes you know this has to me have you ever seen that movie Ryan Gosling movie Drive yeah yeah that's it it's the crypto version don't don't turn into a psycho and start killing all the people like he does but uh I haven't seen the movie thanks for the spoiler okay sorry good movie though um all right immutable and polygon labs in releases as well they team up to expand web3 gaming I know we did an episode on this any high level you want to say uh yeah so brand new ZK evm it is run by polygon Matic staking to secure the chain but IMX from immutable is the gas token it is also where immutable does all of its BD there are layer threes that are available to go on this new zkevm layer 2. it's a brand new layer too called the immutable zkevm operated by polygon uh so this is like a team up like uh it's a team up okay so immutable was on uh startware Tech and so you're saying and it still is okay that chain is still up and running and now they are doing a generalized eke evm with polygon technology with the IMX as the gas token that's cool that's a big win for polygon I guess uh yes yeah a very interesting Alliance here very interesting yeah let's see how that plays out I know there's a whole episode where everyone and I are invested event investors in IMX and Ryan is a advisor to polygon uh very true David Microsoft is building a crypto wallet in their edge browser uh I haven't used the you know Windows browser in Forever Microsoft browser in a while but like they're getting in the crypto wallet game it's a big freaking deal right the default browser of Microsoft is getting a crypto wallet partnership with consensus I believe uh to offer swaps between ether uni die uscc and usdt uh but yeah I mean that's kind of crazy the default browser for Microsoft coming with a crypto wallet I think it's it's I don't know how many people give it care about Edge yeah but some people use it I'm sure there's some Edge Lords out there um all right it says wow what do we got uh sismo ZK connect this is about identity in crypto in web3 um they have just released something right so sismo it's ZK identity for your on chain footprint if you will so yes I have many many wallets I have po apps in some wall I have different poabs and other walls I have my crypto Punk and a third wallet I don't want all of those wallets to be connected via transactions but I do have my identity spread across all of these wallets the ZK connect allows you to design ZK badges ZK proofs to attest to your ownership of stuff and things and poapps or activities without disclosing your address without disclosing Ah that's really cool aggregate all of your uh wallets and all the identity properties of your wallets together yeah without linking them also without disclosing your those wallets to anyone that you need to prove what your stuff is and so they are launching ZK this is sismo they are launching uh ZK connect to get this done that's a really good use case because you know the only way I do it is I funnel through centralized exchange and then it doesn't really maintain my privacy it just makes it makes it not public this exchange knows what you're trying but what else do I do yeah give me bankless tools David I'll go bankless please what what more can I do well I got this thing called a ZK connection thank you I appreciate your help on that um David you were doing an event in uh Dominican Republic this is what it is you guys are burning stocks down there or something what's going on oh no this was in the pleaserdale offices okay we were watching it last night uh so last night pleaser Dow in their pleaser house which is their native web 3 auction house this is so weird dude three different pairs of beauty socks I think we're coming up to a total of 160 thousand dollars uh why did they do this because they are taking the ashes of these uni socks and putting them into uni blocks which is these little cubes so you're gonna have like a necklace with cubes of Ashes of uni socks and there are I think 2 000 of them and so they were sold in this web 3 Auction House Hayden Adams showed up to talk about uh one of the pairs that was burned was Hayden Adams's actual uni socks the ones that he wore he said he doesn't wear anymore because they just soaked up all of his stink that's so good is this you're not is this crypto culture I don't even know what this is I don't know what to hate this why are these socks worth 160 000 freaking dollars because they're associated with unity swap they were dropped at the same time as the uni swap token also Mike Damaris is uh just the big meme propagator of uni Sox he's a big fan of one of the founders of the rainbow wallet rainbow wall yeah and so he bought a bunch of uni socks nft tokens this on a bonding curve he's a socks influencer you get an nft if you burn the token if you burn one token you get to claim the socks yeah uh because there's only 2 000 of them and because it was the first of its kind these stocks ended up going for tens of thousands of dollars he also propagated the meme uh redeem you cowards as in like take your erc20 token burn it claim your uni socks so you can have your thirty thousand dollar pair of socks and wear them uh but the idea is like it pumps up the price of the uni socks uh because it's a fun little like economic game anyways uh pleaser house is the whole production quality of this thing was off the charts yeah they had this host uh Ali Ali Weiss who actually went to college with uh just roundabout fun fact uh doing this like show of this like this web3 auction house this native crypto culture auction house and dude so many people were in the chat participating like Mike was there Hayden was there frog monkey from formerly Bank list now unit swap Fame was there will price was there uh it was like a who's who of ethereum defy it was it was pretty cool it was pretty cool the production was insane dude it was really really I'm really I'm also a member of pleaser now so I'm biased uh but I thought I thought they killed it there you go burning socks I don't know why but they're doing it um warp cast all right this is farcaster Dan Romero's protocol we had him on the podcast fantastic it's been on mobile as an app um but now there's a web version which is pretty awesome go check that out a decentralized social networks is going to be a big theme over the next few years we think and that is one of the leading ones also Ledger is combining efforts connectivity to build a a wallet is that what I'm looking at the browser extension so browser into the browser extension game everyone's getting a browser extension these days metamask of course coinbase wallet has a browser extension uh GameStop has a browser extension now xerion has a browser extension now Ledger has a browser extension I know of one more wallet that's coming with a browser extension everyone wants a browser extension these days yeah um that's great I'll take more more competition good Ledger can certainly do it well they got the the hardware behind it would be really great great to um to connect directly into that block Works has released a grant farm so this is a crypto Grant directory so if you're looking to see what grants are available you can go to blockworks.co Grants and go check that out anything more on this like it's like a grant aggregator every single not every single many many protocols have grants out there um this is Grant farm from block works it's just a place to aggregate all of the various grants that are out there so really cool resource that's right block works yeah let's talk about the big raises this week this is the first one David um in a triple a title set gaming Ray is here what are we looking at yeah so if uh bankless lucerne's are familiar with Eve online the creators of Eve online which is apparently called CCP games has raised 40 million dollars from a16z to build a blockchain based MMORPG set within the universe of Eve online no way that's big man like one of the OG ammo with like real simulated economies and so like it's a natural fit to put the eve economy on a blockchain uh and so I think people are very very excited about this even palenia who's very hard to please these days has said positive things about this so when you know you please plan yeah he's got the highest bar in crypto of legitimacy you know you're on to something so that's pretty cool what does polinia say about it uh that it actually makes sense it's using blockchain Tech that actually makes some sense now the thing with a like a great game AAA game is it takes some time to build so this is a funding announcement it doesn't mean it's releasing anytime soon we could be like three three years plus away um but uh you don't have to wait three years to get a job in crypto do you David because we have the bankless jobs board here I'm showing it bankless.palot.com let me read a few a marketing manager at rise a sales development representative these are non-technical at rise uniswap Labs needs a senior product designer and application security engineer and a senior mobile engineer there's a whole bunch more you can read about them on the bankless job boards and get that your Alpha in the bankless jobs board and we had there was a uniswap mobile web dev job board months ago before they introduced the unit there's there's Alpha on the bank of the child support yeah get to see who's hiring and get that in your inbox guys uh we've got a lot more coming up David what are we in for questions from the nation we got two different questions from the nation the differences between layer threes on optimism and arbitrom we got a Bitcoin versus ethereum take from fiscantes uh and then we got Ryan and I are bullish on as well as a really good meme of the week not actually a meme still really funny but all of that stuff and more is coming right after we're talking some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer

get access in late February arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing D5 and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to arbitrary Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arboretum.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free questions from the nation there's a question for David hello David could you help me understand how Hardware wallets work with browser wallets oh we're just talking about that for example I was able to connect my ledger to metamask yesterday how does this work how does minibask know or store the private key from my ledger to function in this way that is from a tad zoo I think it pronounced their name correctly from the bankless nation Discord David uh how do you browsers and Hardware wallets interact browser extensions interact with tell us about that yeah super important question okay why do we have Hardware wear wallets in the first place Hardware wallets the actual physical Hardware of a hardware wallet will never allow the private key to leave its uh Hardware leave its Hardware it is a secure Enclave it cannot leave you don't even know the private key to your wallet because you are a liability because you are human so Hardware wallets are designed to never let the private key out you have your seed phrase and you can derive your private key from that but your your Hardware wallet will not allow your private QT to escape that is the point a browser extension wallet or a software wallet is like a virtual Hardware wallet but it is stored on the computer so there is a risk dependency there especially if your computer is connected to the internet and so your metamask your browser extension it's like a virtual Hardware wallet it tries to contain it's the private key inside of the software but by the nature of because it's on the computer it is not as contained as a hardware wallet now you can plug your ledge enter into metamask or now into Ledger's own browser extension and others and that allows metamask to connect to all the D5 apps that are out there so metamask is kind of like a distribution connection service to all the D5 apps that allows your Hardware wallet to connect to these things but it doesn't have the hardware wallet level security um so does that make sense yeah I feel like that makes sense totally makes sense to me and uh you know one general rule is if you're going long term Cold Storage that's a hardware wallet if you're more active than maybe a browser extension is okay for those private keys and smaller sums in the browser extension larger sums in the cold storage where it's more secure uh the mask will actually allow you to extract your private key so in metamask you can actually go and tell metamask hey show me my private key and then you can go and copy that private key and load it up into a different wallet in my head I have done this a few times for different circumstances when I've extracted my private key out of metamask I know that I have done that for that particular wallet and so I flag it in my brain saying like I've now exposed this private key to the internet and it is now no longer as secure as another metamask wallet that I haven't done that in which is also not as secure as an actual Hardware wallet and a hardware wallet won't even let you do that at all in the first place so there's always like different levels of private key security and you should understand them in your head totally uh here's a question from Jax on the dev what's the difference between building on an L3 on arbitrum versus optimism heard a lot about the op stack of the roadmap but wasn't aware that arbitrim had that option yeah Arbitron has that option as of recently this is in tandem with the arbitrum token drop is that they are launching their layer 3 surface area and so this is new to arbitrum what is different is that you can take the arbitrum code and you can deploy our another arbitrum chain on top of the arbitrim layer 2 freely and independently but if you deploy an arbitrum chain that settles directly to ethereum you need to get doubt approval of that per the open source per the license of the arbitrum code optimism does not have that restriction optimism is like like yo please Fork our code base please copy it Cambrian explosion of op stack chain is left and right pew pew pew pew open sex chains everywhere no restrictions on being able to fork and deploy an OP stack chain so the main difference between these two things other than the differences between the code although optimism and arbitrum are trying to largely become the same thing which is an ethereum synonymous Layer Two the main difference is the license and kind of the philosophy behind these different chains arbitrum is kind of like more commercial I'll say and our optimism is more Indie more developer Indie uh you gotta you gotta get to get dow approval to Fork the arbitrim code optimism wants you to Fork their code as much as possible uh and that's kind of the the second order effects of what that means are that could be a whole entire episode but that's kind of the gist of it here we go some takes of the week uh from fiscantes is talking about Bitcoin versus ethereum this looked like AI generated Graphics but one looks like this kind of stoic picture of uh I don't know a Greek philosopher philosopher yeah kind of reminds me of The Da Vinci man in the circle and he was like balanced a little bit like that it's Renaissance it's principles it's like deep it's foundational it's immutable this is like you know Ancient Ancient I think is a great word yeah and this is the AI depiction of ethereum what how do you describe this image yeah one part human one part AI definitely on the frontier a little bit of a cyberpunks uh 2077 I think is in here definitely like one part computer uh definitely futurist um definitely uh young as well I would say rather than ancient I would say say young and not yet fully manifested I would also say that yeah I just like the I like the artist our artists we talk about the future artists Ryan are always on the future more than the rest of their world and so I like the actual like idea of illustrating what these things are via art I'm sorry for the podcast listeners that aren't seeing these visuals yeah uh but you can check them out on YouTube um this is a take from Anthony sassano creating a better money is not enough we need to create a better Financial system that serves everyone in a fair transparent and decentralized way that's ethereum so a lot of uh I guess maybe traction on the Bitcoin narrative side of things and Anthony is saying hey um it's not enough to have a better money we need a whole banking system that is bankless that is associated with that money I'd probably Echo that sentiment uh what's your take on this right uh I think this is coming in response to my whole Bitcoin for war and ethereum for peace oh he was talking to you yeah so so he hit me up and he was like dude you were so wrong about that and I'm like I know I know you think that Anthony and I think he's right I think he's right I think the case for ethereum also for war is also very strong uh and I think Anthony would say that like ethereum is the like like you Ryan ethereum is the best suited blockchain for a wartime environment based off its raw fundamentals and he Anthony refuses to get caught up in like narrative war games and will always go back to the fundamentals very very quickly uh and so uh Anthony and others I think are are asking for an ethereum for a wartime type of narrative to emerge and so that's what this is yeah um I just still always think that the bitcoiners will do this better because they'll have like a Bitcoin and guns type of approach to it and like oh it's uh ethereum in the rainbows they don't have like layer twos and nfts and like defy stuff to get distracted by yeah so what do they have their time and energy to to spend on narrative I mean like Bitcoin innovates on narratives written words theorem innovates with code yeah uh all right David uh it's that point in the episode I gotta ask you what are you bullish about this week Ryan I'm just bullish on crypto man uh SEC is going to break in the same way dokwan broke the SEC is going to break they went too far too fast too high flew too far to the Sun If the Fed is signaling a pivot the end of rising interest rates is here we have the bank term funding program which is where we start to issue money once again where did this last bull market come from covid stimmies the BF the bftp is another stemi source so we have the powers that be retreating even though they're coming in very hot they're also ready to retreat so that's bullish uh again we are faced with a banking crisis and I've said this before but it's been a while so I'll say it again crypto is slowly and slowly becoming ready to accept mainstream Society mainstream Society is becoming ready to accept crypto we are meeting in the middle closer and closer and closer and so this is happening along with his banking crisis people are understanding this uh we are getting our layer twos we have two ZK EVMS Ryan launching in the next five days uh that is the way that we make crypto things look and feel like fintech uh the time it seems to be crypto's time uh it's been crypto time for a while I will say it always is cryptos time but there's just more and more evidence that we are shaping up to be just one of my bulletron crypto like it's you can see the writing on the wall yeah I um all that kind of some of that I think the banks are falling apart and we're seeing in the midst of that um Layer Two shipping and let's remember what layer twos are and what ethereum is is this promises to be a bankless financial system it is the antidote for the bank failures it's you know trustless verifiable code where you can see all of the assets what secures them and everyone can be their own bank you can go bankless uh the infrastructure hasn't been ready up to this point this is the Broadband moment of building that banking infrastructure and it's coming at such an interesting time as the banks in the traditional world are having like trouble and this new banking system is becoming available for them Arboretum token ZK sync era polygon ZK evm I mean like all this in the last uh seven days and like I guess you know a couple days from now too um one other take I'll I'll maybe share is I think that this Bitcoin narrative that probably sounds crazy to some of you listeners which is like you know the bags are dead Bitcoin is the only way out get to the lifeboats quick quick um that probably sounds hyperbolic to many listeners and uh I understand that um I also understand like past runs where um that narrative is kind of the seed to understanding like in order to in order to I still believe that Bitcoin is very much a gateway drug to ethereum because in order to actually understand the concept of digital scarcity and digital money and money over Internet Protocol IP like Bitcoin is a core acid to actually understand and as the banks are failing and then the narrative however shrill it might seem to you is um propagating via VIA bitcoiners I think what comes next is we have a season of that we might have like a Bitcoin run up on that narrative and then what comes next is this epic flight to a new trustless Financial system on ethereum and I think we might have a Bitcoin narrative like run for a while but that gets everyone exposed to this concept of digital scarcity and digital money and then that will open the gate for them to be Gateway drugged into ethereum and Layer Two as a new bankless money system that they can now call home oh Wells Fargo doesn't like has failed me the unit of account has inflated uh well I have this browser extension that I can use pointers aren't that crazy right it just opens the door so um I understand like sometimes you're like ah the bitcoiners are crazy like it sounds crazy it's happening maybe they're gleeful at this but I think that the net result is we get that wave that narrative wave will wash over us it will prime the pump to get people ready for the next wave which is be your own bank take responsibility of your private keys and the the property rights that that is entailed to you and look we got layer twos ready to receive the world hopefully well they're not ready yet but they're getting a lot closer and that's what I'm bullish on this week I'm also bullish wow wow uh meme of the week David what are we looking at here in the week this is the first meeting of the week I think I think that we've had that's all actually not a meme it's an accidental piece it's an accidental meme this is Justin Belgium to require all cryptocurrency ads to State the only guaranteeing crypto is risk simultaneously we are having a banking crisis and apparently in Belgium if you are a crypto ad you have to disclaim that the only guarantee in crypto is risk that is hilarious crypto assets are doing better than like the banking sector index if you take away the big Banks like only only guarantee I actually also guarantee you bankless listener in addition to risk you will also have fun that's right lose money we'll have fun losing you right there there could be risks certainly I actually I like that the only guarantee in crypto's Risk like I would wear that on a t-shirt honestly uh guys we have a moment life is risk uh yeah no yeah you're guaranteed to have risk no matter what um guys we have a Moment of Zen coming up um I think you'll appreciate this one uh David liked it I was worried he'd be like not like my dad humor but like it's there's forever people in this in this scene so know that and you might want to watch the Youtube all right go check that out um otherwise I'll give the risks and disclaimers got guys thank you for joining us crypto is risky maybe I'll put it like the belgic ad the only guarantee in crypto is risk but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot about the 20 bucks you owe me oh yeah well I only got ten so here's 10 I owe you ten thanks hey Moe you owe me 20. well here's 10 I'll owe you 10. you owe me 20. here's 10 I owe you ten here's a 10 I owe you here's a 10 I owe you here's a 10 I owe you good now we're all leaving
