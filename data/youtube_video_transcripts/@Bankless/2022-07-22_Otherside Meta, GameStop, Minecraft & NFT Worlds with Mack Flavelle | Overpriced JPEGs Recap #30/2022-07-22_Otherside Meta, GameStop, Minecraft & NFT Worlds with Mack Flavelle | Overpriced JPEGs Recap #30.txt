[Music] hello hello gmgm everyone thank you for the clap mac uh welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs it is weekly recap time where we talk about all the things happening in the nft metaverse industry this week and i am joined by a special guest to help me do this wrap up i'm joined by mack flavell the founder of big head club and friend of the pod you've been on the show a couple times max so thanks for coming back well i keep coming back cause it's always awesome thank you love it we love to hear that so we're gonna dive into a whole bunch of things and we gotta talk about other side meta that test happened on saturday so lots of thoughts there gamestop launched their marketplace their like nft digital marketplace i have big thoughts here i think people are sleeping on this i don't realize how big this is so excited to talk about that there's been some hacks in the industry we got to talk about and uh other other news that we'll get into but before we dive into any of this we do need to hear a word from our lovely lovely sponsors there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started on your nft journey you need metamask and if you need to fund your metamask account in order to buy that nft that you've been eyeing well now you can do that directly through metamask just click the blue buy button on the home screen personally i'm mad that i've spent extra gas fees transferring money from coinbase to metamask in order to buy nfts i've been using metamask directly and it is so much better you can also buy stable coins and native tokens from ethereum polygon avalanche celo and others and you can do it directly with your debit card your credit card through apple pay or google pay and there is now an improved buying experience on metamask mobile you'll only see tokens that are in your region so it's personalized to you and you'll get real-time quotes so you know you're always getting the best deal if you haven't downloaded metamask yet what are you waiting for go try it out you can learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with metamask at metamask dot io buy dash crypto okay other side meta this test happened on saturday about 4 500 people entered other side other side which is board api club hugo labs metaverse initial thoughts mac or do you want to give give contacts for folks do you want me to set up some context i want to hear what you think uh so i think a couple of things one i have like an allergic reaction to when we say so and so apostrophe s propriet proprietary metaverse in my opinion every time that we have to say somebody's metaverse we should actually replace the word metaverse with miniverse because if it's your metaverse then you missed the entire point of the metaverse and so all these different contenders were like were building the metaverse feel like oh right everybody should extend the world that you're building everybody should play in your sandbox because that's true decentralization you're missing point so i i have this whole thing but like meta verses and there is no such thing as meta versus plural there is going to be a metaverse or not but a multitude of metaverses means that the metaverse failed in the first place then we're just sitting on a 3d website then we're just at like disney.com or facebook.com with 3d models and that is not the metaverse so that's really interesting obviously so what you're painting a picture of is this interoperable world where there's maybe different worlds and communities within it but you're bouncing from one to the other and that's actually what a metaverse is that's the universe we want so but everything has to start then with these worlds so it's not a critique of the fact that yugo labs is building the the current yuga labs miniverse it's just like let's be honest about what it is and they're building a miniverse and their vision my understanding is is for it to connect to a broader metaverse and maybe even dominate in terms of having the most volume of users and transactions and whatever within their miniverse in the broader metaverse is that a good summary oh oh yes except or and not except and let's let's let's quote our friend kai who we both know that's actually hi turner love me some kai turner yeah i think it's impossible not to he's he's one of the good ones and uh he wrote the tweet yesterday that said something like you know i'm paraphrasing but stop inventing metaverses and start inventing standards wasn't it start inventing interoperability standards yes yes uh probably because and like i think i think from what i understand yoga does have this vision like it's not like i'm some brilliant prophet who sees this and they don't they they are thinking about interoperability but everybody i know who thinks about interoperability thinks you should be interoperable with my thing you should extend my thing nobody's ever like okay we're gonna build on that other thing when somebody goes and says we're just gonna build and like they are you know yoga labs they have 450 million dollars plus the apes to get started with so i understand that they're not necessarily going to go bill and have a crypto voxels they do have a market presence and dominance that suggests they get to be the colonel of future interoperability that these other things should grow out of the momentum that they build but it's still i still feel like like what they built looked incredible but it looked like fortnite they didn't look like something really interoperable it's a tech demo probably being too judgy too early and i should just like shut up and let them do their thing i i just i just hope everybody read kai's tweet i hope everybody's really thinking interoperable standards and not just destination websites so i think i want to provide some context here and and i want to dig deeper on what building interoperability standards would look like or if you think there's something else that uh hugo should be doing once i give you a little bit more context but let me just frame this up just in case people have been under a rock obviously i don't know however many months ago it was at this point yugo labs came out and said hey basically we're building a metaverse they had this leaked pitch deck that i'm assuming they intentionally leaked though there were some typos in there so you know wish they'd done a little spell check before they leaked this document but it's all right um and it said they're building what they were calling a meta rpg and they were basically like hey existing metaverses are kind of boring and kind of suck and the thing that brings people together are games and we want to have this awesome meta rpg where people can be building arcade games in one section and maybe they're building other kind of games over in another section and then it all links up together and and blah blah blah wouldn't that be lovely so as we've gotten more clarity on what this is it looks like right now they are in what they've said is that this is like an 11-part narrative game that they're currently building out that's that they're building in the open so that they can have their users testing and inputting on it throughout the process so what happened on saturday was the first of this 11 part narrative series where it's just like this very initial kind of performance test for them to test out certain elements of what they're building out and then there and it had a little bit of a story component to it these codes whatever and they're going to be 10 more of these that will allow people to test out different parts of what they're ultimately building and that will further this overall story and it sounds like what is going to be tested are like like essentially the other side development kits their software development kits like you know different things like that so they can really that will shape sort of what this world looks like okay i like the building in public thing i think that's cool i think clearly people are were very impressed by how smooth the gameplay experience was um and like the game itself is nothing right this game you just like attack dakota by hitting spacebar like there's no game to this yet right so i i i would say like let's not overstate how like i i feel like yuga gets a lot of like hype for just like executing you know and it's like well okay like what has been so strategically brilliant here like i'm not sure yet but i i do think clearly the the experience was really impressive now this is going to get me to what you were saying with the interoperability standard thing this is built on the m squared network and this is the technology being developed by improbable and probable yuga's partner in building this metaverse miniverse whatever i should more appropriately call it improbable is a is a british metaverse company and they have had this technology like they they've been you know bragging appropriately or whatever about this technology for a little while of like there's morpheus which is part of m squared whatever like that basically they can have ten thousand users congruently on a network and have it be really smooth and seamless so it feels a little bit like you just threw a bunch of money at this company that had this technology and now is benefiting from it so again this wasn't like yoga themselves hired a bunch of devs and built out the most incredible experience now they've picked a great partners that's awesome but m squared the network is i believe i don't want to say open source because i think that might be overstating it but let me see what i have here it says improbable will develop other side on the m squared network creating an open metaverse on which the community can build and own unique characters and experiences like my sense of that m squared this foundational technology is supposed to be wired for interoperability and for other games but maybe it's only for things that are on the m squared network um i again like i don't think that i'm uniquely insightful in thinking this like open permissionless sort of standards-driven metaverse is a good idea uh and so m squared looks really impressive uh i was trying to figure out how they raised so much money like i think they've raised half a billion dollars for a company that nobody's heard of in their like consumer internet world improbable yeah uh but they've done a bunch of military sims which i always find slightly odd like just uncomfortable war gaming is basically how they seem to have been not funding themselves but proving that their technology works well um i mean to be honest like i'm just a little bit salty and a little bit shitty and probably a little bit jealous and i'm always like oh maybe you guys gonna something up i'm like i wouldn't point and laugh but i might check on my breath and yet i think they i think they nailed this they did to your point like they don't need to they don't need to build these things they need to deliver these things and if you deliver them by hiring and that's great what they put together is not a great game it wasn't supposed to be it's a great tech demo it looked like and and it looked amazing the voice out all the people hopping around i was like ah like again i wouldn't have been sad if they'd  it up but i will not take it away from them you okay see and i feel like i i don't own yuga stuff and again i'm kind of critical i think punk actually you oh that's oh i own amiibo you're right but you know okay but you know like i don't own board apes and i um i and i think i can again i think they've i i think the jury is still out to what extent yuga is supremely talented and to what extent they are supremely lucky and any success story is a combination of both and it's about what is the ratio of each and maybe their great skill is finding amazing partners and that is valid right like that's also talent and not just luck but i but so this is all to tee up saying that like i'm i can be a little bit of a yuga skeptic like i'm i think doodles has established themselves as a wildly talented team i know you know that team super well obviously like and i would say that their success is is skill over more skill over luck and you got i don't even actually feel as confident in that with that said i want you to succeed because they are such the front-facing company of this space that if they fail if they hat when they have big mistakes it sets the whole industry back and so i'm definitely rooting for them from that standpoint but also want to hold their feet to the fire is there something you think they could be doing differently instead of just trying to build their own kind of we want to get rich miniverse when you talk about building these interoperable standards like what would that look like should they be doing something different than what they're currently doing in your opinion to be honest i'm not sure like i don't want them to just go build in sandbox that's definitely not so i like your question because it's forcing me to think about my criticisms and now i'm having trouble like saying oh they should be doing this so yeah like um i mean maybe not maybe maybe the tech demo maybe figuring this stuff out like really doing this uh a thing that me and kai have talked about is the idea of um an alliance of projects i like to call it purple chip alliance and there's this whole concept around there's a bunch of projects that aren't doodles aren't yugolabs aren't punks like if you're not a top five blue chip whatever and you're not a rug that's bleeding out on the floor there's between a dozen and two hundred projects that have found mid-cap projects mid-cap projects i call the purple chip alliance because they're halfway between blue and red and if they all came together because you know purple mix is blue and red and if they all came together it would be interesting it might have been fun and like i mean honestly i'm just now being shitty old complaining guy but it might have been cool to see some of the early yoga labs demos incorporating some other projects like right from the get-go you know if you if you're a king and you step out on the balcony and you have a diplomat from every neighboring country that projects a very different image than if you step out and everybody's wearing your shade of blue or whatever it is and and you collabs is the king like again can't take that away from them but i think i think i'm being unnecessarily critical okay yeah they are doing a tech demo doing a tech demo with interoperability with other projects like that's not the first thing they need and they did let you pick your avatar that would show up above your head so you like kai did show up it says me bit you could show up as different things and they have been pretty vocal in their like white papers and whatever that the end goal here is that you can show up as any avatar you want so i i think i agree with your let's build these standards and i think what i don't know is to what extent this is what you have to do to build those standards is build a world and then have it be interoperable which is why i bring up m squared because i'm i want to interview improbable and learn and understand it better because if that is for example a great standard upon which an interoperable metaverse can be built then i'd say they're actually doing it um so i think i think we can you know i think you and i are both a little bit eugeskeptics but i think this has clearly been a win and i i think they may be doing it right actually um in from the interoperability standpoint it's also worth pointing out like just sort of trying to be critical of my own line of thinking before i mean i always tell people oh i was the kitty part of cryptokitties not the crypto part and i was the problem not the answer dieter wrote the answer the answer was a 721 standard the problem was how do we make cats on the blockchain uh and it was dieter who said we should make a standard right like we could have made crypto kitties in such a way that crypto could use bread with crypto kitties and that was that there didn't have to be a standard where we extended that made that possible we could have made a game and and many people including me probably would have just made a game and like oh look we made millions it would not have affected our revenue we we were white hot not because we created a standard but because we created a fun and compelling play experience because dieter and probably rohan but desperately dieter insisted that that be a standard we all now have seven twenty ones and then if he's a blah blah blah blah and so the point is though that like if we had just released a standard and been like hey look this is technically interesting and this is innovative and this this is pushing the envelope exactly zero people would have cared yeah what we said was we just made millions of dollars and we use this piece of code we use this technology to do that you too can do that and it is that economic alignment a fancy word for greed that compelled a bunch of other people to start playing with the 721 and so you could argue that even outside of technology from a cultural perspective in order to in order to be the carrot that draws adoption to the standard yuga labs needs to demonstrate wild success financial success on their platform and only in being prometheus in that way and showing us the way pulling down that fire will all the other people say oh man we should do that like yeah we're not we're not doing this because it's interesting we're doing this because we're greedy greed is a hell of a motivator so maybe maybe they're making exactly the right moves assuming they managed to make a bunch of money off the other side which they already did on land sales but like doing the in-app in-world stuff so this gets me to actually what i'm have been critical most critical about in in this whole process and what i remain critical about until i prove it no more yeah yeah which is the land cell piece i have been very open on this podcast about feeling very mixed about land sales and it appears that this is shaping up to be a world where they're reliant on heavily reliant on ugc and heavily reliant on the players themselves building out games and and experiences that people want to be a part of and so to limit your pool of creators to people who could afford other side or who were available at the drop time or whatever feels like a bad move and i've said this before so forgive my regular listeners but like roblox roblox succeeded because they anybody could come in they built the network effects and then the best whatever can rise to the top and people can love that whatever they have now out the gate set up this dynamic where they either make their land holders happy by making land super valuable because only land holders can do xyz only land holders can build but that comes at the expense then of the incredible contributor who couldn't afford it who's not in there or you make your land holders mad by making it more accessible by making it more inclusive and now that devalues the uniqueness of the land or whatever and now your land holders are mad and starting this with that dynamic feels really weird and and contrary to web 3. and my point with this all along or my my thoughts on this as they've evolved has been look if hugo literally needed the money because this is such an expensive undertaking and their venture capital their whatever they've raised from horowitz like truly wasn't enough to fund this huge undertaking and everything else they wanted to do so they needed the money okay i can actually understand then you're accepting this trade-off you've established but if it's if they did this simply because okay we would love to have more money and we just haven't strategically big picture thought about this enough and are just doing this because this is how everyone else does it that's what concerns me and i don't know which the answer is um but i remain critical of that until i get more info yeah i i don't know how one would argue that um [Music] outside of as you say more information like um you know this is not the real world this is a this is a programmed world and so maybe every piece of land is actually going to be able to open up it's like a felix the magic cat's bag or felix the cat's magic bag and inside there's way more room and in fact everybody else will be able to lend land to emerging creators from people who didn't have enough money like there's all sorts of possible digital solutions but as you say with the information that we have this is uh well you know you know though let's hold a mirror up and look at our ugly cells you say it's not very web 3 to sort of to be exclusive in that way in fact it's hyper web 3 ish it may not be the ideals of web 3 but how many truly how many interesting things that have happened in blockchain in the last year in web 3 in last year did not happen only to the economically privileged yeah your audience this is in fact exactly the playbook is to charge as much money as possible and then rant about egalitarianism and standards and accessibility while literally doing nothing to facilitate that paying purely lip service and this is not a criticism of your collapse we're all doing this we all talk about how it's the great decentralization but also it's a decentralization thing if you can afford four or five figures six in some cases to get involved yeah i think absolutely and you're right i i need to check myself on that like life is hierarchies right so it's a matter of which hierarchy do we want to prioritize because you can prioritize money or you can say oh goblin town but okay like goblin town itself like if you have the time to be on discord 24 hours a day you're probably more likely to have found goblin town and like what does that mean like like it it's it's which higher like which uh trait which characteristic are we optimizing for and do we want to privilege and money very often gets it but any other construction also privileges something and creates a hierarchy and and we can get really deep on this but i think that's a good point um doesn't doesn't actually detract from this particular criticism it just means that maybe i shouldn't raise it like this is anti-web three because it's it's it's quintessential web three it's just i don't think it was the right way to go and i don't think it gets you the best product um the the only other solution i'll throw out there i i interviewed a guy named uh lance ducette who has studied like the land has studied land-like assets in games for like years and like the history of it and how it always leads to recessions it leads to everything we see in the real world and one of the solutions for it is a land tax on people who aren't using the land productively basically to prevent just squatters like just buying the land as a speculator and then not building anything on it like you have to pay a tax um that i think actually it may be a tax that's universally applied but if you're actually building productively on it you should be making enough money that the tax is worth it it's something like that i'm not getting these specifics perfectly but you get the concept um which still doesn't solve the problem of how do you get the best builders into your world and building in your world but it does solve the problem of people just speculating and just sitting on land for speculative purposes um okay let's move on speaking of metaverses and worlds i do want to touch on what's happening with minecraft and nft worlds have you been tracking this oh my god an evil laugh uh okay why don't we give again folks context very very quick uh microsoft minecraft came out and said um to ensure that minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our minecraft client and server applications nor are they more nor may they be utilized to create nfts basically minecraft is like we have no plans of using the blockchain in fact we're going to ban blockchain technology from our servers and maybe in the future we'll do something with this but not right now nft worlds which is which should be built on the minecraft servers yeah is uh is obviously the the a victim of this and nft world plots have plummeted in value and that's where we are what are your thoughts um my thoughts are that it is important to point out that um minecraft didn't do this in a vacuum microsoft minecraft did this in a world where people were building on top this like there was already a ton of money i'm not sure how much but a ton of money spent on nft worlds a bunch of times spent by those developers like this thing exist now microsoft owes them nothing to be clear uh and like you know the deep irony here is this is why we used to love blockchain was because decentralization matters so there is no platform risk like um probably most of your listeners know this but the uh list of startups that are killed on apple's wwdc every year like somebody could make a website of bodies there's just there's graveyards that go on for days of literally businesses that get killed every time google does io or microsoft does their wwc they make all these announcements and people like oh i had this really cool app that i was working on and we almost had 10 million dollars in revenue this year and it's a feature hanging off a pimple off of the side of the apple os now and they just like wipe out businesses they slay people and it sucks it's also the nature of business and technology and innovation and such i wait for you i was i know i i had a conversation yesterday with dato oh yoshita i'm so sorry i'm forgetting your twitter handle he's great he like you see him on twitter all the time and he helped give me some context on other side and we were kind of chatting about it he's a big gamer and he was reminding me which i guess i knew this but i'd never fully tracked it like you know ethereum was essentially created vitalik's talked about this several times because he had a warlock or whatever in world of warcraft that got so powerful that world of warcraft stepped in and like like made him less powerful so that it wasn't so out of balance and he was like this is wrong like this centralization is evil and i need to create decentralization so um this is the origin of this whole ecosystem ethereum itself is gaming companies and centralized power which is exactly what we're seeing here i mean the most vicious of all companies to do this was twitter twitter used to do a lot to convince developers to build on top of twitter and then turn off the api they had like like the the twitter app that we know now i think was based off tweet deck that was the one that they bought and that's fine except that there becomes this like disingenuity problem they spent months or years more like years telling people build on top of twitter we want a developer ecosystem this is this is a standard almost this is a platform this is a technology build on top of it and then oh hey we're gonna buy one of you and dead the rest of you uh so the the microsoft thing i mean again like they get to do this apple gets to do this you build the platform then you get to make the rules you build the big thing uh board elon had a tweet he was like building building your ip on top of someone else's ip is risky building your ip on someone's on top of someone else's ip without asking for permission is ignorant and um yeah clearly it looks like they this was a highly risky bet to make to be building on top of something like this and not working more closely with their team and but i feel sad i you know we'll see we'll see what happens from here i mean i probably you know the the story of the first time that the kitty hats people showed us kitty hats where you put hats on cats on cryptokitties i like to tell the story where i was like you can't do this you didn't ask us permission and dan who's employee number two at openc and actually build uh kitty hats with other people like max that's not what you said you were thrilled i showed this to you for the first time and you were so excited and i'm like oh well that's very cool of me i like to pretend that i was like villainously angry but apparently i was not but to be that like that bored elon tusk elon musk tweet i don't think will age that well because the entire point of these metaverses that we're creating is that you do build without asking permission if i have to ask permission then this is not decentralized that is literally the antithesis of decentralization i don't know to push back on that it says to build your ip on top of someone else's ip without asking for permission is ignorant what we're doing in web 3 is making it so that it's very clear like board apes doesn't own the individual ip right for those individual apes i is the ape holder own it so it would be ignorant to go and take like the whole you know i mean yuga is in a lawsuit right now from somebody who's using their trademarks and like you know it's more about being accepting of that stuff and and and uh opening up the ip standards that you can build on it not so much building your ip on somebody else's necessarily the other thing to remember about minecraft is that um i don't know what the median age of a minecraft player is but it's like not 18 you know i assume it's it's it's quite young my kid who's nine plays minecraft um if my kid was like dad i need some money to buy the nft in minecraft i'd be like nope not not at all you don't like absolutely not you don't get to go d gym learning the rules of the trade in minecraft like this in my opinion for worse but for better or worse what we do we've already talked about a bunch of times is deeply economic it's like disappointingly economically rational economic incentives greed driven like this is the space that we play in and so if if you did if minecraft wasn't minecraft but you took that same demograph and put something else on it that's like saying oh we went i don't know like if roadblocks has nfts i'm freaking the  out that's like wildly inappropriate to give children economic things that are often often either securities or lottery tickets like nfts fall in those two categories in many cases unfortunately don't put those in kids hands but right now kids are spending a bunch of they're buying a bunch of robux they're spending a bunch of money in roblox they just have a different kind of ownership no expectation of return with no expectation of return yeah it's like becoming a little gambling addicts early or something yeah roadblock is an arcade question yeah yeah yeah all right i think that's fascinating i'm gonna think more on that point um because that is in some ways that is sort of the world we're moving in like we're talking about video games where there's economic value imbued in it i mean it gets me to this broader point that i've made a bunch on the show recently which is like this stuff goes mainstream when the expectation stops being that you're gonna get rich on it like i think a lot of this is more these things will just subsidize our experiences it'll make the experiences we're already having more affordable because suddenly we'll actually own it and we can make a little money back on it but it may you know and therefore it subsidizes the experience it's not like we're about to make a bunch of eight-year-olds millionaires because they have a cool skin on fortnite you know it's more that like all right they they got a little money credited back into their system because they could sell the skin or whatever um that's an interesting question though how do we handle it when it comes to children coin shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for dows and crypto businesses who need

gamestop stuff but i think we're going to hold it for just a few minutes more i want to talk about um some of the hacks we've seen in this space and i want to talk about proof um well let's do the hacks pre-mint was hacked zeneca was hacked yuga labs seemed to have warned about this at least the zenica hack they had a tweet out that said our security team has been tracking a persistent threat group that targets the nft community we believe that they may soon be launching a coordinated attack targeting multiple communities via compromised social media accounts please be vigilant and safe uh and it was literally the next day that that um or like within 24 hours essentially that zeneca was hacked my only thought on this one well i probably have more my first thought on this is i don't understand how much responsibility we're supposed to put on the people who got hacked as in everybody is getting hacked and you know just to be clear if anybody following at home what happens when you get hacked is somebody takes over one of your accounts creates links to web pages with web3 functionality that looks like one of your websites people go connect their wallets to those and then you steal all this uh that like um oh the world is not as simple as like binary it's not black and white it's not like oh there's good guys and bad guys i mean objectively the bad guy is the dick bag who stole all the money we know that's the bad guy sure but how mad are you supposed to be at zenika i like that guy is a victim in this story for all intents purposes he's a victim who threw his victimhood had a lot more victims who arguably lost a lot more than he did but some people get really mad at the person who got hacked i'm like man like again literally they're the victim they got hacked and yet uh you know i can imagine some metaphor but like walking across the road without looking and then you get hit by a car and it causes a bunch of traffic and was like oh man that poor victim of the car and you're like oh no they they were like close their eyes and walked across the road they're kind of an they  up everybody's traffic because and i don't know where you draw the line because to be clear i need better i mean i'll admit i need better security practices i need better implementation of being safe for myself and my community and i could totally be a victim of one of these hacks so yeah am i the bad guy so zeneca initially the thinking was that it was an inside job from from twitter um now it seems like there's two theories it may have been somebody inside twitter um or it's possible that he let's see he said the other is a phishing attack on me where i gave access to an attacker to the extent that they could bypass my google authenticator 2fa he had two-factor authentication on with a google authenticator like that's pretty it's not like just even like hey get a text message to your phone kind of to fa um so we said it could have been a phishing attack it's not like i said this also seems unlikely to me but i'm not arrogant enough to suggest this is impossible going forward i am tightening my security even more ordering yubikey hardware devices for 2fa and for all for all social accounts for both myself and and zen academy i mean you know i'm i'm quite friendly with zenika it does seems it seems so surprising to me that he fell prey to a phishing attack that like could bypass all this stuff which does then leave the but the twitter insider theory which uh obviously i think then much less blame is on him if that's the case um i don't know it this this one's a wild one to me uh because i think we really don't know what the origins of our are yet um and then i got talked pretty publicly about how amazing the community response was and i felt that i mean i got pinged i feel like within like 30 seconds of of this thing like you know i was getting pinged on all sorts of channels saying xenic has been hacked so um the community really responded quickly i mean it was up for 13 minutes before it got shut down obviously that's enough time for some real damage to be done but um but the community really does surrounded himself with on the largest scale are both you know sort of clear of thought powerful in their actions kind throughout all of it uh it's very good i am i mean like i don't know how much whatever was stolen money nfts ethan i don't know how much was stolen but the idea of twitter insiders like that needs to be a lot of money those people get paid very well yeah like yeah better than any of us they're risking going to jail for a long time yeah there's there's like back to it once again theme of the day in the entire industry what is the economic incentive incentive maybe it's there like so maybe it's a phishing attack it's crazy it's so wild to me um you know and uh i mean maybe more will be revealed on this maybe we'll never get the full answer on the prement on the premium side it was a file that was manipulated on pre-med by a third party um and that you know offered a malicious wallet connect what's ironic about this one is i believe it was one of these like except all like it was one gosh see i wish i had this oh the metamask except all transactions yes it was one of those and the irony was that brendan had tweeted about those like the day before and been like this is a really thing that metamask could fix and they should highlight when that was used against pre-med the following day which is um just again wildly ironic i can't find either of these tweets but i'll find the one he yeah here it is um isn't it kind of crazy that metamask doesn't display a giant red warning when a contract is requesting set approval for all which is used by wallet drainers it should be nearly impossible to accept that request instead it looks identical to a normal request like five minute and then he did a little mock-up of what they could do instead so we'll put that tweet in the show notes um so yeah ironic all right well anyways the moral of this story is of course continue to stay safe out there i have to say like i'm getting i'm nervous now like i any time you know the wallet i have that has all my nfts in it there are times when i want to be in that wallet on open seat and anytime i have to sign just the basic open c you know terms and approval thing to like approve going into that wallet i get nervous like i double check i'm like triple checking that i'm on openc.io like i i'm just i i didn't always used to be this way and i really am so uh skittish these days i'll tell you something quickly five years ago i was in google's office uh probably on my knees begging them to allow us to put cryptokitties on android devices we're like we've made this amazing thing people love it it's really awesome and it's a desktop app like in 2017 when i started working on desktop apps i was embarrassed like a website to tell people it's like no no we moved into mobile five ten years ago we're not 10. we did mobile like 2012 blah blah blah it was weird to be on desktop so we're in google we're begging them and eventually they said uh listen we know that you are a good actor like we like you mac you're a good guy your team is good people uh there are all sorts of teams that look just like yours all sorts of products that the silhouette of look identical to yours that are highly villainous and we make rules for billions of people so no you cannot put cryptokitties on our android devices and we never did back to the kids playing minecraft like if you can get zenikad god we shouldn't call it that but if you can get hacked while playing minecraft and i haven't thought through like the exact ux implementation of if you can or can't but if some kid's parents nice kid he's lucky he's rich his parents buy him a thousand dollar thing for minecraft he's got this cool world in minecraft and then it gets hacked that's not that's not like okay for microsoft can you imagine the they're gonna get if my kid walks in here right now and says me dad somebody stole my thousand dollar nft in minecraft because i connected my wallet rom that's some table flipping scenarios you know yeah so yeah it's a great point like if zeneca a highly sophisticated adult who's been doing this for over a year can be in this situation like you know anybody can and certainly children and i think that's a that's a really smart point um just because you mentioned the android sitch do you have any thoughts have you been tracking anything about this solana phone uh not really i mean htc made a blockchain phone five years ago have you ever heard of it has i ever heard of it do i know what it's called i would argue it doesn't matter my argument because i think i've talked about it a little i've talked about the show once briefly but then since then uh bankless did an interview with the solana labs founders who are working on this project and i would argue maybe the htc was too early we now have a state where you do have you know people who are actively trading nfts and the mobile experience is bad and we don't have the technology for this to be a mobile like for web 3 to be really mobile first right now it's a very desktop heavy experience and so lana is not trying to build a phone that i think they're i think they said like they need like 50 000 people to buy this phone like they're not trying to because that 50 000 people who are super web 3 native who are spending money on nfts is enough of enough to create the economic extent incentive for developers to start developing things in a like a mobile native way and that that's what they really want to encourage is activity in a mobile native way get unlock those juices for developers to start thinking about what could we do what would we build if this was really mobile native and mobile first with the goal that down the line your googles or whatever adopt these they're doing this in an open open source way they're trying to make this like you know they're not trying to build the next smartphone that's going to be universally used they're trying to see what gets built and developed if if people actually can think like this and build like this and then you know try and red pill it that way or whatever trojan horse it into google's android i think that's interesting i like that yeah totally that's cool i i was being again like shitty and salty whatever your point is you're kind of smart though your point is good yeah but yeah i know if they're if they're just trying to be the thin edge of the wedge and the idea is that um when android has a deep salon integration solana wins and this is just a path to that it's not to disrupt android it's to get the solana network and other decentralized protocols into the mobile devices then they're heroes and i salute them and god bless you and good luck and godspeed and all that because i would love a mobile first blockchain world that would be amazing i spent the last week and most of the mobile games most of the world is like you know you look at africa you look at like entire continents where they access the internet mobily like you know it it's like it already is a completely mobile world for for many um okay disney announces their 2022 accelerator uh participants i did not recognize many of these it's flick play in world lock verse obsess red six and then the one that we all know which is polygon um i don't know any of these other companies other than polygon did you no and i looked into this a little bit and uh accelerators is a weird model disney you want you want to know god i'm going to end up regretting this when disney doesn't come along and buy my but you want to know what i heard about the disney accelerator tell me i heard it's awful for your business single-handedly up sphero you remember sphero no tell me cyril is a little round robot it's a little circle and you have a phone app and you can you can control the little robot and it rolls around and it's just a circle and it's really cool and it was this like high-tech digital toy from five years ago and then they got into the disney accelerator i might be wrong about that but they had a partnership with disney that came out when disney did the prequel movies for star wars because it turns out that sphero if you put a little mushroom top on it looks exactly like bb-8 and it's  adorable and so they started making these branded spheros that were little bb-8 and suddenly you could have little bb-8 running around your living room and these were very interesting toys like my daughter took a programming class at school when she was seven or something to learn how to make the sphero do what you want you know it's very stem focused it's also fun and i just heard horror stories about again it may not been the accelerator it was a partnership with disney and you they got crushed by the mouse they they were unable to have self-determination they had to do what the mouse wanted and when you have to succeed at the scale of that kind of company right like hey we're gonna go make 30 million dollars this year said the startup and wild applause exploded everywhere but if you're too deeply ingrained with disney and you're like we're gonna make 30 million dollars this year they're like oh sorry no you have to add a zero or you have to go home the blessing and the curse of working at google is if you create a product if you work on a product that can't make 100 million dollars you don't get to work on it like literally the baseline tinder told me the same years ago back in them when i'm baking on my knees in google's office i was trying to convince the head of product tinder to put nfts into your tinder profile i'm like oh yeah they really represent who you are it's really interesting what punk you have blah blah blah and he liked nfts he invested in dapper and  like he you know he wasn't an unthoughtful guy but again he was like for me to consider putting a product in the feature i have to look my boss in the eye and say this is going to make us a hundred million dollars your nfts in 2018 are not gonna make 100 million dollars so the disney accelerator i mean like it's disney right if the stars line up and you can have that army marching behind you holy you can take over anything in the whole world but i feel like they often march over you not behind you you end up becoming like those good men or very visual that was a good metaphor that's interesting i uh i can't speak to that at all i don't know but that's interesting and not and makes sense um my take on this has been i think people are making a little bit too much of the the polygon partnership thing as if like oh now it's like disney is massive they are playing everywhere i had john rogers on the show john was the i've had him on the show multiple times i feel like i talk about him every time i get on a mic because i think he's brilliant and you know he had a franchise for disney for many years and he was on the show talking about how disney should ultimately fork zk-sync and and have their own you know l2 that's the disney l2 which makes a lot of sense and i ha i i know that they're talking to a bunch of l2's and like this is not they're gonna spread their seed for what it's worth right i think across a bunch of different players here because um because they're disney and and it's too early to just commit to one place so i think it's i think it's cool and i think that it's great for polygon and i'm glad they have this this partnership but i wouldn't this isn't like an exclusivity thing where that's it this is where disney's now building for the rest of walt's time strong agree uh the other weird thing and like this is just theme we have two themes of today economic alignment and shitty old guy mac but shitty old guy mac remembers when uh korra you remember korra i know a non-profit named cora which is definitely not what you're thinking of is it a non-profit no cora is a website where people ask questions of course yeah yeah yeah [Music] when i have weird questions sometimes and i end up in a quora feed well i mean for the kids following along at home cora was the most exciting website for the like two years that it came out it was going to revolutionize information sharing it was crazy in the post blog era early social media days that you could go ask a question like how does facebook think about growth and zuck would come in and write three paragraphs that were like really insightful they somehow built this incredible culture of contributors just telling you the truth and some people built amazing reputation and brand for themselves by answering good core questions you could find amazing things they used to print a book called the best core answers of the year and it was exceptional it was one of the finest things to read on earth every year it was like how to land a plane on an aircraft carrier what's that like how to kill an assassin how to rewrite a linux kernel how to like bake blueberries i don't know just weird incredible crazy point is core was to be everything everybody was excited corey was the future the new social media pinterest before pinterest all sorts of and then they lost the momentum they lost the momentum and eventually after years of being in existence they joined y combinator and everybody was like what y combinator is for the like two little stanford dropouts to do their thing and get their little paul graham hand job and a little bit of money and go make their business sorry that was probably inappropriate uh we can edit that we love a good descriptive analogy well it was a y combinator you know i'm pretty sure reddit went through that airbnb went through that it turned little business into big businesses and wild success and here's a big business coming in and they acknowledged it was weird every new is weird yc didn't get the same seven percent they always take like they had a custom arrangement because it was a company that had probably at that point raised hundreds of millions of dollars but it was it was interesting and they tried to pretend it was fun or could be cool it wasn't it was bad it was shitty and so all of this back to polygon disney i have the slightest smell of that to this where i'm like oh you like don't no no you don't belong in accelerators even disney accelerators you're polygon like that's probably a multi-billion dollar network and should you take an investment from disney sure should you sign deals with disney sure but the accelerator thing on both sides feels like weird pr and it makes shitty old man mac be like really i i agree with you on this actually i [Music] do i feel like i've pushed back on your some of your cynicism up to this point but i i agree like seeing the announcement just like all along i'm like people are so excited about this and it doesn't feel like the proper reaction to me entirely like not that it's bad but there's something that feels a little funky about it so um anyhow that's i like that i like that metaphor i like the story we got out of that metaphor and um i mean we'll see what happens look i mean again i i obviously want everyone in this space to succeed because it it only we're in that we're early enough that like it makes sense for everyone to be collaborative you know because it's the rising tide is gonna lift all the boats in this space so um i think that's exciting but i don't think we should overstate what this means for the future of any of this okay i think we are finally going to hit the the point i've been excited about i feel like i've probably been overhyping this but it's to talk about this gamestop marketplace and have you tracked anything about this do you know anything about this should i give it to you from from the start the start like what are your where are you at uh i mean i know that they did more volume in like a day than coinbase has done ever some and i i know that i know that gamestop has a history of the games industry i know that everybody who is playing console games the last 10 years hates gamestop for ripping them off on the secondary sales prices and the like relationship to nfts and this kind of thing the fact that for example people who make games hated gamestop because gamestop would just keep buying and reselling the same games making six bucks every time and the creator of the game never got another penny every major game development published in the console industry loads retail gaming that's why they like digital except this is really interesting actually we went from retail where the retailer kept buying and selling from the consumer  the consumer by paying no price and giving nothing to the creator to going to digital which the retailer but also the consumer because they couldn't resell their and so now all of the money and all of the powers in the developer the publisher and now nfts are like no if i bought the  i own the wow this is actually really good this is truly where the power left the hands of the retailer left the hands of the publisher went to the hands of the consumer the nfc can buy and sell what they want but that's all kind of philosophical i'm gonna shut the up and let you tell us a little bit i love that i think that's that's a great tea up here so i i do think we have to we have to start like last year and we're gonna start with the gme wall street bets run up that took down melvin capital uh i'm sure the audience remembers this because i imagine there's a decent amount of overlap between people who listen to an nft podcast and who were like glued to their screens watching gme beat the short sellers and i mean look at the end of the day that's not the way you should be trading stocks and you'll end up erect that way but it was fun for a little while to watch a reddit a subreddit basically take down a massive hedge fund sorry to everybody who lost their jobs and money in that but let's be real it was fun okay so if you remember maybe don't but the i feel like the initial kernel the initial theory of why people got so bullish on gamestop was because ryan cohen who had been the founder of chewie it's like the you know online pet store whatever had started buying up a significant stake in the company and ultimately got a board seat so he he bought like i think 12 of gamestop and then got a board seat and part of that was because he'd been like ranting at the board for a while that gamestop needed to go more digital and get more digitally savvy and they like we're only half paying attention to him so he kept buying up more of the company and then ultimately he got a board seat and two other like ex chewy employees senior people got board seats on gamestop and so they ended up making like a third of the board and so i think there was maybe some paper ryan cohen had written like his whole theory of the case of gamestop going digital and anyways people were very excited about this and that was the initial nugget that spurred the like we're gonna get bullish on gamestop because there's this whole business model and and ryan cohen who's great is going to take them digital that gots i think at points very much mocked by the institutional investor class probably for good reason because it you know by the time it was whatever the numbers the final numbers it was trading out was clearly a hyper overreaction to like maybe ryan cohen will take this company digital um but i bring that up because from what i'm understanding that is actually the vision that they're really trying to play out and they're taking the nft digital world very seriously so for some context i mean gamestop really does have this massive gaming footprint i don't come from a gaming background at all which i say regularly on this site i think i've probably been to a gamestop once or twice in my whole life so i really did not know their like tremendous position in the gaming world i think it's something like they have nearly 5 000 stores globally they have 50 million loyalty members in the united states which is just so big to me but maybe that number i remember does that sound  huge um and then that's one-sixth of america it's huge i mean maybe i've got bad numbers here but i got this from a pretty reliable source and then um they have the number one market share for like special collectible game sales so like they sell you know people who want to go buy you know some game from the 80s i don't know maybe i don't get this perfect so like they already have a little bit of an audience for that and gamestop is known for like you go in the store and it's like the latest halo release and you know they're pumping it up and it's you know you can go and you know blah blah blah yes and so they do have these you know very deeply entrenched relationships with all your aaa game studios like all the game studios like this was their distribution partner for many many years it seems like and the optimistic case would be like fixing the past mistakes that you just laid out but like that is now their vision for this new phase is they want they're launching this digital marketplace right now on loop ring i think they're going to imx it should be sometime next month as well i think they're going to have places both but where they are really partner with they've been tweeting about elluvium that the gamestop nft like twitter account has been tweeting a bunch about like alluvium and things where they they're creating these bespoke like website pages for like alluvium games for whatever insert i don't have that specifically but like for these games they can almost do in the digital realm what they've been doing in the physical realm which is like hype up these drops you know really give marketing power to games they're excited about whatever on and on and on and they have like a team of i think like 30 people that are working on this to really transition the business increasingly to this to this world um one theory that i heard i was talking to somebody who used to work at twitch to your like amazon prime account and then you would have this twitch prime thing and you would get like gaming skins and you would get these things and then if you're amazon you just have all this data about who these people are in their gaming lives and what they buy on amazon prime and this person was speculating very much without knowing for sure but like that they could see gamestop doing something similar here where like you they combine your there's like they've got these gamestop pro memberships and then you combine that and you get nft releases and now they have information about what you're buying on the nft side and what you buy in the gaming world so all of this like and the fact that they've been so successful to me feels really exciting because it feels like an example of like me really starting to see the future of blockchain gaming in a way that like i haven't fully been able to picture it before and seeing such a legacy institution feel like they're they're making a really legitimate and big bet in this space i think is really cool and i think it's bigger than i've heard people talking about so we'll see where it all lands like you know kind of shakes out um but that's what i've been hearing about it and that's sort of my take on it uh the question for you is around verticalized marketplaces so openc is the place to go get every single nft and i saw somebody saying that they thought maybe gamestop was doing better than coinbase because domain specificity which reflects kind of the in-store experience that you're talking about like i go to a game stop and then master chief which is the halo guy is like six foot cardboard in front of me and there's 600 funko pops on the back wall and there's the silver steel case edition of the new call of duty and it's very shiny and um i don't necessarily so in the old days we used to argue about apps oh god what was it called constellation apps like for wow there was a facebook app and then facebook started pulling everything out of the app and we had messenger which was different than facebook groups i don't think they had groups at the time which was different than the facebook marketplace and so we called it like the great god i'm getting this wrong but it was the great d con there was this concept of constellation apps probably honestly another paul graham blog post what up paul uh but that was like you know techcrunch was writing about that only for six months and then two years later oh you know who fred over at union square those kinds of guys they were writing with us and then yeah yeah yeah um six months later or a year later i was like no no it's oh the unbundling that was the unbundling and then we were rebundling and everything was coming back together and we didn't want consolation apps anymore we wanted super apps and everybody's copying wechat in china and i don't know that we ever landed because wechat does everything for everybody like you need one ring to rule them all uh i don't know if we ever settled on the best answer as a sort of technology culture group or whatever but do you regardless of gamestop in particular do you see room for these verticalized marketplaces of nfts or do you think that's silly i've thought about this a bunch and i feel like the smart money i've talked to has all is all very convinced that we're going to have these verticalized marketplaces i have two things to say on this right so i have found it interesting because i feel like like i had jake brockman on here who's the ceo of coin fund which is like a big inve they invest in protocols and nfts and whatever he's been in this space since like 2013 doing this stuff and they were an early investor in wearable wearable has their like white label service so that individual nft projects like anybody can build their specific marketplace and they seem to be making a big bet on that and jake really made a compelling case to me about why like it is all going to be these specific marketplaces and it's not going to be um just like generalized marketplaces gmoney same thing he came on his admit one um project part of it is a marketplace that's like a curated marketplace of like his stuff and he was seemed very uh compelled that we were gonna have these very individualized kind of marketplaces i found it interesting to compare that to the fact that openc has been so dominant and you know other than maybe buying one-on-one art or whatever you go to openc for everything it seems very generalized um i do think it makes sense that as we have more and more things be nfts that we we probably see these individual marketplaces that can really gear the experience towards what you want like gamers are gonna want different things when they're searching for their gaming nfts then you're going to want as an art collector the things you're going to search for the things you're going to filter for so those are the arguments that make me feel like it will be verticalized what i think is really interesting though and i hope i don't speak out i hope i get this right but immutable access something called the open order book so if you're on imax and you post on any one of the marketplaces it populates on the others now with something like game so i know gamestop is a part of that i don't know that like if you post a piece of art it doesn't it doesn't populate on the gamestop marketplace but the point is if you post a gamestop if you boast like a gaming asset to the gamestop marketplace it'll populate in the other just generalized marketplaces on immutable x and if you post a gaming asset on a generalized marketplace it'll populate on a game on the gamestop marketplace so i actually think we can maybe have it all right where we can have these specific marketplaces when you want to go and have a very specific shopping experience for a certain type of good but you can also have those assets existing on generalized marketplaces if we get to a point where open order books are the common standard or if enough of the trading is happening on l2s i mean this gets us to this broader question around like will other chains will we live in this omnichain world or will like eath be dominant and will all these transactions be happening on l2s and all these things but the open order book concept which again gamestop will be a part of being on imx i think is um is really interesting and back to our old friend standards works because of standards like to be honest i find it confusing when i hear people talk about nft sometimes they're like oh it's only a nifty gateway like sorry what what do you mean like it's on ethereum but but but they're not wrong in that everybody knows that to get that nft you go to that website and then i'm like okay but you missed the whole point of what we're doing here which is that this is permanent that this is interoperable that all we should do is turn filters on and off to see the content we on but all of those filters are just different windows onto the same real world outside which is the blockchain i can look at this window over here i can look at this window here but either way i'm looking outside to see what is real and true and permanent uh and so yeah no i mean that that sort of makes a ton of sense to be honest the other thing we're thinking about i don't know how fair this comparison is i'm sure opens to be pissed but craigslist ain't dead craigslist makes 60 million dollars a year to this day i think open seas made like 60 million on their best weekend to be clear not a year but still like you know there's some of these images that go around that are like oh the great debundling of craigslist and it's got sex is over here and apartments is here and all the different cars are here and all the things you can buy it's like here's this dedicated site there's 10 million dollars in revenue for that one particular thing it's like oh that's cool you're right like each one of those has been pulled apart somebody made a big business out of it but i've never heard of nine or ten of those websites i wanted to solve those problems i mean i haven't been to craigslist in years so i guess i'm not being totally genuine well but amazon is a good example but i think it's interesting right like amazon's great and that was the counter i gave to jake bruckman was like well look at what about like an amazon where you come everywhere but the interesting thing with amazon is they did start specialized right like they very much started with they were the bookstore like they started with books and then they have over time expanded to be the everything store um i don't know literally everything including cloud storage i mean it's i know it's it's it's wild like it's funny because i so i've been reading a book about the history of amazon the company and i i'm halfway through it i've been trying to you know it's one of these books that i've been trying to read for like i feel like like two months and i just keep getting distracted with other things but you know it's notorious for being a company that just spent so that was not profitable for many many many many years and then like you know turned profitable and i and they i feel like spawned that whole model of spend spend spend grow grow grow profit doesn't really matter um and i feel like i had this impression that like i i i guess what i'm getting at is like like i think amazon also just got so lucky like if it wasn't for like amazon web services like no their business model doesn't work like it actually doesn't it doesn't make sense to have same-day delivery like that actually doesn't work the reason they can get away with it is because they have like money machines with like amazon web services and these other things and if they hadn't found that like their core business doesn't actually make sense um which is fascinating um anyhow yeah i forget the numbers but ridiculous percentages of their revenue are from aws and also ridiculous percentage of the internet is sitting on aws like it's very disappointing how much of us how much of our traffic commerce websites everything requires amazon to be having a good day um that is scary i i was hearing i listened to a podcast as i fell asleep last night so i don't i don't have all the details but it was talking about backing up the internet and that like we actually have a woefully poor we like we haven't we do not have the internet backed up and there's like one guy somewhere like working on trying to pack up the internet but like to your point like if if aws servers went down like permanently like it would be disastrous like we don't actually have a lot of information in like multiple places and safeguarded which of course all of this being a huge argument for blockchain and many nodes and decentralization um so anyhow okay i think that covers it i mean a couple maybe quick things you the bill murray nfts dropped they uh it was an initial 85 that were dropped they pumped pretty hard after they were released this was on coinbase nft speaking of it um but there's supposedly gonna be a thousand total coming interesting only in the sense or interesting in the sense that it's and it's a celebrity drop that seems to be doing well and sort of defying the odds where we haven't had the celebrity nft drops do too well recently um they seem very classy they seem very tasteful here's the thing that i don't get the from what i understand about them they're really like little testaments to moments in his life stories of the crazy  he does movies he's been in big parts of his life that's really  cool i think it's a really authentic neat way to bring bill murray to nfts kind of captures the best of both those crazy worlds i realize he's like a wild full and rich life but how the you gonna have a thousand moments that are meaningful in your life captured in nfts like they're specifically not pfps with variations just like oh look he's got 3d glasses on this one and scuba gear on in this one and so how's the you get to a thousand of those but it doesn't matter they they look yeah i mean high five bill murray i thought i've been trying to give him because oh he did the buy a punk playbook before dropping the nfg and like get a better nft advisor but the dude's making like pretty  cool art on brand tastefully using a technology that some of us love what up bill murray yeah yeah i know i said that on a twitter space the other day we were talking about some of the celebrity drops and we were sort of we're praising sia's drop because i think cia's drop is cool and she's released these little stems of music and it sounds like she's going to use them to to make music down the line and i was saying what i appreciated about ceo was like she's been tweeting about this and in this it's i think since like december december of last year was one of the first tweets i saw of it like i feel like she's actually authentically engaging with the space and bill murray love him but like it was very much like a week before he launches something he like bought several nfts and it felt like that was sort of his nod to the space and it's like well that doesn't really feel like you uh you're like really in it but whatever good for him um kingship also finally launched that's the the board ape music group it's jimmy's apes it's a universal music group back project it's um 22 gosh oh now it's going to bug me that i don't know um the name of like the label within um something like that you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah but i also don't know the name so anyway they've launched a band and they're gonna have this like this whole storyline around these four apes who are in this band and so it's like this fictionalized you know there's a narrative component to this i think is cool i'm not entirely clear on what you get as a holder of these nfts i know it's funding this project funding this band whatever um i guess you'll get early access to things and drops in music i actually was on the mint list and i just totally spaced and didn't mint which is the story of my life i've been traveling all week and i just i saw the email and then here you go so i uh but um but yeah it's a cool new new use of of nfts and ip and like immersive storytelling um that's what i got you got anything else you want to flag mac i just want to point out that everybody who wants the you know ip ownership and creative  control of their nft you're not  jimmy stop these projects up by insisting that you have ip ownership rights making incredibly hard for your project owner to go negotiate real deals get good done for your community because the number of people who've actually done anything with those creative rights like things that matter is jenkins and jimmy that's it somebody should get them to yell at me on twitter they will anyways wait this is so interesting so your perspective is like screw it like don't give these rights these individual holders so that the no you're making it impossible to negotiate real deals it's like you're telling me as the project manager hey i want you to get in a race and win that race by the way i'm tying your shoelaces together because netflix won't do deals if you don't very cleanly own the rights and now you're like oh give me those rights and go sell it to netflix everybody who's like i insist i have the rights doesn't do anything with them but they also hinder the people who might do something with it the project runner for being able to do the thing that they should be doing you yourself because you're not jimmy so this is interesting so i've been trying to put together a panel for a little while now that's dc investor jimmy zenika like the cco diehards versus cco critics it's actually been surprisingly hard to find cco critics outside of just like the art side of things jimmy's one of them which is ironic because you're you're taking it the next step further you're like forget even cco like i giving these rights at all um we had a date set then it kind of got up ended so like i haven't been able to make this panel happen but i really want to because i think it would be a fantastic debate and um i'm trying to nail down jimmy on it and so maybe we have you join i think i had the um the former legal counsel for lucasfilm was interested in hopping on and kind of providing the like trad hollywood perspective on it of like i think making the case that you're kind of making of like if it's cc like what you need sort of a central visionary and etc etc but um maybe we'll have you join this panel and you can take the most extreme perspective of all which is like if nobody writes there's only one problem with this which is i ain't smart enough to debate with people oh that's not true like jimmy's very informed jimmy would be largely on the irony of this is like more on your side in some ways like jimmy was going to be the anti-cco guy um cc zero guy so you guys would actually be sort of on the same team and then just debating the nuances of like where to draw the line on those rights i think it's um i think you'll have exceptions to it right like you obviously have board apes wrapped by io siri and going out there and getting deals and and people sort of accepting that they have these other whatever they're these conditions but the exception does not make it the rule where like everybody hollywood now writ large and netflix at large or whatever is going to be just cool with like creating content when the ip is fragmented like that i think it's a point that's not talked about enough ten years from now they probably will be yeah because jimmy's blazing the trail because guys out there doing it for apes like they're i'm not saying that the future cannot allow for this i think the future will this is the web 3 decentralized world we want to live in yeah but today if you're in the discord yelling when moon but also giving my ip rights yeah you're just you're like putting holes in buckets and then dumping water and wondering why your  is dry i talked to a somebody at a at a studio a fairly big studio that was saying that they were they were in talks with some projects uh some you know fairly known projects and and you know these projects are like we want to be marvel you know and the studio is like why would we help you be marvel when we don't own this these rights like what incentive is there for us to like help you make this happen why why would we do that um so it's definitely a very real it's a very real challenge um okay well this is great mac
