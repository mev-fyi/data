renaissance gave you choice to express one's value to join a community and help others and the american debate is about how best to do that and that's the context it's not just dumping tea over the boat it's really history swinging back and forth between decentralization and aggregation big ticks and talks medieval to renaissance and little ticks and talks that characterize american debate and discourse like since day one do you remain loyalist or d revolt centralized institution or more autonomy for divergent geographies and communities and this is federalist versus anti-federalist experimenting in public and the long story short part of it is all those down times all those experiments that did go off the rails and blew up in our faces they paid off we built through and discovered an unexpected solution a way to balance structure with freedom we've ticked and talked back to central leverage we have centralized institutions with very few sandboxes and regulations that aren't nuanced once again and so crypto isn't another thing it's actually part of this great experiment
