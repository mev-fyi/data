was at fault for the FTX Fiasco actually well I think you have to blame the governing structure at FTX above all it's remarkable to me how few SOB stories have come out you know probably a fair amount of it was pretty wealthy people and if you put a lot of money in a non-us regulated exchange that deliberately located in the Bahamas I don't want to say it's your fault but to me it sounds a bit like saying well you lost a lot of money betting on NBA games like a lot of the time you win a lot of the time you don't win and if you're putting money in a crypto Exchange in the Bahamas even without fraud you should be prepared to lose that money
