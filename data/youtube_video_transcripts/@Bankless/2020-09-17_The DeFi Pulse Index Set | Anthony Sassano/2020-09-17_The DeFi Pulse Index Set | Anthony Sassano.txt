because zapper looks directly on chain to tell you exactly how much of which assets you own not only does it know which assets you own but it also knows where they are so if you are providing liquidity to uniswap or you've deposited them to compound or to ave zapper knows and it will give you a comprehensive report of your entire d5 portfolio not only that but you can you can even make transactions through zapper that allow you to invest in various d5 protocols like balancer or unit swapper curve check them out at zapper.fi alright guys we are here with anthony cesano of set protocol set just released a very awesome new index it's the product that we all have wanted from set anthony welcome to meet the nation hey david thanks for having me really excited to i guess talk about this new product yeah so where did this come from how how long has this been doing it's been stalling for a few weeks now probably probably a couple months at this point uh basically came from uh d5 pulse coming to us and saying you know we want to do like a defy index uh we think your infrastructure is the perfect match so you know let's build it and uh we did we worked on it like over the last couple months together in collaboration with them we launched it a couple of days ago and it's basically an index of 10 d5 tokens on ethereum and there's like a methodology behind it and everything of what gets included and what's eligible to be included and it rebalances um you know every so often things like once a month at the moment and it's kind of like managed by us at this point uh but yeah we basically created it as a way to give like cheap and easy exposure for people to all these default tokens because you know if you were to do all the trades yourself for all of the 10 tokens on ethereum right now you'd have to one approve all the tokens when you go to like unisoft for example then you would have to trade them all and then you'd have to manage your position yourself and everything so this literally one unispot trade or one trade on token sets which goes through uniswap uh will give you access to all of these tokens and the rebalancing is also handled automatically for you yeah so there seems to be a pretty strong theme lately of products that just make access to returns just automated in some specific way and that seems to be what this is doing as well let's talk about how the index is constructed so how did you guys pick which tokens go where and how to weigh each one and how that adjusts over time too yeah so it's basically market cap weighted like i guess like a normal index would be so last time i checked wi-fi was number one lend was number two so they obviously got very high market caps and you know you go down the list and the market caps get smaller so obviously these weights will change over you know over time and then once it's kind of like rebalanced uh they'll go back to their original weights based on not so not the original weights but they'll go back to the weights based on their market caps uh you know in relation to each other in terms of like how we pick what gets included there's actually a pretty rigorous methodology that we published in our uh blog post that people can go check out uh that basically goes through each step uh there's a lot of things like you know the the token must be on ethereum of course the the token must be part of a legitimate project it can't just be a random you know food ponzi or something like that right um you know the token uh must have more than five percent of its supply and circulation as well for example that's why something like crv isn't in there because that still has a you know very small supply very small circulating supply so yeah there's a bunch of different things that tokens have to have to meet before they can go in there though i believe there are exceptions to that as well there's actually a condition in there that a token must be live for 180 days but wi-fi is in there and wi-fi hasn't been live for that long but we included wi-fi obviously because it's in a high demand token you know it's very popular within the community and all that sort of stuff um so you know tokens like uni that just came out today could be included uh way before that 180 days comes through it just depends on on demand for example absolutely and so there's ten tokens in this in the in the index and so i'm familiar with balancer which has like a a cap at eight tokens do you guys have some sort of like technical cap or are you guys free to kind of add as many tokens as possible yeah i don't believe there's a technical cap actually um on on our end uh we can basically include yeah as many as we want in there i think at a point it gets to like diminishing returns you know if you have 100 tokens in there you can only really have like one percent weighted you know for for it depends on the market cap but like the waiting's become so small right and you know uh yeah exactly and some you know the hundred tokens right 100 d freight tokens you might you might have some like micro cap that really you know pumps really really hard and then uh takes up a lot of the index so yeah there's no technical limitation but obviously there's like a logical limitation right right and so how how do you who who decides which tokens get added and or removed from the index yeah so currently that is kind of managed by certain default pulse uh where we you know we'll deliberate on that and and kind of like see what we want to include what we're going to exclude uh obviously it's only been out for a couple days so we haven't done any of that yet we haven't made any any decisions around that yet uh but yeah so it's basically i guess for people familiar with the social trading sets on token sets now it's basically like that where set and default pulse other the social trader uh or like the manager of the of the d5 pulse index and decide on that uh you know eventually uh it'd be cool to see at this kind of turned over to the community in some way or to get the community more involved in this in some way but we thought for practicality uh while it was still young we would just manage it on our end so how does this token actually come to be it's a token that holds 10 tokens inside of it like who created that uh and like is the gas expensive to do all that yeah so i guess the way it works for users at the moment is that when they're buying the the set through token sets as i mentioned they're going through uni swap so they're just buying the token itself through like basically a normal uni swap trade but using our interface to do so if you want to actually create the set like mint it yourself you can actually do that as well but you have to bring all 10 tokens yourself right and you have to approve them and as i mentioned at the start you have to do all the expensive transactions so to actually create it i believe at current gas prices it's definitely hundreds of dollars to create this whereas a simple uni-swap trade even at the prices today like a really high gas prices i think it's about 30 or 40 dollars depending on on the on the congestion it's a lot less than that on a normal day right it's like 15 10 or something so uh yeah so you can mint it and then you can also redeem as well so if you have a a dpi or d5 pulse index token that you bought off uni swap you can go to our contracts the set protocol contracts and redeem it for the underlying basically so it's always backed up by the underlying um which also brings me to the point of like how does the price of the underlying keep in check with the price on uni swap right and it there is a spread there and that's where the arbitrage is coming so there's an arbitrage bot um set up to kind of like capture that spread uh d5 pulse open source their their version of it so anyone can do this so if the uni swap price gets too ahead of the actual value of all the tokens uh in the in the set itself you can do a an arbitrage between that and then you know profit off the spread so that's how it's basically kept in check between the two that's super interesting because i would imagine that there actually is some sort of premium associated with the index token because of you know people are lazy and they'll pay extra to to be lazy and just to buy on uniswap but then also gas right if it saves them on gas they they will just go ahead and pay for that premium on unit swap even if it exists they'll pay for it anyways and continue to add to that premium so for for somebody who can maintain gas efficiency and can run a bot pretty well i feel like that's a pretty advantageous profit opportunity there yeah there definitely is and it's also affected by larger orders right on uni swap when someone does a really large order and it might you know incur some slippage of like a few percent uh we warn about this on token sets but obviously you can override that on unisop you can override it as well if your slippage is going to be high if you really want to get in right uh and then that creates like an arbitrage opportunity so yeah savvy traders um and savvy people can can take advantage of this totally so this token uh it it can be a token that just lives in your wallet to invest in but as we all know like d5 is composable uh is there any sort of vision or plans to get this integrated into the various applications that we all know and love yeah so that's like a big vision we have actually with this is one of the core things that we wanted to do since kind of creating it is that we want to get it into kind of like integrated into basically everything across d5 so you know all the the things where you can stake your your d5 tokens to earn more of this other protocol token we want the default pulse index to be on that right we want you to be able to stake your default pulse index and earn these other tokens we want you know added to our va and compound we want you to be able to use it as collateral right um because you know it's it's it is a pretty good collateral like you have all these diversified default tokens in there um so yeah we want that to happen we want all the integration partners all the wallets to have it in there we want you know uh exchanges to list it right and for their users and basically be like you know one click access to to defy you know index products are pretty simple like um when you when you really think about it and it's all about like the marketing in the integrations right and we want d5 pulse index to be the d5 index right okay so with all this demand for like binance lists it coinbase lists it like that there's plenty of demand on uniswap where does the supply come from when the demand is so great like when when there is that arbitrage opportunity how does uh supply actually meet demand yeah so as i mentioned like savvy traders and and people that know how to do this will actually mint more of the d5 pulse index set directly from our smart contracts using the underlying tokens then they'll go and sell that on uni swap or sell that on another exchange in order to capture that spread right make a little bit of money but also bolster the liquidity which makes the market uh you know a lot more liquid uh and and gives better prices to users as well so that's how i guess like we would it would scale over time uh you know liquidity is the biggest thing in in kind of like defined and something that every project wants to get and that's why we see so many people incentivizing liquidity as well so we believe currently the incentive of being able to capture that arbitrage spread and earn a little bit of money there is enough to to to motivate people and we've actually seen on chain people doing this already so it obviously you know is enough for for certain groups of people yeah so are you guys just being laissez-faire about this and being like hey like you free market go and go supply me demand or have you guys tried to like bootstrap some market makers in order to make this happen yeah so we initially seeded it ourselves to make sure that it had initial liquidity there we work with some liquidity partners and also the projects that they have their token in the index to to seed this thing as well to make sure that there was liquidity there we monitor it closely to um you know we we kind of like run bots as well but we we try to encourage the free market as much as possible as that's what we've done previously with our other sets so with our other sets like anyone can participate in the rebalances of them and we have like a market maker network that does that uh because we didn't want to be responsible for that we wanted it to be a purely you know free market driven where we could rely on the the market to do this so that it's decent you know it's more decentralized than just relying on on our team so that's the same approach we're taking with the d5 pulse index and yeah as i said we're seeing some really really awesome traction so far fantastic so i would imagine that i think this product is going to be absolutely successful i can't imagine why it wouldn't be uh so are you guys gonna make more indices like i think there's room for for the i mean maybe you guys are keeping the vegetables out of this particular index but maybe you can make a index specifically for vegetables like what's coming down the pipeline with future indices yeah so i i guess the the indexes are part of the v2 rollout that we're currently going through so there's three main phases to that there's uh support for indexes and multi-asset support so we traditionally only supported two assets now we support more than two assets inside sets phase two is yield farming products which we're coming out with very soon it's going to be really exciting and then phase three is improvements for managers or social traders as they're known and this is when we can kind of bring in more people to build more sets right we want it to be open so that kind of people can build sets but doing anything they want and you know they could have like a food ponzi set if they wanted to but the difference is that we won't list everything on the token sets website because the token sets website is our interface into set protocol whereas you know someone else could build on on set protocols contracts and set up their own interface and do it that way right but we do have plans for other you know industry products uh that we want to do ourselves but uh firstly we're gonna do that yield farming products because we think that they are definitely in higher demand than maybe other index products are and then the improvements for for traders and and for managers in general and yeah then i think once that phases out we're going to see kind of an explosion of people building out these things um and and and making you know all sorts of different products that i think uh you know everyone across ethereum can take advantage of so a build your own index right so uh if you guys are famous for your guys a social trader where like you can kind of be your own trader right and then other trade other people who aren't good traders like perhaps myself can follow other people who are good traders uh you know so the i was initially a trader just just to kind of play with it and off the bat but then i realized like you know what i'm the buy-in whole kind of guy like i kind of just like left my my uh trader set just all in eath right because i'm a massive eth maxie um but now that i feel like this product for for who i am and for what i like to do i think like the a build your own index is a little bit more aligned with how i see things and so like i have my normie friends who ask me like oh what token should i buy maybe i'll just go make my own index and i'll tell them to go buy my own index token yeah yeah exactly and and that's kind of what we what we see as well and what we see as a vision too is that you know there is plenty of people that are not in this ecosystem yet and you know they don't want to have to spend every day in it like we do right they're not like as dedicated it's like any kind of community you know a lot of people for instance buy like gaming consoles because they don't want to buy a gaming pc because it's you know it's a lot harder it's harder right it takes more involvement it's more passion driven and it's the same thing with this people don't want to study all the d5 tokens they don't want to buy them themselves they don't want to go through the hoops they just want one click access to a to a d5 token index and an index is a familiar product to them as well right you know it's something that they can get behind because in ethereum especially we have like a tendency to have so much jargon that people just get super confused really quickly so you know that's what what's always excited me about set and and why i love working here is because we have the opportunity to bring these products that we all know and love to a wider audience that you know i don't think many other projects right now and ethereum can actually target uh because they're still so early but i think set brings those products to to the masses basically so anthony are you ready for a bunch of tokens that you guys excluded to come knocking on your door like hey will you let us into into the index let us into the index please because being being in the s p 500 is a big deal like companies fight tooth and nail to get into the s p 500 because it's legitimizing and it also provides demand right if you're in the s p 500 more funds can buy your token have you guys thought about this angle coming from various parts of other teams with tokens or even other like vc headphones that just want to buy the set yeah we we thought about this a lot and we figured it was a positive thing right because that will signal demand to us to what tokens people want included and you know today i've already gotten multiple messages from people saying you know when is uni going to be in the index right um and the cool thing is that we don't actually have to necessarily remove anything from the index we can just add uni for example we don't have to remove another token uh if if there is enough demand which obviously there is because it's unique stops token right uh but yeah we expect other teams to to come you know and say can we be in the index or whatever but as i said we have that methodology that we want to try and stick by if we see demand from users especially like like broad demand from users um that signals that those users will actually buy the product if we include the the token then it makes more sense for us to do that but we definitely want to keep it a kind of like not exclusive club but we want people to want to be in the index right we want it to be like a premium product that that that people are like banging at the door to get into um from like i guess like a a marketing perspective that's really awesome as well and gets us you know growing and gets us integrated with more with more platforms fantastic and the greatest thing i think about this is that like as d5 gets better as as d5 matures as better assets come to defy the the set index will likewise follow in that um improvement yeah exactly and yeah i mean as i said uni came out today there's going to be other tokens that come out soon that people are going to be you know going crazy for uh so yeah if we can grow the default pulse index to a size where everyone wants to be in it but only some people some tokens can be in it based on the methodology i think that's that's pretty successful okay so now that you guys have this index what comes next yes so i guess as i mentioned yield farming uh products come next we've been teasing these for a while we have some really exciting things in the works right now uh it's going to be coming sooner than people think uh we we don't want to you know wait too long to release these things you know the space moves really fast uh there are other solutions out there already and we want to offer something unique to users so i'm personally very excited about it as a heavy yield farmer myself i would use these products you know we always ask internally is a is this a product that we would buy or use if it's a yes we'll build it basically uh yeah you know yes from the majority of the team i guess um and that's how we kind of like have thought about our products to date so yeah keep an eye out for that and as i mentioned after that we're going to be bringing tons of improvements to managers we're actually restructuring it so we're actually just going to be calling them portfolios now so so for example a social trader can come along and set up a portfolio uh we're going to just call them managers from now on that they can set up a portfolio and then they can basically take in capital and do whatever they want with that capital across all of ethereum so if you want to go lend it out and borrow against it you can do that if you want to go use uni swap to trade between tokens like as a social trader for your one of your strategies you can do that you're no longer limited to what our own infrastructure which has been you know what it has been in the past you can also farm like all these different tokens you can have like a set that's like a super risky one um or like a portfolio that's super risky you can basically say you know this is super you know high risk uh only answer this if you are prepared to you know lose all your money or whatever and things like that um so that you can chase the latest kind of food farms if you want to for example right uh we want to enable this we want to be safe about it we don't want to promote these things to people who um you know maybe unaware of the risks as well so there's a fine line there but that's on the token set side on the the set protocol smart contract site anyone can build on it it's permissionless we're not going to be stopping anyone from doing that so that's how we kind of like envision the protocol going we want to you know decentralize the protocol out we want to make sure that people can build on us because we're we're obviously big believers in in the whole the whole vision of ethereum and the movement and community plays like a massive part in that if you look at any of the other protocols that have embraced community they're the biggest ones right because you know having an open protocol a bit people can build on and people can get involved in uh it just makes the the whole process a lot a lot faster and you can get products out a lot lot quicker well anthony when that product comes out of set i look forward to bringing you back on the meet the nation so thank you for coming to to meet the nation yes thank you for having me cheers
