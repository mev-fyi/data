[Music] hey bankless nation welcome to the meet the nation today we are exploring hop protocol with ceo and founder chris winfrey hop protocol is a across l2 cross chain liquidity protocol allowing you to hop from one l2 to another l2 to another l2 without having to go through the bottlenecks of the l1 so the way that this works is that hop has contracts on the l1 it also also has contracts on all the l2s and also has these uh other uh hop tokens that are accounting tools and using all these collections of technologies as well as actual uscc or usct or eth liquidity on all the uh all the l2s it allows users to hop around all the l2s without having to touch the l1 so we go into the details about how this works the technical technical capabilities of the hop protocol what it's like for a user uh we ask the question what can hop go from l1 to l1 can it can it go and can it also go from l2 of an l1 to a different l2 of a different l1 uh and then we also asked about the the organization of hop protocol how it came to be what is future roadmaps are and so overall a pretty i think thorough in-depth and efficient conversation of hot protocol so i hope you guys enjoyed this conversation and learn all about hop protocol there's links in the show notes with linking to their discord and telegram or if they have one and twitter so if you want to join the hop community you can go ahead and click those links there so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible arbitrarily is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of the centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many default applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrom and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defy apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the defy apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space hey bingles nation today we are here with chris winfrey the co-founder and ceo of hop protocol which is one of the emerging uh inter l2 inter chain liquidity protocols that allow you to hop from one chain to another chain without having to go through some of the frictions of actually using the codified gateway between these two things so chris welcome to the meet the nation hey david uh really excited to be on the show so let's start at the very very beginning where did hop protocol come about and what was kind of the initial inception idea yeah so so um our team was originally working on a contract-based account called ethereum um and so we started that about a couple years ago and kind of saw an opportunity to really streamline the ux on ethereum and we felt like we made a bunch of good improvements um but ultimately when we started it cost about 30 cents to deploy this contract-based account for users and by the time d5 took off and really drove those gas prices up that then it was over 200 and so we had to push this cost over to users and then just to just for them to get started it had this just huge barrier of entry um so we started looking for ways to kind of get our users on to layer two and started connecting ethereum with different layer twos but we were still seeing that users like weren't really saving gas they were kind of moving to layer two uh making a few transactions and then and then coming back to layer one and just those bridge costs were more than if they just use something like uniswap on on layer one um so we realized like okay if ethereum has a future we really need our users to get onto layer two and to stay on layer two and just to be layer two native citizens they never touched layer one where they would have to deploy this uh contract-based account um and so we we started kind of iterating on different ideas put out a white paper and a demo of uh hop protocol and youth research um and and that started to get some traction um you know at the time you know vitalik was starting to talk about uh you know a roll-up centric uh road map for ethereum and we kind of realized that okay maybe this has the opportunity to be core ethereum infrastructure where we need a way to kind of connect these different pull ups and layer twos um and just decided to go all in and focus on on hot protocol so one of the design philosophies that i think you articulated is that it's great if ethereum has all of these layer twos and you can do all these things on the layer twos but if uh we have all these layer twos then people we would imagine people be they would be going between all these layer twos and going back to the layer one to go to a different layer two kind of almost defeats the purpose of having a layer two at all right if you still have to funnel through the choke point of the high gas feeds low block space environment of the layer one so the idea of hop is uh just increasing the the experience of what like exactly what you said which i really enjoyed which was uh being a layer two citizen and so if you can uh just hop around all the layer twos you actually completely uh remove that constraint of the high gas feeds bottleneck that that everyone has to to go through by touching the ethereum l1 anything anything you want to add to that oh that's exactly right yeah okay so uh so let's see where how does it actually work on a technical level what does it mean to hop from one layer to to another um maybe we can start with like what does it feel like from the user perspective what's that feel like and then technically how does that operate on the back end sure um so from a user perspective uh we just exposed this very you know it's a uni-swap-like interface it feels like you're using a cross layer or cross chain uh amm where you can just kind of deposit assets in one end and then um after some time you'll get assets uh at the other end so so you can transfer assets in about the time it takes for the source chain to reach finality uh which is about five to ten minutes the source chain that is the chain that you are leaving or is that the chain that you are going towards the the chain that you're leaving okay um so so that that's basically the the user experience and and something that we've been very careful to you know not introduce a second transaction and just make that uh try to abstract kind of this underlying uh technology from from the user make it as smooth as possible so when you say it's like a unisop style um interface uh when i go to unit swap i have two tokens that i select i have you know i want i have ether and i want usdc actually it's almost always the inverse i have uscc and i want ether um if for you guys is it i am on arbitrom and i want to be on optimism is that is so we just swap out the tokens and instead replace with destinations yeah that's exactly right you'll select an asset and then a network that you're coming from and then a network that you're you're going to okay and then can you also swap uh exchange tokens in the meantime or is that just a completely different feature not not right now uh but it's definitely something that we're talking about addressing in in the future okay all right so very cool so uh i have a bunch of uh usc or ether on uh 1l l2 and then i want it to go to a different l2 how is this actually facilitated on a technical level sure so so there's a few layers to hop and so the very very core layer is is basically this uh way to scalably send messages from from one roll up to the next and and so the way this works is each scaling solution already has a message bridge uh with uh layer one ethereum so this basically allows contracts on ethereum to call contracts on layer two and contracts on layer two to call contracts on ethereum and you say a message bridge that is just like the bridge right like when i say when i want to get my money from from l1 to arbitram or l1 to optimism i use the bridge is this a that's the same bridge as the message message bridge or is that a different piece of infrastructure so so we call that the the native token bridge and the native token bridges are also built on top of this core message bridge okay and so um so so if you imagine uh the the message bridge allows contractors to call each other that what the native bridge is gonna do is it's going to allow you to lock up usdc on layer 1 and then that's going to send a message to mint usdc for you on layer 2. and then on the inverse if you burn uscc on layer 2 then it will send a message down to layer 1 uh to to release that usdc on layer one uh the caveat is that that for optimistic rollups the message from layer two to layer one takes a full week uh for it to be executed on layer one and this allows time for the challenge game to play out um in order to make sure everything's secure and then with with zk roll ups the the message can only propagate as fast as uh that zk roll up uh check points and so a zk roll checkpoint is pretty expensive so sometimes it will happen every half an hour sometimes it'll happen every six hours depending on how scaled up that that roll up is but but you know even exiting a zk roll can still be um slow depending on the scale okay and that's an important point to drive home like even in our fastest roll ups that we have zk roll ups it's still a 30 minute wait time which uh i mean i get frustrated when i have to wait five minutes for my transactions to clear on ethereum so like from a user ux experience like 30 minutes is gonna be even more frustrating even if they get used to it like we can still iterate on this and again that's the fastest time to go from uh a layer two to a layer one uh and so like with optimism optimistic roll-ups which are both optimism and arbitrary it takes upwards of seven days uh and so if you want to use these bridge uh i'm pretty sure correct me if i'm wrong but going from the l1 to arbitromer optimism it's it's more or less instantaneous but getting back out is takes seven days uh for optimistic roll up so there's a huge ux problem here almost no matter what exactly right yeah and and so um and so we have these message bridges that we can leverage and so you can imagine if we want to talk from from one roll up uh roll up a to roll b then the naive approach would be okay send a message down to layer one and then send that message back up to layer two at the destination and then we kind of have this communication link right where you bounce off the layer one to go off to a different destination yeah and so the problem with that is that this creates this huge bottleneck with layer one so you know if we imagine that our layer two environments are way more scalable we have lots and lots of messages and if each of those messages needs to propagate one by one through layer one ethereum then it just creates this bottleneck bottleneck it's expensive and it just doesn't really get us the scalability we want so so the core innovation behind hop is that we will aggregate many messages um at the on the source chain the chain that you're leaving um and then we will uh periodically commit those and so when we commit them we aggregate all those messages into this really compact data structure um i'm sure you guys have talked about merkle trees uh and you basically just have a single hash that represents all of this data and then we can propagate that hash through layer one uh that represents um you know thousands of messages on to the destination layer too and then we can unpack it at the destination and then that kind of creates this this scalable roll up to roll up uh messaging protocol okay so that is like the the settling up between two layers right and so maybe maybe there's just a bunch of usdc that flows from one l2 to another l2 that's not settled uh a bunch of things happen uh maybe a bunch of things more happen maybe a bunch of things more happen and like the analogy here is kind of like a bar tab uh that everyone uses and people usually typically use the bar tab analogy to talk about a payment channel which i think cop protocol might be but we'll talk about that um and then so what you're saying is like you hop protocol allows for a bunch of economic activity to happen a lot of a lot of people going to the bar and asking for a drink without actually a transaction settling to visa the visa network but then periodically you do settle up and the assets do actually flow from like the arbor trum contract on the layer one to the optimism contract also on the layer one and allows the actual roll-ups to settle up with each other based off of hops sort of like off-chain transaction uh ledger that it has is this all correct yeah yeah and so i i wouldn't we we have very uh a lot of similarities to uh payment channels you know specifically that we make a bunch of payments and then we do this kind of batch uh settlement but then but then like structurally it turns out a little different but that's where the similarities end yeah okay exactly so how does hop protocol actually like account for the net of all of the assets that are transferred cross chain crosstrain so so that's kind of this next layer and and so uh hop has this intermediary uh asset that we call h tokens um and so it depends on what assets being bridged but it could be like h u s d c uh h e and so just like are these just like hop ious exactly yeah and actually you know you could think of basically every token on layer two uh as an iou because you know even with the native bridge you're locking up an asset on layer one right and and minting something on layer two and so basically this is hops version of that um that lives alongside the the native token version we call that the canonical asset so like canonical usdc that's gonna be the one that's used in ave uniswap um etc um and so the reason we introduce our our own intermediary asset these h tokens uh is because we need to build this special functionality into them that we can't build into the canonical assets and and so um specifically when you deposit into uh the layer one hop bridge contract uh you you'll mint an h uh token so if you deposit usdc you'll mint to husdc on layer two um and that that functions just the same as the native bridge but the difference is that when you burn um husdc or another h token on layer two uh we have a role called the bonder that can mint uh hucc at another destination for you um because hot protocol needs um it needs what's the right word it need it needs it's it's self-sovereignty it needs its own ability to manage its own currency to account for the differences between the currencies across the different l2s right exactly right yeah okay so like wait so is it so i have usdc on ethereum uh and i deposit it into arbitrarum and then i get usdc on arbitrary but like you said that's actually an iou so it's actually arbitrum usdc that is an iou of usdc on the main ethereum chain and then when you mint a hop uscc aren't you actually minting h arbitrum usdc so it's h a usdc because you are making an an iou for arbitrary usdc which is making an iou for uscc on the main chain is that right yeah the naming gets a little confusing but i would think of it as as um you know the the canonical usdc is kind of a iou a promise to be able to claim um usdc from the the native token bridge contract on layer one whereas huscc is a promise to claim um layer one usdc in the hop bridge contract on layer one okay okay hot bridge contract on layer one is the hop bridge contract on layer one also part of the arbor drum or optimism contracts or is that something is that separate it's separate and then it will also be connected to arbitrarily optimism uh polygon and text okay so it's like it's more not rather than stacking on top it's more in parallel okay okay cool and and so so so that's kind of how the um yeah that that's how the h tokens exist and then um in terms of uh you know transporting an h token from one role to the next we the user basically burns an h token uh specifies the destination and then we have a bonder and and so the bonder is able to fully verify these rollups um you know in the time it takes for layer one finality uh and so with roll-ups you kind of have two finalities you have kind of like off chain finality which you can determine um pretty fast uh in five to ten minutes because you can actually you know look at the the chain of transactions and compute the the state and make sure that you're correct but you can't do that on chain because you can't run all those transactions otherwise we wouldn't be scaling ethereum um and so that's why it takes a week for uh kind of on-chain finality but the bonder they're fully verifying things in real time they see the event h tokens were were burned huscc was burned um and then they have uh collateral locked up at the destination and they'll use that collateral to mint hqstc for the user at the destination um so now you know imagine they facilitate a bunch of these transfers they've locked up a bunch of collateral and they can't unlock that collateral until they receive uh proof that uh huscc was was burned at the source because we want to make sure that the hot bridge contract remains uh fully collateralized and so that's where the uh the the message bridge comes in the hot the hot message break so you know after many people have transferred we we uh aggregate those into our compact data structure um and then you know we propagate this we call it a transfer or a message route um you know through layer one to the destination once that reaches the destination uh then the bonder can can settle up and and their their collateral is unlocked so so that's kind of how you can move an h token from one place to the next pretty immediately and then the settlement process happens over time okay so like in my mind the age tokens are like this shadow token the shadow that like follows the actual real token but it has the the self sovereignty that hop protocol needs in order to move like at the speed of light uh and so uh the way that hop protocol allows for like this like near instantaneous transfer of uh you know asset to from asset to change to change of chain is that you guys actually have the actual assets on all of the change on on all the chains and so somebody on chain a can go to chain b because hot protocol actually has the usdc on both sides and then the age tokens are that communication uh accounting tool that because hop protocol the hot protocol contract on the l1 um it uh it can manipulate with the destination of the tokens as it sees fit unlike it how that's not true for usdc or ether um and so it can manipulate the balances on all the other chains to account for the trend the transferring of uscc or or any other token across all of the chains is that right yeah and this is this is all done completely trustlessly it's all fully collateralized um it basically is completely relies on the security of ethereum and the the different scaly solutions that you're using well we like that word trustlessly um what what happens uh how does um what happens if like all for some reason everyone is on arbor trump and they want to go to a different l2 so i like arbitrary i'm just using arbitrary just because everyone everyone is on uh layer two a and then all for for some reason there's a there's an economic event that means everyone needs to go to a different layer too layer two b and all of the liquidity flees out of layer uh two a how does uh how do and then and then therefore everyone who's left on layer two is stuck because you guys uh hop protocol has lost a bit to all of its available assets because everyone has used up all like the bandwidth how does hop protocol like redistribute to account for like different bandwidth requirements across all the layer twos so so actually to take a step back so so uh we have this h usbc and this is kind of like the second layer but but the h tokens aren't what the users want they are using these actual canonical tokens um and so that's kind of like the third layer of hops so so at the core we have this message bridge and then we have the second layer this intermediary asset and then at the third layer we have uh amms um so we have an amm between the canonical asset and the h token and so when a user is bridging from arbor trump to optimism they'll swap usdc to husdc that hucc is burned and then the bonder will then hucc at the destination and then that's automatically swapped out into usdc and and ends up in the user's wallet from the user perspective it's just one one transaction for the whole flow um and so these amms actually play an important role in in terms of like balancing across the chains uh as well so if we see a huge flow from say arbitrary to optimism um then you know it will cause um the the uh uscc on arbor trump to start uh trading um at a discount and then the usdc on on uh optimism to to start trading at uh premium and this actually incentivizes uh folks to um rebalance these chains um through with with like uh large uh settlement transactions through layer one um so they can kind of redistribute the assets across the chains and and then profit off that based on the arbitrage opportunities that the ams present right very clever that definitely seemed like the right place for economic incentives how are these amms constructed are they more like a curve where the actual shape of the amm is differentiated or is it more like uniswap v3 where you can have concentrated liquidity so so it's more like curve a stable swap they are like kind assets you know there shouldn't be any reason for you know usdc and husc to diverge because ultimately you can claim either one on layer one for layer one usdc um and and same with you know ethernet chief and all the other assets that we support um so yeah right now we're using the stable swap construction hey guys i hope you're enjoying this conversation with chris about hop protocol thus far coming up in the second half of the show we go into more details about the technical details of the hop protocol as well as the future road map and also just a more casual conversation about what chris thinks about the current state of defy and where we are overall going and also talk about yield and how hop can offer just a sustainable source of yield for all those stable coin yield seekers out there so more coming up in the second half of the show but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible matcha everyone's favorite decks aggregator has just launched an open beta for gasless trading so if you're trading more than five thousand dollars in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs then your gas fees on matcha are free and that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage matra has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that that it gets you better pricing trading on mantra is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your d5 trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless connect your wallet and start

eth fault where you can deposit eth into the application borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time v2 is rapidly approaching which will allow for even more collateral types plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from harness the power of alchemix at alchemix.fi that's a l c h e m i x dot f i follow alchemix on twitter at alcomixfi and join the discord to keep up to date with alchemix v2 and to get involved in governance uh can hop bridge non-evm chains it can yes and and so uh we haven't supported them yet uh it would just be a matter of uh re-implementing um our layer two bridge contract for whatever the the scaling solutions but um you know we do plan on on supporting um uh starkware and and uh zk sync and other zk roll ups um and and then eventually we'd like to support uh like disjointed layer ones as well but uh that's kind of a different problem set than what we're addressing right now okay so it seems to be that uh any roll-up evm or not um that settles to ethereum that seems like a relatively uh surmountable obstacle because there's only one canonical hop contract on one canonical ethereum l1 that seems like a task that can be overcome getting from uh 1l1 to a different l1 or or an l2 on 1l1 to a different l2 on a different l1 that seems like a taller task because now there has to be two different hop contracts on two different l1s is it is that is that i'm on on something here yeah that's exactly right can you describe how how that problem works yeah so so it it's a very different problem set it's something that that you know we wouldn't use the core the core technology behind hop uh for this we would kind of uh develop something new and so uh this would probably involve um some new validator set to to basically attest that okay you know tokens h tokens were burned at the um you know some disjointed layer one uh and we can release the token on layer one ethereum or on uh or emit age tokens on an ethereum l2 um and so so this validator set you know won't share the same security as ethereum it will be as secure as that validator set uh it'll be like a multi-sig validator set of sources yeah but but that's kind of you know the best that you can do um yeah right uh listeners will be reminded of our episode with roon christensen who had a lot to say about security assumptions across layer ones using multisigs yeah um okay so uh can one uh is who can provide liquidity in hop right now uh is that like a closed environment and then what's the long-term game plan for that yeah so so we think of the there's two types of liquidity in hop and we call this uh passive liquidity and active liquidity and so passive liquidity is basically liquidity in the amms you just kind of set it you have very low risk of impermanent loss uh and you can just kind of earn trading fees and then maybe stake it uh if there's liquidity mining um and then we have active liquidity and this is the bonded process it's it's a lot more like running a e2 validator where you kind of set up your server you have some process that's constantly listening for events and making transactions um and so right now uh the bridges are set up just one bonder uh per bridge and and so the worst a bonder can do is be offline and when the bond is offline the the transaction will still propagate uh as fast as the exit time of of the the source uh roll up so the the roll-up that you're starting on um so so you know even though there there's just like one party that's doing this right now uh they they don't they're not taking custody of funds they're not not uh presenting additional risk they can just be unavailable basically and in the next version of hop we're gonna support multiple bonders uh per per an asset and then after that we're gonna have a completely decentralized bonder network and so what's really cool about when we get to that point where we have this decentralized bonder network or even multiple bonders is that it becomes a one of n trust model and this is just for being available you know right right now it's trustless in terms of uh of uh custodianship but then in terms of like you know is your asset gonna move you know very very fast or is it gonna kind of move at the slower pace you know that that is still now one of one but it's gonna become one of n which is you know you know you just need one honest bonder to for it to go through very cool do you have any sort of uh like metrics that you've been able to discover over the last few weeks or so or actually months now that protocol has been live for a while about like the the level of yield that liquidity providers are getting from this it is so it fluctuates a lot we just uh launched our eighth bridge um last week uh you know on on like a daily basis some some people were making you know 15 plus percent on each uh 15 in a day no no no sorry uh oh you're you're really compounded okay yeah you just want to say like hey hang on just take all my heat yeah um but but yeah based on a very like short window and so i would expect that to be competed down but but so far you know the yields have been good um and yeah you can also earn um you know stable coin yields and again there's very low risk of impermanent loss so so i don't think there's many opportunities to earn the kind of yields that that hop lps are earning at least for each right extrapolating now this out into what me and anthony suzanna call the the nexus of ethereum where there's many many l2s and there's uh many many uh economic actors hopping between all these l2's this is going to be like a kind of like ethereum's like uh economic heat where all the transferring around is causing a bunch of just like fees and and yield to to occur do you have any like long term thoughts about how uh l2 transfers will impact yield and d5 um that's a good question i i mean i i think you know ultimately we'll just keep attracting capital and i still i mean ethereum uh until you know yields start to make more sense for the the risk that people are taking and so right now yields are very high uh risk is very high um as as you know ethereum becomes more mature and and hot becomes more mature and and you know urine becomes more mature like all these different yield producing protocols uh i would expect um yield to kind of settle into uh more in line with the traditional um finance ecosystem is is urine something that can be a liquidity provider for hub so so we have talked about um so so back to like active liquidity and passive liquidity so with the one passive liquidity is much cheaper than active liquidity uh there's lower barriers to entry you don't have to run the server process uh and there's a lot of folks that are just mercenaries will throw yield you know it's very very competitive um and ultimately with the passive liquidity you need those pools because if you don't have the actual asset for people to bridge into then you know they can't bridge the there's no way to kind of eliminate that that type of liquidity but this ponder liquidity it just is essentially collateral and so right now the the bonder uses the same asset that's being bridged uh but ultimately we could uh or we plan to to move to a future where the bonder could kind of hold the basket of assets those could be yield bearing assets um or you know they could be eath they could be you know whatever basket of assets that the bonder wants to hold and they just use that as collateral uh while earning uh yield on it for uh bridging assets across hop and then that's where i think we'll we'll get uh some big improvements in capital efficiency very cool how are fees determined in hop um so so right now the bonder sets a fee and then the amms take um 0.04 uh percent fee so four basis points um and then you know once we get to the multi-bonder model then um the uh bonders will will basically compete for for lowest fees and then that will kind of drive them down to a minimum do you kind of think that over the long term over the many years that fees will kind of just collapse to the absolute minimum while also speed between l2s kind of increases is that the outcome for this yeah hop definitely scales up a lot better than it scales down so so you know basically the larger amount of assets that we're transferring for each of these settlements um through layer one then the the cheaper we can get fees so so um right now we're at the bonder charges um point one eight percent so eighteen basis points um pretty soon we're going to be you know we we just scaled up the ether liquidity we're gonna do the same with usdc we're gonna be able to drop that down to nine basis points um and ultimately i think we can get it to um you know around four basis points or lower uh for the bonder fees you know that seems to fit into the model of l2 that i've come to understand where the more users and the more assets and the more economic activity that's happening on these l2s the actual cheaper the fees actually are because they're amortized across all the users and so not only is this true of the actual l2s themselves but this is also true of of hop as in the the bridges between these l2s um can you just can you just uh riff on that for a second do you think like this l2 environment is just going to become faster cheaper stronger as more and more people just adopt it absolutely like even even for myself you know i've been using d5 on layer one i just rebalanced a bunch of positions and i just realized what am i doing on layer one i'm i'm just losing a huge part of my yield to transaction fees uh layer two is here today and so um yeah i really think that that um soon here it will be very much much more rare especially for users that aren't dealing with you know uh anyone who's not dealing with like hundreds of thousands of dollars is gonna be on layer two and just stay on layer two because player one's just too expensive it makes a ton of sense um are there any significant differences between how hop is constructed versus how connects is constructed that are worth talking about sure so there's a few different bridge models um so so we already talked about hop uh we we developed uh this this technology and so right now we're kind of alone in this this category um and then another category is um hash time locks and and so this uh it's kind of a game where where you know you have one party uh lock up assets on one chain with the secret uh the party uh another party locks up uh assets with the secret and then um someone reveals uh the secret on uh one chain and then the other party can use that revealed secret to unlock on the other chain and so um time locks they've been around for a long time this is the same technology that underpins the bitcoin lightning network um and there's uh you know they work well in some scenarios and and and then um there's some uh difficulties and you know these difficulties are ultimately why we chose not to uh take this approach when we're we're looking at this problem with ethereum um and so one is that you know you have to wait for two rounds of finality so so uh you know the the uh you you can't move too fast when when you're doing um kind of the second uh prepared transaction and then you can't move too fast when you're when you're revealing the secret um otherwise you you're at risk of a reorg and then the other one is that whoever goes first in this game uh is kind of locking up their assets without any promise of the the other party kind of locking up their assets so if you have one party that has like reputation uh then things work really well uh because you know you they're they're reputable and you know that they're not gonna kind of like you know take you know lock up your assets without fulfilling the game or something like that um but then it gets harder to to like really decentralize that network um because once things get competitive then then you know you have to like layer in some kind of uh reputation layer so to make sure that you know you don't have parties entering and then just locking up people's funds so that that you know that that more assets route through their router or something like that um and then the the uh third type of bridge is kind of this externally verified bridge and that's kind of what i was talking about with with you know it could be a future direction of hop um but ultimately it introduces this it introduces a new trust model and and with hop you know uh for going across layer twos we we want to just rely on ethereum's trust model and see that as as kind of the the best way to scale um in the near term um but then for kind of addressing you know disjointed layer layer wands that's something that's that's better suited for hashtag much or for these externally verified bridges very cool let's let's talk about um the organization behind hot protocol how is that the protocol actually who are the people around hop protocol and how did they become organized so uh we launched uh hop towards the beginning of the year um and since then we've kind of had this community grow um and then you know we we have um a company that kind of facilitates the development of the protocol um and yeah so so you know as we move forward we're gonna be kind of becoming more and more community uh oriented and uh we're already starting to see you know community members that have developed like analytic dashboards or or like uh twitter bots and stuff like that which has been really cool to see is there an actual formal hop down there is not will there be there could be there could be is there a hop token uh there's not will there be there could be okay awesome well okay if i uh i don't know if there is an official hop road map but what is left on the road map um so so there's a lot so so uh right now we kind of have the first version of our bridge um the next version of the bridge is very similar uh but enables multiple bonders for an asset um and so we're excited about that and it also allows us to kind of consolidate like kind assets so right now we have a separate bridge for um you know each of our stable coins um in the next version we're going to be able to kind of have like a single stable coin bridge which is going to be much much more efficient uh and like i said you know it scales up really well so so it should allow us to to drop the fees by a good amount um and then you know we want to head to uh you know we're heading in a direction where we're making kind of the this like core uh messaging protocol more generalized um and that's gonna enable some really cool stuff uh in the future um and then beyond that we want to address um the the disjointed layer ones and and you know that that's going to be a big r d effort to kind of figure out you know uh what's the best way to do this in in a really decentralized way um even if we can't you know leverage the security of ethereum for for other uh disjointed player ones okay well chris thank you for having extremely like powerful and concise answers and so i think that's everything that i need to know about hop is there anything that i missed or forgot to ask um i i think that's it you know we're really excited about um the way you know everything's going we're really excited about the way ethereum is going and to you know we've been waiting for layer two for so long so it's it's been awesome to see that it's like actually here and it's usable um and that we're seeing more and more layer twos kind of come online and get traction um and yeah if you if you wanna try the protocol i'd recommend uh visiting hop.exchange or or follow us on twitter protocol and yeah i really really appreciate you having me on the show chris before you go uh outside of hop when you are done with work done with developing uh what else about ethereum excites you or do you pay attention to um ooh that's a good question i i i mean that's a hard question um i i i you know dive into d5 all the time like that's been super fun like often times like my entire saturday's eating up by just you know making uh you know jumping around these different protocols trying out new stuff um i i uh admittedly uh missed i think a lot of the nft craze um it's been so awesome to see like how mainstream it's gone and like i i you know was so kind of had my head in d5 that that i really just didn't see it going the way it did and like i see your poster behind you i i know that you guys have been big believers in it so uh it's been awesome to see it and um but yeah i i um i've been following closely but but not not too involved on the nft side of things um and then you know dows have been a huge interest for for a long time so like just seeing you know uh you know mullah kind of kick things off and then you know swap and compound really start the the you know more organized uh uh or not more organized but but kind of the protocol dow's uh has been awesome to see it like and so you know uh excited to see more and more people like working for dows and and having that be like a legitimate side legitimized uh type of organization 100 100 it's funny it's funny that you think i'm an nft person because i definitely like aligned myself as a d5 person uh yeah and it's like it's also funny to see like all the d5 people like not really there there's a separation between the d5 people and the nft people out there yeah yeah yeah and like it's so cool like the you know the nft communities are really taking off and it's just like it's so hard to keep up with everything these days like it really is crazy how far it's gone is there room in the hop protocol for cross l2 nft transfers or is that is hop kind of only for fungible tokens absolutely um you know vitalik put out a paper uh about a month ago for for a cross chain nfg bridge and we we think that that the the messaging piece of of hop protocol is very well suited to kind of facilitate this this type of um nft bridge and so like actually he doesn't talk too much about how that that communication would would work in there and so like we see this as kind of a missing component and would love to kind of implement that in the future well there's a lot of things to be optimistic about with the future of hub protocol so chris thank you for coming on and uh telling us all about it thanks david really appreciate it uh so i i think you mentioned this but just to reiterate uh what do you want listeners to do go try out hop exchange follow hop on twitter join the discord what else yeah jump in the community um you know we're always a discord so if you're looking for something to help just start start chatting and you know we'd love to to find something um and yeah follow us on on twitter and and uh get your assets on later too there's real stuff happening and um it's a lot cheaper than later one very cool well all of those links will be in the show notes if listeners wanted to hop into hot protocol uh chris thank you for joining me thanks david cheers hey we hope you
