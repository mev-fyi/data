what does the fed understand that they're not saying first what do they not understand you know prior to this whole covid fiasco and the money printing and the financial pressure and the inflation blackrock with a former fed official released a report saying in the next downturn because debt's so high because interest rates are so low we're gonna have to print a lot of money but that could be some inflationary so they're gonna have to hold interest rates low for a period of time despite that so you're gonna have to have kind of coordination and then the big challenge becomes how to not have inflation get too high and out of control so like the whole road map was there you know central banks never come out and say look the sovereign debt is too high so we just have to hold rates low and financial repress everything i mean they never just say that they never say we have to inflate the debt away they never predict a recession and what they do basically no matter if things are high or low they kind of point back to everything's gonna go back to two percent that's all they do they basically draw a line for wherever it is now to two percent inflation and they just are always kind of going back and trying to point towards that medium and they don't really have a good track record
