hi everyone this is defy dad i want to do a follow-up to my last loop ring video so given that gas prices are still very high a new feature that loop ring is offering is that you can do instant payments for free using loop ring pay so this comes from a tweet from vitalik a while back just mentioning that someone should do ethan erc20 payments for free using zk roll ups and so the loop ring team has newly released this and we're going to walk through it so first off you can only make payments and receive them if you have a loop ring account and so my friend evan here does i'm looking up the hexadecimal address for his ens name and then under account and transfer i'm going to go ahead and make that payment so i'll choose die we'll just send him one die to give a quick example and then hit transfer and that's it metamask will ask me to sign the transaction but it doesn't cost me any fees so once this pops up i'll hit sign all right that's it and then we should see this settle almost instantly and there it is it's been successfully paid so i'm gonna go ping evan to send me back that die and i should see it in the same dashboard also if you'd like to share this through twitter they make it really easy so i'm still on the transfer dashboard but now up top you can see that there's a credit of 1.01 die because evan has sent it back to me and then of course i haven't paid any fees along the way to send or to receive and that's all there is to it to make 100 free instant payments on ethereum all you got to do here is sign up for a loop ring account you
