welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless's darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this interview we are talking to cartridge cartridge is building out all of the Legos that is needed to produce on-chain gaming in the starknet world we of course know what web3 gaming is web3 gaming is like gaming with assets you have games but now you also have Assets in their your game it's different in the world of starknet because we have the compression Technologies of ZK Roll-Ups of ZK Tech we can do much much more than just Assets in our game we can put much more of our game logic on chain perhaps smart contracts on ethereum are put for putting business and finance logic well since we have so much more compression power on ZK Roll-Ups we can put more game logic on chain and have that actually be viable due to how much compression is in the world of ZK Roll-Ups and so cartridge got started trying to build an on-chain game and then they realized that first we need to build all this normal game infrastructure that other games are also going to have to do if they also build on starknet so first we have to build the tools the player databases you know the player profiles all this kind of stuff and then it can incur a blossoming of more and more and more on-chain games on starknet so that's the pitch we're going to go into more of these details and so much more so let your imaginations run wild but first I wanted to talk to some of these fan fantastic sponsors that make this show possible Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps feds can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 feeds by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite DPI apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswa but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every Layer Two and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wallet experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview bankless Nation we are back at the software sessions in Tel Aviv Israel and I am here with uh Terence who's going to walk us through the world of starkware gaming Stark net gaming excuse me uh Terence tell us how did you arrive on starknet what brought you here yeah definitely thank you for having me um so my journey on starknet started about I would say November 2021. uh we had recently launched the dope Wars project which is based on on Loot and was on chain gaming ecosystem with a dow associated with it and as part of like the secondary royalties uh bootstrap Nadal that was governed by the players that have minted like this free to nft and we started a grant fund where we would just grant people like the Dow would choose to Grant people building on interesting things contributing to the dopos universe and someone came to the dial with this idea to rebuild uh this game called drug wars which is what dopos was based on uh fully Unchained on top of start mid and this is very early on in the Stark net kind of like iteration Cycles right before or starknet even had a mainnet available and he and we built out a fully Unchained game that was very early on and kind of opened my eyes to what was possible this idea of putting like everything on chain not just you know the assets but all of the rules and and the uh properties and everything that governs like the the loop of this game and so that's what really brought me to Stark net and was the beginning of the journey that has brought me today to uh building cartridge and and helping out the ecosystem um of on-chain gaming on Stark net evolve so I definitely want to really just dive head first into the world of on-chain gaming and how that's different from what people might be used to when they hear like web3 gaming but first um the fact that this got started off with elude project I think is really interesting oh yeah because this is actually the second Gaming Community that I've heard come out of loot the first one being magic but the the magic ecosystem came out of again like that whole Loop phenomenon but that went to arbitrum why did you and why did others come to to starknet like what about starknet has really attracted you yeah so actually so we originally a lot of the the dopar's ecosystem is actually on optimism so we built out um very early on in the optimism ecosystem we built on fully Unchained rendered nfts to represent like in dopos you have a hustler which is your item and then all the items that you got like on the original card were bridge to uh optimism as individual items so you get like your gun or your you know like your your Air Force Ones or your gold chain and stuff like that and you can like assemble them onto your character onto your Hustler and rant those are all stored and rendered on chains so that was you know an early experiment of having a fully Unchained nfts that are like interoperable and composable and people can kind of like play this game of of equipping like the the dopest Hustler um so we were kind of open to I mean it was very apparent early on that you can't build especially you know during the the the bull market of like you know like late 21 whatever where ethereum gas prices were like north of 100 guy you can't really build a game on chain and expect people to interact with it so we were very you know eager to explore different options so we started with optimism and then uh started building out and optimism was you know much more production ready at the at the moment in time and then started building out on Stark net um I think with Stark net it's really uh there's a set of constraints that it loosens versus like evm chains like one is around like the complexity of the smart contracts that can get like a little bit tricky to deal with when writing solidity and the other is this idea of like um a fractal scaling and exponential availability of compute that you can put on chain which I think like makes Stark net particularly interesting for building games on as well as some other properties um like a kind of abstraction that you know obviously everyone is very excited about yeah there's so many different ways to start this conversation uh count of traction definitely one of them for needing to have the necessary infrastructure to really onboard people into gaming but I think that really that big unlock is the the ZK element that allows you just to do more can you talk about the ZK roll up and what it's allowed you to do when building on Stark net yeah definitely I think it really just allows you to have a lot more bandwidth for like expressing computation on chain with the future like potential avenues for exponentially increasing that through you know fractal scaling or client-side proving so you even have you know properties of like private information that are easily incorporated into the sharknet like blockchain by producing a proof on your client you know allowing for like hidden information and then putting it on chain as well as different data availability solutions that are are starting to come to Market so when you think about a game there's obviously like a spectrum of assets that require different properties right and so as you want to put more and more of those games on on chain so that they like you know inherit the properties of the blockchain like the hardness and the persistence and that they can be around forever uh you want you you don't want to you know necessarily want to pay the same amount like per byte for example for you know like a core item versus maybe like some illustration of an item or like a 3D model of an item so I think like that's another very interesting Avenue that uh ZK roll ups and Stark net have been innovating in that is going to be like crucial uh to building fully Unchained games yeah it's a fully on chain games can you compare and contrast these uh what a fully on train game is versus what uh perhaps a more what people might know as a web 3 game how's this different yeah so I think like Baseline they have some similarities potentially um like the the web three games generally I would say characterized by assets living on chain and taking advantage of the the capability of the blockchain for like player ownership of assets and the ability for people to trade them in secondary markets so like opening up this idea that Gamers should own their assets they should be able to sell them they should be able to like accumulate them over time potentially by like playing the game and potentially get paid for the game right there's like people working on different Dynamics and like I mean I would say uh to you know different degrees of success obviously what we've seen from like you know play to earn and stuff like that um so I think like you know that's like the first just scratching the surface of the properties that a blockchain brings to the table that makes sense for games Unchained Games you start to see like a lot more of that logic start to live on chain so you know with web 3 games you're still reliant on this promise that there's some off-chain game that's going to implement these assets it's going to make them useful and that like your your assets are going to derive value from right whereas on chain game we started we start to put all that logic on chain like incrementally and like eventually potentially everything right so the rules that the properties of those assets or those items like I don't even really like to call them assets because it like you know it's a very financialized term like when you think I start thinking about like a whole gaming ecosystem being on chain there's really a ton of different like objects that exist or in this universe and and maybe anything in your gaming inventory yeah and some of them might be tradable some of them might not some of them might be issued by the the ecosystem um so yeah all of those things or even the properties of a boss right like what is you know the the class of the boss and stuff like all of these kind of things start to live on chain they're legible by smart contracts and people can start to make assumptions about this Foundation that it's not going to go away beneath them right like so in traditional gaming even in web 3 gaming um it's hard to build a game on top of another game right we've seen it like many times over with with franchises like Warcraft or GTA where a developer builds like a ecosystem alongside that maybe like takes advantage of like some game and mods it in a certain sense but it's very hard for them to turn that into like a sustainable business model because you're kind of you know always at the whims of the original Ip owner so you you like if you become too popular like you know then probably lawyers get involved and like you maybe you'll figure out like an exit strategy or like some kind of acquisition but it's very hard for example for like an investor to or even a person to invest a lot of time into building something that they think they can last on top of like a fragile Foundation you know it's like a similar property that you get when you build on top of Twitter and then like all of a sudden they they close the apis off right and so with Unchained games you get to have a foundation that you can make assumptions about and you can start to build in that that Universe can compound right um so I think like those are that that's like the big contrast of the properties that the blockchain gives to Unchained games that I think are gonna you know over time it's a very emergent like very early on in the ecosystem but over time because um the the efforts were compound we're gonna see like incredibly vibrant like you know massive ecosystems of of these parallel like Unchained universes that anyone can contribute to and monetize and be compensated for expanding and so just to reiterate what you said like we have web 3 games which is really just about the instantiation of in-game assets as tokens but the game itself is rendered and not really it's like the game itself is just like a normal web 2 game it's a Trad game yeah and so what we're talking about and specifically the magic of ZK Roll-Ups and why we're here at starknet uh is because you because of what a ZK Roll Up is you actually can do more things as in what uh ZK roles are trying to do is just reduce the cost of computation down to their absolute minimum yeah and when you can reduce when you do reduce the cost of computation all of a sudden what is viable to put on chain actually increases so have you thought about after assets what goes on chain after like now that we have much more commoditized computational costs what what can go on chain next what makes sense to put on chain yeah so I think we're seeing a a bunch of different experimentation with this like I mentioned the dopo's ecosystem we expect we experimented with fully Unchained nfts and rendering and there's a few projects obviously doing that on ethereum as well on starknet we're starting to see fully on chain games like Mumu by topology which is they've built a fully on chain physics engine that deals with processes and is basically like a very fun but technical game where you set up different state machines to kind of uh achieve this objective you should check it out if you haven't Mumu by topology there's another game like influence which displays exploration game which is a lot of fun and that game as well like has some nft assets that they issued uh initially that are incorporated into the game their crewmates and asteroids and then they've built out this like very immersive experience on chain fully on chain of how you explore this universe how you travel through the universe how you can you know land on an asteroid and start to mine resources from the asteroid and and build like a civilization and and you know it's a very is it we they recent only did a testing event with a bunch of like you know a few thousand players and everyone was fully Unchained on Stark net and playing this game and and it starts to create like these interesting behaviors where you know one of the cool things was people started building um civilizations on these asteroids or like or Machinery on these asteroids to kind of like make a picture right and because it's on the blockchain it's almost like okay now the game itself is like you know like an nft in a sense right uh which is like a cool like uh emergent behavior and then you have the the Realms team obviously building a few different games on on um Stark net and pushing the barriers of what's possible there uh when that too is a fully Unchained game where all of the rules that govern um your Realms and how you like can you know build armies and the resource management and all these kind of things is all on chain so you know I think the next thing that makes a lot of sense to experiment with in the in the stock net ecosystem is the rules and the logic there's not so much experimentation about pitting like the assets like media and stuff fully unchanged just yet I think that maybe will come with different data availability Solutions where as as those are rolled out but yeah it's very a lot of experimentation around like just the core logic that governs why an asset like makes sense for this ecosystem and you touched on it but I really wanted to drive this point home so I want to talk about it a little bit more what do we get when we put more of our games on chain like there's this vision of crypto gaming as like composable games where your items can transcend across games or your character can transcend across games like game composability when we put more and more of our game on chain whatever that logic may be what kind of properties do we get out as a result of that yeah so I think it's like you ex described like interoperability and composability are two big value propositions we've yet to like achieve like a great deal of that I think like a lot of that it will come through some standardization in how games are built in represented on chain and so we have an effort that we're working on with the Stockland Community called Dojo to build out Unchained gaming tool chain like for developing smart contract or games on top of starkner and that like I think has the capability to standardize a lot of those Primitives and allow for interoperability and composability much more easily you get the hardness of the blockchain so the the guarantees that the things on it are going to exist as long as the blockchain will exist right and the blockchain gives you this this property where anyone can can propagate the blockchain at some point in the future right like if someone if you if if no one is mining Bitcoin and you want Bitcoin to continue you just mine it yourself right and the the the chain will continue propagating so you can get that same property for a gaming Universe right today you might have a centralized publisher you know like the longest living games are like you know Warcraft like franchises and blizzard and stuff like that but at some point Blizzard's going to shut down the World of Warcraft servers or something right and if you your options are kind of limited especially now that servers servers weren't designed to be run by anyone right like in theory they could like open source it and you would need probably like a devops team to like figure out like how to stand this stuff all up um whereas like blockchain games are inherently designed to be like replicated for it to be like robust to this that anyone can continue propagating this universe if they're interested in it I want to unpack that metaphor a little bit and then dive into that so I've used um Hearthstone which is a another Blizzard game uh which is much like magic the Gathering for people that are familiar with that same kind of game you you own cards and then you play them and like there's the and this is a server based and so unlike Magic the Gathering which is played in person Hearthstone is played virtually um similar to Magic the Gathering you buy Cards you buy cards from uh from blizzard and then those go into your inventory and then you battle other people the problem with horse Stone and what was actually nice about magic the Gathering is that when you buy the cards you actually own them with Batman Magic the Gathering in Hearthstone when you buy the cards it's just a database log yeah and so if we want to go through this progression in web 3 we have the first phase of web3 gaming is like well no now you own your assets and so like when you actually buy uh gauze Unchained is now this web 3 version of hearthstone yeah where you actually own the tokens as cards and so then you can play the game but you actually own the cards the issue with that though is that there there's still a server there's still a client that is needed to be maintained in order to play the game so if the company behind Gars Unchained goes down you can't play the game anymore yeah so it's great that you own your assets but you also need to own the game too exactly or otherwise like the game itself will be rugged and all the reasons why you own the Assets in the first place the utility just drops to zero I think it's a great comparison I think like really what you can say is like a lot of the properties have magic the Gathering has by being like a physical item in the real world can now be given to digital games that live on the blockchain right like if you have a deck in Magic Magic the Gathering you can play it no matter what no one can stop you right like as long as you have a deck of cards you can play it with whoever you want but you're also limited by the physical constraints of the real world yeah you are so that you don't have like you know like RNG or you can't play over the internet and stuff like that well you can roll a dice but you know but um but yeah and like the the the the the creator of the game I mean like from my understanding I'm not big into magic of the Gathering but there's like a formalized um like tournaments and stuff like that where they have stricter rules around like cards that are allowed and interpretations of them but if you don't agree with that in Magic the Gathering if you have the deck and you're just playing with your friend you can make whatever rules up you want right and I think like that property it doesn't exist in digital games right like for example if you're like like playing like let's say League of Legends or a husband or whatever and Blizzard or Riot decides to like Nerf a card there's no way for you to opt out of that Nerf to say like well I'm gonna play with my friends and we like that card uh but like with the blockchain with the game that exists on the blockchain you have that optionality like you not only have this ability for players to be involved in that decision making to like potentially nurse Nerf an item which I think like will provide a lot of legitimacy in a lot of gaming ecosystems there's this idea of like this top-down like decisions coming and nerfing things that like people get generally quite upset about and with the blockchain you enable like this bottom up like if every all the players agree this is out of balance then like let's balance it and you also have this ability for like optionality right like you can constrain the games in certain like in a certain mode while still allowing like other modes to exist in parallel or like other people to build different experiences that are slightly different like if you you know if if there's a game of built on top of like the digital version of hearthstone uh like a fully Unchained game like there might be someone that says like look like the games I think it could be better balance like this and maybe we introduce these cards and they're free to like you know inherit like a lot of that like the foundation of the original game and provide a new experience that's better on top of it without this like you know this worry that if you are competing with this original game that like there's like gonna be some adverse consequence in the future okay so I can I'm pretty good at daydreaming I'm pretty good at imagining things I can imagine some sort of like MMO RPG that's as fully on chain as possible and there's hundreds of thousands of people and they're all playing and it's all super fun um but first we're at starknet what we got is Stark net there's also this thing called cartridge uh but help us go from starknet to a hundred thousand people playing this MMORPG we don't just get to skip there what are the necessary steps in order to get to that point like what are the base level infrastructure we need to enable something like that yeah I mean I think yeah we we're decently far away from that I think like I think there's a tractable path to achieving it um I think like one of the the biggest gaps in the short term is just like standardization around like how games are represented on chain and building out tool chains that enables people to more easily build games on top of Stark net in particular um and that's like you know like like taking learnings from the existing gaming industry like there's you know like standardized ways of representing games and patterns and architectures that people have used for a long time and have it like a lot of inertia and that we can build on top of the the blockchain so there's something called like entity component systems which is you know a lot of game engines uh use this to represent like what what the state in a world and the state transitions of their world and so that's something that we're we're building with Dojo is a fully Unchained a tool chain for building fully on-chained games that abstracts a lot of the semantics of like this the smart contracts and all this stuff underneath and allows people to like very concisely and easily build games on top of Stark net and take advantage of those properties without necessarily having to be exposed to like you know the the rabbit hole that's usually necessary to understand like a smart contract State model and stuff like this so just making it much more accessible so I think that's like you know one of the first steps uh to enabling this I think like you know once we have compelling games on top of Stark net you know Stark net itself is not is an exponential increase in compute available on top of ethereum but itself could not uh manage the the throughput necessary for a single like very well adopted game and a lot of the constraints that starknet is optimized around is around like security and more like defy use cases so I think like a logical next thing is layer threes or like executing on the fractal scaling road map so that's like layer three solutions that have properties that are more tuned to what a game needs so you know like in D5 or in Stark net you probably want like decentralized sequencers right because like you know you're you're so you're touching financialized assets and there's a lot of you know the adversarial model is very different for an Unchained game you probably are okay with like a a centralized sequencer with high throughput that's checkpointing to Stark net and that you can easily exit to come back down to Stark net if like the sequencer is not like propagating the world State like in a way that like the players want um so I think like the next step is going to look like uh centralized sequencers layer three sequences on top of Stark net tailored towards specific gaming universes um that are just checkpointing to Stark net and then another uh Dimension that I think is you know quite interesting is client side proving and so the ability to compute like today you can do it actually in the stock net ecosystem there's approvers that you can compile to to wasm and run uh in your in your browser there's a really exciting project called Sandstorm of someone working on this and um there's like some there's some standards coming out that is going to make it much more feasible to do in the browser as well uh computationally and like that gives you the property of of hidden information as well as uh like this you can generate these proofs on the client side that are very easy to verify so you get like another layer of like exponential growth of compute available and so I think like all those things are you know probably going to have some kind of role um in building this like future you know fully on chain game massive multiplayer online game um as well as probably like State channels and different data availability Solutions so really like we need to execute on the full like road map uh to enable that like future future it's like the abundance of compute and the full spectrum of trade-offs available for things that want to live on the blockchain so you you said the word standard a lot and um going back and I kind of see this world of on-chain gaming following the same footsteps of D5 which is on-chain finance but defy didn't come about until we had the erc20 token standard and then all of a sudden applications could start to reason about the assets inside of them and that's that standard uniformity of assets made it easy to have these assets be composable same thing with nfts we didn't have nfts until we had the ERC 721 standard and so there seems to be this uh inevitable hurdle that must overcome before an ecosystem arrives which is the standardization hurdle yeah which I think that goes to what you're doing at cartridge can you walk us through what cartridges and how the idea of standardization is so important yeah so a cartridge.goal is to accelerate the Advent of unchain gaming so we're working on you know dog fooding we're developing a few games ourselves and then solving a lot of the problems that we see in the ecosystem and working with the community to solve them so initially our Focus has been um onboarding users and we've built a solution for called the cartridge controller which it deals with player interaction and identity and it leverages something called Web authent to use like the secure Enclave in your device to issue credentials and allow people to sign up for you know and and start executing transactions on chain which is a single click like a face ID or a biometric finger scan so that's like one of the things that we focus on like quite early on with cartridge now with Cairo 1.0 maturing and the ability to like kind of start building up the the stack for Unchained games the tool chain we're working with the ecosystem with the different the community of games like the Realms team with love and silver brick and a bunch of other like talented contributors um like Annie and a few others on building the dojo tool chain and the dojo tool chain is really this idea of standardizing The Primitives that people are using on chain to represent games so it is an implementation of a ECS system and it has like some cool properties of like verifiable client-side States and stuff like that that we've built into it and it's already the the nice thing about ECS systems is it's already a standard in traditional gaming like the traditional gaming development and so um it's not like we have to necessarily invent something new we just need to build a way to represent like ECS systems on top of starknet and so that's what we're focusing on like in the short term and I think like that level of standardization is going to bring to a point like the Advent of you know powerful infrastructure built around it so like once we have a standardized ECS system or way of representing state for games and the processes and the the functions that change that state over time you can start to build uh powerful infrastructure that's like applies to all the games right and then if someone is building a game on starknet they get all these things for free it's like if you issue a token on ethereum you obviously you own a UFC 20 so you can put on uniswap right it's like um you know like the equivalent I I guess like one one way to think about it today is like the Unchained gaming ecosystem with nfts today is like nfts are interoperable in a financialized sense that they can trade with each other but it's not like interoperable in the sense that like you could the the properties of them are legible on chain and you can have functions and stuff like that so just like surfacing that level of interoperability is gonna and standardizing it is gonna enable this I think this future continuing with the progression of defy as a mental model idea um I've always been a fan of the idea that like uniswap is an individual defy app and compound is also an individual defy app but these things also hook into each other and they're also hooked into Ave and actually every single defy app that's on the same L1 is also really just one big structure because they're all interoperated with each other so like instead of individual defy apps there's actually just one big D5 superstructure and that's because of the composability of these systems 100 and I kind of think that's perhaps the way on-chain gaming also plays out as in like we have this one on chain game and then we have the second on chain game but then they'll start to be like composability between these two things and then a third auction game and all of a sudden this is actually not just individual launching games but actually starknet is the game and it's actually many many many games did you share this Vision yeah I mean I I think that meant that like Vision or meta 4 expands just to life in general in a sense but uh yeah I think like that this is the meta game I mean right now we're in the meta game of building games right and on chain games on Stark net and it's a lot of fun because of it's a great ecosystem to be in it's like everyone there's so many people that do this for fun you know that I think that's like a a common attribute of people involved in the stock net ecosystem is they're here for like like out of pure intellectual interests of like what is really on the bleeding edge and it's like a game and it's fun for them right um but yeah I think definitely I think like similar like I think similar to like the evolution of defy um on ethereum like the kind of the Paradox you know like a lot of people say you know Unchained gaming is very early but the the games that are built today and the things that are built today are probably because they have this property that they can like live on perpetually the the stuff that's built in the next few years probably has the highest chance of being like the next big thing right so while it's so early and like like hard to figure out like what it what are the paths we should go down or like what should we invest in like the when getting the right formula is going to be like you know like when Hayden was working on like um constant product markets and everyone like no one really like knew about them and then all of a sudden you know the unit swap is like the size of coinbase you know so I feel like it's some something similar will happen once we figure out something cool that players love that people love to build on top of that like it manages to attract a critical mass of of people modding it on building new experiences and like building sustainable like business models on top of of entertainment for players um I think like it's it's coming soon and yeah it's going is gonna be a lot of fun so if we've piqued the interest of any of the listeners listening to this who do you need the most help from who could you uh get the most assistance from out of any of these listeners what kind of what kind of uh developers what kind of developers who do you need help from yeah I mean I think like the ecosystem could use with just a lot of experimentation and we're seeing it there's like you know a lot of different pockets of people building different on-chain games different experiences with different constraints some on you know ethereum main net someone polygon I think it's like important for people to continue experimenting with those and for people that are interested in the space to to try them out and and like provide feedback and and and be a part of that feedback loop I think like there's a large contingent of like the traditional gaming industry that um is is very hesitant on blockchain technology because of the financialized properties of it but I think like there's a lot of properties that the blockchain can enable for games that had any game developer would want I mean if you're building a game in like a traditional game especially if it's a game that fits into the constraints of the blockchain like something that's turn based and has like shared State and potentially like adversarial models and stuff like that like it would be significantly easier to build a turn-based game as a developer on top of something like starknet once the infrastructure is solid then to build out they can manage that whole back end yourself right you get to start experimenting like like you get a lot more leverage being able to take advantage of all these other pieces outside of the financialized component of things so I think like having bringing those people that are familiar with traditional gaming the industry and game development into the blockchain space and getting them excited to take advantage of these properties outside of the financialized stuff which you know it can you know leave a lot of sour taste in a lot of people's mouth I think that is going to be critical to to building like you know like this the future that you talked about of like a massive like Triple A quality uh MMORPG online game that's uh fully owned by the players and it has these like properties of of um composability and interoperability and actually just being like something competitive with what a studio like a centralized studio with a billion dollars can do today yeah well Terence I hope we've uh peaked the interest of many many many bankless listeners and made them
