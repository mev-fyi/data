once we have that thing that you said was important earlier called an open economy then everything just suddenly gets priced right like everything has a market like do you think there are ways around that you know i think there's a fundamental tension between reputation-based currencies that you can only earn by doing things and they connect real status because of the proof-of-work that goes into earning them versus something you can just buy and say i have the same status now i've said that in the past and i've had mobile game designers come up to me like you're wrong you know here's why you're wrong because like you know we sell this thing as iap and it caused just as much status as someone who's earned it but you know i think particularly in a crypto world where you can really tell who's put in the proof of work versus just bought something i think it's going to really detract from the long-term value accretion that goes into virtual goods that you can only earn
