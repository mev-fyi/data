what's more likely a single monolithic super intelligent AI does the eleazer thing or we have robot human conflict War so that second one seems far more likely to me you know we form coalitions and fight each other and there's always the question what is the basis of the dominant coalitions so if you could have a gender-based you know the men fighting the women you could have an age one the old people fighting the young humans versus robots is one possible division on which future conflicts could be based that's completely believable
