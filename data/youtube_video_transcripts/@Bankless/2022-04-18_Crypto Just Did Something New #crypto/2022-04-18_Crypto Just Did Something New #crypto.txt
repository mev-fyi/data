cpi now 8.5 your dollar is worth eight and a half percent less than it was a year ago at this time so did you get an 8.5 raise your paycheck and the answer for just about everyone is probably no i didn't so what does crypto produce this thing called fpi which doesn't actually track the dollar it tracks cpi inflation so that 8.5 if you held an fpi you would have actually been neutral you wouldn't have lost that 8.5 if you got paid in fpi you would still preserve your purchasing power i you know we see a lot of people minting fpi you can mint it with fracs at the actual pec price it's almost like a dollar stable coin that is growing at the inflation rate because we use the exact same cpi basket as the fed uses for the doll now obviously right the trillion dollar vision here again is like eventually crypto is this self-sovereign digital global economy and then at that point the fbi could float against the dollar it could grow higher than what the fed defines as inflation
