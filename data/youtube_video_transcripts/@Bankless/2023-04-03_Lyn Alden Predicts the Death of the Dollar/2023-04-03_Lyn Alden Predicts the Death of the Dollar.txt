welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we've been doing a series lately trying to figure out what is going on Bank runs inflation insolvency recession think this might be one of our final stops in this series of conversations today we have Lynn Alden on the episode who's always rational and gives us her take on what is going on in the world a lot of yelling going on but what is actually going to happen a few takeaways to listen for number one is the Fed balance sheet expanding to Infinity is that a thing that's happened we get into the question of what even is on the FED balance sheet why are treasuries worth anything at all how does the FED work Lynn Alden gives us a school lesson which is fantastic number two we talk about why a Regional Bank crisis like the one we are seeing right now Mike Domino into the dollar losing World Reserve currency status number three we ask if that's a good thing or a bad thing there are reasons why it might be a good thing Lynn explains and finally we talk about how this Bank crisis might impact the 2024 U.S election and how to prepare your portfolio as result of everything that's going on David this is a great episode um I feel like I don't know if it's the Final Chapter because we always seem to find ways to add new chapters um to the series whenever we want to explore more information but um this was a fantastic episode with Lynn that kind of puts a a bookend on the series that we're doing what did you find most important from this episode yeah we've had Lynn on I think either four or five times now and I think this might be my favorite Lin appearance on bankless and I think the reason why is because we spanned so many spectrums in this episode we span the spectrum between these small Regional banks of the world and then the very Central very singular Federal Reserve and we we drew those connections and how that there's a pipeline of capital there and how the sucking of capital away from the regional Banks ends up going towards the Federal Reserve Banks but then also ultimately the capital needs to flow past that past the Federal Reserve which brings us to the conversation of a multi-polar currency base for the world so the dollar losing its dominance into something else uh bankless listeners can only imagine how that relates to crypto which is a topic that we talk about but that's not the only Spectrum we also talk about the spectrum of just the long tail of the economy versus the very Central world of politics and how the loss of one impacts the the the uh fruition of the other we also talk about the here and the now how this is going to be impacting the world in the short term in the next few months and years but then also we zoom out and talk about what this looks like 10 to 15 years from now so Lynn just really helps us navigate a number of different spectrums across a number of different time scales and I feel has given me and hopefully bankless listeners at just a ton of clarity of to so many different issues that this banking crisis relates to there we go and if you want the full series uh started with our episode with Biology then Arthur Hayes then Ben Hunt then Jim Bianco now Lynn Alden this is I think one of the most comprehensive pictures of what is going on in the U.S banking system right now and how that will expand and extrapolate uh over the coming months and and years ahead so tune into all of those episodes we'll include links in the show notes one thing I also recommend that you go check out a lot of the source material for this episode is of course published by Lynn Alden on her website that's at Lynn alden.com or go look up Lynn Alden contact on Twitter give her a follow she posts a lot of these macro charts that sort of thing in those two locations is definitely worthwhile guy squaring it right to the episode with Lynn but before we do we want to tell you about the Fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless including Kraken which is my favorite way to get my Fiat into the crypto system and our number one recommended exchange for 2023.

bank list program and we all know when Lynn comes on Bank list it's because macro is doing something confusing and we need to just blew up something just blew up and we need help navigating all of these chaotic Waters uh Lynn welcome back to bankless happy to be here it seems like a good month to be named bankless yeah right isn't it isn't it yeah the the theme of macro at this moment uh Lynn we've been going on this journey with a number of uh other guests trying to explore really just the what is different now like what is the the the summary of this whole thing and everyone's got different opinions and so I'm hoping we can actually start with the end start with the conclusion we've got a number of topics to run through but I'm wondering if you can just start with your high level summary of the net effects of the events of these last two to three weeks as it relates to the FED policy macro markets or just what the net impact is sure I think the net impact is that small and medium or Niche banks are going to be under profitability pressure for quite a while some of them still have ongoing liquidity or solvency concerns some of the largest banks are pretty much in good shape they don't really have the same types of risks and that's kind of the arrangement that they're in the FED has been pulling liquidity out of the market uh you know over the course of the past year and I think they've kind of run into roughly roughly the limit of how much they can pull out and so you know their balance sheet has been down for a year I think it's probably going to be sideways-ish for a period of time um you know whether it has to shoot up again will depend on if there's another shoe to drop another sort of like liquidity crisis it's partially uh you know psychological uh basically whether or not humans do a bank Runner or not do a bank run so some of that's unpredictable but I think the general base case is for somewhat of a more sideways liquidity situation and kind of a Slowdown in terms of how quickly they can raise rates and and and pull down their balance sheet okay so following on that is I think that the other thing that listeners are in myself are really going to ask for it's like okay was this like a a relatively unpredictably large speed bump but we are still going forwards or are we doing or returning or is this a phase change in the market or did we just hit a speed bump and now we're going to continue in the same direction I think it's a phase change from going straight up with tightening so they're a busy balance sheet constantly down like fed balance sheet and rates constantly up I I think it's a trend change towards somewhat sideways in both of those I think I think the balance sheet is probably going to be sideways-ish for a period of time and I think rates you know they might get a little higher uh but I think the rate of change is slowing down and they're kind of getting closer to their their Peak and that you know that's relevant for for markets it's obviously relevant for liquidity sensitive assets uh you know Bitcoin gold or their assets like that um and it's it's you know generally Pro Equity when it happens but I think a lot of that might be behind us now if you go back to the um September 2019 period there was a similar event it wasn't as severe but basically there was a repo Spike and basically the interbank lending Market kind of broke the FED had to come in and that marked the end of their quantitative tightening basically they ran into the liquidity floor for banks and the main difference was that back then it hit big Banks whereas this time it hit small medium Banks and last time it was not accompanied by all these big unrealized losses because there was no record increase in in interest rates in terms of how much they raised in here I think the the conclusion that I've been getting to is like this is a um very middle of the road outcome as in like I don't know whether to be bullish or bearish I don't know if this is going to uh this is bearish it seems to be for the long tail of the economy as I've been calling it because since the long tail of the banks are now being unprofitable that probably impacts the long tail of the economy but also interest rates are going down but also the Federal Reserve balance sheet is like you said going to wiggle sometimes in in like a flat and so I I actually am kind of confused as it relates to the markets about like Risk on assets which my portfolio and probably bankless listeners portfolio largely constitutes uh and just oh but all over all for equities at large so I think this is it's just like a fair sentiment or a fair like conclusion with this is like no one actually really knows whether this net effect is bullish or bearish yeah I think the middle of the road outcome makes sense um I think particularly liquidity sensitive assets um it's generally a plus for them um uh but in terms of assets that actually make a profit I still you know the the overall recession or not picture is still very relevant the profit margins are irrelevant and so we can kind of divide the economy into almost like two sections there's ones that are interest rate sensitive and that includes obviously real estate due to how leveraged it is and it also includes unprofitable tech companies because they're reliant on issuing Equity very high valuations which is easier to do when in trades are zero and harder to do and interest rates are five percent um and and so basically those are the two areas that have been under pressure I think they're going to continue to be under pressure uh whereas you know there's like travel companies restaurants uh you know kind of uh other areas that are you know virtually unaffected they don't they're not really showing any sort of economic deceleration and then there's a bunch of things in the middle uh like manufacturing uh and other things like that that have shown deceleration but not to the same degree that you've seen in say real estate or unprofitable Tech and to the extent that the market is pricing in kind of a top in terms of fed rates um you know maybe the first half of this year uh maybe a bottom in liquidity that's generally good for say scarce ads that don't have to worry about profits you know historically that'd be gold now it's Bitcoin and similar assets where those types of things don't really have to worry about recession but they do have to worry about liquidity conditions and those have changed we're trying to square some of this for for bankless listeners Lynn because when I hear you speak about these conditions and compared to 2019 and say where it's like this is a liquidity issue that sort of thing um my mind is put at ease a little bit or at least I'm I'm much less alarmed than some of the other messages and guess we've we've had on recently so um just last week we had um or maybe this week before David I can't remember at this point biology on and of course this is uh you know sort of the famous Bitcoin to a million in 90 day type of bet um whether you you know you you take that as 100 conveyance of of his ideas or maybe like he's five or ten percent right it was a very clear message that uh the FED balance sheet is going to print a whole lot of money to make up for this Bank crisis whether you call it uh you know insolvency or that whether you call it like liquidity issue and then we had Arthur hazon Who sort of echoed a similar sentiment but his time range was was larger he was like well you know the 90-day thing is never going to happen but I could see Bitcoin to a million dollars in like you know two to four years potentially if Domino one Falls which is kind of Bank crisis run on the bank uh more money is printed uh we get kind of another four trillion dollars on the balance sheet and that causes the next uh Domino to follow etc etc and then suddenly suddenly you have a a dollar that has hyperinflated and then we had Ben Hunt on the podcast this is this is all in a very short period of time Lynn so uh we're not only trying to get like the point the Counterpoint we're trying to get like you know all of the different uh opinions and ideas on this out so that bankless listeners can kind of make a decision and Ben was basically like you can't call this an insolvency at all he said this is just a liquidity issue um and he was actually angry these are his words angry at those in maybe the crypto space or sort of the hard asset space who are saying get your money out of the banking system system he said that like they were making things up basically that the the ship hadn't hit an iceberg there was icebergs exist but like the ship is not sinking everything's going to okay it would be okay and he was um very critical of those who are calling for uh all of passengers to to run to the lifeboats and then we had Jim Bianco on who gave us kind of another take which was a little bit um between both Ben and and Balaji and Arthur and and here we are now and we're talking to you Lynn and trying to just Square all of these different um ideas now if I if I were to position you around that kind of Balaji to Ben Spectrum it seems like you are closer to the bend side than to to the Balaji side but I also don't want to put words in your mouth so I know you've been observing all of this conversation and have your own takes what is your take on this whole debate and all of the various opinions and ideas of what's going to happen next sure so I think you know between your descriptions somewhere between Arthur and Ben would be my position uh not not where Ben is um similar to Arthur but yeah I don't think about I my base case would not be a million Bitcoin in four years um and then I'm I'm pretty far from the 90-day hyperinflation um the way so the way I would characterize it is the reason I'm fading the left Tails because I don't really see the balance sheet going straight up um you know anytime soon um even though I don't think it'll keep going down that's why I kind of refer to sideways in fact in the past week we've seen the balance sheet go down a little bit but that's of course off after two weeks of very big gains so it's still much higher than it was three weeks ago and you know if you look at that at um yeah exactly there it is and if you look at the FED if you look at the repo Spike back from 2019 what they did was there was a pretty rapid increase in the FED balance sheet for a number of weeks and then it kind of trended sideways for a period of time all the way into February of 2020. and then of course we all know what happened next there was the March covid lockdown crash and everything went vertical and you know that that was a different scenario but if that had never happened the FED probably would have remained sideways for a longer period of time and so I think we've seen a trend change um I don't think that Trend change is going to be straight up unless there's some other big um you know psychological issue now when you look out further I do think this has implications because basically I think the long run outcome here is that the FED will reach a limit where they're unable to keep tightening while inflation does have a Resurgence in the years ahead and I think that that is a pretty pivotal change for hard assets for kind of anti-dollar Trades which is maybe where I would I probably would have lined some at least somewhat with with Arthur on that based on your description as for liquidity versus solvency I think that's very Bank dependent so that is a big difference you know 2008 was a very solvency related issue busy Banks made loans and those loans were defaulting and they had very very thin Capital very thin cash so they couldn't take much defaults uh in this scenario banks have a lot of cash and treasuries and mortgage-backed securities basically very safe assets uh in general they've not made very aggressive lending decisions but but their mistake was buying these otherwise safe assets at very low interest rates that have long duration so if Industries go up significantly those get marked down if they have to sell them between now and when they mature so it's like you're guaranteed to get your money back but if you have to sell it before that happens you could be out of luck and Silicon Valley Bank had had two sides that were extreme on one hand they made a very big bet on these long duration assets right there are other banks that were more conservative like JPMorgan for example in addition to being as big as they are they also were careful about getting into long duration assets too much they balance their book better whereas Silicon Valley Bank was far on the side of like let's just buy all the long duration stuff right so they're getting killed on that side and then two is the uh your your deposit risk right so Silicon Valley Bank also was an extreme there which is they catered mainly to businesses and so the vast majority of their deposits were uninsured because of the size of individual deposits um and they also were obviously very concentrated into a handful of Industries in a region and so their deposit base was very flight worthy and so it you have the combination of those two was was very toxic and so they were a a outlier in terms of their risk now this other handful of banks that are close on one metric so for example First Republic was did not have quite the same asset side problems uh but it had a similar clientele of a very high uninsured deposits and it still had long duration kind of a liquid loans and so that that's a problem for them less extreme than Silicon Valley Bank but still a problem on the other hand there there are you know for example Charles Schwab is one of the biggest brokerages in the country and they're technically insolvent right now and you wouldn't know it by looking at the stock and so they actually have a similar problem with Silicon Valley Bank where they bought a lot of long duration assets at low rates that are they're now underwater on and those exceed their Capital right so they're negative what makes it different so far at least is that you know less than 20 of their deposits are uninsured and they have a much broader Diversified base and you know their their Charles Schwab so they're perceived as being you know bigger safer uh probably backstop as you know if needed and so it's not quite enough to say it's just a liquidity problem the the sheer speed with which rates went up and the discount that these otherwise safe assets have on their books have put a lot of banks into a solvency problem if they're forced to sell um whereas this but it's not a it's not a solvency problem that extends up to the base bank so JPMorgan solvent cities solvent Bank of America solvent uh Wells Fargo solvent some of the other kind of big top 10 banks are solvent um even smaller Banks many of them are still solvent it's very kind of Hit or Miss and so I think it's an ongoing liquidity and profitability problem for a lot of banks and then for certain banks that are outliers there are some solvency concerns so this is really interesting I I do feel like uh it's probably accurate that you are somewhat in between like kind of the the Arthur take and and the bent hunt take here um and you even kind of uh you describe sort of a mix of problems uh there's liquidity problems certainly but there's there's also for some banks particularly maybe the smaller Banks this um liquidity problem because they have a long-term duration bonds that they purchased and and those things are underwater and so the small and the medium banks are are feeling the full effect of this there's this idea that that Arthur also expressed though is just kind of the idea that um this unprofitability may lead to insolvency and that there will be this this kind of the sucking sound of like all of this uh deposits being withdrawn from some of the smaller Banks maybe the most more vulnerable uh banks on the on the asset side into higher yield um you know pools right in like D5 we would call this like uh you know um yield pools it's like yields farming right and so depositors are are taking a look at their their checking account they're saying like why would I settle for like 0.5 or like even one percent from the bank or less uh when I can go to a money market and get you know a cool four or five percent and so there's almost like this slow motion crash happening where liquidity and deposits are flowing outside of these Banks and sometimes that's slow and sometimes it's like fast motion where we see there's some kind of a rumor and there's a run on the bank and I I believe Arthur's thesis here is that that will just continue right up to the point where you know there won't be a flat uh fed balance sheet it will actually like start to gradually increase upwards and there could be some catalyzing events other bank runs that sort of thing that just you know springboarded up he didn't what about that like how does that get resolved that's part of what I don't understand is is how the you know the problem of um being like bonds and treasuries being underwater for some of these these Banks and and uh the the problem of kind of this liquidity of depositors getting getting sucked out of the banks I don't I don't know how that gets solved like it feels like we maybe band-aided the issue right now but there are these long-term persistent issues uh what's your take on this yeah I think he raises good points and I think that there's a lot of Truth to that um the way I would break it down is that I do think that the FED balance sheet is going to go up in the longer term uh in large part because they'll end up kind of monetizing some of the ongoing large deficits uh I think in the intermediate term it's probably sideways-ish until unless there's some sort of psychological event right I think mathematically it can go sideways for a period of time but you know specific bank runs are unpredictable because it's you know it's a social media phenomenon it's a it's a herd phenomenon so there's certainly outlier cases that could that could bring forward some of the problems that I think are otherwise going to happen over time as far as the sucking that that's that you know that's why I am concerned around small and medium Banks because you know if you look back historically during rate hiking Cycles you know you have t bills and money markets they will offer much higher rates and usually Bank deposits are pretty sticky people don't shop around their Banks too frequently and so you see a widening gap between deposit rates that don't really move uh you know at least on average and then you have you know all those other things and it's usually because the hiking cycle doesn't last very long you know people are just you know suit hype they have other things going on they don't they don't optimize that it's not something they focus on um if you start to see busy perceptions around higher for longer it does start to raise the average deposit floor and we're already seeing early signs of that banks are very gradually raising their deposit rates and in addition that hurts small Banks more than big Banks because for example JP Morgan does not have to raise rates because everybody wants an account at JPMorgan um you know so they don't they can just keep them low or raise them very slowly whereas if you're a small Bank who's dealing with deposit flight you you don't have to raise rates uh deposit rates and then the problem is that that affects your profitability which if it gets bad enough can affect your solvency and yeah the funny thing is you look at the Federal Reserve themselves they are unprofitable and they have negative tangible Equity right so what they you know part of their setting a mate policy was that they sharply increase the rates on on their you know what they pay to Banks what they pay to money markets while their assets are all these long duration assets they hold Treasures they hold mortgage-backed Securities and so the fed's actually operating at a loss for the first time in modern history uh and they have a trillion dollars in unrealized losses uh but of course no one can do a run on the FED directly they basically can control their liability side so but you basically see a microcosm that's kind of that that shows the extreme event of what a bank can look like if they have to raise their rates all the way up to the current money market t-bill rate and so I don't think it'll get that far but basically the longer that they stay up here the more banks have to do it now the way it can resolve is partially a matter of speed if they have to raise their rates to like three four percent you know this year you'll see a lot of banks go completely insolvent uh get bought out there's already been a multi-decade process of Bank consolidation basically smaller Banks going away getting either merging together or being absorbed by bigger Banks and becoming bigger Banks uh so I think that's going to continue possibly accelerate now if the feds slow goes down their hiking cycle if deposit rates adjust more slowly basically as certain loans come due and they're redeployed into new loans at higher rates you know Banks both their asset side and their liability side can kind of move up together what really hurt them here was the sheer speed with which rates went up in a given year because it's the fastest since the 70s in uh you know that the number of basis points and it's the fastest ever in terms of the percent increase basically because you're you're going up from such a small base uh and so that's what really hurt Banks Lynn I'm I'm wondering if you could uh help us with some maybe classroom time with Lynn uh for a second because you know I have a like now I feel like I have a fairly decent understanding of what's on a typical um Banks balance sheet whether it's a you know small medium-sized Bank in the US or one of the one of the big cannot fail too big to fail Banks but you mentioned something there about kind of the fed's balance sheet and uh maybe we could kind of look back at this graph here where we see that sort of rise over time and this is um showing 8.9 trillion dollars was kind of the high and that was in uh April of 2022 or so and then uh 2023 March we we dropped down um you know the quantitative tightening I believe is going on and and these assets were leaving the FED balance sheet uh and now they've spiked back up which looks like kind of a you know the liquidity you were talking about now more recently over the last week or so they're a little bit down but you said something interesting there which is like the FED oh always operates with an insolvency and of course like no no one can do a run on the bank of the of the fed I'm actually not sure how all of that works so uh can you like explain that it's like so what is on the fed's balance sheet all of these numbers these trillions of dollars like what are they and how can how can it how mechanically does it operate um you know at a uh at a loss every year and uh why can no no one do a run on the fed or what would a run on the FED even even look like if if that was possible sure happy to cover edit clarify they don't always operate a loss they ever since September of last year they began operating at a loss for the first time in modern history usually they operated a profit and so what the what the fed's balance sheet looks like has changed over time if you go back far enough it was gold but if you just go back if you know before the global financial crisis let's say you know 15 years ago they mostly own treasuries so they own treasuries and just like a you know their own treasuries is this correct no it's like fed it's it's federal government treasuries yes yeah U.S treasuries it's a liability for the treasury and asset for the FED right and you know just like any bank has assets and liabilities a central bank also has assets and liabilities and so for a central bank their liabilities are one uh banknotes so if you have a physical dollar that's a direct liability of the FED obviously it pays zero interest rates because you don't you know if you hold a physical dollar at zero zero rates um and also Bank Reserves so you know basically when your bank holds some of their cash they hold it at the fed and they you know depending on the era in question they do earn some interest rates on that you know the third component of liability is a little more complex it's reverse repos but it's it's basically another interest bearing uh liability for the fed and so those are the three main types of liabilities and their then their assets historically were treasuries ever since the 2008 crisis uh it's consisted of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities um and so they own a ton of treasures and mortgage-backed securities those make up the majority of those assets uh and so his you know for most of the past several decades their assets paid a higher interest rate than their liabilities because their assets are on average longer duration and their liabilities because of the banknote portion has zero yielding component so it's actually pretty hard for their average liability interest rate to exceed their average asset interest rate uh but because of the speed with which they raised rates from such a low base uh this time it's the first time in in modern history maybe maybe in the 50s they had it but it's the first time in modern history where their average liability interest rate is higher than their average asset because they're what they pay on uh Bank Reserves and what they pay on reverse repos is closer to five percent whereas what they're earning on their treasures and mortgage-backed securities is I don't know two percent three percent something like that not very high and so now they're operating at a loss and in a healthy environment before they were operating a loss you know the FED would earn say 100 billion dollars a year in that interest spread and by law they have to give that to the treasury so they they basically operate profitably they cover their expenses and then all their excess profits go to the treasury now that they're not operating at a profit anymore um they basically they don't have to pay the treasury anymore and in the future if they're ever if they're ever profitable again they get to pay themselves back for their accumulated losses before they'd have to send money to the treasury so the short answer is that in the near term nothing happens to a central bank when it goes technically insolvent because no one can do a bank run on it and it can still cover its expenses if it goes on long enough then it starts bringing up questions of fed Independence uh if they're insolvent and uh you know that they're having issues like that then you're probably going to hear from Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren or others every time Powell has to go in Congress and start bringing it up so there is like a Fed Independence question independence from what the political system the government yeah basically central banks the reason they have assets and liabilities uh and that they you know they generate a profit is to try to make them independent uh now it doesn't they're not fully independent because you know they they have oversight kind of like how the Supreme Court right you so they're put in a place you know by the Senate and the president but once they're in place they operate pretty independently from Congress or from the president the president can't just call it the Supreme Court tell them to do something similarly you know a central bank their heads are put in place by the Senate and the president but once they're in place unless they're doing something illegal they're now operating someone independently if they have their own funding source and so for example during uh I believe it's 2017 president Trump was not happy with Powell raising rates uh but it's not there's nothing you can really do about it if if it was part of the executive branch a president could for example tell a central Banker to cut rates six weeks before an election you know and boost the chances that so that's the kind of Independence they want to have that you the president can't directly tell that the head of the Central Bank what to do now during crises you know pandemics Wars Central Bank Independence kind of goes away uh more or less uh so extreme events you know that Independence is an illusion but during routine events much like the Supreme Court and other things it's almost like a fourth branch of government and the reason nobody can do a direct run on a central bank is because all banks in the country have to hold their cash at the FED uh there's no alternative there's no one there's no area that they can flee to and the FED determines what those are you know they can increase the amount of cash that those banks in aggregate are holding at the fed or they can decrease it now the way that a central bank can indirectly have a bank run is if everyone wants to sell the currency right if we don't trust that right the turkey turkey central banks do well we sell the Lira and they're they're it gets taken out in the in the the the value of that currency not from Banks pulling out of their Central Bank and forcing them to sell and gather realized losses in the way that these Banks do Lynn that is the value of that currency and also the the value of those treasuries as well because they they are somewhat one in the same are they not right so like when we look at this this graph of the the FED um central bank balance sheet you said all of these uh trillions in uh in value on the left these are mainly composed now in the modern Fiat fed no longer uh Bang reserves it was a little bit but I don't know if that's like five or ten percent or something like this it's mainly mortgage-backed Securities which of course like people know this is backed by some property some like actual house value somewhere out there uh and then it's treasuries and so kind of the question is like um all right so what what is the value of a treasury because when when someone hears about you know Central Banking for the first time it all seems so self-referential so your assets are your treasuries wait what like is this Monopoly money like so how does how does the Tre how are the why are the treasuries valuable maybe that's my questions like why are U.S treasuries actually valuable and who gets to say how valuable they are is is that where you start to have external country sort of pressure where other currencies are like or like where the US dollar and treasuries are being devalued relative to other currencies yeah okay tell us about it exactly exactly so I had to clarify one point the Bank Reserves are a liability for the Fed at an asset for those Banks and they're backed up by treasures and mortgage-backed securities so to give you a rough magnitude there's something like 3 trillion in Bank Reserves at the moment got it and those are those are one of the fed's liabilities along with physical Bank notes and reverse repos so that's the liability bucket for the fed and then their assets or Treasures mortgage-backed Securities and this recent Spike you see on the chart that's that's that's their loans that they've been making so there's around the margins there's things like loans and assets like that that are liabilities for the bank that borrow the loan and it's an asset for the FED that made the loan but the vast majority of their assets are those Treasures Market Securities and and to answer your question you know if you go back far enough it was not you know now it's circular but if you go back far enough it was non-circular uh gold was at the foundation of the system gold is an asset that's not someone else's liability it's just it's accumulated energy work no one can just print more of it you have to go out and find it and so gold was the underpinned asset and dollars represented claims redeemable claims for gold you know you could deposit your goal into the banking system and now you had access to all the conveniences of a bank and if for any reason you wanted to pull your money out you could take it out in gold and the same and you know at first it was like free Banks or Banks held their own gold and eventually central banks where they they you know they held their assets at the at the central bank and the Central Bank held gold and then as we've moved away from that system it's backed up by government bonds which is circular so you know basically you know liability it's every asset is a liability so you know the the underlying asset for the whole system is essentially treasuries and now mortgage-backed Securities too and those are someone else's liabilities the the Treasures of the government's liability and mortgage-backed securities are home owners uh liabilities and so you have that circular system and what determines it is basically International exchange rates uh as well as things like prices of real goods and services and alternative monies like gold right so you know if you have a country with your currency crisis like let's say you look at Turkey you look at the value of all of their money uh you know when they're having a problem and nobody wants to own Turkish paper assets that'll all decline compared to say the market capitalization of gold or compared to the market capitalization of say the United States on the other hand if they get their act together and they strengthen and they stabilize things and more money wants to go back into turkey the overall value of their currency and bond market their paper assets will increase again uh to represent that and what essentially gives a currency some degree of you know worthwhileness is that it's kind of like you know if there's an arcade and the only way to play all the games was that you needed their token to do it imagine if their tokens were not paying the dollar they're just free floating right the quality of that arcade determines basically what those tokens are worth if they have the best games and you know they don't they don't change things very frequently you want to hold you know you're fine to hold those tokens for a period of time whereas if it's if if that arcade's on the decline if you know if if they if they printed a ton of extra tokens nobody wants to hold the tokens and so all these countries there's like 180 currencies they're basically local monopolies and if you live in that jurisdiction you have to pay taxes with that currency and so all these all these basically currencies are receipts to say okay this is tax this is a this can pay a tax in this country so you know if you pick a very small impoverished country that currency is not going to be worth much whereas if you pick a country like the United States or Japan or or parts of Europe things like that that currency historically holds value reasonably well because it's a it's a more stable system at least outside of War crisis things like that Baker station we are getting schooled by Lynn Alden I I love this this is um if you've not heard this before I think this is a brilliant you know explanation of what's going on in central banks so so Lynn let me sort of um maybe try to summarize a little bit of this but so the U.S treasuries are so valuable and they're for the dollar is so valuable because the us right now has the best arcade in the game or maybe has for the last 80 years since uh Bretton Woods and and people want like great games you could buy petro with a dollar all sorts of things if if I were to sort of abstractly now that the dollar is very self-referential it's all kind of Fiat race is Fiat based and um if I were to look at a treasury is this kind of like a metric of U.S power dominance or is it like the US military or is it at the strength of the U.S economy like or is it just like I don't know the games in the arcade is maybe that the the better way to phrase it like some some people say that the the dollar is valuable because the US has the strongest military in the world and I is that an oversimplification what would you say um to kind of like summarize where the value of treasuries is actually coming from I would say the economy and capital markets are the number one thing uh with military being a a second and it mattered more in the past and so you know if you look at so basically if you go back to the the world picture there's roughly 180 currencies and they have a ironically a barter problem you know how does how does how does Nigeria trade with South Korea uh they don't they don't trust each other's ledgers necessarily right because any either one of them can you know print all the currency they want and so historically it was gold the problem is gold is it's not very quick uh and so right now what they do is they all kind of look at the United States and say well you know South Korea doesn't necessarily trust Nigeria Nigeria doesn't necessarily trust South Korea but they both say well we'll use dollars right because dollar you know the United States is big uh relatively stable and so we can use dollars for that International solving of the barter problem and you know if you look back historically it was uh you know the United Kingdom had the global Reserve currency uh until roughly World War One World War II is kind of multi-step decline you had the rise of the United States after World War II because we were relatively unharmed by the war we emerged by far stronger than anyone else and so we did the bread and wood system which is we we basically said okay all your other currencies pegged to the dollar the dollar will be pegged at gold and that's how we'll do International settlements that lasted you know from 1940s until 1971 when the United States defaulted on on gold because there were too many dollars compared to gold and so then we've been in this floating era and the way that the United States was able to maintain that was kind of two ways one is that there still was no alternative if you want fast International settlements there was no currency better than the dollar uh in the 70s after that the fault um and two the United States made deals with Saudi Arabia and other countries to only sell their oil in dollars and to hold a lot of their surpluses in treasuries basically you know kind of kick start this network effect that was somewhat already there because of that Bretton Wood system and so now at this point it's kind of a multi-decade network effect of one biggest economy in the world to you know reasonably strong property rights rule of law uh a depth of capital markets so uh no Capital controls so treasury is a pretty liquid Market S P 500 is pretty liquid uh Bond markets liquid uh you can buy and sell and move around pretty readily unless you're you know a pariah State pretty much um yeah basically that that's how it's been for a while it's kind of viewed as almost like neutral territory with tons of depth and stability uh whereas China now is rivaling the United States and in terms of some scales um but they have Capital controls and so it's it's a and less overall property rights rule of law uh but it's more like whatever the the leadership wants to do and rather than kind of like independent institutions and open borders uh and so that's it's not really a good alternative yet although around the margins it's going from say zero percent to you know five percent rising in terms of of you know usage so I think we're kind of pointing towards a more multi-polar world but essentially what what gives that strength so far is the size of the economy and Ray dalio did some research on this a while ago where he would he would map Reserve currency countries in terms of multiple metrics so education uh Innovation uh military uh size of the economy and their and then their percentage of like World Reserve Holdings and generally the reserve holding is on a lag so usually education Innovation economy go up first and then and then their currency usage on the global scale follows and then those things Peak and then some decades later currency Peaks and then starts rolling over so the United States in many metrics you know peaked relative to others roughly 20 years ago and our currency is kind of rolling over but it's still the near the the peak because it's one of the last things that starts to stagnate because it's got that momentum it's got that Network effect from all those prior decades you know uniswap as the world's largest decks with over 1.4 trillion dollars in trading volume but

federal reserve's balance sheet this is like the deepest pool in the ocean the deepest part of the sea the most liquid part of like the world right um and really this conversation and this banking crisis started and I've been using this phrase across a couple podcasts like the long tale of Banks and I think the smallest and most Regional Banks probably as a as a trend uh to make a blanket statement the smallest Banks got hurt the worst and the biggest banks got hurt the least worst uh and there's been ever since this banking crisis started to unfold there's been this flight up the liquidity pools like down down towards the gravitational Center which is the federal reserve's balance sheet and the closer you are to the federal reserve's balance sheet the safer you are like the bigger banks are super safe and the smallest and most Regional banks are the the ones that are most uh uh most insolvent or most illiquid um and then we we skipped into this conversation of like okay well what happens when the what happens when you do a run on the Central Bank what does that hypothetically look like and the answer is like oh well you look at X external currencies external Fiat assets and so the the visual I want to put in bankless listeners heads is that like uh kind of like a of a river and a rivers that like converge and converge and converge and then they ultimately converge at like the deepest part of the ocean right eventually all all Rivers lead to the ocean I want to actually go back to the other end of this spectrum to where where we talked about like the long tail of banks that serves a long tail of the economy because when what you just said just now is that like Fiat demand and economic demand creates Fiat demand but right now uh if I'm understanding this correctly and I want to get your opinion on this is that since the long tail banks are going to have a a profitability problem they're likely I'm guessing not going to be giving out credit they're not going to be giving a lot of credit out to their particular regions which means like the the rural areas of the economy are going to be credit underserved and under growth and really what what when we see this sucking again talking about that sucking up to the big Banks and up to the federal reserve's balance sheet to me I hear that we are pulling away growth and Innovation from the long tail parts of the economy and I want to get your perspective in on like what that does for the next 5 to 10 to 15 years of economic growth in the United States and then after like we talk about this for a little bit I want to zoom back out to like what that means for the the role of the dollar but first can you talk about just like the impact of the economy as a result of this sucking a way of credit and capital away from from the long tail yeah I think it's actually a really good set of questions um you know if you look at Banks Nationwide smaller banks have a higher ratio of assets that are in loans uh so they make individual loans to individuals or companies whereas larger Banks they do lending but they um they hold a lot more Securities um and you know when they do make loans it's usually to very large entities so you know big Banks make loans to Big entities and small Banks generally make loans to smaller entities um you know especially talking about businesses and so to the extent that these small Bank environment is less vibrant that is generally economy negative uh generally negative for smaller uh businesses things like that now I think the good news is it's not as though that whole log tails and solvents I mean there are plenty of of small Banks and Credit Unions that uh you know they manage their duration well most of their depositors are under the FDIC limit so they're not you know they're less at risk of like immediate flight run and instead I think the main risk is that as they gradually have to increase their deposit rates in order to not have their all their money flow at the JP Morgan uh or money markets they're going to face ongoing profitability problems and yes they're probably going to curtail their lending especially if the FED tries to stay tight and tries to keep liquidity down and so what that generally does is it points to a period of disinflation and potentially recession if we're talking six months 12 months 18 months it generally points in that direction now things can change between now and then that could reinvigorate it so on one hand you have pretty inflationary factors you know the fact that the that the FED is not tightening as fast as they were is somewhat inflationary if we start to see China open up and Spike oil prices for example that could be inflationary there are a number of inflationary catalysts and risks out there and I think the longer term story is going to be probably future waves of inflation I think the nearer term story at least for now is still some period of disinflation which is demands coming down lend is going to go down and that kind of points towards stagnation recession until there's some sort of policy change or something that kind of kicks starts the next cycle when you zoom out long term you know it's interesting most countries have fewer Banks even on a per capita basis in the United States we're actually kind of an outlier in terms of how many small Banks we have even though the numbers gone down dramatically over the past 50 years we used to have like 13 000 Banks and now we have like 4 000 Banks uh just in the past 50 years and if you go back further than that it was well over 20 000 Banks so we've actually we've gone down quite a bit but if you look at Canada for example they're way more Consolidated into their top four or six Banks if you look at the UK also more Consolidated and I think I mean you could argue that our small Bank long tail that we have compared to other countries is one of our sources of innovation because they can experiment more they can specialize more uh you know if everybody has to go to Bank of America they might not get the lending they otherwise would have gotten um and so I do think that's a it's not healthy in the long term um and it's something but I think it's something that's going to keep continuing regardless I think that we're going to see that ongoing sucking towards the larger and larger Banks and money markets things like that yeah and since larger and larger banks are generally more like Risk averse and like you said that's the smaller banks that are willing to specialize and get into the Nicks and crannies of the economy this seems just like an overall damper on Innovation right I I think around the margin yes um now I think that some of these I mean obviously I think Silicon Valley Bank got excessive um you know there are other banks that specialize in farm lending you know there's all sorts of different pockets they know their Community well they know um their industry well they if they specialize uh so yeah I do think it's it's not healthy to have more centralization of lending decisions um basically access to Credit in this in this system we've we've constructed that we live in is of significant importance um and so I I do think it's probably going to slow down and then also when you when you just zoom out in general um you know we've had this kind of 40-year period of ever lower interest rates and ever higher Equity valuations ever higher you know XYZ of real estate valuations things like that and I think a challenge that we're now going into a trend where interest rates are sideways to up and so a lot of these valuations of say equities real estate things like that even if they grind along sideways in nominal terms or even if you know if inflation's high enough they could even go up in nominal terms but I think in say inflation adjusted terms a lot of these assets are probably not going to perform very well that can blow up the government deficit because they're kind of reliant on ever larger capital gains taxes you know asset price is always going up and so I I do think that the United States does enter somewhat of a situation you've already kind of seen in Japan or Europe of a period of stagnation that that's at least the risk uh if we if you know if things kind of discontinue pointing in this direction and okay so let's so that was the long tail of the economy and now that we're talking about again like the macro let's just ask the question if if we do enter a stagnation era uh and what does that mean what does that do for the position of the dollar in in the global ecosystem we've had a couple tweets that we're about to pull up but just like the topic of dollar hegemony like is is this perhaps a time to rethink the Dollar's role in the world so I do think we're seeing diversification uh now there's like two sides of this that I think are both wrong they're they're people that are always calling for like the immediate end of dollar hegemony right around the corner and if they've been doing this for 10 15 20 plus years uh they're always early it's always hype driven it's you know it's like okay 5 10 15 20 years go by and it's like no that's not what happened um whereas other people are basically saying no all that's a conspiracy theory it's gonna stay like this forever uh Nothing's Gonna Change and I think that's obviously it's very backward looking it's it's not Dynamic I think you know what we're seeing now China has rivaled the United States in terms of uh economy size and some metrics so they're they're way higher than us in industrial production more skyscrapers more electricity bigger commodity importer they're the largest trade partner with most countries in the world it used to be the United States now it's China uh they're still weaker on on Military um and then they're way weaker on Capital controls and openness right so so you know most countries feel more comfortable holding U.S assets than China you know unless you're Russia or unless you're Iran unless you're basically outside of that Western sphere and you're you're looking Eastward now so I think what we're we're kind of trending towards is a more multi-polar world where instead of the United States kind of being the only game in town I I think we're especially with the war and the seizing of reserves you know countries don't want to have all their assets you know in the United States fear they want to diversify their assets they want to have Diversified Payment Systems so they can't be cut off from global trade they don't want their assets seized and so I think we're seeing kind of these these Regional polls of power where the United States is still a you know currently the the leading currency around you know it's better than the euro in many ways it's it's more open than the Yuan it's still the number one and number two economy and then you have these other ones that are competing around the margins especially if you're you know culturally or economically tied to China more so than the United States and we've also seen a rise in Gold so you know from the 70s until 2008 you had a decline in Gold ownership among central banks globally and they basically shifted out of gold and more towards dollars ever since the 2008 financial crisis so the bottom you know central banks got down to like just under 30 000 tons in 2009 and then ever since then it's been a v-shaped recovery they're just increasing their goal tonnage over time uh they're back up to something like 36 000 tons and so around and that's kind of like you know neutral ground you know if if country if a country holds gold reserves and it actually self-cosities of them they now have this like sanction resistant asset that is no one can print it it's slow but but at least it's theirs and they can over time use it if they need to and so I think we're seeing a little bit more of a diversification where you know Brazil says I want to hold dollars I want to hold gold I want to you know I'm willing to hold some Chinese Yuan as well because they're a big trading partner uh and I think you just see that that a little bit more global decentralization and then I'm hoping you can make the case for a frequently on Bank list we talk about um uh stable coins and crypto rails as a really good way for the United States government to maintain supremacy of the dollar and that's perhaps why they should adopt these systems but I actually want to leave that conversation just aside because it's actually adjacent to the topic at hand um I'm hoping you can actually present the bookcase for actually the United States not having the world's Global Reserve currency like what how why is this why might this be good for our economy why why might this be good for uh the actual uh people of the United States rather than just like you know being able to fund and finance our military like why should we be perhaps interested in exploring this future yeah it's a good question because when people talk about dollar hegemony they they implicitly assume it's a bad thing should it be lost and they don't ask for who and why and so basically the way that this works is that you know if you go back to the Bretton Wood system when it was all pegged to Gold the downside of the system is that in order to maintain it the United States got emptied out of its gold reserves we went from like 20 000 tons of gold down to like 8 000 tons until we be defaulted on the system so that was the cost of maintaining we got a lot of advantages from it but we also that was our cost we had to basically keep Outsourcing our gold in order to you know maintain it and when we pivoted towards putting the treasury at the heart of the global system uh in the 1970s um our cost is that the you know so most currencies the value of their currency in large part trades on how desirable it is to hold it but another big factor is trade balances you know if if Japan sells way more stuff than it buys globally this business basically more revenue flowing into Japan and that tends to keep the value of their all else being equal their you know the value of their currency you know reasonably strong and if a country starts running persistent trade deficits usually their currency weakens and that has a natural effect where they're able to buy less they're able to import less and at the same time their ability to export gets more competitive because they're they're poorer and you know their labor is now cheaper and it might be more cost effective to put a factory there you know assuming they still have they're operating socially on the other hand if a country has a trade surplus you know usually their currency will appreciate and that'll increase their import power and decrease their ability to export things cost effectively and so that can actually shrink their trade deficit their Trade Surplus back down over time so you kind of have this natural you know they kind of want to keep pushing towards a neutral trade balance uh through currencies now one thing that happens is the problem is if if a country has an extra monetary premium place on if more people want to hold dollars even if they're not trading with the United States then what it does is our currency is always a little bit stronger than it should be which means it's you know we always have a little bit extra import power but we also have a little bit less export competitiveness all else being equal and so it kind of it contributes to us having a structural like five decade long trade deficit which basically means that we've kind of hollowed out our industrial base so our our building to make cars our ability to make engineer you know Precision Engineering equipment our ability to do XYZ has been heavily impaired uh doesn't mean we can't if you know if some companies particularly good they can still be in the United States but it's just all of the headwinds are against us in that regard and it's way more cost effective to produce electronics and all sorts of stuff in China Taiwan all these other countries and it's it's gotten to the point where it's gone on so long where it's almost a national security issue where we can't even you know if we want to build electronics for our military if you want to build electronics for this you know if China Cuts us off you know we can we can cut them off and cause them National Security issues on certain things but they can also cut us off and cause National Security things and so we've we've hollowed ourselves out enough and that's actually a downside of the system that basically having dollar hegemony is really good for the military industrial complex it's really good for DC it's really good for the banks it's really good for if it's kind of neutral to good if you work in an industry where you're not trying to trying to export kind of lower margin things so if you're you know if you work in Tech if you work in healthcare uh it's probably pretty good for you whereas if you uh are a blue collar worker or you basically if you want to make stuff in America and and sell it abroad that's that's you know that's been it's been negative for that group and it's kind of been negative negative industrial policy Pro financialization policy so if that were to reverse it'd be very painful at first but then depending on how we handled it it would also allow us our economy more balanced again the way it was decades ago yeah and uh so the idea here is that because in the United States dollars the world Reserve currency we export dollars instead of exporting product instead of exporting nouns widgets uh and so because we can't we can't compete our own manufacturing our domestic manufacturing can't to compete with our ability to export dollars why can't that be true because the Federal Reserve can print dollars for free where it takes labor and materials to produce widgets the Federal Reserve can just press print and Export that instead and so this is like where American like exceptionalism comes in we just have all these free Tailwinds because the world start like demands our dollars and so like that's the argument for why uh perhaps a dollar not should not be or ought not to be or perhaps could not be the the dollar the the hegemonic currency of the world and Lynn when we had you on previously I asked you the question did we've talked about this a few times before on Bank lists and and but it's been a while I asked you the question did the role of the United States dollar as the global Reserve currency perhaps impact the 2016 election with Donald Trump versus the you know the Democrats and and the idea here is that he he won a bunch of Swing states that were previously blue that swung red that's where all manufactured capturing States and this is why I started this uh this like a series of questions with talking about the long tail of Banks and the long tail of the economy I'm wondering if you see similar political divisions as a result of this uh banking crisis banking insolvency because if all this credit is getting sucked away from the long tail and pulled into the Federal Reserve and perhaps a different currency might this also create uh more further left versus blue divisions in in the economy is this something to be to be worried about do you have any perspectives here I I do I think this does contribute to populism um and it can take different forms obviously one of them is is is the you know the the trumpian uh wing of uh the Republican party that's that's a that's one of the forms of populism and I do think that's that's the type of things where you suddenly get more anti-establishment surprises uh with how elections can go and with things like that and you know basically it Luke I think Luke groman the analyst made a really good uh observation which is basically the patriarch system was probably a very good idea strategically during the Cold War which is basically that the United States secured you know energy secured kind of it's It's you know positioned in the Middle East kind of pushed out Soviet Union all made sense after the Soviet Union fell uh and you know we're now in the say the early 90s that was probably a time to Pivot and and change the system make it more balanced uh but they didn't do that and so ever since then the system in many ways has been harming us more than hurting us now still helpful for the military it's still helpful for for certain kind of establishment interests but it has been pretty negative for the What's called the heartland the industrial part of the of the you know the the economy and so we've kind of been in this position where if you if you're an executive in multinational corporation if you work around DC if you work in Tech or Healthcare you're probably doing pretty good Finance whereas if you if you're outside of those kind of segments it's been this long period of stagnation and these other countries kind of eating your lunch and that does cause you know just overall more polarization and also because most people can't go into the detail why that is but they know something's wrong and I think you see it come out in various ways there's certain types of left populism certain types of right populism but the general theme is kind of populism anti-establishment and people know something's wrong and then they express it in in different ways and I I do think that's a risk and it's something that as long as we we have the system kind of unchanged I think that problem is going to either remain or possibly get worse this is really fascinating because before we started talking about like the dollar uh hegemony and the dollar is the reserve currency of the world you're kind of painting a picture of a very choppy decade right that could have some form of like you know inflation on the on the one side and then deflation recession on the other side and what keeps going through my head is whenever the the FED is is printing or whenever there's talk about inflation or deflation or recession is like this ain't going to be good for wealth inequality in the United States it's what I always think I'm just like let's say the money printer goes back on Lynn and sometime over this decade which likely will and Arthur Hayes is right or abology is is correct we know where the info where the money printer inflation primarily goes and that's the asset prices right we have a just a Delta between the wealthiest United States and um like the least wealth wealthy that hasn't been seen since one like I don't know the night 1820s before the Robert Barron era and so as you're painting the picture of the next 10 years is just look looking very Bleak from what the inequality perspective and that's why we see wealth inequality spills out into our politics and all of these social issues I had never actually considered I think or thought deeply about the the idea that well maybe the path out of wealth inequality and some of the the social um fracturing we see right now is the loss of the dollar as the reserve currency that's kind of an interesting thing like maybe the antidote is the dollar is no longer the export to the world and we kind of reverse this and get manufacturing Blue Collar jobs back into the United States um but but I also have to like pause it and sort of wonder if if Reserve currency status isn't somewhat like um a ring of power do you know like just like Lord of the Rings style where you have the ring of power and you know it's better for you to like give it up and it's hollowing you out on inside and you're like turning from looking like a hobbit to more and more like a Golem every single day but it's just you can't give it away you can't like cast it into the fire and that is um the core problem because it is such a powerful tool isn't it and I don't know maybe this goes back to dalio's book I don't know if there's been in in the history of Empires rising and falling if there's ever been an Empire who has cast The Ring Into the Fire and said no no longer we no longer want to be the reserve currency of the world we'll we'll hand that off to the a succeeding Empire and so I wonder if if the United States is just in this impossible state do you have any Reflections on this yeah it's a great set of questions and one is that large organizations really disrupt themselves whether the governments or corporations they usually get disrupted rather disrupt themselves um and so they generally don't see the flaw in their current thing they assumed okay it worked 50 years ago it's still going to work and it's just not working anymore and so but they don't really realize that and to use Lord of the Rings analogy you know I think that the challenge is that if if they were to Pivot from a position of strength then they could make use of that fact right that basically if they if they were to support Global Payments the diversification of reserves that'd be probably ironically a good thing for the United States in the long run uh but they're probably not going to do that and so basically like in the in the you know in the books and the movies Bilbo he was one of the ones that was pretty good at getting rid of the Ring before it really you know he got some corruption but he but he got but he didn't turn a Golem he got rid of it uh whereas gobs an example someone who held it way way way too long and so you know if the United States were to say uh you know pivot after the Cold War that'd be the best time to Pivot if they were to make more practice decisions to Pivot now and kind of you know kind of solve that problem now be more like you know Bilbo or something like that but as long as they kind of continue down this path it's more likely that the gollum root it's it's it gets Messier and you know as far as money printing goes I I think the challenge with that narrative is that it's it's very it's one variable among many so when you look at Japan for example you know no balance sheet has gone up quicker than Japan's you know their their broad money supply has been actually slow growth but they're but their central bank balance sheet has gone up tremendously and it's over 100 of GDP and yet they have less wealth inequality than the United States and the question is why and it's of course because they're doing other things they spend very little in the military uh their health care per capita is way lower even though they live longer and they're on average older basically it's it's their fiscal things that determine in large part you know they still haven't there's still there's poor Japanese people there's rich Japanese people it's it's a capitalist system but you have those less extremes uh a higher average median and in the United States because a lot of our budget goes to uh the military uh we have the highest per capita health care costs in the world uh there's a number of factors that apart from just the money printing uh they contribute to wealth concentration and so a lot of that is kind of just individual policies that we've we've decided and that's also that tends to be a an artifact of being a global Reserve currency that you look more like an Empire where you know we we project outward while kind of forgetting about our homeland so you know we we spend you know the Brown University estimated that we spent 5.8 trillion dollars now on the war on terror uh that's you know Afghanistan Iraq all these other stuff uh and it's it's partially from the war itself it's partially from a permanent increase in expenditure so permanent DOD increase permanent Department of Homeland Security veterans benefits interest on the debt 5.8 trillion while at home our bridges are like you know on average very old and and you know increasingly problematic our infrastructure is not great we it's kind of like we're so focused outward that we Hollow ourselves out inward in multiple ways and I think that's that's the challenge and it's ideally we would pivot out of that and focus more domestically but I I think that they you know they rarely pivot from a position of strength that really is the story of Empires isn't it I mean you wrote the Roman Empire in fighting Wars and conquering lands all the way up to uh England and uh sort of forgetting about uh the domestic side of things and what what in the city of Rome um so Lynn how does this uh this Reserve currency thing work out then if you were to give me give us kind of the summary of this part so you're thinking that there is a much more multi-polar world with respect to the reserve currency so do you see the dollar diminishing as a percentage of um use uh you know worldwide and the wand sort of taking a stronger role um gold Reserve currencies going up or is there any position for um you know digital gold uh type crypto monetary systems here how do you see this evolves over the next 10 to 20 years and let's just assume that the US is kind of taking the fate of Gollum and trying to grasp at the ring and hold it tight and not freely give up Reserve currency status so so what happens with the world Reserve currency mix do you think so I think the general Trend um now when you look how far enough it's one of those things that people you know it's not a lot can happen in a year but a lot can happen in 10 20 years and so once the further out you go the obviously the hard is to predict but essentially the general Trend um I think is that the gold trend is probably going to continue ever since it has since she has a nine so uh especially kind of brics Nations will be more likely to want to hold more gold than less gold so I think that that ratio could keep inching higher um the the wand is starting from a very small base um but I I think it's generally going to increase somewhat um it has been for the past few years there's been recent announcements that are likely to continue accelerating it and so I think that'll become an increasingly non-trivial percentage I I don't think it'll be anywhere near the dollar anytime soon but it the fact that it comes off zero diversifies things somewhat both in terms of payment you know the ability to for countries to do Center persistent payments with each other as well as you know what they hold their money in therefore you know what countries they're exposed to who can who can seize their funds that kind of thing just more diversification um as far as you know digital gold basically I do get the question on bitcoin for example and the issue is it's still too small you know even though uh Bitcoin is pretty big um for for many of us um it's still small in terms of you know Global oil trade is over two trillion dollars a year for example and we're talking about an asset that's hundreds of billions of dollars it's still small enough that whales can move it and so basically I think that as it gets bigger that does become more interesting because you have a reserve asset and you have global payment possibility but I think that you know people expecting that to happen in a year or two or three it's premature and we'll see how this technology matures and solidifies and gets bigger to the extent that it might become relevant and going back to your prior point about stable coins you know it's interesting because that's that's also the area that that's gone against the trend which is that you know central banks are modeling dollarizing over the course of a number of years while stable coins you know the the people are not detolorizing right so so people in Egypt are not de-dolarizing people in Nigeria are not de-dollarizing even though many central banks around the margins are slightly de-dollarizing uh so if you look at stable coin issuance it's over 99 dollars um and a lot of that is you know some of that's obviously defied stuff but a lot of that especially on on you know the lower fee that's a lot of that is um he's developing Market use cases where they want dollars but they don't trust their local banking system and should the United States uh support that um that I think has Runway ahead of it there's still a lot of people out there that want dollars now we talked about actually the downside of so many people wanting dollars we just covered all that uh for the United States but for in their mind basically the more that they support and allow those stable coins to exist it does I think you know keep the dollar going for a longer period of time because there's more hands out there that want to hold it whereas if they you know if they get super aggressive and they cut off stable coins from you know the the Offshore Banking system and things like that that can perhaps further um accelerate the the diversification that we're going to see probably among currencies so I think what timing what timeline we look out at depends on one technology you know the evolution of Technology over time and then two political decisions of whether or not they want they realize certain things they want to promote certain things or whether they want to pull back and a general challenge overall is that in periods we have high sovereign debt and some sort of inflationary pressure you're more likely to get Capital controls you're more likely to get um you know lending restrictions things like that I think we're seeing it around the margins with say you know operation choke point things like that and I I think the base case should be to expect that to somewhat continue and that's that's a risk that we we all have to deal with to varying degrees Yeah in a multi-polar world I don't think it takes too much imagination to understand that crypto probably does pretty well in a multi-polar world but Lynn I do take your point that right now the the market cap of Bitcoin just isn't sufficiently large to support you know an entire countries or or just like a net effect of migration from you know dollar dominance to multi-polar that also includes Bitcoin but uh and this will be speculation on the future so we of course cannot read the future uh I would I still would expect that like in a world where there is demand for a diversified currency base and Bitcoin is at the still somewhat cute market cap of something like 600 billion 700 billion dollars there would still be like a magnet pulling that thing upwards into the multi-trillion dollar market I think regardless right and and a combination of that demand of just the nature of a multi-polar currency World benefiting Bitcoin plus again technology moving digital and then also just the the the general downtrend of Fiat currencies and then also just the passing of time like give it two to four years Bitcoin is in a never mind the last um 15 or so months uh Bitcoin is in a 15-year bull market uh and so fast forward to two to four to six years this is this perhaps is when like the liquidity profile of Bitcoin could support uh something equivalently large as an entire nation's like demand for its currency do you agree with this sentiment yeah I think the long Arc of time points towards this this becoming relevant on a global scale it's already relevant for people right it's it's relevant for individuals Nigeria and individual argentinians individual uh people in Lebanon it's already kind of a you know Global money for people and the largest pools of capital it's still you know kind of too small for them uh but I I think you know Central bankers and Sovereign wealth funds would be insane not to be looking at it and studying it and you know smaller countries uh have an edge where they can you know it could be relevant for them sooner than it's relevant for the big countries uh we've seen that perhaps with El Salvador we'll see how that story unfolds but you kind of see you know these Rebel countries can kind of get into it a little bit earlier we've already seen you know probably like North Korea unfortunately is into it because they for them it's like a tool kind of like buying drugs in the internet whatever there is a tool kind of like how in the 80s drug dealers were early adopters of pagers um you know it's just that's how it works it's useful technology yeah it's it's unfortunate it's kind of how it works um when the internet came out you know the first thing it was used for was you know the things that are not not the most Savory that's kind of how this works so there's some early adopters that have a stronger Catalyst to get in there quick um but basically as it gets larger and more liquid less volatile more widely held more understood that's when I think it starts to get relevant on the on the Sovereign scale so these Rebels are defecting first um when this has been uh so much fun thank you for explaining all of these things and rounding out some of the conversations the series of conversations we've been having I it gotta end with this so uh what do we do about this we've had we've had you on before and you've talked about sort of a portfolio composition and and certainly for the 2020s being long on harder assets the digital or also you know not the digital we have Rebel countries defecting do you do you have a rebel portfolio prescription Lynn how do we uh how do we weather the next 10 years of uncertainty or even the next um I don't know the the next regime change the next wave of what the FED is going to do next so I think it's gonna look different for a 25 year old and a 75 year old but you know I've kind of pointed towards say a three pillar portfolio which is one pillar you know profitable equities you know kind of you know 401K stuff another pillar of commodity or alternative money exposure so energy producers copper producers steel producers gold Bitcoin that kind of asset uh and then the third pillar is is Cash equivalents t-bills money markets things that are you know you pay your bills with you have like a volatility volatility reduction that you can then rebalance into the other pillars should there be volatility events obviously younger investors can push out further on their on their risk Horizon older investors have to be more careful the volatility they take you know a challenge in our space is that because of how extreme these events are you have to worry about idiosyncratic events like bands or being separated from Financial system things like that which is why I you know even when someone's very bullish on an asset they should consider the tail risks and what they would do if certain tail versus materialize and therefore have enough diversification that they're able to recover they're able to take action that they can you know make use of that as as it unfolds even while you know naturally wealth tends to be built by taking pretty significant bets having a vision uh if you're right uh whereas wealth is is kept by some degree diversification and so every investor depending on their age depending on their conviction their knowledge they can they can determine how contradictable or diverse they want to be but I think that's the the general thing to do is be focused on these kind of hard assets things that have real value um you know 10 20 years in the future and then just being liquid and being you know conservative enough to realize that it's going to be a volatile Journey because you said the words tail risk I got to ask you do you think crypto is the ultimate tail risk asset that is basically the the thesis that Arthur Hade Hayes conveyed um so let's say there is some tail risk event having a bankless money outside of the existing system uh of course like if you buy oil or or gold or those sorts of things generally you're buying ious for these items whereas with with a Bitcoin or an ethereum or some cryptocurrency you can you can hold the genuine artifact yourself in a self-custodial way do you think there's value uh there's value in that in these in these uh trying times I do yeah and so you know we've already seen cases where for example uh you know a woman from Afghanistan left the country made this perilous Journey like Alex gladstein's covered it she gets the Germany she has Bitcoin with her you know she she she got robbed she had to you know all this stuff happened but she still has her 12 words and you know can can access it I know a person who you know left Venezuela um with Bitcoins right you know that they the the mining equipment was seized but they couldn't get the Bitcoin and you're out so if you can physically get out you know that the fact that you have this kind of portable you have access to a portable Ledger is is very useful and you know historically gold has been that tail risk um and it can be domestically right because you have this ass that doesn't need the Internet you know it's it is it's resistant to all sorts of things but you can't really bring it globally you you know you can't bring a large amount of gold through an airport you can't you know there's all sorts of restrictions you can only bring small amounts whereas what makes say something like bitcoin useful is that if you know if you know what you're doing there's you know you're you're tied into this Global Ledger and value flows more internationally so I think it's absolutely tail Risk insurance especially for anyone who wants to to be mobile and have their own self-custodial wealth that's right when they when they call us Doomsday Preppers I say it's just tail Risk insurance that's all that's all crypto is Lynn it's been so much fun to have you on today and to walk through all of that uh I learned a lot as I always do spending time with you they're always rational Lynn Alden we appreciate you coming on Bank list once again thanks for having me happy to be here Briston disclaimers guys of course none of this has been Financial advice we don't know what tail risks await we only know they probably are coming uh crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot foreign
