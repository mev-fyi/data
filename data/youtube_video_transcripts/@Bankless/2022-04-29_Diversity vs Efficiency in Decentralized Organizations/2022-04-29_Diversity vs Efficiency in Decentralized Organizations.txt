there's this thing in nature called the optimum window of viability where it's in between diversity and efficiency and it's always in the middle point what we tend to do is always go way too efficient and you disturb the balance too much diversity is also bad because then that doesn't work because there's too much so i think if we can get to that point where we balance out the speed because we do need to move right we can't just be like i'll be fine so i think if we can reach that balance of doing things mindfully and doing things properly that we don't cut corners very important but we move
