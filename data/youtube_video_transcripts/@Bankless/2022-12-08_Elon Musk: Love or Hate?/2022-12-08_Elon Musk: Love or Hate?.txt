you have a side you pick a side anybody who's ever been in a Tesla you'll think differently a lot of people don't actually understand how revolutionary the car itself is like you basically turned a piece of mechanical Hardware into a software which is it's not do I respect him from a baseline entrepreneurial level that said he's making some mistakes I think Twitter blue is a huge mistake I'm a fan of creating some sort of Twitter for Enterprise product basically tiered pricing based upon the number of followers that you have and then the number of tweets that you may want to send out paired especially with like a customer service function if you ever have a problem with the company what's the best way to get in touch with them you tweet at them and then American Airlines or whatever tweets back at you why do they get to do that for free in the best real-time customer service software ever existed it's like you should charge them for it and then build them like a CRM customer relations thing on the back end and they could pay a lot of money for them probably would that's the first or good original take on Twitter that I've heard in a long time thanks man
