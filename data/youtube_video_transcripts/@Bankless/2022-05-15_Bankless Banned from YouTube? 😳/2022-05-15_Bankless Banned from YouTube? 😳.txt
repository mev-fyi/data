bankless was banned from youtube we got letters we got email from youtube saying you've been deactivated it just says like you broke our terms of service see you later you know i i'm like look what did we do we kind of had an all hands moment in the bankless hq discord and we're like all right what do we do what do we do what do we do and we basically stayed silent because it was the middle of the night we know like the way forward for this is to make a bunch of noise but we're gonna wait until sunday morning so sunday morning drafted up a tweet said like yo bank list was banned and uh that that worked i will say that one of the bankless best assets is that we have is that we talk about the value of censorship resistance and d platforming so this is the wrong community to mess with because we talk about this all the time
