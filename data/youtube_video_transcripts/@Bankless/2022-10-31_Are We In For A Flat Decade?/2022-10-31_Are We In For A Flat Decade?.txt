have we bottomed yet this is a article from Zero Hedge from drucken Miller decade of no returns not just druckenmiller saying this but a lot of macro thought leaders saying this as well that basically we could be in for a flat decade what do you think of that idea generally and then we can give kind of a Counterpoint to this when we talked to Lynn Alden hey Lil and Alden we're confused and scared will you help us and she like pulls in like well this part of this macro world looks like this decade this part of the macro world looks like that decade I think that's what Stanley druckenmiller is doing I think just the broader question is does history rhyme and to what degree I think the other more relevant question is how much does crypto get caught up in that there's no way that crypto can have like a 10-year flat Market because we build too fast like stuff happens too quickly
