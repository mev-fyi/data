[Music] what up coordination how you doing on the pod today we have alan ranzel who is the director of file coin green you know about file coin the cryptocurrency that allows you to track and pin ipfs data a global file storage network but did you know that filecoin is very focused on becoming green carbon neutral using the same tracking technology that it uses to create the positive externality of more file storage on the internet filecoin green is using that same technology to make sure that it tracks its carbon output and offsets that carbon output so uh we kind of pull the thread of carbon neutrality and blockchains in this episode we talk about what web3 can do for sustainability that web 2 camp building a global carbon ledger and then creating a shelling point for the refi movement with the sustainable blockchain summit and just the growth of the refi movement in general so i think this is a fun episode and it's well timed given that the merge in ethereum is coming up 99.95 less carbon usage of the ethereum network coming up in the next month or so and i think that the sustainability of the energy usage of blockchain networks is a big big uh topic right now and filecoin has been putting in the work over the last several years in order to build filecoin green to make their network carbon positive and to be good for the world so great episode i hope you enjoy uh without

you're attending ecc visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts hey alan how's it going really good how are you pretty good thanks for thanks for joining the pod uh can you tell us about file coin and file coin green yeah um so follow coin is the storage layer of web3 um so you know ipfs right is a content delivery layer so ipfs gets your data where it needs to be when it needs to be there and make sure it's content addressed whereas filecoin is for long-term storage right so falcon launched in 2020 um the the utility token filecoin allows you to pay storage fighters to store your data and then prove that they are continuing to store that data over time and so filecoin green is our initiative which i started to try to understand the environmental impacts of the falcon network and do what we can to verifiably drive them below zero so uh you know in 2020 filecoin launched it was growing really really quickly i think we're now uh we're we're now close to something like one percent of all of the data storage data centers across the world is stored on falcoid um something like 111 the size of aws so it's a huge network it's been growing really quickly and people started asking right after it launched what are the environmental impacts how much energy does falcon use and what do we what do we know about that right and so we can get into more about how filecoin green works but what we do is we go from unchained proofs of data storage to estimates about electricity use of individual falcon storage providers and then use those estimates to connect the network to renewable energy and do that in a verifiable way and then on top of that we're developing a whole tool stack in order to allow people to take a similar level of granularity and verifiability for the environmental impacts of other systems and you know really work to to make um all of web 3 and ultimately the entire economy beyond web 3 more verifiably sustainable than it is now beautiful well i just want to say as a developer myself i've used ipfs for many of the things that i've built in fact i think the first smart contract i ever built i put a json blob directly on chain and i had someone review the code like noted they'll do that put it on ipfs and and put a hash of that in there so major respect for ipfs as a project and i think it's really impressive that filecoin green exists and that you all are taking the initiative to uh make the network carbon neutral i'm actually looking at filecoin.energy which is a site that shows the stats of the file coin energy or network energy usage and i think that's a it's such an ambitious goal but it you know i'm just impressed because my the cynic is me just expects that projects are going to externalize the costs of the carbon that they're creating so what was it that that made you all go down the file coin green route you know why not externalize the cost of of the energy cost of the network is there a competitive advantage was it like a moral thing you know tell me about about how that came about right um i mean so so juan and i have been sort of jamming on environmental issues since i don't know 2008. so juan binet the the founder of protocol labs right yeah yeah exactly yeah so sustainability has always been something that that both he and i have cared about a lot um so uh you know i think i think juan always wanted filecoin to be a network that provides a positive externality whenever people use it so that was the entire concept behind filecoin and then ipfs as a lead-up to filecoin originally was okay bitcoin has a lot of has a lot of great things about it um but it creates these negative externalities that especially in 2014 when juan was initially thinking about this were were external right so bitcoin was not endogenizing the environmental costs of mining and electricity use into the network and so the question then becomes and the question that i think juan used to frame a lot of the the basic concept from filecoin from the very beginning was how can you create a crypto network that produces positive externalities or beneficial externalities when people use it beyond just its value as a currency and the the conclusion he came up with was that it should be possible to develop crypto primitives that allow you to provide tremendous amounts of data storage right as a result of mining on that network and so that was that was always the goal right and so with that framing i think it's not too much of a leap to say okay we're creating this one type of externality which is file storage or the you know the the fox storage network um what can we do to expand the scope of the externalities that we are measuring that the network is creating and then do what we can to take all of those externalities and drive them verifiably in a positive direction so i think i think that was you know that was sort of always the philosophy behind falcoin and then what we started to realize after um you know as the network was being developed and then we really started to think about this problem as the network was growing was that the design of filecoin lends itself very well to this type of analysis so uh when you store data on falcoin you don't store it on the network as a whole as sort of an emergent property you store it with an individual file coin storage fighter or a set of filecoin storage spiders for redundancy and so what that means is that you have a contract to store this data with this given sp story fighter and we can see storage photo by storage fighter like node by node exactly how much data they're onboarding onto the network and how much data they're storing over time what that means is that we have this ability to um in this really granular way right it's not it's not that you have all of these nodes and they're mining on the network and you only see them when they like win a block reward or you only see them when they make a transaction but we actually see all the activity of all of the all the active nodes all the time right or at least every day when they like publish these proofs and so that lends itself to this really sort of granular level of analysis that you were seeing that you're seeing on filecoin.energy which is the dashboard that we built with our energies model which allows us to then um you know take individual storage deals so like data that you're storing corresponding to some nft that you have say and map that to a set of storage fighters uh and assess what we can about where those storage fighters are located geographically and how much energy they're using and then go the next step which is allow them to buy renewable energy in order to cover their energy use right and so you're able to like make all those all those leaps right because of the design of of the falcon network where you can see the activity of every miner or every node you're able to go from data to storage fighter to energy use to renewable energy purchased not just in aggregate or in general but renewable energy purchased from a specific solar farm or a specific wind farm that's being used to store my data and so that's that's sort of the the level of transparency that we're aiming for and the level of granularity that we're aiming for and we really think that right the way we work with data across web3 really lends itself to that um because we have all these primitives allowing us to verify you know we're all part of this this massive set of distributed systems that we're just we've all we always have been we're just sort of aware of it now right and we have these primitives allowing us to um to to you know construct this uh this like granular verifiable view into the effects of our actions right not just the direct effects but the sort of extended effects and the externalities that you were talking about um and so we really think that you know when we're doing things in web 3 we should just be able to print a receipt at the end of the day saying this is what you did these were the environmental effects of what you did um here's how you could reduce them and here's what people did to mitigate them yeah it's really interesting because you expect blockchains to be this transparent immutable ledger that tracks financial transactions but then taking that from a leap to tracking any externality is is sort of i think a really powerful thing and you know my expectation was that filecoin from the outside a naive viewer might expect that filecoin's really good at tracking storage on ipfs and pinned on ipfs but the fact that you can generalize that externality of creating file storage into creating positive carbon impact and then track that is i think that that's a that's a leap in generalizability that's really exciting to me and so i guess you know you know if we take a broader perspective what can we do in web 3 with first sustainability that we can't with with web 2. what what further could be unlocked here yeah totally well and i think i think the i think the way you put that is really interesting right because you would expect foulcoin to do a good job tracking data storage but like data used to track data right so if you're if you're good at data you can use the data to track the data but if you're going to data you can also use the data to track the other things right and so it's like those those basic primitives right it's like it's it's you know you're talking about recursion uh we were talking uh a week ago right that's right the level at which you can take these systems and use them like turn them on themselves right yeah and it's like i think i think that's that's super super powerful right and we're sort of in working with distributed systems the way that we do in web 3 we have this phase change where we're like really able because of that recursion combined with verifiability right building verifiability into the basic primitives of the internet um right we're able to uh work with data to track whatever we want in a way that is like far more granular and verifiable than we could otherwise and so coming to your question right about what can we do in the sustainability space really with web3 tools that we can't do with web 2 tools um i think there's a huge opportunity to build build systems to track all sorts of environmental externalities in a way that is is far better and far more automatic than we can otherwise and so a way to think about this is that right now when a we get a lot of our sustainability data from corporate reports on things like emissions and those corporate reports are put together by auditors and these auditors have to go through all of the the financial records of a company they have to cross-reference um all these different data sets they have to check with that company's suppliers they have to do all of these different things manually that go into publishing this ultimate report of how um how much carbon emissions that company is responsible for right so as a result of the fact that all of this has to be done automatically these auditors take a long time to first build that model and then go through assurances and then publish that report and so you only have these reports published every year right and if you think about that um and you think about the economy as at least in part an information processing system where you know you mostly we process information through price signals but this there's this extra level of information that we're now trying to add on top of all these companies allowing us to see okay if company a makes widgets and those widgets have a certain carbon intensity and company b uses those widgets then that carbon intensity has to be factored into company b right so this like information about emissions is being passed from company to company throughout the supply chain and if every single company takes a year to do that then every time like price information gets passed quickly right but this extra layer of information that we're putting on top of the economy if every time a company reports that takes a year and then their customers uh don't get that data for months after that data is current right and then they take a year to report so every hop throughout the supply chain takes another year and you think about the velocity with which that information is traveling through the economy that's going to be very very slow and what that means is that if company a really far upstream changes something by the time it gets to company c or d or e or f um it's gonna be there's gonna be a lag of many years right and so if we trust the the climate scientists which we should because the ipcc has something like ten thousand scientists uh performing the the sort of best verified science that has ever been done in the history of human civilization um the ipcc is saying that we have eight years to decarbonize the global economy by 40 and so if we are processing the information that is central to doing that such that there is a time lag of one year when it goes when that information goes from company a to company b to company c every step in that value chain that's a problem right so we're just like fundamentally not working with a system that is going to enable us to pass information at the velocity needed in order to accomplish our goals and so what we can do with web3 right is make that automatic but you can only make that automatic because of the verifiability that you can get from doing things like content addressing your data making sure that data is self-sovereign so when someone changes something you actually know who changed it um making the pieces that can be publicly verifiable publicly verifiable things like what we're doing with 5. energy allowing you to go from on-chain proofs to energy use estimates and also connecting that with renewable energy certificates that are publicly available and i think zero knowledge has a huge part to play in building this whole system but we can't build that global carbon ledger unless we use web3 tools because the way they're doing it now they're just taking excel spreadsheets and they're sending them from person to person at a company and um that's the system we have now which takes a year to pass information from company a to company b and that's just fundamentally not gonna cut it when you think about the time scales we need right so it seems like it's a credibly neutral way to track the externalities positive or negative for carbon across the world that kind of disintermediates and is more eff efficient um and yeah i mean did is is that like a good summary of what you just said yeah and i think the i think the credible neutrality is really important and then i think also just at a fundamental information processing level we need to design a system that puts us in a regime where our goals are possible and the system as it is architected right now is just not in that regime yeah you know it's interesting because i think the layman view is that uh blockchains are bad for the climate because of proof of work but it's interesting to think about this credibly neutral ledger being secured with something like proof of stake which uses 99.95 percent less energy than proof-of-work and you know from there not only can you have almost a carbon-neutral based system but you could even create externalities that make it carbon negative from there so i think that those two insights together is what really gets me excited yeah totally i think that we need to take all of the large systems in the global economy and make them more efficient and so we should do what we can do to make web 3 systems less energy intensive but the main effect of web 3 on the climate crisis and the main job we have to do is providing tools that are going to allow us to do global carbon accounting in a fundamentally more efficient way right like that's that if you think about like the impact of web 3 on the planet um we need to reduce our direct impact but that secondary impact of allowing us to actually understand across the economy no matter where you are in a value chain what can i do to reduce my emissions and what can i do to report that in a way where all of my actions are verifiable um like that's that's our main that's going to be our main our main effect right okay so i mean oh man i i mean i i believe that web3 can be used for coordination and uh i believe that climate change is the largest coordination failure out there but it is quite a daunting task to think that decarbonizing the entire global economy by what did you say eight years from now uh that's quite a daunting task yeah so how do we do that yeah it's a good question i don't think any one person has all the answers right and i certainly don't i think we need to i mean everyone needs to do whatever they can right this is it's definitely an all hands on deck situation and a big piece of that is understanding how to make this type of reporting verifiable right i think a big piece of it is also building on top of that so once we're able you know so so falcon green as an example the first thing we did was we just built the models in order to allow you to go from proofs on the filecoin chain to energy use estimates and that's what first comes up when you go to filecoin.energy then after that once you have once you have the ability to understand what your impacts are you then develop the ability to connect that to renewable energy and so you know that's that's this this next piece where falcon storage fighters can purchase renewable energy and prove that by making the certificates publicly available and there's analogs to this in the in the carbon offset space and then the third level is then building the right incentive structures in order to scale that and in order to get people to actually use those tools in order to reduce their emissions right and we need to build that you know we're building that in falcoin right we need to build that in the rest of web3 and a lot of awesome people are working on that and then we need to build the best tools for both doing carbon accounting and building those incentive structures we need to build the best tools in the world for doing that in web 3 so that they can catalyze the global economy for people who are building you know larger incentive structures in order to see how can i actually do this better by using the tools that we developed to coordinate people better and part of that's going to be you know private private sector actors coming in part of that's going to be governments i don't really care who does it i just want it to be done and i want to build the tools that are going to allow whoever is going to do it to do it well so i mean building a carbon global carbon ledger is is that what we're sort of talking about here yeah yeah exactly okay yeah i mean i i think that you know as someone who's worked on smart contracts and and has played with these tools before i can definitely see why a global carbon ledger is necessary but i have a hard time thinking it's sufficient so we basically not only need to have carbon credits on chain that people can purchase but there has to be sufficient buy pressure that enough people are purchasing that carbon credit to make it neutral and then negative and so the hard thing i have a hard time figuring out is economically why you know if i'm an actor i i'm either going to have an incentive to externalize harm or it's just feels like my impact is so negligible that i just won't even bother to really think about it and so engineering that buy pressure for those those those assets on the carbon ledger is something i have a big question about i mean is it like basically governments that are going to be buying these carbon ledgers and using tax dollars to do it or is there another way to internalize what would normally be externalized by default yeah i think there's a list of hypotheses as to how we're gonna do it and we should push as hard as we can on every single one of those hypotheses right so going sort of micro to macro right you have individuals that are starting to care more and they can they can do some to reduce their impacts and the more that we can allow them to understand what those impacts are in like granular verifiable detail and also to prevent them from buying snake oil right i mean not prevent them but like allow them to see what they're actually buying and if you're you're buying some some offset or trying to do some mitigation like make sure it's really good right so so that's one level and then at the company level increasingly companies are responding to shareholder pressure in order to first just do reporting and then make those reports improve over time so like set goals of of you know being carbon neutral or being carbon negative and you know aiming to um to reduce their impacts and mitigate their impacts and have a positive effect on the planet um so that's another thing that could be done um clearly like state and local governments in my view do have a role and like they should do whatever is politically possible to keep the planet from burning because we're running out of time and then at the really large scale right you have things like the global carbon reward program which delton chen is working on if you read the book the ministry for the future the it's it's effectively so the it's by kim stanley robinson it's sort of a near-term sci-fi book about how um how crypto can help fix the climate crisis right so effectively they create this global carbon coin and it is backed by governments using monetary policy uh so central banks set a price floor under this coin and then anyone who can verifiably reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere can record that it goes into the global carbon ledger and that gets um and you know they get rewarded from that because there's this price floor um so that if you read the the if you do a close read of the ministry for the future that whole scheme is based on the chen paper which is dr chen is a real guy um he is working on doing precisely this and we should help him do that so that's that's sort of a spectrum right from like the really micro to the really macro and everyone should should try to help out the opera crypto

coinshift.xyz bankless yeah and i'm wondering you know we're starting to do a lot of research on decentralized identity uh in in my ecosystem and you know the whole idea is that if web 3 is a dark forest and you have this adversarial mindset because you can't see your counterparty web identity can be this light that shows you who your counterparty is and i'm wondering if and how identity fits in like basically there could be people who care so much about environmentalism that they will give better deals to people who offset their carbon emissions or are otherwise not externalizing harm and so you know i'm wondering uh as we go from this micro to macro scale how we can create that incentive for more people to not want to externalize carbon it feels like identity fits in there a little bit uh i don't know if you have anything to add with that yeah totally um and i i you know i love that image right of of identity as this light that you shine on on you know someone that you're you're interacting with in this dark forest um i think for me identity interacts with zero knowledge in a way that is really crucial for this global carbon ledger to work and the the issue there is that if you are a company or a project um maybe you are completely working out in the open and that's great and everything you do is publicly verifiable but we now have the ability right to build structures on this spectrum from completely open and completely deterministic and algorithmic all the way to sort of existing companies which are you know pretty closed and um different projects are going to want to give other people a different degree of visibility into their books right so like a traditional closed company is not going to want to show every single person it does business with it's full carbon accounting ledger right because often things like energy use are are very closely tied to their margins and they want to you know maintain their trade secrets they want to maintain secrets you know any sort of like business information that's this confidential and so with zero knowledge what we need to do and people are starting to build it and we're working on this too is build a system in which you can allow the company or project internally to to make this whole automatic model right how do my my carbon inputs um things like fuel things like electricity things like the carbon intensity of what i buy how do those map to outputs so the the products that i'm then letting my customers know um how carbon intensive they are and how can i make that model in a way that is really high quality and passes that information along in a way that's automatic right so we can move this data through through value chains in minutes not in months and then when i tell a customer what the carbon intensity of their products are how can i prove that what i'm telling them agrees with what i'm telling everyone else without actually showing them the entire contents of this model right and so in order to scale this um you know beyond what three but but even within what three right um because not everyone is going to want everyone else to know exactly what the details inside of their project are right which is which is fine right um we want to allow people to keep certain types of information private but we don't want people lying about what their carbon intensity is or like stashing it into fake offsets or something um so i think i think that's um so so if you if you imagine the the system that uses um that uses decentralized identity and you know some amount of of auditing but then zero knowledge at sort of the interfaces of a project like i think that's that's really where we have to go um to to make this this type of thing really in practice scalable mm-hmm yeah yeah i think that's a really good point is like the privacy aligned with the digital identity is is an important part of that but um just i think that there should be a social norm where you're not just looking at the immediate well then maybe you know maybe one could build a protocol where you're not just looking at the immediate attributes of your counterparty to to build a transaction with them like you know if i'm doing an under collateralized loan i want to know how often this party pays back their loans and that's a first order thing but how can we build a protocol in which i can say okay they're actually a good actor and they're not externalizing harm as like a secondary part of that identification protocol so i don't know i'm rabbit holding on this i don't need to take the conversation too far in an identity direction but it felt like it was sort of pertinent to to our conversation here yeah yeah totally and and that's i think that's that's really relevant right to a lot of the governance questions around like how do you actually build this in practice right and make sure it's really high quality and like higher quality than the existing system um another kind of version of that where identity i think becomes really important is say someone has an idea for really high quality carbon offsets and they want to match those with some customer who wants to offset their emissions right so the the customer wants to make a really high quality claim and then the the person selling offsets wants to make really high quality um uh you know wants to like have a really high quality product that is like recognized in the marketplace as such um so something you could do is is run um you know run something like a like a bidding process where a bunch of people apply to have their offsets be used to match to this claim and then you could have a public process in which um different offsets are like ranked on different attributes and then i think where identity comes into this is like okay you know that round of bidding finishes and you match these offsets to this claim everything's great um but then have those projects maintain an identity as they go on to the next round right so it's like maybe maybe you can see the history of like the development of this this process and maybe there was some weakness in like the verifiability of um of carbon sequestration in the first round and maybe that project fixed it in the next round right so it's like see this like persistent history of um the progress that's being made like technologically um in sequestering carbon and allow um allow those sorts of attributes to follow actors around so it's not just one claim one time it's how do we actually take the research process of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere or you know reducing carbon intensity of certain processes and how do we actually build a governance process around that so we're incentivizing it properly and allowing projects to follow sort of the funding funnel right going from smaller scale more research oriented applications or funding opportunities to ones in which they really scale and i think that type of coordination process in which we're not just tracking carbon and applying sort of a financial model to it but we're really playing an active role in the knowledge generation that goes into creating new types of solutions and shepherding them along i think has the potential to be really powerful yeah yeah i think that's beautiful and and i i really think that uh there's this perception that the internet of money and blockchains are just about finance which is only one of the eight forms of capital right there's spiritual capital social capital material living capital intellectual capital i'm forgetting the other two or three but you know creating a ledger that creates positive externalities on all of those vectors i think is is really very powerful at scale if if we can coordinate together right and and i think it goes back right to the that recursion right you can use data to manage data but you can use data to manage all sorts of other things if you can measure them um there's this planetary boundaries framework which i think a lot about which is these i believe nine different categories of variable that scientists can measure about the biosphere and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere you know it's one of those variables right so so they're all useful for assessing the sustainability of the planet for living creatures including human civilization one of the things that you can measure in order to figure out whether we are sustainable in the long term is co2 concentration and that's in this unstable zone but other variables that you can measure are things like extinction of species and and reduction in biodiversity and that is in in the red zone right like if climate change is in the yellow zone so like we're sort of verging on this being really unstable um biodiversity is is collapsing right at this like completely unsustainable rate um other things are are nitrogen and phosphorous flows which come largely from farming um those are also like variables that we can measure that are in the in the red zone and so i think that you know like you're saying right um to the extent that we can broaden our scope where a lot of these tools were initially developed to manage financial capital but something i think a lot about is how can we bring that degree of verifiability that we associate with something like an account balance and bring that to something like a attestation about your effect on one of these these planetary boundary variables right like how can we how can we really like take that same degree of verifiability and apply it to these sustainability questions and because we've already developed these tools and they work really really well in finance right we should be able to to expand to that scope and um work really hard right on building sort of as you point out like non-skew morphic tools that are going to allow us to manage natural resources in a way that is is far more robust and scalable than we've developed so far so okay so you know i i'm envisioning what this looks like at scale and and you know to me it seems like the tracking of externalities not only on the carbon vector but other living material vectors like biodiversity uh maybe there's other uh living sorry you said that there's multiple places where there's planetary boundaries that are being that are being violated or might be violated that need to be tracked so um an economy of impact certificates that sort of track the positive externalities and create markets that can bring those planetary boundaries back into balance and and you know like to me that's kind of what i'm hearing is that what it looks like at scale you know take me 10 years into the future say file coin green is maximally successful uh we're successful in building impact certificates for the world what does this look like in the year 2033 uh 2032 yeah i think what that looks like is not just within web 3 but in the economy as a whole we have really robust reporting processes that allow you to know no matter who you are at what position in the value chain what are my effects on all of these planetary boundaries right what are my effects on land use for doing this what are my effects on fresh water use what are my effects on you know biodiversity or phosphorus flows or something and allow you to see if i decide a versus decide b what are those effects going to be and then allow you to verify those effects at the end of the day and then that's part of it right is like those those those reporting those reporting pieces and then the next piece is connecting that to incentives so that we really have this scalable system where we're driving all of those variables um you know through impact certificates and sort of variations of impact certificates um driving all those variables into a more sustainable zone like the sustainable zones specifically like take all those variables and like there is a level set for each of them in the planetary boundaries framework drive them toward that that green sustainable zone and then the third piece of it i think is having that be integrated with ongoing systems to continue to research what those boundaries should look like and continue to research what those impacts are and continue to empower people who are closest to those impacts in order to have an outsized effect in making those decisions right so there's so so at the global scale right there's the carbon ledger is a good way to look at this there's the the incentive structures at the um you know corporate level or the the network level that allow you to to drive that below zero then there's the scientists right who are going to have to be incentivized in order to keep on trying to understand right last year we thought this planetary boundary was at this level actually we think it should be at this level right last year we thought that the amount of carbon sequestration in the soil due to uh performing this particular type of regenerative farming technique was this um now we have a better way of measuring it and we think it's this right or last year we thought that um this co-benefit right to this community in the amazon that's protecting this forest worked this way um actually like we're working with them and they're telling us it works this other way so we're gonna course correct and we're gonna um we're gonna set up these incentives to work better for people on the ground another thing i think about a lot is this book um uh this book called scene like a state by james c scott which is all about how when you take a system in a very centralized way and you um you imagine how that system should work and then you impose it on the real world you're always gonna miss things and um those things can can come back and really sort of doom your project so an example of that is scientific farming when it was initially introduced in germany in the late 19th century they knew certain things about forests um they knew the the land uh covered by a forest they knew the amount of timber that they could extract from this forest and they could walk around and see like what type of trees there were um but so they they built a system using only those variables right they said okay we're gonna manage this forest in order to provide the most timber and the most predictable supply of timber per uh acre as we can and so they said okay we're going to take this natural forest we're going to cut down that forest we're going to plant the type of tree that gives us the most timber in these like neatly ordered rows um and this monoculture is going to be super optimized right and so the first generation that worked really well the next generation the trees get kind of sick the third generation their timber yield was was super low right and so um that is what happens when you take you know you develop one model to rule them all and say this is how we're going to manage the system but you're not in touch with people on the ground you're not in touch with a scientific community they can continue to study that over time and improve your system you just like impose this version of the world on the world and you're going to miss some variables no matter what you do even if you try to do a really good job so the only way to build this in a way that's actually going to work is build continuous improvement into that whole system right which i think is a huge part of what we're aiming to do um you know if we're successful you know years down the line right it's going to be because we succeeded at building that government structure not just the incentive structure and not just the measurement structure yeah beautiful um i mean i think it feels like it all boils down to just building the coordination in which we can track these externalities in an incredibly neutral way and at scale and then bootstrapping the economies of more certificates being created and being consumed and people caring about it at the social layer and and then it just kind of snowballs from there and it makes me quite optimistic and i can't wait to see that snowball start to start to be built so um anything anything else to say about anything i didn't ask you about this vision that you that you want to say yeah i think another aspect to it and another sort of avenue right into why we need went through native tools in order to build the global carbon ledger and the global ledger for other planetary boundaries in a way that really that really scales and really works is that in the economy before web 3 we had fiat money and we had these different computational processes that are layered on top of fiat money right so i was talking about in in carbon ledger is the way they do them now they basically send a bunch of excel spreadsheets by email between all these different people involved right and ultimately [Music] fiat money is is pretty dumb right it knows how to like if you think of it as a as a computational substrate it knows how to add and it knows how to subtract and you can set up these mechanisms that do other things like like provide you yield but it's not it's not like a turing complete computational substrate that's going to allow you to model externalities right and so the result of that is you have to set up this other data layer on top of it in these excel sheets that allows you to try to like take transactions right and like maybe you set up the incentives right initially maybe you didn't but try to like do that accounting afterwards like after the fact right and by using computable money we can actually build that data layer into the transactions themselves right and so i think i think there's a huge amount of potential right in approaching all of this using the tools that we're used to um in web 3 where we can really build something that is a difference in kind from the sorts of computational structures where people were trying to use fiat money to like kind of you know build incentives but then because fiat money is a computationally insufficient substrate for modeling environmental externalities right you can't like you can't take um you can't take a forest and all of the all the like biodiversity benefits of a forest and like easily price them in a way that's visible to the market we can actually start to like build these systems in a way where the incentives can actually work and improve over time in a way that you fundamentally can't otherwise so the computer scientist to me finds that compelling that we need to turn complete substrate that can track all of the positive complexities of doing this but you know like what layer of abstraction is above that are we talking about local community currencies that track carbon like so the problem with the us dollar and with bitcoin is that it kind of takes everything and tries to put it in a us dollar shaped container and and if you have like a local currency system that's built around local values i'm using local both in the geographic sense but like in the value system sense that you you can kind of is there is are we talking about a local community currency for tracking carbon that has an exchange rate with us dollars and more global currencies but like what's the layer of abstraction on top of the the turing complete layer that that you think is is really powerful yeah i think we have to i think we have to try a bunch of things and see what works right and i think part of that is building those models directly into into different systems right and so things like some some projects like um like gain forest um or like the open forest protocol are doing in which and regen network in which you are actually taking data about the health of an ecosystem and tying that in in different ways for different projects to um either different nfts or different um you know like tokenized carbon offsets um or other instruments right and so that's that is a system in which you have an existing model and you send people out to measure and then the data that they collect becomes part of your transaction right then i think another another level that we need to think a lot about is say you do have a framework for a global carbon ledger how do you decide who decides and how do you and your credible neutrality is part of that and also bringing the right types of expertise to make the right decisions in is a big part of that right and so um part of it is part of the answer to your question is you actually build models that are better than models that we could build with just fiat currency so things like you send people out to measure trees or you use satellite images to make sure to find what the tree cover is and then the other piece is then how do you connect that to these governance systems that both tie break using properly designed incentive structures and expertise and are set up to allow continuous improvement over time as our state of knowledge of those systems improves got it so it seems like there's quite a diverse set of projects ideas that are sort of in this design space since creating a shelling point for them and supporting them as well as trying to lead them is is part of that and actually that's really a great segue into the the next thing i wanted to talk about with you which is you and i were just in paris for youth cc and for sustainable blockchain summit and one of the ways in which i feel a great kinship with with protocol labs and filecoin is that we're both kind of creating these social shelling points where people who care about positive externalities crypto being good for the world can come together meet each other figure out how to exchange capital and talent with each other and sort of build a movement of more green green crypto and so you know i i think that you were actually the executive director or the main host behind sustainable blockchain summit so not a question but just to thank you thank you for putting that together i think it was a it was a great uh great experience for me and it makes me a lot really hopeful about web3 in general do you have anything else to say about the social selling point that you created or sustainable blockchain summit i just had such a good time and i just want to make sure that we give you a lot of kudos for running that and i hope that you run another one yeah and we we're definitely plenty too yeah thank you for coming it was it was awesome and of course you know thank you for all the all the work you do right with bitcoin with um you know this podcast right in the book and and shelley appoint the conference and all of uh you know doing doing that that type of work right um yeah the sustainable blockchain summit was a blast um we got uh you know many of the the major projects in the space all together to talk about what's going well what needs to be improved uh really cool announcements coming out from a ton of great projects um we're planning to run it again in bogota um probably um so around devcon um and a date for that should be coming out soon as well as a speaker forum so we would love people who are working on projects in the space um or who are interested in the space to uh to home it should be a really great time that's great i think that get coin dao is planning on running a shelling point also in bogota so we should make sure that we don't double program each other but uh but yeah i think that that's great and looking forward to coming to another one of those in in bogota absolutely is there anything i didn't ask that you want to say i feel like you all are doing so much good stuff and i i don't know lead us what are you excited about um what i mean there's there's so many different directions that that all of this goes in right i'm i think what i'm most excited about is the growth of the refi community over the past year it feels like um it seems like i think a lot of us have been in crypto for a lot longer than that and have been sort of looking for these these shelling points um where we can organize around taking crypto which which you know like you like you talk about right um or like you you've mentioned in the past few minutes um i think a lot of the social perception around blockchains and around nfts and all this stuff is that it's it's you know it's bad for the environment for all sorts of different ways and i think there's been this this great sort of surge of people who are in this space and both want to reduce those environmental externalities um and also just use these amazing tools and primitives that we have to build systems that you just couldn't build in uh sort of the web 2 economy and um build ways of you know really regenerating the planet and scaling that right and i think like you know over it really does feel like over the past year um and sort of accelerating over the past six months um there's been this just like huge surge in people who are dedicated to that project and i'm really really excited about that i'm really thankful for that yeah yeah totally i mean it's it's beautiful to see this group of like-minded people sort of come together and talk about this vision of how web 3 can be good for the world and uh manage those positive externalities and you know i i almost think of it it makes me feel like web 3 is this way to program our values into our money but it just kind of started off in this cypherpunk sovereignty privacy orienting direction and i agree with those value sets too but there's a whole contingent that i think is just starting to to grow that's more solar punk and and cares about these things and uh it's it feels less lonely i'll say to have a lot to have hundreds of people coming to shelling point and and to be working on this stuff together so uh it's it's really beautiful and and and uh i think that it's just great that people are actually building projects in this space i can't wait to see who's going to be like the uniswap of this space and who's going to be the the urine finance of of this part of the space it just feels very uh abundant right now yeah 100 there's there's so much to do and there's so many amazing people uh that are just sort of piling into it right now i'm really you know i'm really excited about the next year and the next 10 years to really see where we can go yeah beautiful well uh where can people find you and and file coin green online yeah so we're um we're at falcon green on twitter um you can go to green.filecoin.io to learn about our our grant programs our events we have a meetup every month it's happening next tuesday um we have a million dollar grant round that's focused on d5 projects right now so please go to green.filecoin.io to check that out if you're interested in the next sustainable blockchain summit you can go to sps.tech i think that website is going to be updated pretty soon with details on the on the devcon sbs um and uh yeah we we you know announced most things through those channels there's a sign up uh there's a mailing list you can also sign up for on green.filecoin.io if you want more information and if you want to really join our community you can join the filecoin slack and go to the hashtag phil green channel um and we will see you there great beautiful well thanks so much for being on the pod thank you for your good work on file coin green file coin green green pill uh it feels like there's some really great stuff happening here and looking forward to building this movement with y'all me too thanks for having me on [Music] you
