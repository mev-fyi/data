we need to understand the systems of power that we are operating inside of in order to be able to essentially break out of them welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code quiz composed by people and each individual member of the crypto Community has their own story to tell the cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero I'm talking to Parker J Patrat who is a venture capitalist at fintech Collective and also a core member of the boys club and Parker and I resonated with it with each other when we found that what we're interested in in our backgrounds people think are actually like very far away from crypto my background in Psychology and hers in what is called critical theory uh we're talking about college majors here but actually there are things that are very directly related to what is vet at the basement level of crypto and so Parker and I had this hour-long conversation just unpacking what is critical theory and what are these things about like power structures in crypto and how crypto is changing the form factors of power structures and what a power structure really is and how things like Dows and social movements and nfts are allowing for new power structures to be expressed by still but still not by changing the rules of how power structures begin in the first place so I think you guys are really going to enjoy a conversation that is very close to the metal as to what we are doing here in the crypto space which is disrupting power and also creating new power structures hopefully ones that are fundamentally better and more expressive and are more aligned with the people that are inside of them so without further Ado we'll go ahead and get right into the conversation with Parker right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I have never been hacked scammed or lost money to a thief and

good good uh Parker what would you say that you do in crypto I am an early stage investor in both crypto startups and tokens and I also am on the founding team of boys club which is a social club Dao and Community focused on women in non-binary builders in web 3. and how would you say you got here great question um it's been a long and wild journey I would say um I grew up in a very activist family going to protests um super lucky to be super well traveled um and uh attended a school that was very liberal liberal arts school and took a major there called critical theory yeah and that is how you came to be here in the studio with me today yes indeed um so with within that major um we were really interrogating systems of power um most people in the major go on to work for a non-profit or start their own or do some kind of activism lawyering um but around my second year in uni I somehow stumbled across an article about the ethics of AI and that led me into this deep uh Tech Rabbit Hole I was like staying up every night researching reading about brain machine interfaces text space a lot of like bleeding edge Tech started working for a few startups worked for VC and I think one thing to note here would be most people that I was surrounded by at the time were actually very anti-tech um and anti-capitalism anti-entrepreneurship um and I actually started making a lot of connections between what I was studying in school and the opportunity that I saw this Tech present to create better systems in the world I knew about crypto for a while like I knew it existed I knew tokens were a thing um my light bulb moment really happened when I started looking deeper into blockchain technology and I had this moment of really realizing wow just like all of these other Innovations and inflection points that have come before it right like the internet AI the World Wide Web um all of that blockchain technology presents not only a tremendous opportunity to reimagine our financial system but also to reimagine how we coordinate how we exchange value how we mobilize how we express identity and privacy and yeah that that made me want to get involved okay so the the valence of what you were up to before crypto was uh liberal upbringing various like politically motivated uh but and then but also uh unlike your peers or cohort perhaps more uh Tech accepting or Tech Optimist than than the people that you surrounded yourself with and also I'm getting the the gist of somebody who uh is perhaps a little obsessive and futurist and a little sci-fi and also can connect things like things like Political Science and Tech and Ai and the current state of like Society this is kind of like the gist I've gotten uh from you from talking to you just now but also uh previously and this light a moment for you for me came when we were talking about your major critical theory maybe we should go down that rabbit hole first because I think that will help Define the rest of this this podcast what is critical theory I had never heard of this major before and and uh how did you just resonate with it so much that's a great question um so the major actually is only offered at the University I attended so it's like very Niche um and like I said before at its heart it's an interrogation of systems of power it's very interdisciplinary in the sense that it draws upon everything from philosophy to anthropology to political science so a lot of social sciences and it aims to combine different kinds of methodology with uh practice and practice and I'd say it's overarching aim is to explore interrogate and uncover systems of power that are widely taken for granted and challenge a lot of the normative assumptions in our society with the ultimate goal of um you know fostering students you can create social change and I actually think back to that time right and think back to um you know like I would say I I am at my heart and core like a a sort of activist person like I'm very opinionated um I have very high conviction about things I believe in um and I think the connection between that and also um you know being excited about the future right and being excited about the opportunities and sort of thinking about okay where is the world going next and also like how do we want to shape it um and I think that um you know really uh really led me into the path of what I'm doing now both in the boys club and with fintech Collective My fund so the study of systems of power is an interesting phrase because it's not uh totally like descript like it's very broad like yes the study of the systems of power uh and you I mean you said it was multi-disciplinary of course and it must be but maybe we could unpack that a little bit more like what is a system of power and what does it mean to like study these things I think power is very multifaceted there's so many different kinds of Power some are visible and explicit some are invisible um and I think there's a wide range right like I I would argue that um Power exists in any situation um but I think in any context in any context it exists in this conversation it exists in our society it exists in the way we're going about our day-to-day lives um so it just has a small microcosm I'm the one managing these cameras right now and that is a form of power that I have in this particular context and so that that's what you're saying at a very small scale is perhaps what power is look now we're looking at you um but then we could also like what you're saying is it exists in many many contexts so you know the president of the United States also has power and so like critical theory is power at all scales is kind of the idea I would say that's so that's the idea like that's that's the framework that it's operating in and focused on right so everything from like Sovereign power to individual power to soft power Social Power right Social Capital um all these things are related and I think uh the goal with critical theory is to make or to attempt to make um invisible or assumptive forms of power um more explicit we need to understand the systems of power that we are operating inside of in order to be able to essentially break out of them right which is what I think crypto comes in one of my favorite episodes that we've done on Bank lists was with Joel minegro from placeholder it was called uh I think governance and power and we were talking about like why do these governance tokens have value we were trying to answer that question what's the association with governance and and and price on the secondary market and he really like destroyed my previous intuition as to what capital was like Capital it's like the money that you have in your bank and also the net worth of your combined portfolio that's what capital is and he was like yes but also incomplete there's also Social Capital right like how much how much how many favors do you have stored in the bank with your friends like how how much can you like move the needle of something and I think perhaps what you're talking about with with critical theory is like okay if we can figure out how to identify all forms of capital not just Financial Capital not just Social Capital political Capital whatever you want and whatever you want it to be that starts to look something like critical theory is that where is that a good definition I think that's pretty accurate in terms of really getting at this idea of like capital is so much more than um that is what's obvious um I do think like the sort of ideologies that critical theory comes from does come with some political uh motivations at least in the major that I was in in the environment that that I was in but I think like one really interesting learning right like some some people come to me and they're like how did you start there and get here and do what you're doing now and I'm like I actually see um you know a kind of a straight line through right like um I grew up in a family where um challenging Authority was encouraged which I'm really grateful for and where there was a lot of value placed on not just oh what is the answer to the question but what kinds of questions should we be asking right like the key is not an answer but in the question itself um and so I think like um within critical theory I took a lot of um what I what I learned and the way that I learned to approach uh the world from a framework perspective um and you know after sort of um exposing myself to many different kinds of people and beliefs that strayed far from my own at the time I was able to really see like Okay um you know there's there's a lot of values um in crypto that I think transcend um like politics I think if if uh we're talking about critical theory which again I'm still learning what this thing is we do have to have like a historical perspective as well uh because we can't just understand systems of power without seeing how they've like changed and adapted uh and again you've already said that how this is like a very multi-disciplinary thing I would imagine history is one of these things that you must study to understand like critical theory um how how do you see crypto as like a continuation of this whole thing of of systems of power like you you said like uh critical theory and crypto is a direct correlation it's not like a long Meandering Road it's actually a direct first critical theory now crypto what what do you see is so direct about this crypto is obviously super new and exciting and it's full of people who are mobilized around um or United around um not accepting right the system that we're currently in and and being able to imagine a different better one right and so I think like these modes of of not just accepting kind of what we're told is right or what we're told is the normal thing to do um and trying to imagine like a system outside of that is really where I see that a connection although I do see um within crypto definitely you know I'd say the crypto Community departs a lot from some of those those ideological roots of critical theory which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing I actually really like um the the diversity of thought that I've seen within the space so far would you would you say that critical theory doesn't have diversity of thought or is that a is that an invalid question um that's a loaded question to ask um I think within my major there is no diversity of thought it was very very uh liberal and um woke um and I definitely still like hold some of the beliefs that I did at the time but like I said before like I really took the initiative once I started learning about all these other things like I was never exposed to Growing Up or in my school right like Tech or Finance or any of that so I really just like it was a totally new world for me um and once I started exploring that I I started challenging my own assumptions because I was like wow everyone else around me has been saying like Tech is bad capitalism is bad like all this stuff is bad so we shouldn't engage but I was like no this this is awesome like I was like you know when you have a crush and you have like butterflies and like they're all you can think about that's literally how I felt like every single night like staying up every night still like my notes and my notebooks like just learning a bunch of stuff um but anyways like going through that I I also started you know realizing like okay what things was I sort of taught or not largest topic expected to believe within this major and within this institution school like how much of that actually resonates with me right and so um I mean we talked a bit uh a few weeks ago about thinking for yourself right um and I think for me at the moment like I once again like you were in a very polarized system and there are some of my beliefs that would fall um far on one side and some that would fall far on the other and I'm comfortable with that and I actually think it's a really good thing that you know to be able to um not just like Loop all of your beliefs or positions on certain issues into one um bucket right and to actually try to like discover for yourself like what do I believe and um one one sort of moment in that Journey has been um surrounding myself with people across the Spectrum like I'm friends with many different kinds of people who would fall on both Extremes in the middle and I think we're like kind of losing that as a norm in our society right now one of the interesting things to me about crypto is that um everyone who understands crypto there's like a secret handshake that people have like oh you're a crypto person I'm also a crypto person and like you get to in the same way that like religion played this role way back when where like if you I don't know I'm I'm guessing a world that I never lived in 1500s Europe uh where like maybe you lived in Spain but then you traveled across to like what is Germany again these countries didn't exist that back then but you get the point but if you're under the same Banner of the same religion you can shake hands with that person like yeah we're on the same page here yes and that's what it's like to be a crypto person it's like oh yeah you're you also uh are crypto like we we know the same stories like haha Michael Saylor like we have the same like cultural memes and all of a sudden there's like a connection here about like what values that we have because they're largely going to be similar but then they can also diverge like okay you're a crypto person sweet like Federal Reserve money printing yeah but also wait what kind of crypto person are you I like are you still on a crypto person or are you an ft crypto person you're ethereum crypto person you're a bitcoiner and so like there's this one part about crypto where people have broken out of old society and all if you're a crypto person you have all gone on the same Journey as all these other crypto people which you've broken out of like what is kind of like Plato's Cave of society it's like we're no longer in the cave we're kind of woke to the way the machinations of the world works because we're crypto people and then you enter crypto and then like there's a new set of like societies to go into like you have the ethereum societies the Solana societies the Bitcoin societies and so uh it's always been interesting to me that crypto offers like a new like slate of understanding like a new scaffolding for people to like map on new understanding too and then and then like pick a different route and so like where a lot of people previously might have identified as like a democrat or a republican liberal conservative you get into crypto and people tend to lose a little bit of those older identities and then they pick up new ones how would you say that this relates to critical theory or does it at all um great question I'd love to take it in a little bit of a different direction though because you actually just touched on this massive thesis that I have at the moment um so I've been doing a lot of like Research into uh political polarization like studies show Pew uh Pew Journal has a lot of great studies on this that I think deserve a lot more attention um like if you look at the charts it's kind of insane like over the last 10 years political polarization has skyrocketed now more people than ever before say they wouldn't be in a relationship or even want to be friends with someone who has a different political sort of identity as them at the same time over the past 10 years we're seeing religious affiliation and extreme Decline and just like you said right like religion and the church is where people used to go to find their Community to find their value system to find a shared ideology and assured identity that they like passed along to their children right um now people are losing that they don't have that anymore and I think they're turning to um political parties to find that and don't get me wrong I think it's a really good healthy and positive thing to be politically active and to care about these issues and pay attention to them um where I think you know things uh might go a little wrong is like when you you when when your energy party system and America's um you know one of the only countries that does this it's not working great um is those two systems can only work in all position to one another um and so I think the question then is like how do you solve the issues that you're trying to solve if the way you're trying to solve them is always by relying on this othering um and like just to unpack that a little bit more what you're saying is that there are like a larger and larger part of our political system in America is that I'm a Democrat because I need the Republicans to fail and or vice versa like I'll be a republican because like the Democrats can't win and it's not necessarily like you pick a tribe because of what you believe in it's that it's what you don't believe in and so like exactly can a community exist simply as like being an antithesis to another Community does it doesn't seem like a very strong foundation for communities to exist upon it seems like a negative flywheel effect yeah exactly and what are the consequences of this why is this bad well I think I think it prohibits progress it sort of sets up the landscape where there's only two buckets right like if I'm um a Democrat I believe XYZ about these certain issues if I'm a republican I believe XYZ about the same issues like it buckets all of your belief systems and like all of your beliefs into one category but like if you look on an individual level like humans are so complex right and they also change over time and um I think there should be more room for that like how could we how can we progress as a society if we're not um tolerant of or open to being challenged and changing our beliefs and you know we're all bringing in a very like binary fixed system I would say but I think there should be more room for flexibility and discussion um more diversity of thought yeah more diversity of thought exactly do you see crypto offering like a platform to solve some of this stuff like how do you see crypto fixing this great question I don't know if crypto fixes it um I think that's a pretty broad statement to make but I will say um like I said before like crypto definitely crypto is definitely political in certain ways right like I definitely think it attracts libertarian-minded people um but I think it's it's emphasis at least in my experience has been on values right of like transparency um social mobilization um like open and open Financial system um and all of those things allow us to maybe build different political communities within that but by like sharing this already like shared set of values we're able to accomplish so much more um but I do think we're at an interesting time in crypto where we're seeing more divisiveness within the community as well you mean more more tribalism I think this is very illuminated after the tornado situation of where do where does regulation come into play um there are people who are strong Believers of Regulation crypto and you know might say this is the only way we can truly realize crypta's full vision by um having the right kind of Regulation to onboard everyone including Enterprise institutions and another of that might argue no like the the full vision of crypto being realized means that there's no regulation so at least in my in the sort of communities and spheres I'm in that's more of the um divisiveness I've seen um which I think is interesting yeah so that that debate is one part like there are some ethereum developers who are who will like refuse to work on a client that supports censorship at the base layer right which is kind of where this tornado cache conversation has really gone um because that's where the like The Logical conclusion is right if we want to like have these things be like regulatory friendly we kind of need to bake in certain rules at the base layer but that just turns off basically every one of the developers that came here in the for the you know in the first place right and then there's newer parts of crypto that are like well if we want like ethereum and Bitcoin to scale out to the whole entire world we're gonna have to play nice with the previous power structures that exist uh we need to like interoperate with old rules rather than like conflict with them and so I think maybe what you're saying is that there's like this these uh a divide growing in the crypto space where like some people are like we should sacrifice something to get adoption and then there's like the hard line of Libertarians or like we'll sacrifice nothing uh and we'll just have whatever we have at the at the end of this and this seems to be like a deeper deeper issue than just like I'm a Solana person I'm an ethereum person I'm a Bitcoin person this is getting down to like the very basement level of crypto I agree I think it's way deeper than just you know um kind of like what sector of crypto are you into or supporting but um it is like a very fundamental question that quite directly affects the future of the space um and I think a big question becomes like you know what this is really calling into question is like what are the fundamental values of crypto and of the people engaging in this system right like what does it mean for to realize crypto's full potential is it onboarding everyone and sort of being flexible about the framework or approach or Foreman which it takes or is it like sticking true to what I would say is the initial Vision um and yeah like being hard about that and like refusing to engage in anything else I think that question what are our values is probably a question that's relevant to any system of power that throughout time and and so it's always like as long as there's a community there's probably always this question do you have any thoughts about to like how that question particular has permeated throughout all systems of power and throughout history or what yeah I mean what comes up for me there and I'm literally just like riffing her about what comes up for me there is like not just what are our values but like how are our values expressed and like what does it mean within the in-group to comply to those values um right so like we could say like like this thing is the value um but I think more and more we've gotten into these sort of prescriptive modes of thinking of like if you're not doing this thing if you're not doing that thing it means that you don't agree or sort of like comply almost to this value you're not in a tribe right so like I think I think maybe a more complex question than just like what are our values is like how does the socially acceptable way to engage within a value system or to show support of a value like change over time um and I think it obviously changes a lot depending on the context um like we've seen it change a lot in the past five to ten years right like with the rise of like Instagram infographics I would say like um I've been thinking a lot about actually like Instagram and infographics and I think there's like a social pressure to post them when you know there's one issue to the next right but um there's a lot of like you know I wonder if someone's like when people are postings and for graphics on their story is it more for like a signaling effect or more difficult Instagram infographic is yes yes an Instagram infographic I would say it's like a really pretty nice like graphic design canva like poster um explaining facts about an issue or like stating an assertion or position on an issue and explaining why the viewer should believe in it um so it's like narrative work propaganda work propaganda not in a negative sense yes yeah like quite literally yes okay yeah okay um and like it's so like I'll see people like posting an infographic and I used to be an infographic poster myself I will say um but I'm like okay like you know that's great and all but is that more to feel like oh I'm doing the right thing or like oh I want other people to see me supporting this issue or being on this side especially in the climate that we're in versus like do you actually like care are you actually like deeply thinking about these issues and like talking about them within your day-to-day life are you virtue signaling or do you actually believe what you're posting exactly yeah yeah I think it's gotten way easier way more easy to Virtue signal than ever and also to not even realize you're doing it um yeah I think that that brings up the question of like as going back to like uh you know critical theory and and organizations of people throughout time that create systems of power how these people how these communities spread information and and Define and this is why I asked that question like what are our values how do like it's great when a community can ask ourselves those questions and I think crypto in its very beginning stages actually has like the privilege of not being so large that only a few people have to ask that question for that kind of to become the conversation at the time yeah like during this tornado cache um uh era it was Eric wall that put out that post on that that poll on Twitter saying hey ethereum Community would you ever support censorship at the base layer and that one tweet was like this one opportunity for this whole entire ethereum Community to Rally behind and say no we'll never support it never ever ever and that was like a unique opportunity that we have as a crypto Community it's like we have crypto Twitter we also have this one tweet to focus on where we got to Define our values in that one particular moment but I would imagine throughout history there's been like less more loose ways less concrete ways less specific ways for communities to actually figure out what they value and now we're like in going to the political Spectrum we have like the Democratic and Republican like National parties which kind of like Define the values a little bit they are they just they decide who's on the team and who's not uh and so that's like a system of power that's largely out of the hands of people uh but overall like there's also like so many other different like organizations throughout history like every single Revolution ever how did they Define like what they cared about and why were they revolting in the first place and who was able to like lead that conversation have you ever how do you think about this as it relates to the crypto space like dissemination and acceptance of like narrative well there's also like we know there's Twitter Bots out there trying to pump bags and so like that's out there like an influence like how do you think about this in the crypto space well bot networks are on the rise yeah um but yeah I think it's it's interesting I mean one thing I'll say is like you said a little earlier that the sort of Democratic and Republican party are sort of setting different values right and dividing them um I think like from a very high level external point of view that's true but one interesting thing that I've been noticing recently in developing all these friendships with many different kinds of people in many different political beliefs like we actually share the same values like we share the same values of honesty and authenticity and being a good friend and family building um and transparency but the way that we think is the best to go about the way of like realizing and achieving those values in our Day-Day lives in society might actually be really different um which is the same but the executions the different the debate yes like I actually met someone at um where was it like December or somewhere recently at a conference and we were talking like really vibing and we were talking about like taxes and how we think that should go and we were like super aligned and I was thinking you're like oh it's probably this person's probably like super aligned with where I see myself or feel myself sit at the moment on the political Spectrum turns out opposite and once that was uncovered like they had a totally different attitude towards me like and that really like took me back and I was like Hey like don't you think this is kind of funny though like I I think it's cool like we have the same values we just think we should go about them or maybe construct the framework around them in different ways um and I think like that defensiveness is natural and like I would I definitely used to be like that like very much um but I actually think like there's a lot of alpha in finding people with the same values as you that have really different beliefs on the outside um or beliefs of ways to go about realizing them and like talking more about that and So within crypto that's like one thing that I see as an opportunity is like rather than um starting with like more of an external perception of like you know political motivations or parties we're starting with the values um and then there's like different kind of factions that and and I think you see this also like within crypto like it's really interesting because across the different you see it in really different ways like Dao people like very like hippie kind of like communism Vibes like yeah in like the most like affectionate way possible because obviously like then like there's other parts that are like very libertarian very like you know no government interference um but like we're all United by the same values as so I'd say at least like for the most fundamental ones so I think it's really interesting and I think it's like a great opportunity to sort of rethink the way that we talk about these things and think about these things and like identify ourselves with these things it definitely has been one of my most interesting experiences moving to New York is like in Manhattan you have like the trading firms and you have all the Traders out there in Manhattan yeah and then here in Williamsburg there's like a lot of Dow people which are like like The Burning Man types right yeah yeah and then there's like there's also the D5 people in SoHo uh with like open sea and uniswap and dydx and then you got like the nft people out wherever they exist Times Square yeah sure yeah in Times Square yeah and like but then also like LA's got a bunch of like nft people and like you're right These Fine these people all all kind of have a particular Vibe about them yeah like they're all they all find each other right um and but then also like you were saying we were talking about how like um there's the same the same fundamental philosophy same belief structures but then different ways to like go about that and that's that's been my like my biggest uh ideas to like the difference between Bitcoin and ethereum we have the same values even though the bitcoiners will never admit it about ethereum people we believe in the same things we just one one group of people says yes and Bitcoin is how you express this and then the ethereum people's like no ethereum is how you express this but it all collapses down to like the same values at the end of the day which is kind of like what I was going back to earlier like previously before crypto people had like these alignments like liberal Conservative Republican Democrat and then you go through like this filter of crypto and if if you can make it through the other side of crypto you kind of lose your old identities and then you like latch on to new ones like instead of Republican Democrats we need to do like a study on this we need to do like a quantitative study on like what well I think it could be I mean well here's the thing is like it would not be super accurate because self-reporting and self-surveys are not accurate but for a starting point we could do like um sort of how how did you or how you know before you got into crypto what would you say is your primary political Association and like after where would you fall on the scale I think that'd be super interesting did your political affiliation like change or political demeanor change but when you after going through the filter of crypto it did but I don't even know if it was just crypto honestly like I I made it a really big initiative in my life to really do everything I could to make my own opinions on things so like for like every morning for example like I read um far-right news sources I read far left news sources I read like what I would try to find or say are like the most moderate news sources so I try to read like about the same stories and the same events that are happening through many different lenses because everything is biased these days right like and um and again like this is something I really like realize and noticed too after like leaving the the kind of like liberal arts bubble I was in which by the way like I don't know how familiar you are with that scene but if if your belief art school yeah okay yeah so like I don't know at the time though for you like it might have been different because like I'm younger than you but like in my experience it was like if you don't believe these things you were literally ostracized from the community like ostracized cancer culture oh like cancel culture was the culture oh no like yeah no seriously um and when you're surrounded by that for so long like it just you know it's group think and so yeah I don't want to be in that even in crypto like there's group thing in crypto so I just think it's like important to expose yourself to many like diverse information diet healthiest diet out there yeah um super important and like that's also for me how I found like new interests as well arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social daps like Reddit

without all the Clutter you can download the browser at brave.com banklist and click the wall icon to get started one of the uh things that I've been thinking about lately then well while I was writing out the notes for this show I had an inspiration for tweet and I tweeted out smart contracts democratize the ability democratize access to writing the rules and this is something this is an idea that like Ray dalio put into my head a while ago where he was like yeah like different Empires come and go and sometimes Empires clash and when they clash it's really just a fight over who's going to write the rules like so when one Empire wins they subjugate the loser Empire to their rules uh it's like we it's our laws that are Canon not yours and if like they don't agree on laws then they have like war and it's usually an economic war and this is what I see kind of happening with like Republicans and Democrats it's like all right we have the Republican party and then the Democrat Party and these are just like trading blows as to who gets to write the rules for the next four years and we're going into crypto and we we have the ability for people to like you know write smart contracts these are like you can democratize access to writing the rules we also have like now we have Dows we have nft projects we have defy apps and all we have communities that around these things and so like now each one of these communities kind of gets to write the rules now it's not at the same scale of an Empire or a nation-state but it's still pushing the ability to create power structures like create rules to the hands of the communities and so when we talk about like this idea of like changing power structures and changing like uh changing like orientations of people's alignments whether it's like a political alignment or just like an ideology alignment how do you think that this changes the way that Society will work when like all of a sudden we have many many many more cultures that are outside of just like the political spectrum and now inside of crypto communities and they all get to write rules like what do you think are the consequences of this well dude I think it's I think it's so exciting crypto economies are introducing like fundamentally novel and innovative ways of doing governance and human life that we have never seen before and the design space is so open it's it's crazy and I think few few realize this like like crypto economies like we have now Dynamic voting in almost real time we have um voting systems and governance mechanisms that are completely unconventional um to how traditional corporations and institutions work and like I said before like the design space is so open like I think recently in recent months we've seen a lot of criticism of doubts and doubt governance and at least on my timeline like I've been seeing a lot of tweets on you know Dallas as a business model never gonna work like this is never gonna work all these like doubts are failing um and I'm like okay but what's the common the red for the Dows that are failing it's I would say most of them are using token based voting governance right um I am so excited about the design space that exists to create more Dynamic forms of governance mechanisms like I think um humans are humans are Dynamic humans are complex like our beliefs as you've been talking about in this conversation are belief systems change over time we get new information um to contextualize right and I think number 1 fixed voting and like in a snapshot period of time I don't think it's the most optimal way to go about voting like I'm really excited about um this sort of Novel governance mechanism called conviction voting where basically you like stake your vote and every day or whatever time metric you can set ideally um it gains more power and then you can retract it rather than like I vote today and in two years maybe I wish I hadn't done that but there's nothing I can do to change it but I also think like we shouldn't be um we shouldn't be putting decision making power or privileging decision-making power um for people that just have the financial means to do so and like when you do that you get like a very I would say over time like a very corrupt system where um there's this sort of uh tragedy of the commons where like people like the general population of Voters within the system knows that their their vote won't really make a difference so they get voting fatigue they don't participate and then you have like one two three maybe four major actors controlling everything um often times in a way that is not reflective of what the general majority wants um so I think there's like an urgent call to action here to uh put a lot more research documentation and experimentation into our Dao governance mechanisms like I think yes we are seeing Dao's fail and that is such a good thing how could we ever progress if we don't have that point and like what can we learn from this and what are the patterns we were talking about the Z4 we were talking about investing and like how we're um huge like pattern identification people pattern recognition yeah pattern recognized doors um but same thing we should be doing that now we should be applying that now we should like have more initiatives for um like peer-reviewed research journals to study these different Dows and their governance and voting mechanisms as case studies and come out with reports and there actually is a lot of this if you look on like jstor um there's so many good peer-reviewed journals on Dow governance and protocol yes I'll send you some after this like with my annotations there's there's so many good ones and they have realized crazy things like I will read these I go back to like the boy scout team like guys we I'm like so fired up and I'm just like no one like that's what I'm I sound crazy but um animated it sounds energetic yeah yeah it's so exciting like um for example I think I may have told you about this study but um there was a uh there was a study that basically used all of these decentralized um in-person resistance movements over time right to like Occupy Wall Street was one um the Zapatas movement was one and they basically like studied you know what made these uh communities and organizations um disseminate over time like what led to their ultimate unsustainability why'd they fail right why did they fail and like um one thing that they found was uh in The Proposal process like when there when someone made a proposal it was rejected and there was no follow-up people didn't feel heard and so they ended up like leaving the organization right they didn't get feedback or an explanation on why and like this is something that like in the sort of like code is law like protocol is law I guess like mindset are ideology G I think we really fail to recognize right like I and I think we also fail to underestimate the um the salience of governance that it is done off chain um in a in a more like concealed way like private calls personal relationships um soft power right like all that does affect the way people vote in government only some governance is actually done on chain yeah yeah and like it's like that Iceberg meme where like the on-chain governance is just like the tip of the iceberg it's just the part that's expressed totally and like last night we were talking late and then like we were talking about delegation and delegating tokens and like I like I said I'm I'm for delegated governance but I also think like how do you account for these very um significant variables within that right like someone literally just being more socially popular right and like wanting to appease to them like that is human nature and um without Anonymous voting like I think we we do see a lot of that today um but yeah I think there's like I'm excited I think there's a lot of design space that we still have left to conquer I think it's I super resonate with the idea that so many decentralized movements fail or dwindle or just dissolve because a lot of their energy of their community members dissipates when their community members try and exhibit some change express some change upon the movement that change doesn't work and they don't know why or they don't know how it didn't work or they don't know they don't really have any next steps or like they don't have any lessons to be learned they don't feel heard and there's like this part of the human brain The Human Condition is like people kind of just want to be heard like they want they want their existence acknowledged right we all have goals when when things get in the way of our goals that gives us negative emotions and and we if we want to align with something and be a part of something we need positive emotions we're gonna we're gonna move away from the things that make us feel bad we're gonna go to the things that make us feel positive and if we are have these goals that we want to express onto these political movements which people generally like really feel strongly about but we don't feel heard we're gonna go do something else uh and so the when when you tell me that the decentralized movements fail because people can't I feel heard my mind goes back to this like uh idea that we were talking about earlier of different forms of capital there's Financial Capital which is token votes which we kind of know are like you know new and not complete yeah there's like Social Capital which what we're talking about it will kind of popularity contests well you know sometimes that popularity context is vitalik buterin and his really good idea about how something should work on ethereum and maybe we should listen to that sometimes it's actually just like a you know malicious I could go both ways but I think what I'm hearing you're saying is that there are these Dows that are trying to figure out different ways of enabling their community members to express what they want to see changed in their Dao that doesn't necessarily restrict down to how many tokens do you have or like how popular is your profile picture handle inside of Discord how can we enable these community members to express themselves without that being like gameable or attackable or like fall apart because like a poor mechanism design and this seems to be also like kind of close to the medal of what critical theory is if I'm if I'm trying I'm still trying to learn what that is uh are we all yeah yeah maybe that's kind of the point uh what are your thoughts on that whole uh ramble yeah well that definitely resonates I think humans just want to see and be seen um that may or may not be what it means to like love someone um if we want to go that deep but I think like I'm happy to because I wrote a little bit about that oh you did yeah oh my God tell me more yeah so the idea was that um all of these new Dows I think this was in the middle of a nft summer um uh but also also Dell summer is that like all of these dolls now compete for our love where like uh the the centralized fixed concrete algorithms of Twitter Facebook Instagram are like trying to compete to make us angry because that's the one algorithm it's like it's the rage algorithm um dowels now and like all of these social organizations on ethereum which there are many nft projects Dows sometimes sometimes even defy apps they're now trying to compete for your love uh and so uh it's like the it's these protocols that enable their community members the most are the ones that are going to find the most alignment and are going to find the people that not sell their token and show up in that Discord because that Community feels the most loved and this also I think fits into the meta around like gone other days of Bitcoin as the static asset and crypto Punk says the static nfts all future nfts are likely going to be productive as in they're going to have a team or organization that like makes that nft useful and what is that what does useful even mean if not just like making that owner feel special and warm and fuzzy and like alignment and having loyalty with their assets yeah and if if owning these assets opens particular doors in Dallas whether that's governance changes or just like perks uh whatever so long as like the Community member feels heard in a community that they share values in that Community should do well yeah that's kind of where I was going with that that really resonates and I think um like nfts aside I think we we can see this a lot um with web 2 examples of when people are starting communities and dogs I'm like it's really really important to be as specific as possible um and like don't be afraid to be Niche like what are the strongest subreddits like the weirdest stuff that you've ever seen that is like so Niche and weird right like those are the strongest communities because they're really United around something specific and they they know why they're there and they really feel shared whether it's a value system or interest or whatever common problem when you're starting a community like a lot of community um communities that I see like starting up like they're like okay how do we like appeal to this group this I'm like no just focus on one thing that's how you're really going to attract intrinsically motivated participants like you're saying um if you're very intentional about who the skinny is for and like who it's for not who it's not for and then like from there like you're saying I think there's this huge component as well of like a giving um giving community members the resources that they need to understand how to uh how to interact with the community and like what opportunities exist right so um you know where do I go for this for this question or um you know what are what are ways I can meet others in the community whatever it is um but really like context setting I mean about this but um it's really important to set contacts so people feel a sense of familiarity and feel equipped with like the knowledge they need to thrive in the community and then from there I think like this also circles back to an earlier point in our conversation about um creating an environment for a diversity of thought and opinion um and I think sometimes that just means like opening really opening the conversation up and and being willing to engage with others that have different beliefs than you and like I sort of talked to you a bit about this before um but you know I think within Boys Club um and I'll speak like from my own personal perspective as Parker like I think we've been very intentional about creating a space um where our our values are clear um like our mission is that our Vibe is clear um but we're also not telling people what to think or what to believe right and we're saying here's what we here's the kind of culture um that we want to see in crypto13 and that we want to drive like join us right and then those who resonate with that can join but I think we we've been really intentional about um and even with you know some external pressure like not putting a statement out for example that we're not sure resonates with all of our members um just because like people from the outside might assume it does yeah sure sure um one of the same like thoughts that I can't that came out of that that same like D5 summer nft Summers that uh and this came after uh blouse platform Royal where you had this tokenized music uh platform and the idea of like a tokenized piece of art and but this also works with the Dow Community too where uh the crowd the token owning crowd now also has a voice uh and so like say you you have the performer right the value Creator and this could be Blau the DJ this could also be like the boys club uh core team whoever's like there's always like two sides of an organization right like there is no such thing as an artist without the consumers right and so there's always been like a two-way conversation between artists and their fans uh and you know the artist will do something that the fans like and then the Crowd Goes Wild right but now we have tokens and so like now when the artist says something that the crowd likes the token goes up in price or the token just becomes more useful or something and it gives like a back and forth conversation when there's a way for this community to express themselves back to the leadership or and sometimes that leadership is just like the Dow governance which is themselves they are their own leadership but when the community has a voice there can be kind of this two-way narrative this two-way conversation as to like okay what do we want this to become whether like whether it's Blau the DJ saying like all right what kind of music do you guys want and like that the community can actually like be given the driver's seat a little bit Yeah and again going back to like smart contracts actually give communities the power to write the rules and we have tokens allow the community the communities to have voice and control and influence and all of a sudden like writing the rules is something and again tokens and maybe we're still stuck in the age of like snapshot token votes but like we're trying to get out of that out of the Dark Ages maybe that's what we'll call it when we look back on it but all of a sudden like the communities are able to like kind of write the laws and and express themselves and their values to each other and and themselves yeah and all of a sudden we get to like it feels like we get to steer something that we weren't able to steer before totally how do you think about this okay so I'll relate this back to actually a course I took um within the critical theory major which is called resistance movements in the law we basically studied a bunch of resistance movements um and then compared them to Legal kind of case studies um and we're ultimately trying to answer this question of does culture shape the law or does law shape culture and one really what's that question again because that's hot uh does culture shape the law or does law shape culture love it I would say there is a golf Mutual Constitution um but there was a really interesting study that's always resonated with me and it just keeps coming up in my work in doubts um and basically it showed like there are these types of community kind of lawyers or policy makers that um often do a bunch of professional institutional research market research you know you know the whole thing like and then make policy recommendations um But ultimately um in the follow-up with those communities usually the policy is like five years later were not actually found to have much impact or actually fix the problems that the community is facing but the lawyers that actually went into those communities and spent like significant amounts of time like weeks and months with individual community members talking to them listening um really trying to understand like what are your daily problems and like how do you think that we should solve these like yes I'm the expert but like how do you how do you see this you know being solved for um or what would you like support and help in and the lawyers who spent that extra time actually embedded within the community um came out with policy recommendations and changes and outcomes that five years down the line were significantly more successful um in solving that community's problems and in improving the um daily life of those communities than the ones that made like external recommendations and I think I think about this a lot more than does like it relates to what you're saying in the sense that Dows are almost like from the get-go right like expected to think of the community and we see this in when there's a treasury that doesn't have a lot of community allocation that's like not a good luck right like there's this new expectation from the gecko that I think does present of listening to the community and getting their involvement in participation that I haven't seen really exist anywhere else before I mean I think that's really interesting um and like you're saying like tokens are like a mechanism and vehicle uh enabling that but I also think like synchronous communication going back to the sort of proposal drop-off follow-up thing is really important like one thing that we um recently integrated into like our proposal process in boys club is a zoom call like if you're making a proposal you have to hold a zoom call and if everyone can't attend like that's okay but you have to hold a zoom call to like pitch your idea and just like get others feedback before the voting goes live and like we used to do a system where it was just um posting a proposal having a async discussion and then going into voting but we realized like the Zoom call is actually like very very important um and what did the zoom call bring to the table that without it when the boys club wouldn't have it's a great question I think like more openness and fluidity to the discussion and like a different level of just humanness that you can't get through chatting on Discord um and also like the ability to explore different ideas or different opinions in real time with people that you care about and that you have that you share skin in the game with on the same thing um and like I I know Dina and Natasha kind of talked about this like when they were on the Pod recently but um one thing that really struck me when I started working with them which is about a year ago when boys have started in November of last year um was I was like whoa they are so honest about how they're feeling like they're like I'm really nervous about this I'm I'm feeling like worried about this or doubtful about this or feeling insecurity around this thing and I was like Wow because like personally I was coming from before a mindset of like okay I of course I'm feeling those things in my day-to-day life and like work sometimes but I'm not gonna share them because I'm not gonna like like you know um you know like the meme where it's like the guy and he's like I made it up like I'm not gonna like tell everyone I made it up obviously but like then working with them like oh yeah I'm just gonna tell everyone like how I'm really feeling like it builds this level of like trust and honesty where also where we're able to like like hear that and like hear someone say oh I'm feeling like nervous about this or insecure about this and be like oh like you shouldn't be like you're good and like that can actually like really make a difference in the morale um so that was sort of a long-winded like thought there but um that being something I think yeah fostering that level of like vulnerability within your community combined with encouraging diversity of thought and then creating like operational Logistics systems that enable that um I think really will work to produce um what you're saying like this sort of shared ownership and decision making and discussion have you ever thought about how um what crypto is supplying to the world with what we're talking about there's different ways to express yourself there's different like factions to align with like whether you want to join boys club or like please or Dow like pick your doubt Bank list out pick your Dell there's so many different ways to like have your values be expressed by the doubt landscape and that's kind of like my bold case for Dallas is like there's a dial out for you it's kind of like you know you're going you're going into college and like all right pick your club like there's a club there's a doubt for you somewhere yeah so you can find your tribe uh if there's not one like maybe you should make one because maybe other people are looking to find like resonance have you thought about how the and this is what I I mean when I say what crypto's supplying to the world that we're supplying all of these places for people to like perhaps feel resonance with have you thought about how this kind of relates to what is lacking in the outside crypto world where we have like Millennials and Zoomers who for the few are the first generations to feel less empowered than their parents and they don't feel like the Boomers listen to them in society have you thought about how crypto like actually solves or not necessarily solves but just like answers to some of the the growing voids that are in society these days I think with like Dows and the governance spectrum and design space that exists today like what I what my initial thought is what immediately comes to mind is just like more effective means of Grassroots organizations achieving their goals and also building their own cultural cultures and identities like wall I am not the biggest fan of token voting like that is probably a great system for some doubts and like that's great like I don't think we should be going around saying like old ow should do this all data should do that like like you're saying it's very customizable across the stack um and I think what that means is like for maybe the first time ever in history with these Innovative and novel forms of governance and forms of organization um different organizations specifically can um more quickly mobilize around a common goal um or a common value in a cheap value we saw that with Ukraine Dao we saw that almost with Constitution Dao like Ukraine Dao raised more money in the first week of it being formed than the UN did for humanitarian relief in Ukraine like actually conceptualize that like that's crazy can I hear us on here yeah that's crazy like it's insane and like that's so cool and I think that really goes to show like um I'm also getting really into this idea of like flashed owls and like when does it out disseminate like probably like not all Dows should strive to or be expected to exist forever um so I think we're really not have Ukraine Dao what the goal is to not have Ukraine yes yes yeah um and the goal is to like create a spectrum of ways to organize mobilization and governance in a way that enables different doubts with different objectives and working in different timelines across different skills to quickly and effectively achieve their goals um and I think that's like super cool because like if you think about it it's the way I kind of like envisions like all these different like factions like you said before like you also use that word working outside of the system but I think within Dallas too we're reaching a lot of weird questions like big hairy questions of like like I've been reading um this book uh rethinking reimagining organizations that talks about like this teal teal model um and it's very similar to what we've been doing within uh boys club and like what also kind of what Orchid out does with like different guilds or pods that each have their own sort of mini Dows inside of them um working together to form one dial but like basically the whole thesis of the book and the teal practice um is borrowed from like corporate structures so like almost in the same way that we're reaching this circle within the wider crypto community of like okay does crypto just become sort of like a token economic system and like blockchain that the government is like running on um like Dao is now sort of reaching this point I think where it's like oh like our Dow is just like basically like now adopting corporate structures right I don't think it's like necessarily good or bad and but I think it's like interesting that we're seeing this like full circle thing and I wonder like what the sort of I guess like Peaks and valleys of different like lifelines and then the evolution of this will be oh one other thing that I've been thinking about um is I was thinking a lot about I've been thinking a lot about like parenting like I'm really excited to be a parent one day um so like I think a lot about like oh like how do I want my kids do this or that and I was thinking like hmm seems like a lot of parenting might actually just be about like fostering intrinsic motivation and creating like positive feedback loop incentive mechanisms for your kids and then I was sort of thinking like can you unpack that a little bit why why is that um well I think it's like I think intrinsic motivation is really important right like um at least for me personally I I was raised without a lot of pressure like my parents were never like oh we want you to be successful in this way or we want you to go down this track or do this thing um or go to this school like or get got married like those were never conversations but the conversations are more like this is the type of person not what you want you to be like um like a kind person and it's a little more meta more values based I would say than like more values based than um than like outcome based or like label based um and so I think like by starting with the values like that Foster a lot of intrinsic motivation just and how I interact in the day-to-day World um and I also think like by fostering intrinsic motivation um you're also by proxy encouraging a lot of curiosity and like you're encouraging your children or whoever to like awesome like get so excited about this go explore it go figure it out go try this thing Go fail um and then the like incentive mechanism thing I mean that's like everything from like brushing your teeth to like going to school and like just you know all these things um but I was thinking about how there's a lot of like like relation between maybe how Taos talk about you know getting contributors involved in fostering that kind of ownership and like with parenting I don't know yet but I was sort of thinking about like this next generation of like Dow parents and like what will they be like so you're saying that you can kind of apply the the idea of how to be a good parent to also a dow and say hey if we can get this like smaller part of the Dao to start like creating a feedback loop inside of itself then that little part of the Dao can like self-perpetuate and we don't have to think about that anymore and now that's a cell like an auto functioning part of the Dao and then we can like create this over and over and over again for many many parts of the other parts of the Dao and if we can do that enough times like all of a sudden the Dow as a whole is like the self-perpetuating ecosystem is that kind of the idea here yes I was actually thinking of it as the inverse of like oh how can we apply these like sort of Dao models to children but um because I was thinking about like tokenomics right and like there's all these things involved in it with like how do you create systems where people are rewarded in the right way even with like a vesting schedule as you know I met this crypto person who gives his kid um a choice every month of like is his allowance in like USD like cash or like Roblox and I was like wow this is really cool it's almost like kind of like a vesting like options schedule um and that I don't know I was just sort of thinking about um Dao people and crypto people are such nerds about incentive mechanisms and positive feedback loops and intrinsic motivation and ownership and like those are all things that like matter and like parenting too so I wonder if we'll see like a change in like with the ethos of crypto and I think this really circles back to like the very beginning of this conversation of like what are the values in crypto and like what do we care about and think about and like how does that translate um I guess across how might that translate across Generations yeah and also how do we how do we like incentivize it right like how do we manifest it yeah um so when if we were to zoom out and say say douse get their together and maybe we can also answer what that even looks like uh we can let's fast forward like five ten years into the future where a lot of this idea and thought and like practice of applying some of the things that we've been talking about today on the show and Dallas like start to like you know start to get their ball rolling what what does your the successful versions of dowels in the future look like what are they doing that have helped them become successful what do they need to do I don't want to be prescriptive like I don't think there's one right way to do doubts like I know how I personally feel about certain things within doubts and like what my preferences are but you could also zoom out more and just say hey like uh the Dallas have figured out ways to hear their communities better right we can get a little bit more mad about it right I think yeah like getting more meta about it I think in a successful Dao World a few years down the line we will see a proliferation of diversity endows both in what they're United and mobilized around and in the ways that they operate um and then I also think like to get there um like I said before like we need more experimentation we need more research we need more documentation um we need to actually be like more academically I think rigorous about um the about the development of this industry or space or sector within crypto because like those peer review journals live on those are like nuggets of Alpha and like like you would never find that on crypto Twitter right and like I literally just found them by like I can't remember a single time I've ever seen a peer-reviewed article spread on crypto Twitter yeah yeah like but we need both right and like I we we do like it'd be helpful right in these conversations where people are like this style model is failing it doesn't work it'd be helpful we need evidence and data like I'm a very digital person we need data to back it up and so we need to be able to point to um to different dials that have succeeded and failed over time and actually have measurable ways of like documenting that and consolidating and presenting that information I think that's just a simple call to action of like hey let's let's codify our learnings and make that shareable which is kind of just like what open source is uh I mean we're not writing software here we're kind of sometimes we are uh with things like Orca protocol but like we're just saying like hey we need to like share more information about like how these structures are working and maybe
