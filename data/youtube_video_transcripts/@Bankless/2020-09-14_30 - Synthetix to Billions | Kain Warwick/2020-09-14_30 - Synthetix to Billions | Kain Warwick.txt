[Music] [Music] welcome to thankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what an epic interview with kane man it was great yeah i really think that these this d5 founders series that we're doing that we started with donnie with our last episode and and this episode with kane and then i really think that these episodes are really going to be a fantastic snapshot of the the pre-bull market before before like all this explosion of innovation and development happens which you know i'm crossing my fingers does happen right and so what we're trying to do with these episodes is we are both trying to focus in on the founders of these specific protocols the actual individuals themselves you know stani kane sergey hue and and focus in on exactly what about them created these protocols but then also simultaneously create like a canonical what is of a what is synthetics what is chain link episode at the same time and also create a snapshot for where these protocols are when the start of the bull market really got roaring right so that's what these episodes are about and that's what this episode with kane of synthetics is all about kanan himself is a really interesting figure and he's done a ton of podcasts right so but the reason why we wanted to get him specifically on is really get the background on kane himself right because kane is a pretty interesting guy he's a he's a crypto anarchist and crypto anarchists are super interesting and so we we get into that conversation which i've never seen kane talk about before and so that was kind of my big big highlight of this episode is kind of seeing how kane thinks in the world and how that how he thinks and how that got related into the synthetics protocol ryan what did you take away from this episode yeah i think the the patterns and archetypes of these crypto native founders are basically they're really setting the playbook for how other d5 protocols are going to be formed in the future right so you see you see these uh protocols like constantly learning from each other on you know how to how to build a community how to um you know create your incentives in our episode with stani last week he talked about how his avonomics the avonomics of the ave protocol basically inspired by a whole slew of other d5 protocols so what we're really seeing is this entire ecosystem leveling up together and some of these protocols quite honestly they're experimenting they're flying by the seat of their pants but when something works when they iterate and something works then that ripples across the entire ecosystem and it becomes like a a pattern a best practice for d5 protocols moving forward so i think these episodes are key if you're looking for what those patterns are so you can identify the next synthetics you can identify the next ave you can identify the next crypto native founder and front run the opportunity as we always say here this is also awesome because we got a chance to hear about synthetics and uh toward the end kane really spelled out what is happening next in three areas then he sort of added a fourth and uh i don't know left me very bullish on defy left me particularly bullish on eth which uh you know i'm usually trending in that direction anyway but also bullish on on what synthetics has planned so it's a great episode to get up to speed on everything synthetics we we start with the the basics of what it is but then we get down to sort of the the the depth and the meat of what it um can be in the future and uh yeah fantastic listen so far we're two for two on both of these d5 founders leaving us with a particularly bullish sentiment at the end of their podcast uh the the flow through this podcast was pretty good uh so we like i said we start with talking about kane and his specific politics and personality how that related to synthetics then we talk about uh you know the brutal bear market and growing community during that bear market and then we talk about rising the ranks of defy using the conviction and the strength of the community and really what was the recipe that synthetics created that ultimately created their success and then as we said we go into the road map for synthetics and future predictions uh the episode speaks with the self we don't need a long intro so i think ryan we're just gonna go ahead and get right into the podcast but first we're gonna talk about our sponsors one of the tools i've started to use recently is zapper for those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market it was characterized by just opening up blockfolio and refreshing it over and over and over again and also anytime you ever made a trade you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio that you think that you have matches what you actually have with zapper you don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do is zapper is input your ethereum addresses and then zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is so there will never ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that zapper reports to you zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions all of your positions all at once so there's no more editing your portfolio because zapper just does it for you one thing that i thought was really useful about zappers was when i plugged my wallets in i found that i had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago and without zapper i would have probably lost that forever because zapper knows where your money is better than you do it's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available defy platforms like curve balancer uniswap yearn in the bankless nation there is this growing number of money legos and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming which is why you could just go to zapper and zapper will will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from so check them out at zapper.phi enter your ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed your ethereum address is a bankless bank account but here's the problem it doesn't have a human readable name it's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem it provides a domain name for your ethereum address so instead of telling someone to send you funds to 0xe3ba blah blah blah you can tell them to send funds to yourname.crypto a domain name for your ethereum address at unstoppabledomains.com you can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs you can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your dot crypto or dot eth or even zil domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names dot com.org your bankless bank account on ethereum should have a domain name too so go to unstoppabledomains.com register a domain name for your ethereum address now unstoppabledomains.com all right let's get into the interview with kane bankless nation we are so excited to have kane warwick from synthetics on our show he describes himself as the formerly semi-benevolent dictator of the synthetics foundation but now he's currently aspiring synthetics dao super delegate kane is really the founding father of d5 liquidity mining and all of the things that we're seeing going on in the space today kane it's great to have you we're super excited about this how are you doing sir uh yeah yeah thanks for having me guys uh i really appreciate it all right so first question as one of the founding fathers of all of this defy liquidity mining is has it gone too far do you have any regrets about starting this whole kind of trend kane what have you done yeah i know you know it's actually it's so funny uh i woke up this morning and the first message that i i saw was uh from a guy on discord and he was like do you ever think like what have i done here [Laughter] that was literally the first message that i saw and i was like what's gone wrong i was like what's happening i like immediately when like looked at like sushi and saw the migration happen so um you know i think uh i think at times you know it has gotten a little uh a little crazy um but you know i've always been a big advocate for you know experimentation and and so i think that this idea of like distilling some of these incentives and really kind of testing the edges of them is you know not necessarily the worst thing so you like the experimentation is what you're saying yeah yeah i think it's i think it's good i think it's a net positive in the end so kane you've gone on a bajillion podcasts and so there there's plenty of podcasts that are just like all right what's synthetics but of all the podcasts i've heard with you kane i've yet to hear one that talks about your personal politics or your personal attitudes about life and from what i've listened to i've gotten the gist that you're kind of a crypto anarchist uh if is that right and can you elaborate on that yeah so so you know i definitely uh have like a an anarchist uh bent right and and you know it comes from uh i guess like this you know anti-authoritarian uh viewpoint of you know power structures need to be justified and you know anything uh you know any power structure any sort of hierarchy or or you know authority that can't uh be legitimized you know should be torn down um and you know i think that that's kind of the the sort of core of my uh my world view from a political standpoint so anti-authoritarian then like has it always been that way kane or was this sort of an awakening at some point in your life no i think it's always it's always been that way um you know uh probably you know coming from uh my upbringing i guess right like um you know i uh my dad was a professional tennis player so he was um you know pretty intense person um is a pretty intense person and you know definitely uh our our family was uh was you know i've got three younger brothers so there's you know four four boys competing all the time so i you know we always had this uh this you know really intense highly competitive environment in my uh house and so i think you know at some point uh kind of challenging that and and sort of questioning you know authority just became ingrained in me when did and when did you get into crypto and would you say that all those same values came before crypto or kind of after crypto and crypto helped instantiate them definitely before you know i i was kind of you know someone that would read uh things like chomsky and and you know a bunch of different uh sort of political uh viewpoints you know in my kind of uh late teens and early twenties um and you know just really had a strong uh kind of view that the status quo was was not quite adequate and you know that there are a lot of issues in in the status quo in terms of you know how uh how governance worked etc and so i think that when i when i first saw uh bitcoin you know to be honest i i didn't really get it i read uh the slashdot thread that i think a lot of people read um you know in like 2011. um and you know coming from uh a payments background and a retail background um you know it just it didn't quite sync with me it was probably a couple years later before i i really um you know saw the value from like a political perspective rather than just as a payment mechanism being a crypto anarchist of sorts what is your hope for how crypto platforms crypto protocols how they help organize people like what is the futuristic sci-fi version of crypto that you see in your head well you know this is this is part of the reason why i've been uh so bullish on tokens for for such a long time right you know even through through the bear market where you know tokens were seen as um you know this uh this terrible kind of black mark right on on you know people who had done icos and that sort of thing and the reason behind that is that i believe that you know they're such a powerful coordination mechanism and that you know if you set up a system of rules that is is very clear um and you're open and anyone can participate that you know having a token that kind of uh unites uh that rule set is is a really powerful way of driving behavior and so you know the idea that you can create these coordination games and you know provide services without needing some sort of like top-down you know hierarchy or you know structure i think is is really exciting and we're starting to see that you know and and obviously the first uh kind of wave of this is very financial in nature um but i think there is the possibility to extend it you know further than that and really you know kind of open it up and and have these sort of self-governing uh you know systems that don't require essential authority to to mediate them how is this reflected in this synthetics protocol right because all crypto protocols have values baked into them to some degree so how would you say that these values have been worked into synthetics i i think it kind of comes from our community um you know where i've been a participant in the community from day one you know even when there were only maybe 10 of us that actually cared about the you know the project right um and and so you know my my view has always been engage with the community as a community member um you know and even though i do occupy a privileged position as the founder i've really tried to you know not exercise that power and not you know not leverage it um and you know just to to try and uh you know advocate for whatever position i'm advocating um you know on its merits right rather than you know relying on some kind of authority and so i think that the people who uh participate in our community and who've been kind of attracted to that have a very similar viewpoint right like they believe that you know the the kind of argument should be one on on its own merits and that anyone can participate and that's another reason why i think you know we haven't gone down the uh the sort of on-chain uh governance path right we've we've kind of stuck with this idea of um you know rough consensus and and letting debate kind of you know live in the community and to decide things so okay and something else i i actually just learned today is you wrote a novel right i did i did uh somewhat um stupidly um it's never a bad decision to write a book in so yeah you know it was it it was one of those things where like um i i read a lot right um you know i read a lot i read a lot of uh non-fiction and a lot of science fiction and you know fantasy and stuff and uh i was reading um a nick bostrom uh book about ai and there was this example this uh super intelligence super intelligence yeah yeah super intelligent so um and you know he gets to the point about like the the paper clip generating you know optimizer right that like is is optimizing for um you know uh generating as many paper clips as as possible um and i've i you know was reading it at night fell asleep and and kind of you know was really stuck with me and then the next morning uh i kind of had this idea for like a short story that kind of extended that uh that you know thought experiment and so i started writing it and you know throughout the rest of the day like i you know put down like i don't know 8 000 words or something like that like it just it was kind of like flowing out and so then i was like well maybe this is a bit bigger than a short story and i've never written anything longer than a short story before and that was a huge mistake because the amount of uh pain and suffering that you go through in the editing process i just was not uh prepared for it so it ended up taking me like almost 18 months to finish it because i went through like you know five different uh revisions and really changed a bunch of stuff so i'm a bit of a perfectionist which is which is why uh start starting to write a novel was maybe not the best uh best plan given that it was a side project well good for you for sticking with it but like so i i've read that book too uh super intelligence i think um elon musk was talking about it for a while and just it kind of tuned me into it and i gotta say that book uh somewhat haunted me right because your part of the thesis uh is that basically ai is inevitable and quite possibly an evil ai is the out uh is the end outcome of all of this and you know nick's kind of caution to us is we should be preparing for that now in fact i think he he works as an ethicist uh to like come up with um protocols to uh reign in the the future ai that's coming i i almost wonder so um peter thiel i think has has kind of painted this contrast where he talks about ai being almost an authoritarian type of technology versus uh crypto blockchain being a a more classically liberal type of technology an anti-authoritarian uh technology and i'm wondering if that kind of fed into your interest in that book super intelligence and uh the novel itself this this whole kind of anti-authoritarian like i guess path that you've been on your entire life it seems did that feed into it well you know so uh i definitely had the naive uh view of uh of ai right up to that point and you know i i definitely spent a lot of time you know reading about um you know general uh artificial intelligence and you know for for years right like tons of uh books you know um and i think reading uh bostrom's book it was haunting it was it was really scary like he really painted a picture uh of you know this alternative uh approach and you know i think i i'm fairly optimistic about the potential for technological progress but that definitely was an eye-opening uh uh kind of experience reading and what i remember in reading it was how fast it could happen like in a blink of an eye right so it gets to human iq you know 100 iq 120 iq right and then a week later it could be well beyond human's capability to even reign it in yeah exactly and and that was part of you know writing the the novel i think originally the short story was like just a way for me to kind of uh you know take this very sort of troubling alternative viewpoint that i hadn't really uh you know considered previously and process it you know as a way of kind of processing it and obviously it took on a life of its own and took a lot longer than i would have liked but you know i think it was it was very helpful for me to kind of incorporate that into my world view but i do think it's a little bit you know like uh i don't know um you know the heat death of the universe or something like that it's like a thing that you know is true but you kind of have to just you know continue operating yeah yeah exactly like if we sat around all day like worried about like you know this idea of like an agi uh emerging you know in 10 seconds uh being over uh you know maybe maybe that's too pessimistic right maybe we should be trying harder to prevent it but i kind of feel like it's either inevitable or it's not and you know the hope is that we have some benevolent uh agi rather than you know something that is malicious and i i do think at least for me right so uh ai could grow very powerful we're already seeing it today in centralized companies like google and um you know baidu and all of these uh all these companies but um crypto is almost like a little bit of the antidote to that right it's it restores some balance in the universe it restores some self-sovereignty for the individual and we're starting with money systems but um there could be other systems so i find personally like after reading you know some of nick's work and other things it's just like that's that's kind of the the side i want to be on um at least right now is is like more the decentralization side of things that's helping to restore a little bit of the balance of um you know what centralized ai could it could eventually become but um yeah anyway yeah i agree and you know i think i think there's like the the risk is really in the opacity right and this is where you know crypto uh is so powerful right like when the rule system that you're operating under is opaque and and you can't you know understand what the implications are you know it's impossible to kind of see the the rules um that's where you know power can really aggregate and become abusive i think when everyone's operating um you know on the same rule set and the rules are very clear uh at least you have that you know advantage where you understand how everyone else is playing um so i think that that is something that i see in crypto's you know a very powerful driver for um you know maybe uh the potential for more fair outcomes uh you know in in these systems so kane you wrote this novel out of just pure inspiration and and motivation which you know is is something in of itself like a high effort activity right and then ever in doing some research for this podcast i went to the synthetics slash haven blog which started in september of 2017 and you've been just pumping out blog posts after blog post ever since then right and then and then not to mention just being the leader for this crazy awesome d5 protocol where does this motivation come from like where do you get the energy and meaning behind what you are doing so that when you wake up in the morning you're ready to go and and build something like what what motivates you to what yeah what motivates you one of my favorite uh books to to stay on the the book thread is the hard thing about hard things um by ben horowitz and and i think you know he talks about the idea that like hard things are the reward in themselves right just doing something that's really challenging and i think that you know there's there's definitely certain people who have uh you know a mindset i think i fall into this category of you know it's just fun to do difficult things um for you know it's its own reward and so you know uh i think i'm i'm a little bit uh crazy like that where you know i i have this kind of perfectionistic streak and and feel um you know really driven to be challenged and you know if i'm if i'm not challenged then i get bored really quickly and and so you know waking up at the moment and just being uh you know kind of inundated with like the the d5 fire hose it's you know it's definitely confronting and i think everyone's feeling that um but you know there is an aspect of like trying to kind of synthesize it all and you pull it all together into some coherent uh view you know is really fun at the same time right so you know you got to be having some fun but you know it's definitely it's definitely challenging i've been doing startups for a long time and you know there there are days where you kind of wake up and you're like it's been 20 years of startup life and you know you feel a little bit burnt out but i think it's it's fun enough to kind of keep going um you know at the moment and so what's the goal like when you are when you do decide to wake up and and decide that you know no longer is startup life fit for you and instead walking in the mountains is now fit for you like what what do you have hoped to achieve like what are you trying to change the world to to be like or or what's your trying to what's the mark that you're trying to leave upon the world you know i think uh i have a very strong uh sort of streak of like trying to achieve fairness and and trying to achieve uh equitable outcomes um you know i feel very strongly about that i think that you know arbitrary and this comes back again like anti-authoritarian you know viewpoints right like the the idea that someone can exercise arbitrary power over someone else i find to be really abhorrent and so you know to build a system or you know to contribute to systems being built uh where that you know is uh is limited and the ability for people to to abuse power is limited i think you know even if it's not necessarily you know synthetics being a world-changing thing just contributing to you know crypto and d5 i think is is something that you know keeps me motivated and you know i'm hopeful that uh we can kind of continue experimenting and you know add to this you know body of knowledge about how you coordinate uh behavior and you know achieve things like that without uh necessarily um you know looking for some specific outcome right you know um i don't i don't think it really matters uh what the outcome is as long as you know we're kind of building up this uh this you know uh new kind of technology and new way of coordinating people so we're in the middle of our d5 founders series here on bankless and we started with uh stani from ave last week we're now here with kane from synthetics and one of the questions that we're asking everyone came from our episode with vance spencer of framework uh which was also kind of like the vc start to this whole thing and one of the concepts that he talked about was when he is looking for you know d5 founders and then also d5 protocols to like invest in or put their skin in the game into they they said they frequently asked the question for protocols that are looking to hand over governance over the protocol to the community the question is are you really about that life because that's a different lifestyle that's a different choice than running a c-corp with you know a board of directors and and publicly owned company right it's a different it's a different goal and so so kane why are you about that life like what what about you is particularly suited to building this community owned and operated protocol i've always i've always you know in all the startups that i've run uh you know some of my friends and and people that are close to me have always kind of pointed out that you know one of the the common threads with all of them is that there you know tends to be a community that kind of uh coalesces around them um that gets really passionate about it and really cares about it and i think you know part of that is the this kind of process of engagement right of you know genuinely uh engaging with people and wanting them to contribute and i think a lot of people pay lip service to that process right but really they do want to retain power and they want to retain uh some sense of control um but you know i i genuinely do want to engage and and kind of hand over control uh as much as as possible you know to uh this this protocol like it's it's you want to be this the super delegate instead of the benevolent dictator right that's what it says 100 exactly exactly and you know even though we don't have super delegates yet you know when we do um you know my my genuine hope is that people uh you know think that i'm a viable candidate for that role and you know we might end up in a situation where we have you know seven uh people that are super delegates that are you know sort of responsible for um you know helping to kind of direct the the next um you know phase of the the project um and you know obviously i want to be a part of that right but i also want to to have earned it rather than you know be kind of grandfathered in because i you know happened to be you want to get it you want to be a voice in the protocol not the voice in the synthetics protocol in time over time absolutely and you know this is already happening right like people do not listen if you go in and like honestly if you go in and look at discord right like i'm constantly advocating for things from there like no not we're just not doing that we don't we don't think you're right on this so it's so you're already getting overruled then on things oh all the time are there times where are there times where you're like oh you know the community is right about that and i was actually wrong and it led to a better decision and i guess you know the opposite do you feel like sometimes the community's made bad decisions you know i think in the in the early days everyone was very passionate everyone felt you know very uh very strongly about you know the direction that things should be be going in but it was also very cohesive right like we all were really bored into what we were trying to do and so you know we would have debates and disagreements but you know generally was about like how do we achieve something and i think what's kind of shifted as the community has grown is it's less of debates about how do we achieve something but you know sometimes even like what are we trying to achieve um which i think is an important thing but you know even uh you know recently uh probably i think the biggest one and i've talked about this before is the monetary policy change right you know when we change the uh the inflation schedule um there was a community member delta tiger who you know was advocating for it and i said no this is a bad idea like we don't want to go down that path we want to you know have like a you know coherent uh monastery policy and he advocated for it you know pushed it through and you know it was definitely a good change like that was a really positive this was basically the decision right i i guess i introduced as kind of you know father of uh founding father of d5 liquidity mining right but um the original design for synthetics was like more like bitcoin right where it would be some kind of fixed cap and there wouldn't be a change to issuance policy it was very kind of regimented right that was the prevailing thought at the time so you're saying like this whole shift to liquidity mining wasn't even your idea it came from the community it that's true so so you know um i basically said uh you know i had this idea um when i think this is going back to like 2018 right so um i think it was around devcon so like you know maybe october whatever of 2018 and we were clearly not getting traction right like we weren't getting people to uh to you know uh stake we you know we're having trouble with engagement and uh i started talking about this idea of you know changing the monetary policy and uh you know essentially uh shifting to you know something more like a hardening right like to you know introduce inflation and we would have this hardening process and so that that initial process of changing the monetary policy to reward stakers was pushed through by me but the the stupid part of that was this hardening component right of like each year would have it just created like unnecessary risk and basically six months later someone came in and said that's a really dumb idea and i said no it's not and then everyone actually said yeah no it is a dumb idea we should change them they did all right so for folks who have not heard about synthetics we want this to be kind of a canonical episode about synthetics in the future um could you just do a quick explain it like i'm five of the protocol what does it do and what problem is it solving kane so basically what it allows you to do is hold a token that gives you uh exposure to any asset that the protocol supports on ethereum so you know on ethereum uh you want price exposure to bitcoin you want to be able to hold a token that will uh you know move like like a bitcoin and so what the protocol allows you to do is hold that token it uses oracles to essentially uh you know lock the token to that price and it's you know effectively the same as holding a bitcoin right with obviously some different properties um and the same thing goes for you know other assets like gold silver you know you can hold an ounce of gold that's tokenized and you're able to get your price exposure the same way as if you were holding a a you know one ounce gold bar these things are called synthetics right that's what a synthetic is it's essentially a um kind of a price tracker for all of these assets though it's not the actual asset itself that's getting traded around it's just kind of the price representation of that asset it's and it's importantly it's supposed to be redeemable for an equal amount of that asset in real life although it is not a claim on the real life asset it should be able to redeep be redeemable for the same amount of value of that real asset correct yeah so you know there's there's no you can't you know front up and and convert uh one token you know uh one xau sxau token for um gold but uh you know in theory you should be able to convert that into you know the right amount of dollars to go and buy a gold bar and buy an equivalent amount right and so how do explain how the oracles get integrated in synthetics and what the oracles do so uh we made a decision uh about 18 months ago to work with chain link to implement their oracle system um and we've worked really closely with them since to to get this done and you know very excitingly finally we've made the transition so we've moved all of our oracles over the chain link and you know it essentially allows us to uh to kind of hand over the complexity of managing this oracle network uh to you know people that that's all they do um and so we can you know focus on on the the things that you know make sense for us to focus on and kind of outsource this uh this price feed component um so you know it's a big deal it's also very helpful for decentralization because you know previously uh we were running an internal article that you know was um again very opaque people didn't know what the rules were um you know it wasn't clear where the price feeds were coming etc so we've now moved away from that and and i think it's made the protocol much more open and decentralized subsequently and oracles are crucial for synthetics right because all of the uh synthetic assets available in the synthetic marketplace they need to be they need to know what the price of their real world correlate is right so if you buy a a tokenized ver a synthetic asset of one ounce of gold what the oracle does is it takes outside world data of the real world gold price from some source and the chain link oracle reports that to the synthetic marketplace to tell the synthetic marketplace to price all of the synthetic gold tokens appropriately tell them what price it should be and then we can copy and paste the same model for all possible you know assets right like the smp 500 or the tesla stock or apple stock or you know maybe something even crazier like uh the uh the population of a country like so long it is it can be like reported by chain link it can be turned into a synthetic asset on synthetics correct that's correct exactly yeah as long as there's enough liquidity in the external market as well so we don't we don't want the you know the market to be uh manipulatable of course of course and so how does the snx asset come into play here where does the snx asset get involved so it's essentially the the collateral token for the network um so it's this your coordination point uh to get everyone to come together and you operate within this this rule set so if you're holding s and x you stake s and x and you're able to uh to issue uh debt which you know tracks the these price oracles and uh the the fees that uh accrue from people exchanging uh different synthetic assets um you know between each other so if someone goes from synthetic bitcoin to synthetic gold they pay a fee all of those fees go into a pool and the snx stakers who have been collateralizing the network get their pro rata share of those fees each week and so this is how synthetic assets come into existence right like we don't we don't just get to start with all these assets they need to be created somehow and so what someone does is they take the snx token say they take a a thousand dollars of the snx token and then they uh they they deposit it into uh synthetics in a comparable way that they deposit ether into maker dow or something and then they have some amount of credit based on their deposits and that credit can be turned into a synthetic asset by choosing which oracle to make that uh that credit turn into an asset buy right and so you can have if you have like 200 worth of credit by your snx deposits you can turn that into 200 worth of synthetic gold or synthetic tesla was all that correct that's right that's exactly right but that's not the only thing that snx does because the other half of snx is governance over synthetics the protocol right so it's this dual collateral token for the snx marketplace and the governance token over how the xnx marketplace works how has that relationship between like this dual purpose of synthetics how is that relationship kind of been absorbed and understood by the community like how are people thinking about this this dual relationship so you know at the moment the the snx token uh does not give you governance rights um so you know the the governance process that we use is very similar to ethereum right you know it's not a direct uh token vote you know based on how much ether you have right uh that feeds into the the eip process and we have a similar approach where you know we've got a community they're all token holders uh but you know your ability to uh kind of advocate for a specific change or you know for something that you want to see in the protocol is not limited to your token holding you know it's it's actually your reputation within the community that is what really drives you know your your ability to kind of uh make changes and propose modifications and i think that you know that's something that maybe is is a little bit different to some of the protocols that we've seen recently where you know they are using direct on-chain uh governance and you know i've got some some serious concerns about uh you know the the implications of that i think eventually we will get to a point where um you know we have this delegated you know voting process and people can delegate towards uh specific um you know people who are um looking to kind of join uh this governing council essentially but at the moment uh the process is very you know rough it's it's a rough consensus process and we need to get to a point where consensus is really strong uh in the community before we make any changes and there's a risk of that as well obviously which is your ossification like like we've seen in bitcoin where it becomes really hard to change things and i think this is where you know eventually we will get to a break point where it becomes too hard to change things through rough consensus and we actually need to move to some form of on-chain governance but we've been taking that very very slowly for you know the kind of reasons that i stayed there yeah okay pardon me for for the the mistake the the dual the duality of the synthetic token model i should have been referring to was the fact that the snx token does have rights over the cash flow over the protocol right and so the snx token is both the collateral for generating assets and then also the asset that is has a claim on the cash flow of the system and so if people will remember about a year ago and around then i was kind of known loosely known as generally an snx asset skeptic because of this self-recursion right like the the asset the token that the quote-unquote equity over the protocol is also the collateral of the protocol which to me i kind of saw that as like a dangerous feedback loop but i kind of now consider that i mean i kind of think that that attitude came out of like an a bear market attitude like a pessimistic attitude because there's also nothing more like awesome in the world of crypto than feedback loops right self-recursive feedback loops and you know let it be known that ether and ethereum and proof-of-stake operates in the same sort of feedback loop so now in my mind in my 2020 mind i'm now actually like relatively bullish on just the feedback loop between s and x the asset being both the collateral for synthetic assets while and also generating collecting the fees from the the synthetics marketplace and so has there been any community discussion or community like uh um understanding about the the duality of the both the cash flow slash collateral model of the synthetic asset there there has and you know this is something that we we talk about you know a lot but i think to be fair to maybe you know uh 2019 uh david um you know the the reality is that we are still limited right like you know the the using snx is the only collateral is somewhat limiting um and so you know we're pushing ahead very very aggressively to add uh either um as a collateral to borrow not just uh synthetic ether which is you know the current uh ability that you have but to actually be able to borrow susc as well um because you know in in the current environment in a bull market um you know there's a lot of demand for decentralized stable coins both you know die and susd um and so we need to have a lever to kind of you know extend uh the supply and and you know that's something that we're working on really closely so i think some of your concerns are still very valid right and we still have to solve some of these issues so i don't think it's necessarily a solved um assault problem but to to go back to the question around like cash flow i think you know it's funny right because uh in 2018 you know 2019 the the skepticism around tokens was uh you know at its peak right um and my view was always that if you wanted a token to have value it had to to you know accrue some cash flow right like it wasn't going to accrue value just from being a payment token that you know was was kind of uh operating in this walled garden i i you know i was always pretty skeptical of that idea and so i think that you know the the thing that limited people from approaching things this way was like a regulatory fear right they were worried about you know looking like a security etc and so i think you know one of the things that synthetics has contributed um you know hopefully is to reduce that fear and for people to to realize that you know a passive cash flow asset is a security but a token that's like this coordination mechanism that allows you to participate in an ecosystem and do work and receive fees for it is something else entirely right it's it's obviously not um you know uh the exact definition of the security and so i think that one of the things that we've really contributed is is you know to push that uh you know to open up the overton window on token design and make people more comfortable with the idea of uh you know these cash flow generating tokens you had a fantastic thread on the overton window of um you know capital and how there's a range of new uh options that d5 founders should consider we definitely want to talk about that in a little bit um but but is this what you just described is that essentially the upside thesis for snx that um a ton of cash would be generated basically by the synthetics critical and that would have a value accrual mechanism that feeds back into s and x is that the gist of the upside thesis that's it yeah exactly you know that's that's the idea that you know if we all come together and create this service that allows people to have price exposure to you know almost any asset on ethereum that there'll be a lot of demand for that and that demand will you know result in and a lot of uh you know free cash flow that flows through the network and ultimately to tokyo we were talking to stani about this about you know what you mentioned uh to kane about the 2018-2019 where everyone was bearish right so 2019 january 2019 david or january 2019 uh ryan could have purchased snx for four cents not to make you feel bad david but like right now it's five dollars so we had some opportunity costs there and so did everyone but like i guess to be fair um it it felt very much felt like at that time that um you know d5 was dead that kind of ethereum was maybe i don't know just barely hanging on that tokens all tokens were futility tokens none of them could uh deliver any any value uh and now here we are right now and snx is like twelve thousand percent up in price like marketing have a 2.5 million to like 500 million right and like a little over a year later um like absolutely insane i think uh our conversation with vance from from framework sort of illustrated the power of a contrarian bet in d5 in 2018 and 2019 but how did how did that feel for you on your side right so uh you're you're more than kind of an investor obviously in snx because you're actually investing your life in in the protocol and you're investing your team time and that sort of thing you mentioned uh ben's book the hard thing about hard things i remember this always stuck out with me he he talked about startups having this uh wfio moment this like we're aft it's over movement um before they kind of come out on the other side did you ever have a moment like that where you thought synthetics is never gonna work or even uh before haven is never going to work yeah i mean you know in late 2018 uh mid to late 2018 you know regulated stable coins uh and a combination of regulated stable coins and dye really had marginalized the the utility of the protocol um and so you know we were in this situation where we had to make a decision to either pivot um you know or just keep driving off a cliff um and you know we were definitely in a bad place i think at the end of 2018 early 2019 where you know okay we had enough runway to kind of keep going but clearly not enough to be able to take on circle right you know or uh you know paxos or um you know uh you know any of these these regulated stable coins that we're we're starting to see pop up and so you know we we just basically decided to to double down and you know uh accelerate the movement to this multi-currency system um and that's where we started to see some product market fit so you know uh i think that was that was probably the moment the late 2018 moment where you know we decided to just throw it all uh you know just kind of a bit of a hail mary and change the monetary policy you know the pivot the rebrand all of it and you know i think we're uh we're pretty lucky uh in in a number of ways that we just happened to kind of uh you know hit that that inflection point in d5 around about the same time but you know there was a part of me that you know always thought that this was pretty inevitable right you know i i was very very uh convicted that you know what we were doing made sense and that it was necessary and that you know there would that it would work in in spite of the skepticism right and skepticism was totally reasonable you know i i think uh you know we had a number of debates on on twitter and in various places um you know back then and you know the people like tayo and you know who are still skeptical about you know can this work um but i i think you know my view was uh was that you know i i really believe that the mechanism uh would be successful and and so you know the vindication of kind of seeing the market respond um and you know we're not there yet right like we're not at a point where the cash flow from you know providing this this service uh this decentralized service is sufficient to to kind of you know keep the network going in perpetuity um but i think we're getting closer and we're starting to see that you know there is genuine demand for it which is which is really good and you had to have that conviction in 2018 to continue to work on what you were working on in 2019 like at the time like you mentioned it um usdc and even tether these centralized stable coins were uh basically dominating right so it was very hard to be in the decentralized stablecoin business but another element that was very difficult uh was there was no like onboarding of liquidity into d5 at all like it was all through the centralized exchanges and where were they going to route you well they were going to list tether they're going to list usdc as the trading pairs and it almost seemed like to me this kind of inflection point that that you mentioned for for defy kind of occurred as an ecosystem of money legos right um like it seemed to me that uniswap really started to fuel a lot of the liquidity for this space and that created almost a feedback loop for synthetics to become more successful and increase its volume did you feel that did you feel like the space was kind of you know growing together and that some of these other money legos almost snapped into into place to make synthetics much more feasible absolutely you know uni swap is a big deal but i think you know we we really can't overlook the fact that it was maker and die which facilitated this you know if there's if there's no dye i don't think any of this happens right so you know dye kind of enabled uh you know things like compound uh to to really you know have this like symbiotic relationship right and and i think uh you know even set protocol and dharma and like you know all of these things uh the the ability to you know kind of believe that this is was workable i think a lot of that came from maker and so you know it's it uh i i think it's it's something that maybe you know it's kind of overlooked these days you know people look at compound and you know to launch the compound token it's like this kind of you know moment but i think you have to go way way further back right to like late 2017 and the launch of dye that was the the genesis do you still feel that cohesion in d5 that like the ecosystem is all we're you know we're all kind of in it uh together i mean look it's gotten a lot noisier right you know uh back i think it was you know just before devcon right like that was the first d5 conference and there were maybe 50 people in the room um you know and [Music] funnily enough though even then there was definitely a little bit of like uh you know tension right um you know not everyone was it was necessarily friendly there were there was a bit of competition and i i think also you know we were definitely not in a mindset of abundance back then right it was a very much a scarcity mindset and um you know and a little bit zero sum and i think i think that improved you know through 2019 as as things started to kind of heat up a little bit um so i think that you know people are probably a lot more friendly these days than than they maybe were even back then at times um but you know it's much noisier and there's a lot of crazy stuff going on so you know we don't have the same level of connectivity uh you know with some of the projects just because it's really hard with everything going on to stay connected hey guys before we start talking about the synthetic spartans we're going to take a moment to talk about the sponsors that make the bankless nation possible banklessnation do you want to go fully bankless but in the real world monolith is the defy account that you need it wraps your eth address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more it closes the loop from fiat to d5 so you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees then you can convert that die to adi which is an interest bearing savings account again zero fees and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a visa card so you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in d5 guys this is magic this is the closest thing to the holy grail crypto card and monolith gives you all of it you need to download the app at monolith.xyz to get your bankless visa card it's optimized for european listeners they'll be coming to the us soon and when you get that visa card the monolith card tweet about it when you do i love seeing people on packaging they're beautiful bankless visa cards it makes me realize that the revolution is here search monolith in the app store ample forth is a new base money experiment on ethereum many people have heard of this new rebasing mechanism and ampliforth was the protocol to first introduce that into the ethereum space ample forth is very comparable to bitcoin in the sense that it has a non-dilutive supply however there's one thing about it that's inverse with bitcoin whereas bitcoin has a completely inflexible supply meaning any demand for btc the asset is therefore reflected in the price and ample force is the inverse of that where ample fourth is pegged to 2019 and any demand for the ample fourth token is reflected in the supply of the asset not the price of the asset so the ample fourth token tracks 2019 dollars slowly over time so it should never be too far away from 2019 and in order to achieve that goal it adds or burns ample forth token supply so that the market generally prices it around the value of a 2019 dollar it is definitely not a stable coin because the volatility of the value that you hold will fluctuate up and down wildly but the token itself is supposed to track a dollar pretty interesting experiment there's been a lot of spin-offs using this rebasing mechanism they also have this liquidity mining program where you can supply ample fourth and ether tokens to the uniswap pool and you'll be able to get an extra dividend of ample fourth tokens from the ample fourth geyser so check them out at ampleforth.org and see if this is an experiment you want to partake in i think the best piece of alpha that i think everyone knows about nowadays is that community is everything right and synthetics is known for having one of the earliest and most um uh the strongest communities in the space that we can really think of and anytime some some community generates this bottom up like their own sort of uh mascot or or icon then that's something to pay attention to and like the synthetic spartans came really really early was there any one particular moment that more or less like triggered the the spartan meme or the instantiation of the protocol or the of the community around synthetics protocol or was it more of just a grassroots kind of bottom-up type of thing where people just for some somebody coined the term and then it just grew from there how did how did the synthetic spartan meme come about well i think it it it kind of came from g right you know that was his avatar uh you know so um djan spartan right um you know his avatar in in discord was uh you know the um one of the spartans and and so you know when people started to feel that this community was really you know uh cohesive and you know starting to solidify and they started looking around for you know what he was one of the people that really drove it um you know and kind of gave this identity of you know we don't give a we're just gonna you know keep pushing here and it doesn't matter if people don't believe in us it doesn't matter you know they're skeptical uh we we know what we're doing and we've got a vision of where we want to go and we're just gonna keep pushing through and so i think that that was where it kind of uh that was the genesis and dj and spartan for folks that aren't like on twitter all the time like many like probably all of uh us here are um he he's a pseudo-anonymous twitter account right that tweets about lots of things in d5 but was uh an early believer particularly during the bear market in what synthetics was was doing and i i like the spartans analogy because there weren't a lot of you guys back then you know there's the the 300 the mighty 300 again it was less than 300. yeah it was against all of the forces that that were kind of opposing it um and uh yeah it's it's uh it's fantastic that in crypto you're able to i mean we talked about uh chain-link god recently in our uh episode with vance but crypto's able to attract these pseudo-anonymous yet incentivized very strong and very captivating and very um i guess formative uh community members it's like i have you seen that anywhere else like you were involved in developing building communities before but is that something unique to crypto in your mind i i really think it is um and maybe it's also unique to like this time uh on the internet and and you know that people can really you know kind of uh create a persona um you know i think there's been communities you know i like irc you know things like that where you know people didn't necessarily identify with their uh you know their their real world uh persona um but i think the the kind of cut through and an amount of impact that someone can have on crypto twitter as an anonymous account uh is is much much more powerful than anywhere i've ever seen it kane can you compare and contrast what the community's energy was like before and after uh the introduction of the sip process and maybe maybe there wasn't any one formalized beginning of the sip process but i'm going to go ahead and guess that you know at some point there was this team-led protocol changes and then now it seems to be that there's this community-led protocol changes during that uh pivot between uh the the pre the team governance to the community governance how can you kind of compare and contrast the the community energy and you know self self actualization around um the the stewardship of the protocol i think the most uh the most tangible uh immediate thing that happened when we introduced uh sips was it forced the team at the time to be more transparent you know if it uh put a check on our power right like we weren't able to just arbitrarily do things we had to actually go through the process ourselves and it was something that i really strongly enforced um you know in the team right that we couldn't just pay lip service to this we were responsible for advocating for the positions and you know we would assign someone within the team to be the champion of that sip to go out to the community and and get it through and i think that that mindset then kind of you know uh went through the team and then you know kind of further out into the community where they all of a sudden again it wasn't just paying lip service to the society the idea of decentralized governance it was you know we were embodying it and we were you know actually you know forcing ourselves to participate in the process and you know if we got it wrong and the community said no then they said no and it happened multiple times you know were there things that before the sips we would have just done it and then told them afterwards and then all of a sudden we had to tell them ahead of time and they had the ability to say actually no you're not doing this we don't want it and maybe if you could take a moment and define sip and also uh where it came from which are the eips and then maybe also comment on how and and something like an sip uh would uh enable community engagement yeah so you know it's basically this idea of a formalized document that uh that you know allows people to see what a an improvement proposal is going to to do right so you know there's a structure about here's why we think we should do it here's exactly what's going to happen here's the intent behind it um and it puts you know uh it puts a lot of structure around any change to the protocol um so you know everyone can can feel engaged with it and one of the early ones that was rejected uh was this uh this proposal that i wrote um to allow uh people to migrate their escrowed uh snx tokens from one account to another so the issue was that you know we one of the unintended consequences of the the staking rewards being locked for a year was that if you started staking with multiple different accounts you could end up with this situation where you had to like maintain these accounts forever right and you know if you abandoned one of them you there was a huge opportunity cost so i proposed this idea of allowing people to consolidate their escrow uh tokens into a single account and people said no we don't like that idea we're worried that it's going to create like a secondary market for escrow tokens and you know all kinds of unintended consequences um you know and it was funny because that proposal that you know obviously there was idle invested interest in getting it over the line because you know i had a number of accounts that uh you know test accounts and things like that that i was maintaining and they basically said bad luck sorry you're not doing it and it still hasn't happened to this day so and just to define sip it stands for synthetic improvement proposal and so this comes out of you know eips which are ethereum improvement proposals which came out of uh bips or bips which are bitcoin improvement proposals so there's there's just this common uh you know something ip which is how generally protocols uh maker has the same thing where they have maker improvement proposals so this is a common theme throughout crypto so when when sips kind of just became a thing in the synthetics protocol and also in the synthetics discord how did that change the team's relationship with the community right so now all of a sudden the community realizes that it has it has new voice it has power it has a way to voice their wants and desires and then try and generate some sort of rough consensus about what the community wants and then they realize that they can get the team to change things in the ways that they want so how did this kind of change the team's relationship with uh it's your guys's community so are are the community is the community now steering the ship would you say or who steers this the synthetic ship i think the the biggest immediate impact that it uh that it had was to uh reduce this kind of uh voting block of the team right because now all of a sudden there were people uh you know who now core contributors right that that we have that are funded via the the synthetic style um but you know were were at that time funded by the synthetics foundation um it was this idea that you know oh there's the team and the team thinks this right and then there's a community in the community thinks this but actually what it what it did which was one of the most meaningful uh impacts i think was to kind of break that up and you would actually have people on the team who were like well i think this is a good idea and then other people who didn't and they would actually be in the community you know participating and kind of advocating for their uh view and it really had this impact of kind of flattening you know already we we didn't have much of a hierarchy but it allowed for you know someone in the team to disagree with me for example on a specific point and rally the community and get it over the line um rather than you know needing to kind of all of us agree and present the united front you know it really changed it to where all members of the community and even if we are funded by the foundation uh we still have a responsibility to you know participate in this governance process the same way that any other token holder does and because of the community being given a voice did you see more community members enter the community did you see that community grow after that i think what happened is as new people found out about the project and and kind of you know join the community they really felt this like powerful sense of there's something different going on here you know for people who've been in crypto for a long time you know communities uh sometimes very shallow right you know it's just a bunch of people that are holding the same bag right um but you know i think in in synthetics uh at that time and you know even today uh but you know very specifically at that time if you turned up in the discord you're like holy there's something going on here like people are very passionate about this and i think for you know people with the right mindset who genuinely you know wanted to kind of participate in in a protocol and and you know have an impact it was really attractive and and they often stay every protocol should go through a bear market right like that's where the community is in the trenches it's not in this bull market like you know 10x run-up stuff that's not where you build like the the the core folks it's those that stick with you during the bear yeah exactly exactly so next step in the story of the synthetic spartan like uh community growth um growth story was the ability to leverage uh snx as like this engagement tool where you know you would purchase snx and then you would stake snx to access the inflationary rewards and we were talking about this earlier when we uh were talking about how the the community kind of rallied up to say that kane's four-year happening uh model was stupid and there should be a more smooth uh smooth happening model and again this was this was a community getting a voice to rally for something that an advocate for something that they wanted in the in their protocol that they used but then the um the inflation rewards are it was a whole new a whole new thing and it started to create this feedback loop can you talk about how the inflation rewards impacted the growth of the community as well so yeah i think you know if you go back to 2016 2017 this idea of artificial scarcity right you know there's only x million or x thousand or x billion tokens right and therefore you know if people want to use them uh to pay for something you know in some system and there's only so many of them then the price will go up right which like looking back on it is just like idiocy like it's so obviously dumb right but we were all you know uh drinking the kool-aid and you know i think we we kind of thought this uh might play out right but the the thing that was missing was you know rewarding people for engagement right and i think that that you know what i when i kind of looked at why the engagement was low and and took a step back and and really you know took the longer view the thing that was obvious to me was you know back in the day if you were going to spend you know i think the first time i set up a bitcoin miner in like 2012 it took me like an entire weekend i spent like 48 hours didn't sleep like you know sitting on forums like reading different things going through you know hardware config issues etc until i get this bitcoin miner set up and the reason why i did it was a i was interested but b i wanted to mine bitcoin i thought it would be cool and if i could mine some bitcoin that would be amazing right um and i think that that was the thing that was missing from all of these artificial scarcity tokens right it was okay we're gonna send all the tokens out everyone's gonna hold the tokens and then we're going to ask them to do something but there was no way of the protocol actually rewarding them and so they changed the the monetary policy to add this inflationary component and reward people who were participating was the you know that was the thing that kind of kicked off this uh this cycle and really drove adoption engagement so it seems like the thing maybe we thought was the secret sauce of bitcoin or part of the secret sauce this artificial scarcity and viewing that token was less important than the other element of the secret sauce which was like uh community network participation right that's i feel like what you unlocked with snx absolutely and you know we've seen it now play out multiple times subsequently you know things like uh wi-fi and yam and you know where people are are doing something that the protocol wants and earning tokens uh from that and it's an incredibly powerful uh your driver behavior okay so the high level road map so far during the synthetics 2018 bear market is that you know the the communities kind of spun up it's pretty it's pretty thin like it's less than 300 but 300 spartans regardless uh and then uh the sip process gets integrated the community gets a voice and then uh there is in the inflation rewards that's built into that so from if you're on the inside what you are seeing is that the team is starting to listen to the community and the community is starting to like grow a spine grow a voice and then also what the community wants does end up actually end up getting built and then not only that but also you are able to get access upside upside exposure to the growth of synthetics through the inflation rewards meaning not not only is the team executing to the will of the community but also the community is getting engagement rewards right so you're able to stake snx and get inflation rewards and then we're also going to talk about the the farming rewards of uniswap and and uh s the uh s eth pair on unit swap uh but this is where we start to get this feedback loop where after these things happen and especially with these uh inflation rewards uh there starts to be the price increase of synthetics right and that's where i think synthetics first got on like a lot of people's radar when synthetics first broke a dollar and then i saw a dj spartan on twitter saying like synthetics going to six dollars and like my bear market pessimistic mentality is like no no way dude six dollars that's not happening uh and you know not too long ago synthetics was the token was at seven and a half dollars a couple months a couple weeks ago and so at the at this point we're starting to see this feedback loop where the price goes up and then more community it gets created because more people are getting people who are fundamentally interested in number go up right and so number goes up people go into the discord they get engaged with the community they've accessed the snx staking rewards and then and then price goes up further right and this is this to me this is the story of the synthetics bear market turning into a bull market and in my mind synthetics the synthetics platform along with ave and perhaps along with chain link 2 are the direct creators of this this bull market at large right and and perhaps even a little bit more credit to synthetics and maybe even you specifically came because you are the quote unquote father of modern agriculture because synthetics created the whole concept of yield farming right so can you talk about how uh the community was able to access further rewards snx denominated rewards through uh through both through staking but also through providing liquidity to uniswap and then maybe tie that into how that's linked into the to the farms that we see nowadays yeah so so you know all of the things that you described there the the elements that i think are necessary but not sufficient right like strong community you know the uh the you know this uh inflationary reward feedback loop etc but i think it was it was still really critical that there was some belief that we're building something that was going to be useful right you know if if we hadn't have had uh this idea that you know we're building um this derivatives platform you know after we've pivoted away from the the payment network and you know like it's funny because we've now come back to the point where susd is becoming quite useful and people are using it and it's it's you know it's gaining traction but you know we've we've thrown out the idea of uh transfer fees and transaction fees etc and now gone to this uh this exchange fee but i think we needed to have that core uh belief that we were building a protocol that was going to have utility right and you know that that was really important to uh to kind of get people as they came into the community uh to kind of you know to engage i think if there had been nothing there except for these feedback loops it would have uh it would have kind of petered out but once we realized that you know we had this uh this kind of snx you know we had this inflation that we could direct at anything right so we could direct it at you know our own protocol but we could actually direct it at other things that were somewhat ancillary to you know to the protocol that we also needed like liquid on reps and and what was really interesting is uh you know we went through multiple iterations different people proposing things g was one of them um and your author and i actually were on the other side as as often happens you know i was on the downside of the table um and uh and you know we're like oh i don't know if it's a great idea you know there was still like i still have a bit of bitcoin maxi in me right where i'm like oh i don't really like the idea of changing the monetary policy i feel like we should be careful about that etcetera and you know uh it's taken a while to kind of beat that out of me but i think the market finally has um but you know we we got to this point where we're like we need a liquid on ramp um we have uni swap now uni swap is amazing um you know and we were one of the early projects that i think really saw the utility in uni swap um and we said okay let's try it you know we finally got to a point where the community was comfortable with like okay let's take an eth eighth pair right where there's no impermanent loss um you know let's let's direct some inflation at it and you know we went uh from nothing to you know one point i think the equivalent of like eighty-five thousand eighth uh in unison right which was incredible for uni swap incredible for us people were looking at going like what is happening here you know what's like how is this even you know this was pre the the total value locked you know crazy metrics that we're we're seeing these days you know the idea that you could lock up 85 000 eve uh you know over the course of like a month was pretty insane and and no one predicted i was just personally i was just surprised all this stuff worked like it was like wow it's working yeah yeah absolutely absolutely it was it was very it was eye-opening i think for a lot of people you know we've had this belief that you could get behavior to kind of happen um and you know previously it was only sort of happening internally in this this kind of self-referential feedback loop as as you sort of said but all of a sudden we're like this is real there's you know 45 000 eth in there and 45 000 uh synthetic like this is a real thing like heath is money this is real like people are putting real value into uni swap and you know into this liquid on ramp to get access to snx and and you get access to this reward um which i think you know that was really kind of the the uh you know the crossing the chasm moment where people were like okay this this works and so to me the last cherry on top for like this bull market story and how synthetics fits into uh into ethereum is but in the integration with unit swap is is hugely important because everyone loves unit swap right but you guys also started to leverage chain link right and chain link has its own extremely robust community as well and you guys really really needed a solution like chain link to exist in order to produce all your synthetic assets and so now like the uh from what i'm guessing i was i was not in the chain link community in the in the bear market nor was i in the synthetics community in the bear market but i'm going to go ahead and guess that when the integration between synthetics and chain link you know was announced and then was actually manifested that there was some sort of melding of the communities right and so not only are protocols on ethereum composable but their communities are also composable as well so can you was there any sort of um signal as a result of the integration between the the protocols between the two communities i think so and and you know for the chain-link community uh it was a very similar situation to the synthetics community right there was a lot of belief they you know they believed in the value prop of what chain link was building uh you know they believed in in the approach that was being taken and they they believed in the utility that it would bring to the ecosystem right but belief is you know only gets you so far right they needed it to actually manifest in you know someone putting their hand up and saying yes we want to consume this protocol you know this is something that we really see is beneficial and i think synthetics was uh probably the first uh you know protocol to really kind of go all in and say like we're going you know we're doing chain link this is it we're gonna you know deprecate our uh our external you know sorry our internal article and move to this external article um and i think that that was you know huge validation for the community right the chain-link community that like this thing that they'd been saying was going to happen all of a sudden you know this was the first example of it and then you know you had a bunch of other uh other your projects then you know kind of uh come along but i'm pretty confident that we were one of the first to sort of go out there and say this is the right solution we've vetted everything you know we're really happy with not just the the solution as it stood then but our confidence in chainman's ability to you know augment and improve the solution over time to get it to a point where we really you know thought it was going to be a long-term uh solution for for synthetics so okay so now here's where we are all right it's in 2020 yield farming is is now a thing uh thanks to the creation of agriculture so thank you kane uh we the synthetics community is is a community that you know other protocols would die for uh the synthetics protocol is also integrated into other protocols like chain link like unit swap uh and then like and and more maybe more passively into protocols like yam and sushi and so it's getting its own integrations kind of organically uh and and the the sip process is alive and well and and things are good and from at least from my perspective of synthetics so where are we going next kane what's next for synthetics what's next on the road map so you know there's there's still kind of three uh broad pillars right that are not quite there um you know we're we're seeing a decent volume uh decent exchange volume but you know we can it can grow much further right um you know we've seen uh uni swap curve uh you know a lot of these amms generating incredible volumes you know volumes that are outside what i think a lot of us believe could happen this year right and so i think that you know that's something that we just need to to nail and we're working on a number of things to make that happen um but then we've also got this other issue of you know supply constraints right so um we need to get enough supply out there which is uh which is ensuring that you know we've got a collateral um that you know it's robust and and people can you know lock each and issue susd and then the final component is you know gas costs and and latency and you know throughput like we need to get onto uh l2 um we need a scalability solution and so we're working with the optimism team uh and you know that's that's moving along really well and i think we're we're kind of getting to a point where um you know that's that's going to be something that uh is is going to be the the next kind of big phase shift for the the project and you get us to be able to scale up to you know tens of thousands of you okay so we've got three things we've got volume supply and gas cost can we talk about each of those so on the volume side of things you guys today just announced uh synthetics volume program uh is that important can you tell us about that again it is and you know the reason the reason why it's important and we wanted to kind of help to bootstrap uh this process is that you know synthetics is a protocol and at the moment you know it's fully vertically integrated and you know we have to build the protocol itself you know we have to uh build you know all of the components all the way through to the dap player right but eventually we want to get to a point where you know we believe that there are people out there who can build much better dapps um better wallets better integrations and can just consume the protocol uh and abstract away all the complexity for their users right and so this is our way of kind of starting that process and bootstrapping it by essentially uh you know funding uh this this rebate for people who directly integrate synthetics because we believe that you know it'll be a net positive for their users uh over time but we need to kind of kick start that and so you know this is a big deal it's something we've been planning for probably about six months um and you know it's something that we think uh we can get you know maybe 10 or 15 different integrators to you know jump onto in the next couple months during the trial all right so that sounds huge and on the supply question i guess you mentioned eath collateral so last i had uh looked at that there was kind of a an initial amount a capped amount of eth collateral that uh was going to be lit in the critical maybe already has been can you give us an update on the status of each collateral so there's some in there now is that correct and then how are you looking to expand that there is the the limiting factor though is is less the supply cap right now and more the fact that you can only borrow synthetic against your eighth right so what it effectively uh means is that you know someone who wants to uh lock each and be able to you know do yield farming or trade or whatever uh kind of has to short each um which is obviously not ideal um so the next the next phase which is hopefully you know three or four weeks away is the ability like you can in maker to lock eth and borrow susd the same way that you can lock even borrow die um and so that will significantly expand the supply of susp and will there be a cap on that the amount of e3 there will be initially yeah i would probably be about five thousand eight um i think initially but you know like maker we'll increase the debt ceiling and allow that to kind of grow over time as we get confidence that you know liquidations are working and everything's working smoothly okay so that's going to be for susd right so susd is almost would you would you say it's like a die alternative and like one thing that i think the the bankless space has been really clamoring for is a very bankless stablecoin the most decentralized stable coins there's tons of stable coins in the space right now very few of them are decentralized maybe die can you kind of hold that title although it's starting to incorporate some more centralized assets as well what's the vision for susd so far what's uh kind of governance thinking is it going to be a more decentralized alternative potentially um but you know i think that what people are demanding in the market is a kind of low governance low complexity uh eat back stablecoin and i think we will see that i think people will will build that the the big question right is not you know will they build it but can you actually bootstrap it right and so you know the thing that uh that i think maker did incredibly well um was uh you know to to kind of bootstrap this initial liquidity right and i've said this on twitter that it's incredibly hard to do that i think people you know massively under underestimate the amount of effort and you know belief that was required to kind of bootstrap the the initial diet supply and so you know i do think that we uh you know we will be an alternative stable coin but there is a lot of complexity in the synthetics uh ecosystem that you know maybe won't satisfy everyone they might want something that's a little uh a little simpler and less complex so what is the incentive for someone to deposit eth to mint some susd then uh well arbitrage profit for one you know so if we're trading above the peg being able to you know sell uh and and capture that premium um is the first thing the second thing is you know susd is used in a lot of yield farming uh systems you know you can go and deposit it into curve to farm curve balancer etc and oftentimes the yield that's paid on susd is much higher than on heath so it kind of makes sense to lock your wreath up get susd and use that rather than just depositing your youth directly but access to ether for all as collateral just on the supply topics and more you know we've written pieces on bank list about this concept of economic bandwidth right where um you know the the chain ethereum in particular needs to have assets that are highly valuable and highly liquid in order to provide bandwidth for the entire d5 financial system that's built on top um the the thesis and bank list is that like synthetics has a limited amount of economic bandwidth right right now so let's say the market cap of snx is 500 million that means you can create like you know some um proportion of 500 million in in synthetics on top but once you start introducing other economic bandwidth sources like potentially eth then you can start to create a lot more supply is that does that theory resonate with you is that kind of a an important aspect when you think about supply when you think about collateral just collecting all of this all these economic bandwidth sources from ethereum it is um you know one thing though that i think uh is really critical that you know we've we've kind of as a community uh sort of you know leaned into is this idea that we only want to use permissionless collateral right we don't want to go down the the path of using you know uh centralized stable points et cetera as collateral um so you know being able to expand the the supply of susd uh on you know on the back of uh and maybe potentially you know with some tokenized uh btc representations that are permissionless which you know we still need to kind of let them uh play out a little bit i think before we'll get comfortable enough to use that but um you know the the ability to uh expand the susd supply which is now you know sitting at around 100 million which is kind of crazy right like i'm sure you guys remember when dai hit 100 million it was this huge deal right and you know susd just quietly hit 100 million uh you know a month or so ago and it was wow i didn't even know that yeah it was just like it was not tracking yes like we didn't even notice it right like it was just like one day we're like we're like oh wow yeah it's 100 million right like it's just you know the way that the market's gone uh but the ability to expand susd out to like 500 million or a billion just requires uh eighth right like that's it's just critical to the functioning of the system so it's always been something that we've we've considered um and it was just about trying to find the right way to do it without undermining and this is really critical without undermining the utility of snx within the system you know snx is still the backstop of the system it's still the uh the thing that you know accrues all the fees um so you know there needs to be the right incentives for people to to use as collateral but not undermine the incentives to use snx and a quick definition for our listener so when you say permissioned assets you specifically mentioned eth and you you mentioned possibly some future version of a tokenized bitcoin but apart from that are there other permissioned assets on ethereum and like why isn't something like usdc the stablecoin not a permissionless asset i mean you've got essentially a custodian that's managing uh the the funds right that's managing the fiat that's in a bank account somewhere um and then you know issuing essentially an iru against it right so you know that's that's a very different uh type of asset to something like eth right so um you know i think maybe we could consider uh you know like maker using tokens on ethereum um but even that uh is you know is it brings its own issues right so i think for the time being uh you know it will be and then maybe adding uh you know some some tokenized btc um but to get the the next step of adding you know erc20 tokens as collateral i think would be a stretch for the community but we'll see so when you say uh that you'll be able to mint susd via your eth we listeners and correct me if i'm wrong but listeners should also just be hearing that because you can just swap susd for any other synthetic asset that you'll be able to maximally leverage your ether deposits to create any sort of synthetic asset it just starts with susd first right susd is like the default it's like the water and it's the it's the substrate for going into any other synthetic asset so you know maybe susd isn't really interesting to people because you know dollars aren't interesting to us because we're in crypto but it's just like it's the substrate token to get into every other synthetic asset right that's this is all true absolutely and you know you can go s usd into sd5 for example which is you know basket of all the different uh d5 tokens on ethereum so you know there's there's a number that you can go into gold for example right so if you want to um you know lock your wreath and and get some exposure to gold but i think for for most people uh who just want this price exposure um probably the safest thing is you know take some of your stable coins for example and just buy susd and then convert it rather than necessarily locking you know ether and uh buying gold but you know we'll see it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out and how much demand there is for people to add supply and and just participate that way or if they actually genuinely want to lock even and start trading yeah as we've said before i mean i think ethan's economic bandwidth trustless economic bandwidth or permissionless is the word you used is is definitely a bull case uh and a uh you know tailwind for eth price uh but we will see how that pans out and look forward to you guys doing more with it and adding more with it so we talked volume we talked supply the third area which i think is uh really interesting is gas cost optimization right so we've been living in a gas price are down as we talk as we as we're recording this but yeah i mean they could be back up to 400 next week who knows um in one of our conversations kane you had talked about the uh the work that you're doing on roll ups with ovm and with the optimism team is like we had we talked about well kind of the main chain is like manhattan right and this ovm solution roll-up solution as a a layer 2 chain that you're building is is almost like a brooklyn right where it's going to have more space the real estate is going to be a little bit cheaper and it's going to have more room for low-cost transactions essentially so i'm i'm curious to hear your progress on on that and how are you planning to make brooklyn a place that other protocols want to live and users want to come to so funnily enough uh we i think we've gone a little bit over uh time which is totally fine but um i'm i was supposed to be on a call with the optimism team uh which i i told them a few minutes ago that i wouldn't be able to make that wow that's a little bit funnier yeah yeah yeah i know no no that's okay it's totally fine yeah we'll message them and apologize yeah we have a weekly catch-up uh that we do um that was like right after this but um you know obviously we're having a good time uh here so i just told them uh i'll catch up with them later um but you know tell them you'll show them on the pod exactly right so i i typically do uh and so so you know i think the heavy lifting of this is obviously on the optimism team right you know they're the ones who are building the solution um you know we are we're kind of advocates for that solution and and that specific uh you know uh chain for a couple of reasons one um you know they're building something that is going to be uh sort of you know optimized for getting people onto it as as easily as possible and so you know with the most minimal changes to contracts and you know ideally they'll just be able to deploy their existing mainnet contracts straight on to onto l2 and that's important for composability because if we want uh you know all of the fun that we're having now to continue you know in an l2 environment we need those contracts to all be running on the same you know uh optimistic roll-up and so you know they're they're working with a number of teams but you know one of my uh you know main main jobs at the moment is like going out and talking to other projects and kind of you know advocating for them uh coming along and and you're participating in this uh this optimistic roll-up uh chain that you know the the ovm supports and so um you know that's that's something that is coming really soon and i think is going to be a huge uh bonus particularly for smaller uh snx takers so you know we've got this very problematic issue right now which is that gas costs are so high uh and you know the the transaction complexity on synthetics is so high that people are priced out you know they actually can't even participate unless they've got you know a couple thousand snx for example um you know which is maybe ten thousand dollars so there's a whole range of people that you know are just unable to participate in in the um system right now which is really problematic so this uh this first phase of the the ovm migration is going to directly address that and really be targeting the people who've been kind of left out uh you know for the last month or so with these high gas prices and trying to you know uh make it a little bit easier for them to participate and you know reduce some of the the costs that they've been experiencing we were talking with stani in the previous episode and he he said that if somebody builds a great brookland you know ave will be like first to try to get in there um have you been coordinating with any of the other d5 protocols uh toward this or is it mainly a synthetics initiative uh no no i've definitely been you know i'd speak to stanley a couple times a week um you know so i've i've been advocating uh for this you know with most of the d5 uh projects out there that you know that we've talked to um and obviously you know the optimism team are working on that as well but it's one thing for you know the project itself to say hey come and you know play in this you know this place that we built it's another thing for you know a project uh to say hey like we've done our dd we're really comfortable this is the right approach and we're going all in on it um so i think that that that carries a lot of weight uh and so i'm i'm very hopeful that you know we'll be able to have uh some of the the critical money legos uh you know over on this optimistic uh roll-up shard very very quickly very cool uh very quickly any timeline on that just curious i mean look at you know the options in the team have said uh mainnet by the end of the year uh i think we'll have some interesting uh progress even before that um you know specific synthetic progress to you know as i said alleviate some of the the gas uh price issues um so you know it's going to be a phased approach but we're working really hard to try and get this done asap to to get you know kind of pseudomet uh stood up to to kind of help with the gas costs for stakers well well well that sounds fantastic i'm really looking forward to that lower gas prices um one other topic i guess on road map is how the whole synthetic space is shaping up so there's this idea that a decentralized bitmex might might come about and synthetics is certainly part of that story but there are some other protocols as well that have maybe some different uh trade-offs so of course there's maker which is you know produces dye which is a synthetic in itself but then more recently there are protocols like the uma protocol and there's of course dydx it takes a more order book based approach and then there's newer protocols like the perpetual protocol just curious high level what are synthetics's advantages uh or maybe some of the trade-offs relative to those other uh initiatives so i think the the main trade-off with something like uma is that uh you know we don't have the ability to uh issue the exotic uh assets that they do right um you know because they have uh this kind of priceless oracle approach they don't rely on a liquid market externally to pull a price feed in from so you know they can do they can do all kinds of weird exotic instruments which i think is really cool but the flip side of that is that you know each of those instruments or or your assets needs to bootstrap its own liquidity um you know as as we've kind of seen with their early experimentation uh that can be somewhat challenging sometimes so um you know getting liquidity in this environment right now is really really hard right like you know if whatever liquidity premium you've been able to kind of accrue uh is a huge advantage and you know obviously we've seen things like you know the vampire mining from sushi to uni swap which is which is a whole other topic that uh you know we could spend a long time talking about but um you know liquidity modes are still uh i think a big deal um and so you know for us uh the fact that we've got you know 100 million dollars worth of susd and i think you know 130 million in since uh is a big advantage that we've got do you think like uh designs like dydx also suffer from that like lack of um or the the liquidity challenge as well that essentially when you're doing something in synthetics you already have this nice pool of collateral you kind of bet against the house right and that's uh that can be advantageous for liquidity absolutely you know it it definitely creates uh it creates you know a lot of a lot of advantages and one of the things that it will enable um which we've talked about a little bit is this idea of tokenized bridges between pools like curve right so you know curve uh is this amm that is really amazing at allowing you to convert different assets that track the same price so you know usdc usdt die susd et cetera and then you know tokenized bitcoin um and you know tokenized gold but it requires that you know all of those assets uh attract the same price within the same pool and it's hard to bridge the liquidity across but what synthetics is potentially going to be able to to do is be the bridge between two different curve pools so you can imagine a curveball that had you know even essie and then a curveball that had you know sbtc tbtc ran btc and rap btc you'd be able to go east into rap btc via this uh tokenized bridge in these curve pools and you know i'm very confident in the next couple of months we'll see you know e to to wrap btc transactions in the you know millions of dollars on chain kane i want to turn the conversation to regulatory compliance uh because you know we kind of there's always kind of this uh this monster in the back of crypto where with it which is like the nation state right this thing that is inherently generally it has an adversarial stance to probably some of the shenanigans that's going on in this space uh and so how does how do you guys as you know the centralized synthetics team think about compliance uh and like what would happen if some regulatory three-letter agency came in and said like all right you guys need to implement like kyc if that happened what would be the next steps for the the synthetics team so i think this is this is kind of a critical point it's maybe you know the the other pillar that uh that we didn't talk about it you know amongst those three which is just generally decentralization and and decentralized governance and getting to a point where you know the protocol is sufficiently decentralized that a regulator would look at it and say well this is something that you know we can't actually capture we can't shut down um you know it's similar to you know where i think you know the ethereum uh protocol got to right you know where the fcc said well it's sufficiently decentralized that you know we don't believe it's a security we don't believe that it's within you know our kind of uh purview to regulate this thing uh maybe it's someone else's but you know we're not going to step in and i think that that was uh you know a very calculated decision on the basis that you couldn't really regulate ethereum right it was genuinely uh sufficiently decentralized you know you couldn't just go and round up vitalik and ask him to you know turn off the masternode right that wasn't a thing um and so you know i think that i think that uh we are getting to a point now where for example you know if you said to me shut it down i actually can't you know like i don't have any power that would allow me to uh to shut down the protocol you know the articles are now decentralized um you know governance is decentralized we've got three different dowels that control protocol upgrades and distribution of funds etc um and you know there's no single party within uh within the protocol that has a level of control that could actually stop it and i think that that's something that's only really happened in the last you know three months where we've gone to that point so i want to drive this home for listeners because i think there's a lot of people that haven't uh totally appreciated how bullish specifically synthetics it is for synthetics to be completely decentralized and and how bullish it is for the rest of d5 right because coming coming out of realty and what is what is going to be coming out of realty is the realty asset which is uh an aggregate token that has the value of all the real estate of the realty platform like underlying the asset including the rental income right it's it's it's all of realty tokenized into a single token and that token is unfortunately going to be whitelisted because that's how security tokens work like realty is an american company and therefore it answers to the sec and and no one in realty has any interest in you know going against the the regulations of the sec however what can happen when this asset is created is that synthetics can just make a synthetic realty asset which is then therefore completely permissionless and then has all the robustness of the decentralization of synthetics right and so any sort of token that comes to ethereum that is ky seed and permissioned can have its decentralized permission list counterpart on synthetics kane have you thought about this this potential world we have and and you know obviously there's lots of discussions around uh you know which assets we should support and you know ensuring that there's enough liquidity for them etc uh and and so i think you know the only constraint for us is really liquidity in the the sort of primary market but the asset trades right um but you know it's interesting to think about uh assets that are also on ethereum uh for which you know we can we can kind of directly pull a price fee right that there's already an existing price feed um and so something like uh you know realty i think is a good candidate to create like a permissionless version a little bit how you know people have made like wrapped nexus mutual to avoid the the kyc and allow to be sort of you know openly tradable um so i think that that's something that is going to emerge over time where you know you see these uh permissionless variants of security tokens and various things but then you know the same thing goes for like synthetic tesla right you know synthetic tesla share uh that you know is is totally open and permissionless and you know can be purchased by anyone anywhere in the world as long as they've got you know in internet connection so we we talked about um playbooks for capital formation really quick uh kane as we as we start to wrap up here you mentioned the overton window has expanded which means there's basically more possibilities for crypto native d5 native founders to essentially raise capital and you put out this excellent tweet thread that we can link to in the show notes that sort of talks about some of those things um are you starting to see that manifest now or like what advice i guess would you give a crypto native d5 protocol founder like yourself on just capital formation yeah you know one of the nice things about uh getting you know out of crypto winter and maybe crypto spring or you know whatever maybe starting to kind of head into a bull market is that uh the the ability to raise capital and the power kind of shifts uh into the back into the hands of founders right you know we've gone from a situation where you know six months ago 12 months ago it was almost impossible to raise capital to a situation now where uh you know founders and project teams can dictate uh you know terms which is good um it's good in the sense that you know it allows for people to do the things they want to do rather than being forced into you know specific things and so i think the ability to you know raise money directly into a dow uh which was probably going to be almost impossible you know six months ago is now very possible we're seeing a lot of that and so you know the ability to to avoid the need for a foundation and you're having all of this infrastructure around a project uh is is good the flip side of that is it means you know less uh sort of protections for uh you know investors and participants and protocols which is going to lead to you know losses and scams and things like that um but i think you know it's a it's a double-edged sword and so you know you'll see uh protocols that will do the right thing and and projects that will do the right thing and be far far better for it for being able to kind of dictate terms and launch in the way that they want to um and then you know you'll see some some losses and inefficiency on the other side of it all right so uh crypto native founders going crypto native in capital formation is uh sounds like that's the way to go um all right so just because it's fun just because we're in a bull market just a final question for you kane price predictions my friend so eth price end of this year so december 2020 what do you say and then in three years what do you say and how about the same for total locked value in d5 so i think that there's a very decent chance that uh eve will be back over a thousand by the end of the year um you know depending on on the macro uh conditions that we're in um in three years time hard to say uh you know that's that's probably too far out for me to even uh you know try and make a prediction uh just because the way cryptocycles work um but you know i certainly hope that we'll get to a point where you know if if 2.0 is launched uh the price will be you know far higher than it is today in three years um and then you know total value locked it wouldn't surprise me at all uh you know over the next 12 months to see you know 50 billion in in total value locked or more there you go that is bullish and uh kane it's been a pleasure when we talked about particularly the synthetics roadmap the future volume supply uh gas costs and increasing decentralization uh that that's a very bullish road map sir and uh the bankless nation is is looking to you guys and the synthetics governance to pull it off very excited about all of that kane thanks for joining us today thanks yeah it was uh it was a lot of fun really appreciate it awesome all right bankless nation uh some action items for you guys we have included a link to the new volume incentive program that we mentioned on the show also a link to kane's thread that we mentioned you should also get involved in synthetics governance there's a link to that as well getting getting involved in these protocols is the way you learn about them that's the bankless way for sure we also have included a tactic from bankless on how to use synthetics so if you're just warming up to it if it's just your first time you can check that out as well finally we are looking for your five-star reviews on apple itunes david we're at 154 so we want to get to 200 we want to get to 300 we want to get to 500. we need to we want to override we need to break ether price right this is how it works right we are going to get the bankless podcast to the top of the itunes chart as this as this bull market continues and we need your help to do so right we are now in the top 100 of the itunes investing and finance uh categories for podcasts and i'd totally think that in one two years we're going to be in the top ten uh but we need your help to get there so if you could go to wherever you listen to your podcast and give us those five-star reviews so we can spread the bankless nation across the world we would really appreciate it all right let's do it guys risks and disclaimers eth is risky so is snx crypto is risky in general so is defy you could lose what you put in so be careful out there but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
