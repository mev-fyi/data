you just said this could kill the need for cookies there's some Nuance to it but yes we wouldn't need cookies in this model if you've ever been to an EU website and you know it says allow all cookies or just the ones we need well just the ones we need are typically used to maintain sessions so when you revisit the website you're still logged in I'm saying it's possible to shift to a system where you just show up with your keys again and you can sprinkle a little power into a session key and that can improve who you are with any of your interactions without them having to remember you every time you just sign and Bam it works kind of like sending a transaction to ethereum
