there's something very serious brewing up there and it's coming from you know from the youth bottom up it's not like the el salvador case where you know el salvador got lucky enough to have a millennial president sadly he's kind of a maximalist but he's pushing bitcoin through everyone's throats top down in argentina is bottom up adoption and with vitalik we have been able to meet with an ex-president with a potential future president uh with the government uh with a you know left-wing activist everyone left aside their differences that's the power that vitalik had i don't think many people in the world can unite argentines uh like vitalik did and it's because everyone is realizing that there's this thing happening with the new generations that is very wild very well and that gives me hope you know
