foreign [Music] ation how you doing this episode oh man this is unlike an episode that I think I've done on the green pill pod before this episode is an interview with Travis whitech who is a regular contributor to raid Guild and molok Dao that I've been working with about creating media about solar Punk and pluralist values solving coordination failures within the context of a scoped engagement between some of the uh projects I've been working on in raid Guild and that has come together into what we are calling the pluriverse guide so you can get it at pluriverse.wtf basically the Genesis of this guide is that gitcoin's mission is to build in fund digital public goods and part of that mission is to build a quadratic funding protocol that supports ecosystem public goods now I'm of course no longer involved at git coin but uh my Genesis of working with Travis was during this time at git coin part of that mission in addition to the protocol was to create social shelling points for people people to talk about public goods solar pump coordination Game Theory crypto economics exchange stories and ideas and designs on top of these things so basically you've got protocol level Innovation Technology Innovation and social Innovation that's happening and from 2020 to 2022 gitcoin facilitated in the funding of thousands of Grants and members of get coin dial also published four different comic books three books three regen conferences and wrote countless [ __ ] posts all about solving coordination failures and I've been working with Travis of consolidating a lot of these provocations at the social layer and a lot of these learnings into the pluriverse guide so basically Travis is a philosopher in this episode we go deep on the idea of a plural verse which as opposed to the the universe is one physical world as opposed to the metaverse which is Neil Stevenson's dystopian digital world that's overlaid on the physical world and then later zucks metaverse which is kind kind of his dystopian Digital World overlaid on the physical world as opposed to practical pluralism which is the idea of creating anti-fragility celebration of diversity at the base layer of web3 and ethereum uh plural the pluralism guide talks about creating a world in which many worlds can Thrive radical Independence autonomy and envisioning of these worlds talking about our values talking about the trade-offs and at the base layer baking in a respect for a pluralism of these things so basically the plural verse guide is available at pluriverse.wtf you basically read the guide you join a telegram group and then you get a brain dump of all of the smartest people in the space who are envisioning the philosophy and the social and the ethics and the code of what the plural verse would look like if we defined it from a reb3 perspective not a Zuckerberg metaverse perspective that's employed top down by Facebook and meta's shareholders but a plural verse that from the bottoms up is generated by the web3 community and that's what the fleuriverse guide is get is to provoke and so Travis is just a really special human he's so [ __ ] smart I have like so many browser tabs open because I just talked to him I'm Googling all of these definitions as I'm doing it and I really enjoyed this episode it's like rich chocolate cake but intellectually and I am just so excited to talk about the pluriverse guide with Travis whitech on this episode of the green pill so without further Ado I'll give you Travis whitech and the pluriverse guide the Opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto Community with web3 support and a non-custodial wallet Opera lets you access defy apps quickly and easily the Opera wallet has buy sell and swap features and of course lets you view your beautiful nfts but the browser still lets you use any crypto wallet extension you prefer giving you the choice and flexibility for the webtoon world Opera lets you view and manage all of your assets across all the blockchains all at once and offer seamless multi-chain support between ethereum Bitcoin polygon binding exchange and other EVMS and layer twos but Opera goes even deeper than that Opera has a built-in homepage for crypto natives with the Opera crypto corner with price charts news feeds nft updates to make sure you are always on top of your game and it even has Discord and telegram integrated natively into the browser that's crazy Opera is truly building the battle station for the crypto World check out Opera both on mobile with Android and iOS apps and on desktop too refi summer has arrived and cello is here for it celo is the layer 1 blockchain for the regenerative Finance movement it's fast Planet positive and built for the real world

Travis hi Kevin um so we are here to talk about the Polaris guide which is something that you and I have been working on for the last nine months or so but I'm curious before we get into that if you could tell me a little bit about you and your backgrounds yeah sure um I'm an artist I studied painting I'm also a philosopher and was pursuing a PhD in Aesthetics before uh dropping out due to pandemic conditions and jumping deep into crypto um mostly as a ux researcher of the expanded field as I like to say I'm interested in ontological design consider myself a little bit of an ontological anarchist yeah Hollow biont aspiring symbiont inhabitant of Tara just another uh citizen learning how to live well in a Dying World I I uh uh I I know some of these words and I want to dive deep on on that in order to do that we have to introduce the pluriverse guide that we've been working on for the last year or so so we'd love to hear your side of the Genesis of the plural verse guide and uh what we've been working on there yeah sure I'd love to hear your take on it as well um so you first approached me through raid Guild back in uh October November or something like that to um make the third version of a comic series which you had already started and the comics were generally motivated to spread the meme of um of git coin and a regenerative stack and a good versus evil kind of battle between maluk which is a meme that everyone is familiar with and some new characters that um you and your comic team at the time had introduced which was eastbot right this kind of um Transformer like uh Metatron type character composed of all of these regenerative uh stack Legos and um Anon who is the central protagonist who represents the kind of anonymous autonomous self-sovereign community of crypto and um it takes place within yeah a kind of Dying World that um although the meta crisis idea that you're exploring with schmachtenberger is more recent it really kind of visualizes um some catastrophes some coordination failures right like the um the multipolar traps that the world is currently suffering from and provides a kind of a utopian well let's definitely a solar Punk vision of an alternative the quadratic lands specifically is um the epitome of human beings being able to successfully coordinate beyond that right so I came in Via raid Guild and started working on Comics three and now we're finishing comic number four and um I built upon the foundation that you laid down and I my goal was really just to complicate it as much as possible so I tried to make the The Narrative structure more rich I introduced a bunch of characters that are quasi-human they're like humanoid but there's like the we tried to blow it out um into multiple worlds multiple dimensions and um yeah we were responding to some you know to bring it towards the pluriverse guide now we were responding to some memes in the air um everyone's been talking about the metaverse and you introduced this meme of the green pill at East Denver which is when comic number three was first um released to the public and so um the pluriverse guide was a kind of auxiliary or or you know supplementary supplemental project along the comics to try to capture the lore that we were actively crafting in relation to those ideas so not zuck's menavers of a kind of like you know centralized top-down Flex of a power structure uh where basically it's a simulation simulacra of um a hyper capitalist world where everything is pay to play but a pluriverse which explores the plurality and diversity of of perspectives of um a kind of get coin vision um things of that nature yeah so I mean I think that it's been really fun exploring these ideas with you especially since I just think that you're really good at complexing out some of the world that has evolved out of the solar Punk conversations and the get coin lore conversations over the years so yeah I was engaging you I'm no longer involved in get coin Dao uh no longer leaving anything there but at the time was involved in get coined out in this work stream called the moonshot collective which was the rapid prototyping work stream and basically what we wanted to do was we wanted to take the ideas of coordination of game theory of multi-polar traps which are basically the coordination failures the biggest coordination failures in the world are climate change and uh the lack of information that you can trust and um basically these are all coordination failures for Humanity and they all have these deep systemic roots in Game Theory and we wanted to make that game theory more approachable to Everyday People people and so we uh when at the time I came to you we had done two comics about basically this giant coordination Megazord the e-spot coming together and fighting molok the god of coordination failure and making it kind of a I wouldn't say a Marvel Cinematic Universe style thing but definitely like on that Arc of superhero versus super villain and when I met you you were like oh there's something here but it's way more surface level and I really want to deepen the story and the lore and so we produced this third comic which was just way more Rich story in world than the first two Comics that we built together and and basically the the idea was over time as as more and more comics came out about the these Concepts we started to abstract away the central tenets of each individual comic and into a pluriverse guide which would allow anyone to create their own comic or their own music or their own transmedia art that tells the story of solar Punk values of the pluriverse of coordination and this guide that we're dropping on uh at em con next week on September 7th is is is available at pluriverse.wtf it's the pluriverse guide and it's basically the guide for anyone who wants to create any media within this franchise so that's that's I think my retelling of of what you just said I'm curious if you have anything to add there yeah I can build upon that infinitely um but yeah for simplicity's sake I would say there's two main tangents that we've been exploring um one is to uh actively be expanding the Fidelity or the resolution of the lore um which includes yeah some of these elements that I've already mentioned so like the meme of Malik as the god of coordination failure and um as the you know embodiment of the representation of this cosmological Force which is somehow inside of the human imagination but is separate from it and you know all of that as well as to get more granular about eastbot and the regenerative stack and the technology that we are building for it's more than just an optimization scheme or some kind of efficiency algorithm but it represents a kind of regenerative Network that will facilitate you know this integral kind of um these Integrations into urbanity to come and uh you know Anon I think is one of my favorite um characters or motifs or like inflection points to play with because Anon is is like defies defies that characterization by the very nature that they are um Anonymous but then we also have this character who's physically represented in the book and it's just this wonderful opportunity to explore identity you know from from like lgbtqia plus type you know modalities or fluidities of identity as well as considerations of privacy and self-sovereignty and autonomy and anonymity and all the rest like these kind of fluid positionings or povs that that the crypto Community specifically the ethereum crypto Community is leveraged upon right and so that comes down to like solar punk as an optimistic Bright Future Vision which you know many of these days are um putting into Contra distinction with lunar Punk which might be a more you could you could briefly describe that as a more privacy focused um like dark Cipher type orientation it's more than just you know Aesthetics there's um profound political ideological positioning I think underlying those two um as it pertains to the plural verse one of my main goals has been to complicate as much as possible this binary reductivism down to just two that you're either Anonymous or not that it's solar or it's lunar that it's a Utopia or it's a dystopia um and that the quadratic lands is really this opportunity for us to collectively think together um about the future and whether that's you know no matter who you are um within this space whether you identify as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist or like anything in between um I think the quadratic lands is this invitation and that's a key that's a key word right like the pluriverse guide is an invitation and all of the content within it is an invitation for us to think together to dream together to to manifest quite literally together um and so that's the second part about the plural reverse guide um that's worth noting which is since the beginning or at least since I've come into these conversations with you I've been kind of um provoking us to think about how to decentralize the project more like how do we get this this whole conversation to not be about Kevin and your memes evangelizing to a community or even Kevin and Travis talking about um how to evolve the meme of Malik and all the rest but how do we actually use Dao mechanics and tooling and all of these incredible regenerative um D5 refi Legos to invite um a community in and in in the spirit of Open Source to um distribute Collective ownership over the IP and to provide a real horizontal open uh portal an interface for the community to take the memes into their own hands yeah yeah I mean I think that that's one of the real big opportunities that I see here and I've just kind of been so lucky to have fallen ass backwards into this platform on bankless and in the community in which I think because I started get coin um in one of the the more prominent progenators of solar Punk memes and some of these provocations and what would it look like if we invited all sorts of talented people into a telegram group uh and maybe eventually a Dao that could could be telling these stories and I think that that's where anti-fragility comes from that's where diversity comes from is from inviting other people to come in and co-create alongside us and so you know it's it's possible that one day this podcast and future editions of the green pill book or future media campaigns that I'm involved in could be channeled through this pluriverse project and they would just be one of the many projects that's building the pluriverse along with other members of the community and I almost think of it as a you know together at scale that kind of becomes a not a Cinematic Universe but like a transmedia universe a transmedia pluriverse of people telling stories about a metaverse that is not Zuckerberg's metaburst but is the the vision collectively that web3 has about that metaverse and what if we you know what if we continue to instigate that by just going around and making more comics you know we've done we've done a comic that features like metamask and ethereum and get coin uh and we've done one on raid Guild and git coin what if we went to coordinate and had like the Apes fighting their coordination failures or if we went to urine and had them uh the the rabbits and the waifus fighting their coordination failures putting all of that in a pot and stirring it is I think the container of what we're trying to do with the pluriverse guide so so so yeah I mean I I think it really becomes exciting to decentralize the creation of this lore and debating about what our values is is is something that's going to happen in there because plur versus about pluralism and a plurality of perspectives and there's going to be conflict in there as well totally absolutely and so again it comes down for simplicity's sake it comes down to really two huge considerations which is on one hand the ideology that drives the articulation and the manifestation of those memes as well as how to Leverage The crypto economic tools and the Dow tools to prevent capture of those ideas and those memes um so on that second Point first I mean people are probably wondering to some extent not to get into the weeds or anything but like what exactly is the structure of this pluriverse dial um and as you'll see as it's articulated um within the pluriverse guide that we're going to release at em con this is a community built upon a maluk uh style Dao the Malik contracts which um are now going through multiple iterations contracts are currently in version 2.5 and the Dow house team and the um the wider Community or ecosystem work working on ball which is molec version three is about to release those contracts as well which really opens up a lot of powerful integral tooling for communities to pool their funds together well protecting from capture which is includes economic capture governance capture through the proposal flow of the Dow as well as something I'm very interested in which is uh cultural capture like how to avoid the kind of Founders dilemma and the kind of Charisma of um uh you know the the relative gravity or weight of charismatic leaders such as yourself and to distribute the potential to influence and to participate within um the conversation so you know um raid Guild and DOW house which are other Dows that I'm regular contributors to we have are already kind of integrating this structure of again Dow house Dow contracts um accessed through the Dow house UI and um various tools that both of those communities as well as the whole just general metacartel Community are actively speculating and building to further facilitate this kind of Open Access and interface um yeah and then the other thing is is the ideological stuff which maybe I'm just going to try to restrain myself a little bit um to see if you had anything you wanted to say about the mechanics before jumping into that rabbit hole yeah I mean I think just to like come up for error a little bit a lot of these Concepts will make more sense to you once you've read the pluriverse guide go to pluriverse.wtf read the pluriverse guide if you're interested in getting involved there's a telegram group where you can read more and you can learn more about these Concepts and that's a great place to uh I think it's a diving board that allows you to to Deep dive uh back in so so let's keep going what do you got cool yeah well [Music] um let's see so I feel like this term um the pluriverse or you know working towards the plural reversal um might be something that we it might be a good starting point for like uh beginning to get deeper on some of these things and so as we've already mentioned I think the initial impulse was to Define an alternative to the metaverse um to a to the universe even to a singular Vision to this right kind of you know the meta representing this abstraction this like ultimate abstraction of which the entire universe is funneled into and so the pluriverse representing plurality um was what we kind of concocted and right so I know that you uh published an essay recently um with Oren of gnosis um called practical pluralism and this is a great essay by the way I really enjoyed it but I think I might distinguish what you guys are defining there in Practical pluralism which if I understand correctly it's mostly about treating client diversity as a public good and yeah up the stack into other apps not just from The Client app layer yeah was the idea totally and then how do we align our incentive mechanisms um within ethereum or like really any code base hopefully open source code base to like kind of uh bacon you guys talk about like anti-fragility and resilience right um so that there's a competition among these various implementations and that produces this kind of anti-fragility of uh of the core um governance layers which um I totally support that and I mean as an idea I think it's a really important one I would typify it myself as a kind of accelerationist idea which with no pejorative implications to that but certainly different than the plural versality that we're evoking within this project which might de-emphasize that competition in order to re-emphasize a kind of opening up of um diversity of another sense and specifically I pull the term plural versality or the pluriverse from a text which has been um very influential on me for the last uh basically since we started this project um a text by Arturo Escobar called designs for the pluriverse and I think the extended title is like radical interdependence and autonomy and the making of Worlds um It's a Wonderful text it's difficult and dense but I think everyone should read it absolutely within crypto um and so specifically he hones in on a few things which resonate really deeply to me and I'll try to make this super brief but he advocates for design thinking and agile methodological Frameworks and that tradition of um of light design that's very responsive to the user as being so important and this is of course something really important for crypto I think crypto has a ux problem and I think crypto has a UI problem um which and those things kind of reflect each other and um but mostly I think this is embodied within maybe what we could call an ontological design problem which Escobar really ratchets down and gets into what this means which includes opening up and defining the term ontology and relating it to design thinking and basically he calls for an ontological reorientation that the way that we should be designing is towards transitional States like we're designing into the Transitions and um this the whole text and his whole modus operandi is to extend this invitation and that design should be extending an invitation it should be designing for local people and local needs and like that's what defines the success metric for our outputs and these kinds of you know I guess as an alternative like immediately focusing on growth and scale and speed and moving fast and breaking things um is the practice that we have inherited but it's not one that will serve us for the Long Haul so you know we have to begin pivoting immediately and I think the way to do that is to um reproach or readdress like these assumptions that are that are designs that are building is based upon and you know to bring it home that's ultimately what the invitation that the plural reverse guide and the whole plural verse idea and the project as we've been crafting it is trying to do it's an invitation for the crypto community and the World At Large to rethink the kind of yeah ontological foundations so to speak um that were that we're building on top of yeah I mean I think that it's this is such a great place to start so going deep on the idea of a pluriverse which as opposed to a universe is the one physical reality that we're in uh as opposed to the metaverse which is the digital abstraction layer created on top of the universe that uh was originally conceived in snow crash as a dystopian world and it's been reinvented as a dystopian World by Mark Zuckerberg um as opposed to practical pluralism which is about client diversity at the app layer and the consensus layer of web3 networks the pluralism the poor the pluriverse is a world where where many worlds can Thrive focused on radical Independence autonomy and articulation of those worlds would be sort of my mile wide inch deep summary of of where we've been but uh Curious whether would that evokes for you yeah I really appreciate because I forget this all the time but I really appreciate that you recall snow crash uh Neil Stevenson's novel as the um yeah the progenator of the metaverse meme and of course Neil Stevenson has like this this whole Cypher Punk kind of uh weight and importance of himself uh you know of his own work like kryptonomicon um and my favorite book of his is called uh anatham uh which is wonderful if you've not read that it was kind of the inspiration for this giant clock that um oh the specifics are gonna evade me there's that that organization based in the Bay Area that's exploring these highly speculative Futures and trying to figure out basically through conference format how to manifest these in our contemporary moment and they're making this clock that is designed to withstand the inevitability of the downfall of civilization maybe we can I can get the specific reference and we can put it in the show notes because it's not going to come to me right now no but um this is really important right like so Neil Stevenson's vision of the metaverse uh is one thing but like I think that might be an entry point for us to talk about the importance of Science Fiction which ultimately that's what we're doing we're creating a science fiction Universe which has profound weight and significance and um you know as far as that goes I'm more of an Ursula Le Guin Ursula K Le Guin fan more than Neil Stevenson I think that not only is she is an incredible writer but the way that she um deals with her wild speculations of the future and represents the profound tensions of our contemporary moment I think are so pertinent and prescient and she's uh you'll find a few Ursula Le Guin quotes within our pluriverse guide text and um yeah she's so delicately nuanced in her weaving of these SF figures right which is her term that um Donna haraway actually kind of picked up so um SF science fiction but also so much more than that speculative fabulation these string fingers uh figures like you know the the string based kind of um cat's cradle type games um as well as like speculative feminism like Neil Stevenson you know for as much as I like his novels he is kind of putting forth this dystopian world of patriarchal uh subtle settler colonialism um hyper accelerationist capitalism he really it is like Stevenson's metaverse is zuck's metaverse like it is a kind of dystopia that we are actively manifesting and if we're not careful we'll become the reality that we all are kind of compartment compartmentalized into um so yeah I mean it matters what stories so this is Donna haraway again that I'm evoking it matters what ideas we use to think other ideas and in her book um staying with the trouble which again another text that I highly recommend everyone reads this is like must read she she says this phrase over and over again almost like a mantra like it matters what thoughts think thoughts what stories tell stories what knowledge is no knowledge is and again the plural verse guide is like an invitation to think differently yeah and and this is one point that I really want to highlight for me because you know I'm I'm a software engineer I have a computer science degree a lot of my sharpest thinking is done in code or logical Concepts and and I think that one of the the sort of prompts that from from being involved in this plural first guide with you project is that you know maybe the design for the plural verse shouldn't just come from coders but it should come from artists and everyday citizens and people who have really thought about these these trade-offs and I think that that's really one of the most powerful things here is that we can explore a lot of the ethics and a lot of the philosophy of how to live well in in die well on Tara how to treat each other well what is intentionally the kind of world that we're trying to provoke in web 3 and have those debates inside of this container and I think that you know just moving away from the technical and thinking and code to thinking uh about the people and their experience science has been one of the provocations that I've gotten out of you in this project Travis yeah great I mean that makes me feel great it's also been really challenging and edifying uh for me as well and I think that is how we should be provoking each other right like that's how we should be thinking which is to say expansively like beyond our comfort zones um not just continuously doubling down or reifying um what we think that we know but challenging ourselves beyond the known into the unknown um because it matters right it's it's so it's like Everyone likes to talk about this cybernetic idea of autopliesis um of self-making self-replicating systems which are fundamentally closed systems and this resonates really really deeply um within ruminations on blockchain technology and and the kind of systems thinking engineering mindset approach um which has ultimately manifested a cybernetic vision of ecology and I think that the crypto Community is beginning to brush up against the limits of this form of thought and I mean I see it coming up again and again with the conversations you're having with your hosts I mean with your guests um here on the green pill podcast um like your conversation with uh trach is one of my favorites and his rumination upon the sifano for um of this like kind of colony multicellular organism it's actually separate discrete organisms that are collaborating Allah adal or something like that um as well as like meta dreamers evocation uh to consider mycelial networks and the kind of natural Communications of mycelial roots tickling um trees and you know he describes it as this kind of natural internet and and whatnot and um you know not even to mention the kind of uh uh perfumed pollen clouds of all of the you know uh yeah hormonal and like um perfumed uh Communications that are having that are happening between trees and within forests above the soils um but yeah I think ultimately what these metaphors come down to are a need to break the idea of autopoiesis towards again like evoking Donna haraway she talks about simplisis um making together building together symbiogenesis um she in that book actually and this is great um I'm just remembering this so forgive me but she she mentions this organism it's called it's called mixo trica paradoxa I think it's a it's a critter it's this organism that she uses to illustrate symbiosis symbiogenesis simpoesis it's a critter that's kind of made up of these different taxonomic kinds of cells that when we when we look at it under a microscope we don't recognize anything particularly unique but then looking closer where we would expect to find the mitochondria Within These individuated nuclear nucleated cells we actually find proliferations of more Critters of of bacteria more bacteria and so it's an example of um a very simple organism as a hollow biont right which is this term that I used at the beginning which is like we are Hollow by ants you and I we humans we are you know um like calcium scalford scaffolded um upright salinated meat sacs that are basically vehicles for our gut flora and fauna and it's it like really begs this question of agency and you know we're so caught up in this conversation especially within crypto but also in the world right now in this present moment about our individuality and our Humanity but I think that there's something very humbling in remembering you know remembering again and again that we are vehicles for other organisms and the Earth is a vehicle for our species as well as all the other organisms and even this Critter that I'm mentioning makes a trichoperadoxa is like is is a complex kind of bacterial Colony that lives within the gut of termites and there's this kind of beautiful infinite regress of organisms within organisms within organisms and our thoughts and our mind and our knowledge really isn't as much our own as we let on so there's this like again an invitation in that thought to think with to think together across species even like beyond our own humanity and I would argue um yeah I would argue for my own I wouldn't argue I would just pose I guess as an invitation to think with this community that if we're gonna make it like if we're going to manifest the quadratic lands in this beautiful um you know uh equilibrium of the solar Punk quadratic lands it's going to require us to start pivoting and thinking differently about humans about Humanity um and about the humanities right like the human the humanist project which still continues to drive much of our building much of our innervation much of our technological development much of our civilization um so as as a science fiction based or speculative fabulation or speculative feminist based invitation I invite the the listeners of this podcast and anyone interested in our plural verse project to ask those kinds of questions to themselves like what is post Humanities consist of is it you know what is post-humanism transhumanism and how does that integrate within this this solar Punk uh vision and how are we going to get there how do we build it how can you articulate it or illustrate it and if you can please do and then please uh join our our Dell so that we can dream these ideas together and take them further yeah I mean there's so many points there that I want to touch on uh basically the the different hold ons of the human body and bacterial guts and our cells having a symbiotic relationship with other organisms that are alien to us just is such a gnarly thing and it makes me optimism of the about optimistic about the symbiosis between man and machine in the future and also the pluralism of outside of our bodies of uh not only families and towns but when we have Internet native organizations in these dowels how we relate to those dowels in a non-dystopic way um and how those dials relate to each other and those whole lines sort of fractal up to all of humanity is what that evokes in my mind but um keeping in mind that every hold on is not is not the same in this siphonophore what's the word that trick used yes I think he was describing a siphonophore Yeah so basically you know I think he described a Dao as like you can have all of these cells in a certain part of an organizational unit that don't resemble another ones and like it'll have just like a weird antenna and that antenna is like banteg I remember him saying in his talk you know some sometimes you just have these beautiful unique unicorns in these dolls that are uh defy classification or label labeling um so so yeah I mean it's it's really interesting to think about the pluralism of organisms and hollons through which will co-create the world together in the future and designing for that yeah totally and so all of the elements of the pluriverse guide which probably originated within the comics but there's also some new elements in there they're all kind of um you know I think of them as inflection points and as these portals um these these doorways or these interfaces for passing into this realm of of consideration and this includes you know like the ethbot more and more is beginning to take on this weight of thinking about the um the the crypto stack or specifically the regenerative crypto economic stack and I won't go deep into this but you know I'm a big fan of Benjamin bratton's book called the stack um where he I think the most wonderful takeaway from that book is that when we refer to the stack it's not just the physical infrastructure it's not just the technological infrastructure but it's all of the human like Urban civilization type um you know socio-cultural philosophical infrastructure that's related to it um and you know so like on this question of humanism or like it's like we have this there's the stack that we have and then there's the stack to come which he defines as this black stack even and if we hope to in some way um articulate a way of being or a stack even that is beyond the human while we we have to confront the Paradox of also wanting or Desiring or maybe even needing the human to remain at the center of that stack as the subject and the object of its uh you know knowing and desire um and so it's really about seeing and being seen and um you know the big nightmare is to just be seen as irrelevant by the technology um which is like this whole you know nightmarish vision of of AI um but even worse than being seen in an as an enemy is uh not being seen at all and so I you know I think there's some real important issues that we will all need to individually confront and answer um or at least at least be able to articulate the problem there um of what kind of world we're trying to manifest and whether like his post-humanism equivalent to post capitalism like are we articulating some kind of Utopia that is the end of work and the end of competition and is this um you know in Scott Alexander's meditations on Malik he describes accelerationism um through through the writings of Nick land who is um a really wonderful poetic but also horrifying terrorizing thinker in his advocacy for a accelerationist capitalism um you know basically the thesis is capitalism is going to end it's going to hit the fan um the detritus is going to hit the fan so let's leverage our technology to make that happen as quickly as possible so that we can start exploring what comes next um well yeah you know Nick land was just on that note he was a really um influential thinker kind of a leader of this of the ccru which is what does that stand for the cybernetic cultural Research Unit um this kind of collective of intellectuals and hackers uh that came out of the UK and more than Nick land I would I would advocate for the crypto Community to read more Mark Fisher who is also part of that same group and it talks it certainly is a researcher a theorist of accelerationism but I think a more constructive one rather than a destructive one you know um he pulls this quotation as I'm sure many have heard before like uh it's easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism um and that kind of creates this this propensity to wax dystopic about the catastrophes like we're not going to make it we're all in on our current infrastructure and social systems because we've got a global monoculture of capitalism and uh we only have one Earth and we're all sort of eczema is is that sort of the idea yeah I think so I mean this is an idea that comes out of Frederick Jameson and slavoy Zizek but basically it's like capitalism is this pervasive stifling atmosphere it's a condition um not only like as a result of the production of culture but it is actively producing culture and then work and education and all of this stuff happening within it so it's it's like in itself the invisible barrier that constrains our thought and our action well at the same time the Target that we're trying to dismantle for our thought and action um but I think in focusing on you know as Mark Fisher does um so Mark Fisher wrote some amazing texts that explore the paradoxes and complexities one of them is called capitalist realism which is a whole text dedicated to exploring how to even begin to articulate Alternatives as well as a series of lectures which he began uh unfortunately during they were incomplete due to due to his untimely death but the lecture series are called post-capitalist desire where he really ratchets down on humans as desire producing entities and you know back to Arturo Escobar and designs for the plural verse that ultimately is an ontological problem like how do we reorient our motivations how do we re-articulate what we're building towards okay we want to be optimistic while also being while also focusing on optimization schemes like how do we reconcile ourselves um this is ultimately an invitation to get really high resolution about the future right like that's what all of this has in common that's what science fiction and the plural verse guide and all of these other ideas that we're discussing really have in common like what what are the quadratic plans how do you define them and how are we going to get there like what's the the straight line between point a and point B Point shift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for Dows and crypto businesses who

things that I appreciate about you Travis is that I have the most tabs open on my browser after talking to you because I'm looking up definitions I'm like wait what's ontology also I forgot that I had was reading post-capitalist desire and I got like a chapter in and it blew my mind but it was just so rich and like chick thick chocolate cake of philosophy that I I just I just forgot about it I need to come back to it but I feel like by hanging out with you and hanging out in the plural verse Dao I'm just going to absorb it through osmosis and maybe there can be social containers in which we talk about these ideas in addition to just being provoked AF from the pluribrous guide uh so what's one of the things I really appreciate you is it really stretches my imagination to hang out with you and talk about these Concepts and I think that's that's why I kept pulling this thread of yo let's build this let's make a shippable increment here for the other so thank you for for for continuing to provoke me yeah thanks man thanks for those kind words um I want to thank you too I mean I've been really drawn to um to your words into your agenda ever since I came into this space couple years ago and you have an undying dedication to what I would Define as a radical optimism which I think that's always pretty dangerous to position oneself as an optimist within public especially as you do um but what I really appreciate about you is that you have an equally undying dedication to being critical of it and to trying to unpack you know to increase the definition to increase the Fidel Fidelity of that optimism and to explore not only so many different kinds of resources across the disciplines but to continue asking questions and I think you know that's so essential um for learning how to live and die well on uh a living dying Planet you know as as inhabitants of Terror right well I mean I do think that um you know there's some there's some quote and it's escaping me now about being able to hold two opposite ideas mutually exclusive ideas in your mind at the same time and not going insane uh and um I do think that you know it's it I do want to default towards optimism because it's the only way to uh to I think to live and to be to be happy but we are in an adversarial world that does have a lot of coordination failures in it and um you know Daniel schmachtenberger would say a problem well understood is uh half-solved and so I think that by understanding the adversarial nature of that and trying to create a shelling point that allows us to overcome those Natures then at least we've collectively half solved uh or or starting to stare over the epoch together of uh not over the epoch over the Event Horizon together of what's possible so it's really a multiplayer game and what's cool is meeting other players on the journey that uh can add to your own journey and I think that's what the plural verse is like I'll tie it back into the plural verse here it's it's that diversity of intelligence is figuring out how to coordinate together that I really think is the way that we can actually manifest that uh that optimism into the world and overcome that pessimism yes well I am not an engineer as you know and I do try to provoke you um about the engineering mindset um and I think that is a really important like that kind of systems thinking approach is incredibly important for us to remain resilient in grappling with the incredible complexity of all of the interrelated tethers and nodes of of this lattice that we're all immersed in but I do also feel very strongly that we cannot resort to just you know to settling for just that perspective that we need to continue to challenge ourselves and each other um to integrate a deliberate intentional kind of diversity so you quote schlachtenberger saying a problem fully understood is half solved but I remember him saying and this very well could be just my own uh cloudy memory but I remember him saying it more like a problem fully visualized is half solved and I think I think others have stated that same quote as a problem uh fully or well well articulated or well stated is half solved and those those three differences I think are profound um what does full comprehension so to take yours you know fully understood problem what does full comprehension even consist of and if our understanding is confined or constrained to a single way of knowing to a let's say a eurocentric or or Western um um or you know settler Colonial or uh yeah like Germanic lineage of philosophical intellectual type of knowledge then can we can really honestly say that that problem is fully understood and you know as an as a an artist and a student of Aesthetics um maybe that's why I I remember it as fully visualized because I think in in this contemporary moment we don't give enough credit to the profundity like you know to the pro to the power of um visualizing our problems as a way of knowing in Contra distinction to how we articulate them or I guess this um again this like kind of systems thinking approach of solving problems what if we consider this to be a problem that cannot be solved but more like an infinite Riddle That continues to tickle us and is a kind of stimuli to retain or and like to practice this existential agility to always be responding to um and what was the third oh well stated a problem well stated uh really like lays the cards down on the table of putting you know the Primacy of understanding within language and I think um you know so does fully articulating does fully stating a problem equivalent to fully understanding it and should we even be striving for full understanding as a goal does that mean we can somehow own it and hold it and destroy it and solve it and make it disappear I mean I think no just that's my own opinion my own bias no that's um maybe requires this yeah a softening and a redirecting and an opening towards a more kind of diaphanous flowing in of other other forms of um perspectivalism non-human maybe and certainly like non-western non um ontological types approaches totally yeah I mean everything other worlds other dimensions one of the things I appreciate about the conversations with you Travis is that uh there's many rabbit holes to go down um and you will take us there but I'm very much an 80 20 guy um and I'm like Ah that's almost the definition and like yeah maybe we don't have to solve this problem but we can at least address it um and I would push back slightly on the idea that you know maybe philosophically and intellectually for those of us who have made it this is just a riddle they have existence that we get to entertain ourselves by exploring before we die but you know there's people that are really suffering out there um and I think that you know by articulating this world you can move the median user experience personal experience in the financial system forward a certain amount and um you know if you look at like an Italian Farmer in the 1500s like your life was [ __ ] compared to what you have to I mean it's better in some ways but in many ways we have better health care we have of better rights for people today we have better education and like you know I do believe that progress can be made and and it's all in the trade-offs between the perfect and the good that that we allow that to happen and this is just me representing that 80 20. uh let's move the ball forward a little bit uh View and and pushing back on the like you know I I want to talk about aliens like let's [ __ ] around and talk about aliens but um you know like let's uh let's know that we're going there only for our own intellectual gratification at least right now um and I want to like weight myself a little bit more towards the pertinent existential problems of today's humans and probably the next couple Generations is is where I where I would fall so I know I'm curious what you what your feedback and pushback is on that yeah I think we got to be careful with that um We're Not Gonna I mean I'm down to talk about aliens too but it that we should be careful not to dismiss that as uh a game for our own intellectual gratification I think the meditation on Aliens and the reason I've tried to inject this kind of weirdness into the comic series is because that's ultimately a meditation about outside right inside and outside um about other worlds other beings that are fundamentally non-human and um getting beyond the thresholds and limitations of the the constraints of this world view this of the Terra world view um in order to anticipate how we might see ourselves differently and that's I mean that is the ontological turn um I think as far as how the pluriverse guide relates to a more 80 20 as you say need to take seriously the dire situation that we have found ourselves in um you know I think yes the pluriverse guide should also not be dismissed as um as like kind of light and and like um I don't know unserious unrigorous like so easy easily dismissable pure lore crafting that doesn't have profound ramifications for how we approach those problems um the the core problem is an imagination problem in my opinion and the way that we collaborate and coordinate and work together to imagine together alternative worlds differences to the status quo and the you know the reality is that no one really wants to confront what has to happen which is growth needs to stop immediately in fact it needs to be put in Reverse like we need to be descaling we need to end progress like we need to move Beyond these anthropocentric human oriented systems and yet we remain thoroughly entrenched within a builder's mindset of continuing to move fast and break things and to grow and expand into scale and I think we every day all of us everywhere are confronted with the Paradox of um trying to maintain some semblance of sanity while also understanding that that perpetuates the very thing you know that we're trying to um unravel and dis and dismantle and you know this comes back to like that Mark Fisher idea about um capitalism itself it's like it's easier to imagine an end of the world than to actually imagine the end of capitalism but that's exactly what we have to be doing we have to be Imagining the end um of these forces um that are causing all of these multi-polar traps and races to the problem to the bottom and the The Meta crises and this false alternative in just in my opinion between catastrophe and dystopianism and you know like the the Doomer post Doomer mindset the lunar Punk solar Punk mindset Etc like we need to teach each other how to sit differently with those ideas and this is an invitation for this whole Community to do that collectively yeah well you know and the other thing I'll put in the pot and and stir it uh I'm not sure I agree with everything that you said but it just reminded me of um this this conversation that happened on before the lunar Punk uh solar Punk debates there was a terrapunk blog post that popped up and was uh basically advocating for we don't need to end growth in order to create a more regenerative economy and so it just reminded me that we're gonna have that guy on the podcast in the next coming weeks and I would actually I would love your help prepping for that and and challenging him on on those ideas would be great yeah it sounds really challenging for me um I'm obviously bringing some biases to the table um but remain humble and open to uh yeah exploring in other ways um of navigating this together yeah totally um well I think that we're oh man we're out we're out of time and that is uh sad because I think we have so much to learn from you Travis and from other people in the community that are thinking about these things but the good news is that uh listener you can go to pluriverse.wtf you can download the pluriverse guide and uh honestly the pluribus guide for me was like that scene in like the Matrix where Neo is learning Kung Fu I just like learned so much like download of Travis's brain from reading the guide join the telegram group there will be uh basically it's launching at mcon on September 7th which I think the episode will be airing around then and we can continue the conversation in that telegram group and hopefully we'll be green lighting some media projects that explore these Concepts visually uh acoustically and through other mediums so the podcast episode has to end but the conversation does not have to end and I want to thank you Travis for for uh being my huckleberry area on this project it's been a lot of fun yeah thanks for having me Kevin um I'll be at mcon and if anyone recognizes me by my uh profundity my profusion of hair um please come up and say hi and if you want to talk about SF figures or any of this other stuff that we've um been discussing today I'm super passionate and super enthusiastic to keep those conversations going even if you have a complete difference of opinion and yeah that the project has a yeater campaign which we're preparing to launch and the community is preparing to spin up a Dao to um you know maintain the negotiations of the of the canonical progressions of lore on chain and yeah definitely pick up a physical copy of the pluriverse guide which we're releasing imminently um the physical version is amazing a lot of great design um and and provocative uh invitations and thoughts in there yeah uh yeah joined the telegram group we'll both be in there and keep this conversation going we absolutely will and the one thing I'll say just as we're showing the book which you can get at pluriverse.wtf you can get the digital version and the physical version there is that we have one of the best designers in the get coin ecosystem that worked on the book and it looks pretty [ __ ] dope and that just doesn't come across on audio at all so you're gonna have to download the guide at pluribus.wtf in order to see those beautiful animations Travis anything I didn't ask you that you want to say um I want to say that I remember the name of that project it's called the long now foundation in SF and they have a project called like I think it's called the 1000 year or the 10 000 year clock and that's the that was the impetus for Neil Stevenson to write anathem it's basically around these monks in in monasteries that are keeping the infinite cosmological time um but beyond that no um I'm really pleased to have this conversation with you it's very challenging and very neutrifying for me um and I think this green pill podcast is much needed and really important um yeah let's continue to think together we must think think we must and it matters foreign [Music]
