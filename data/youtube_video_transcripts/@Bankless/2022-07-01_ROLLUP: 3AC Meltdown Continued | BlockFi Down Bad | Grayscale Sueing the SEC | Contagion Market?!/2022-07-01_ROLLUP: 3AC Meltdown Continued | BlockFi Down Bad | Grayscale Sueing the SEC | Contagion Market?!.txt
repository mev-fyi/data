right d5 markets performed flawlessly transparent on chain it all worked we we did the same liquidations that the c5 lenders did except d5 didn't screw anyone over actually performed exactly as it was supposed to it's because our regulations are based in smart contracts so the sec and other regulators could view defy as part of the solution here hey bankless nation happy friday morning and happy fourth week of june this is the last week of june we've got a lot to cover here david i'm fresh back from last week i did get covered last week i went to the beach had some fun but also got co-fit so i'm a little bit under the weather so i'll try to meet the coughs david but how are you doing man your new place looks great yeah thanks my man doesn't it doesn't the brick look pretty good i got some big plans for what's going on behind me in the future yeah what are you thinking some like little nfts uh i got a little bit of entities but uh more than that more than that bankless studio uh the plans for banquet studio is underway more on that later in the show all right well so we'll save that to the t's at the end but we got some hot things to cover some big things to cover i came back and i i feel like i'm you know i left kind of shaking my head a little bit and i came back and i'm just like still shaking my head like what a mess last week was a complete mess again i think the theme of the episode today the roll up today is crypto contagion once again it's continuing to propagate but we've got a few stories where uh we're gonna chase down what's the first one david yeah we're gonna we're gonna recap the dust that is settling around the three years capital meltdown we've done this a few times before already and the dust continues to settle we are finally starting to get some clarity although there is still much more clarity needed so we're going to go through all of what it where we is beginning to shake out as the final part of the story of three hours capital and then that bleeds right into the story of blockfi again the same stories that we've been covering but because three years capital was related to blockfy uh we got to cover the settling of the blockfi issue as well uh blockfi where it was previously raising at basically a 5 billion valuation about a year ago is now being valued between 25 and 50 million dollars those are some there's differences between those numbers that sound bad but then that bleeds right into the third big story of the week which is that ray scale is suing the sec and all these stories are related to each other one just like flows right into the other which brings us back to like the theme of this whole entire market which is contagion contagion contagion and it really ryan all kind of comes down to the gbtc discount and so we're going to walk the viewers the listeners through like how all of these things are tied together how one rogue venture fund that everyone thought was chad's was connected to this gptc grayscale trust which was an inferior product as a result of sec regulation uh whose fault is the bear market well it's a lot of people's fault but we can definitely name some names and so we're going to cover all those stories all right we're going to be naming names for you is that is that what you want in that name guys for us to talk about things that people did that were just straight up dumb because that's what we're gonna do in today's episode i think we have to camp on that to learn from our mistakes hopefully um also wanted to tell you about our friends at juno juno is a crypto bank okay but it's not like all the other banks in that it has remained solvent and actually this is kind of a bank account that uh i think of as dfi's best friend because they are so crypto native and so defy native david what kind of things does juno provide in a bank account juno i think pretty much has the world record for the fastest connection between your checking account and an ethereum layer two so juno it's like your new financial services crypto enabled financial services you can get a checking account with don juno and you can go from your checking account to polygon arbitrarum optimism and then they also are working on their stark net and zk syncing integrations as well so like that's already mind-blowing like checking account to layer two in seconds uh you can also swap your your money for crypto assets uh with zero fees uh we love that and you can also in your on juno a checking account get six percent on your usdc or it's three percent on ether or three percent on btc uh and so like it's the the crypto enabled checking account for the future of the world uh i mean the address writes itself yeah absolutely absolutely and it you may think hey why are the bankless guys telling me to go open a bank account but we're literally telling you to go do that because this bank account is so crypto native and crypto enabled and look you know you're never going to get rid of your your bank account there's always going to be a place for the banks but this is what a neo bank really looks like it's completely connected to the crypto world and there's no borders you have seamless transition between both so know you guys probably want to get started you can head on over to the link in the show notes and when you do there is a 10 back reward on your first crypto deposit and also a hundred dollars when you set up a direct deposit because once again you can actually get paid in crypto through juno as a service too so go check that out juno dot finance slash bankless all right david let's get on the markets report so what are we looking at with bitcoin price this week we're down it looks like yeah it's one of those weeks like yeah it's down every single week isn't it uh start of the week at twenty thousand five hundred dollars we are currently at nineteen thousand dollars just a few dollars above 19 000 uh down seven percent on the week oof that does not feel good to be below 20k that's definitely bear market territory it's getting chilly down here in the cold how about eth what are we looking at on the seven day here yeah ether started the week at eleven hundred dollars we are currently at one thousand twenty six dollars down six point seven percent on the week oof flirting with that triple digits i saw i saw triple digits uh this morning yeah we got this morning i was like wow that's a number that sucks that's a bad number huh you think yeah not for bob how deep is the cut here how'd you be going oh god you want to make some calls i mean i i think we're going to have plenty of three-digit buying opportunities maybe not plenty but like there will be numerous buying opportunities there were three times i remember being able to buy 80 ether in 2018 to 2020. uh this is the second time that i've seen triple digit eath so count them like two times there you go guys it's look if you're bullish on the space as we are and if you're as bullish as on eath and some of these other assets as we are this is an incredible opportunity now i'm not saying that we're gonna go up overnight but i am saying that probably over the next weeks to months maybe years i don't know will probably be one of the few triple buying eth opportunities if not the last one we ever see um but who knows i mean quote me quote me on that later after i'm right don't quote me on that uh forget i said that during the bear market to bitcoin the ratio what are we looking at this week david yeah it's basically flat we're at point zero five four that's where we were last week so no significant change not going down though and total crypto market cap we down two we're down on that one yeah we are at a clean 900 billion dollars in crypto market cap down 50 billion dollars in the last week 50 billion dollars in crypto market cap used to be noise that's not noisy anymore we lose 50 billion dollars in the market cap that's uh what is that that's two and a half percent do you know it's still funny though less than that that's five percent that's five percent but less than a trillion dollars right it's like um you know the dot-com boom got to like three trillion in the big.com boom and if you do like inflation adjusted that's more like 10 trillion so like you know crypto did what two trillion three trillion three points not that big right compared to like the internet or the doctor trillion yeah exactly now we're now we're back under a trillion dollars but let's set some context here because david i know we're going to do a lot of macro episodes and i think it's worth talking about uh macro for a minute um our friend uh kyla this week um mentioned in her newsletter a meeting that happened at the ecb uh the european central bankers where all of the central bankers got together and they had a big conversation and essentially as kyla says they were like wow the entire economic regime is shifting from low inflation to whatever this is whatever this is is definitely high inflation new paradigm new paradigm and jerome powell is actually quoted as saying we understand better how little we understand about inflation what this is what jerome powell says and it's kind of head smacking right because you're just like you have one job jerome powell and that is to like look at the historical context for this thing he said that out loud pretty sure he did david and so um your job is to literally understand what inflation is this should have caught no one by surprise in fact there's a lot of things that the fed could be doing that's not to say though david that um like the fed and powell are the only ones to blame here okay sometimes yeah you're like all of the blame going around for inflation people are like oh it's trump other people are like oh it's biden they'd be like oh it's you know the war russia and ukraine it's putin's fall everyone wants to blame and the reality is like yes to all of the above right it's all of their it's like there's a lot of collective fault this was a post that i read this week that lists 15 things that inflation can be blamed on and justifiable reasons for each number one covid number two congress number three president biden the cares act one number four president uh trump in the cares act one and two number five consumers who overspent number six consumers who shifted to goods it's part of kovid number seven the russian inflation of ukraine number eight just in time delivery supply chains number nine fed monetary policy number 10 wages and unemployment insurance number 11 home shortages number 12 semiconductors automobiles price go up number 13 corporate profit seeking number 14 tax cuts and infrastructure a number 15 author of this post even added crypto why is it our fault a little bit funny uh they just said um a lot of people made a lot of money on crypto and then they bought things in crypto and drove up the prices of other things but yeah but i was thinking about the equities market too there was more money made in the equities market than crypto i don't feel i blame at all i'll take one fifteenth of the blame i guess whatever but like the point here is the broader point is it's not any one thing david it's like a whole bunch of things that are causing like where we are right now with inflation and it seems like the central bankers are still not quite sure what to do with it all right right i i would summarize between all of those things it really boils down to globalization uh because globalization made a pandemic global very very quickly it also is responsible for our our supply chains our very supply fragile supply chains uh and then also like a russian invasion of ukraine that also has uh global impacts just because we have a global network so like we're super global so like like i think like five to seven of those things could fall under the globalization category and i think also five to seven of those things could fall under the uh fiscal irresponsibility category money printing like uh you know payments for infrastructure that like is probably like there's a bunch of corruption in the united states like you know no surprise there uh so like between global globalization and or like fiscal irresponsibility i think is like two-thirds of the blame i would say uh yeah and then you got a war you know who are well that's globalization though right because then the war like impacts supply chains impacts oil blah blah blah sure sure so there's the bumper sticker globalization and money printing and wara cost caused inflation and crypto and those crypto don't forget about crypto it's bitcoin's fault yeah um well you know what i i read a great probably the best thing article i read this week was actually uh a letter from dan uh at panteran we've had dan on the podcast in the past um he's really good from a macro perspective in particular and um he was talking about the big blame maybe he would say like more like hmm more like two-thirds itself is is actually on fed policy so he would he would wait what you just said you'd probably agree but i think he would weight things more towards fed policy decisions at least exacerbating all of the inflation that we were about to have and two things the fed did wrong powell for some reason and the fed in central bankers around the world screwed this up in a big way number one they kept rates low for too long we should have been raising rates a year ago david that was clear inflation right we went to transitory inflation so it's number one that's that's happened at times in the past but like that's that's that's one issue but the second issue is even bigger they've been manipulating the bond market okay first time in history this has happened if you look at some of these graphs from the pantera um like report you could see look what the fed bought 3.1 trillion dollars in bonds like buying a whole bunch of mortgages and dan makes the argument that like when you have an interest rate of 2.3 in the u.s and when uh home prices are raising are increasing by 20 percent year over year the fed is basically daring you not to buy a house in fact don't just buy one house buy two or three if you can i have houses because it's all cheap money that the fed is effectively giving you so by manipulating the bond market and stepping in on the housing side of things in the mortgage side of things the fed just pumped this thing up way beyond levels that we've ever seen probably historically right and so um yeah we've got a lot of overvaluation to get through and dan actually says he doesn't think that this is going to be fixed until a few things happen one housing inflation goes negative either that or unemployment rate goes up by two percent so we're in a recession that possibly or core cpi gets closer to 2.5 percent core cps not total cpi it's it's uh cpi less energy and and food and it's about six percent in the us uh or the fed has unwound the majority of all of the mortgage manipulation that it's been doing and important thing to like take a look at is um this is kind of a us problem all right the average core inflation across our peers japan is point eight percent france is three point two percent canada five point seven percent germany three point eight percent the average three point four the u.s is six percent no coincidence that we also uh printed the most amount of money for stim semi checks we also gave out the most amount in like unemployment and seamless checks and like surprise surprise we also have the highest inflation 100 so this has to unwind has to make its way out of you know through the system uh and uh you have to wonder too this is uh something that you picked out this week the wall street journal is talking about this in a different way than they've been talking about it what's what are we looking at here yeah they give that headline rising interest rates will crush the federal budget and like the the conversation here is that if we raise interest rates and send our economy into an uh a recession not only is that a recession for the american american economy our own government can't pay its own debts and so like the federal the federal government is too indebted to suffer high interest rates but also if we so simultaneously that's a problem and then if we send our own economy into a recession where's all the tax money going to come from to pay off the debts so like in 2022 you know like how much ca like the irs the treasury's going to receive in capital gains tax in 2022 like nothing basically less capital it's going basically to zero so like they're not making any money on capital gains uh they're going to be able to make less money on just like other things just because overall when the economy is down the economy is the thing that they tax and so if we have a recession in like they have no inflows to pay their own debts meanwhile the interest rates are going up because that's what we're doing to fight inflation and so the wall street journal and it's important to note that the wall street journal is saying this because like yeah it's an extension of like some parts of the world are just extensions of the state there's like arguments that like the tech sector is just a surveillance arm of the state and the media sector is just like a like a media arm of the state if you just want to put this into like your conspiracy hats on the wall street journal's like very close to the state right uh and so like when the wall street journal is saying like hey we need to defect from uh the policy of the federal reserve and say hey if you guys keep on raising rates you're going to kill everything it's important to note like where this source is now this is just like one person's opinion in the wall street journal but i mean it was published by the wall street journal yeah and you know what this is the this is the thing i think we want to find out and i want to find out dave and we have a lot of macro people coming in the podcast in the next couple of weeks right like lynn alden's coming back who else um luke uh grumman yeah yeah gromman uh we also have um travis kling on as well like we have like so many different macro commentators who are going to give us one big question i want to find out is okay so you have people like uh dan from pantera saying the fed's got to raise rates like four to five percent and the fact that they're talking about like half a percent or in point seven five percent raise is laughable because they're already like months behind and so they need to raise it to like four or five percent as you have that and then you have a conflicting kind of conversation going on saying the fed can't raise rates or else the u.s won't be able to pay his uh pay its interest payments right any longer so how does this get resolved is a big outstanding question for me that i want to ask some of these macro brains on bank list so backless listeners stay tuned for that a lot of conversation coming up the answer to that question probably is the answer that the whole entire market hinges upon right now like whether we are in a bear market or a bull market or like a recession depression or revitalization depends on the answer to that question i would say totally agree guys we got some more stuff coming up uh three hours capital oh i'm dead i've got some things to say ryan david's gonna go through the full story and he he knows that he's been doing his research here also block file length three hours capital one billion dollars ooh suffering in this as well this is uh the you know crash for the crypto banks uh and lastly we're going to talk about the grayscale suing the sec what that's all about we'll get back to these topics when we come back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eth by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your note to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there

the crypto contagion the three arrows capital meltdown uh the story continues into this week here is a story from the wall street journal crypto hedge fund three arrows capital ordered by court to liquidate david's gonna go through all of the details but just a little bit of background on this three years capital is absolutely massive during the bull run um 10 to 18 billion maybe assets under management it's still kind of unclear but a whole lot of money and a whole lot of prestige through this group and now there's a complete meltdown david what's the story here like what take us through the timeline of what happened now that we have seen the fallout from some of this we get to start to peer inside the black box that is throughout his capital and all of this really started and this behavior started at the very beginning of the bull market for those that were here around the beginning of the bull market the grayscale gbtc trust that it's gb dc is one to one uh towards bitcoin but not there's no redemption window and this is because we cannot have a bitcoin etf because of the sec they had to make a trust out of things and so you could come to the grayscale gbtc trust you could deposit one bitcoin you would be issued one gbtc share and then six to 12 months later you were allowed to liquidate that share on the open market uh you know this is for accredited investors only as the bull market got underway and like uh institutions did not have coinbase accounts or ftx accounts they used the grayscale trust to gain access to bitcoin and since they're not one-to-one redeemable since there's not a credit window the grayscale gbt's trust could have a premium i think the premium got as large as like 148 percent as in like one bitcoin was uh one gptc share was worth 1.48 times a bitcoin when it should trade at par but it doesn't because it's not an etfs it's a nice arbitrage it's a 48 arbitrage right there if you can take the six months illiquidity illiquidity window right so here's what three hours capital would do they they went out and borrowed as much bitcoin as possible from the market to turn it into gbtc shares to milk this premium they would borrow bitcoin from some source and they would put it into grayscale six months later they would have this like 48 like arbitrage and that number would fluctuate because this premium would never go away right it was so persistent for so long uh that that's what people thought but then even even the most average person will like yeah if there's a premium people are going to milk it and throughout capital were the people milking it the thing is ryan they weren't selling their gptc in to capturing on premium they were giving it to they were using it as other collateral so like this starts off by three years capital borrowing as much bitcoin as possible as much bitcoin as the market would lend to them from any lender facility possible which is where this contagion starts and so they put all their btc that they are borrowing into the grayscale lgbt trust to get gbtc back and then they start using that gptc as collateral to borrow stable coins so they're now borrowing stable coins based on their gptc and they started to invest in order to try and get the alpha try and get the premium to start to pay their some of their loans back for borrowing bitcoin in the first place they invest bigly into tara we all know what happens there they bought a bunch of vested avax tokens uh well i mean avax is down bad and they're probably still vesting anyways and they started to take more and more capital from wherever they could get it because they also have like loan and interest payments to get back right they get a 660 million dollar unsecured loan from voyager which is a crypto exchange not a lending facility but somehow they convince voyager to give them a 660 million dollar loan unsecured loan they get a billion dollar loan from blockfi over over collateralized i believe the numbers were some combination of bitcoin and also gptc shares uh we'll talk about that later on uh so they get a billion dollar loan from blockfi uh with a hundred with a 30 over collateralization so like a 1.3 billion dollars inside of block five they get a one billion dollar loan and they go and speculate on the market with that they get caught up in the staked eath trade like trading the merge thinking that the merge is going to happen like everyone's going to buy into staked east but then instead of the merge happening the markets go down bad because of fed fed risks and like their staked eath instead of being worth one eath turns into being worth 0.96 eath and they can't redeem that because that's how state eath works in the first place uh and so also like there's illegal stuff happening too uh and so the singapore central bank uh just uh gave three arrows accentures accentures i don't know what that means actually three hours capital for alleged misleading and false disclosures and there's evidence for this that's going around on crypto twitter and in throughout the markets there's evidence that they falsified records to lenders in order to access more capital so the fraud basically they committed fraud so that they their balance sheet could look healthier so they could get more and more loans out from other people there's also public reports that three hours capital allowed other trading firms to use their account on crypto exchanges to trade through their accounts right three hours capital they had billions of dollars they could they could negotiate with crypto exchanges to like hey charge us less fees on your on your exchange because we're going to put a bunch of volume there and we don't want to pay those fees and the crypto changes are like yes totally you guys put all this volume through our exchange we'll totally charge you less fees and then through capital let other people put money into their account to trade on their account on crypto exchanges so that these third parties could access less fees as well you know what that is ryan that is an unlicensed prime brokerage with brink secrecy act and wire fraud these are criminal cases uh and then there's also representation that they there's also evidence that they represented to otc desks they had relationships with other entities and other otc desks that they didn't in order to like presume some legitimacy to other oc otc desks so they they start off with this like very normal like i'll just borrow bitcoin to get this gbtc tray premium they never sell they never they never manage their risks they instead of instead of closing their risks they just open up more loans on those risks then they somehow like give this crypto twitter uh like a brand about themselves that they're huge chads who make a ton of money uh and so people loan them even more money they took money in from d5 treasuries who like d5 treasuries like they raised 50 million dollars they're sitting on it they don't need to go get yield during the bear market so somehow throughout capital convince them just give us your treasury and we'll we will give you like this percentage meanwhile they probably like stick it into something like tara and get 20 percent and then that thing goes to zero so like a bunch of d5 treasuries are down bad uh down to zero because they trusted through his capital to give them the yield and so like not only did they like they are the one of the sources of contagion because they borrowed from voyager they borrowed from block fi there's if they didn't borrow from celsius they are one degree away from borrowing from celsius well what's crazy about this is like this is the point retail uh it starts lending to three hours capital without knowing it so if you're putting funds into block fi right and you're generating some sort of yield you were effectively lending to three hours capital now this is an over collateralized loan right of course so people think that's super safe but we'll talk about why that wasn't so safe with gdbc a little bit later but i think the important point here is it wasn't just institution to institution this became a retail phenomenon when you're depositing uh funds into these crypto banks like a block fires celsius you are actually giving some funds to zoo and the thris capital team and that truth is rampant throughout the industry right like a voyager a crypto exchange not a lending desk customers would come and deposit their money into voyager exchange to do normal exchange stuff and voyager lent that money out to three hours capital so three hours capital is at the center of the contagion they are the contagion ryan they have they had their tentacles in every single entity that would ever lend the money either over-collateralized or under-collateralized and so like it almost doesn't matter where retail entered the industry money flowed into three hours capital because they took every single lending opportunity that they could and max that account out that is crazy does this blow you away like it feels like they just made all of the new mistakes in like one market cycle they just did them all it's like check the box i'll think that the gdp trade goes on forever i'll get into tara and see if that i'll do this youth staking trade expecting like some sort of timing on the other side of this uh i'll do the uh alt layer one trade with avalanche and all of these other things like they're just checking the boxes of all of the mistakes a noob would make to lose their money during the bull market right and like it they made such a staggering amount of money during the upside of the market part of that was on the backs of they borrowed it and then like you know it works in bull markets and then they lost it all in the bear market right and so like i i can't remember where i heard this quote from but like the venture firms or like you know hedge funds that do extremely well in one cycle aren't going to be around it for the second cycle because if they were levered up they were if they were levered up on the way up they're also levered on the way down and they don't make it the second time around so like having too strong a performance on the upswing means you're getting liquidated on the downswing and that's definitely what happened you want to see the cherry on top of this whole entire uh this whole entire saga ryan yeah give me the su has a 50 million mega yacht that is being seized uh and i can't remember what i i can't remember what the name of this yacht is but it's some like internet meme this is a triple decker yacht that suzu put a a down payment on somewhere in like i think it's the british virgin islands or somewhere who has also made a court order to liquidate three euros capital because that's where three was capital i believe is domiciled uh anyways uh yeah so like this is something that suzu still has is this like 50 million yeah that he has his down payment on uh which is absolutely crazy absolutely uh crazy absolutely brutal um and uh it sounds like the like authorities are stepping in nation states british version islands are ordering the liquidation so like the collectors are coming probably for that yacht as well i would imagine all the assets are going to get liquidated um it's pretty fine this is not a matter of like three hours capital going under and like we're not we're not seeing three hours capital again like this isn't happening yet this is still in speculation phase but this is a criminal enterprise this is a criminal enterprise well kyle davies and suzu are in my mind i'm not a lawyer i do not have insight to these things do not listen to me they are criminals on the run yeah it definitely uh it definitely is starting to seem that way and uh unfortunately it's it's cost the the crypto market a lot in this cycle including retail um this is a tweet from vitalik what are we looking at this is not him weighing in on the whole controversy but i think he's maybe being a little uh subtle here he's being a little a little snarky yeah for good reason vitalik says that there are far more honorable ways to burn 50 million dollars to impress people than buying a super yacht they burned way more than 50 million by the way like becoming a git coin grants matching partner here is the matching partners for our current round so if you want to look around in the space and like look who is still capitalized and capitalized to the point of donating to public goods it's the people in this graphic we got unlock protocol we got the graph uh we got radical we got aragon project zora figment zk validators cello urine finance ens domains protocol labs chain link sorry if i'm not writing all these polygons they are always there these are the people that are so well capitalized that they are still donating money to public goods nice job guys yeah there we go and you know what this is just um i i hope this is part of the cleansing process of getting rid of the excess of um like greed and leverage and margin that was going on during the the bull market um dave and i aren't like celebrating the downfall of three hours capital at least i'm not maybe david is a little bit no he's not but like i it's this had to end this whole spirit of like d-gen short-term um traders dominating like this had to end and we had to get back to the fundamentals of what we're actually building in this industry and so i feel like from that perspective this is the hard medicine the crypto industry and everyone in the crypto industry has to swallow because the stuff we were doing in the cycle and by we i i don't mean bankless listeners necessarily but collectively the industry was not sustainable was not healthy and had to stop at some point and so better now than later right and uh i think this is a healthy thing well let's talk a little bit about blockfy because you were the contagion has spread to blockfy you yeah yeah they had a one billion dollar uh loan outstanding to three hours capital but it was collateralized by 1.3 billion dollars or something to that effect how does this even happen how does the contagion spread when you've got a collateralized uh loan to to block fight david how does this spread into bl block fi's uh you know potential bankruptcy or insolvency right now is what it's looking like well so 1.3 dollars of over collateralized loan for a one billion dollar loan like that's sure but like crypto prices went down by like 60 or 70 percent and throughout capital didn't have any money to top up their loan so that 1.3 billion dollars in collateral was probably below the one billion dollar loan that that block fight gave through rose capital my understanding is block fight there was like there was like um a one billion dollar something alone right that that um block fi had with um three hours capital they were lending them and they had you know we call it 1.3 million a billion dollars over collateralization of that a whole chunk of that was bitcoin and that could be collateralized as prices go down block five is going sorry that could be uh liquidated as prices go down block five is going to liquidate that entire position and my understanding is they did but another chunk of that of the 1.3 billion dollars that was supposed to collateralize this loan was actually actually uh gdbc and that is not liquid in the same way that bitcoin is liquid right and so my understanding is that's really where blockfi has gotten hung up on the gdbc collateral that was not worth what it seemed like it was worth in the market right and that's the part that really you know punched him knocked him out um i mean there's other things that block fire is probably doing from a risk perspective but this was certainly a big one and has led what to blockfy um it's uh there's a purchase talk yeah what's what's going on there yeah there is a tug of war there is a race to acquire blockfi uh and so this is a race between morgan creek digital which already has a bunch of block-wide equity to begin with uh and then also ftx uh so ftx gave blockfy i think a 200 million dollar like credit revolving door like facility i think a couple weeks ago 250 million yeah credit agreement uh and so like that allows for like users with to withdraw their money um as far as i know users can still withdraw their money uh and that that comes off of like a credit credit agreement with ftx and i think what that means is that ftx has the ability to purchase ftx shares from the equity holders at like basically from what block file was previously valued at basically free like at this current valuation block five is valued at 25 to 50 million dollars which is an extremely low number basically wiping them out it's basically you're taking all of the equity holders of block five whether that's the founders or employees or previous investors like morgan creek you're wiping them out but what ftx was doing here is placing its um its debt to blockfy as more junior to depositor debt so that means they're kind of like protecting depositors so if you were a regular user and you had deposited funds into blockfly you want to make sure you're going to get that money out and you want to get that money out before in a liquidation event ftx gets its money out and so that was the benefit that this was providing and i actually think it's it's laudable that blockfi is trying to look out for its users uh maybe they're also trying to just prevent like criminal charges or something like this right so maybe it's not all kind of moralism here maybe maybe they're actually trying to protect themselves here but depositors getting protected in this scenario is a good thing it's not clear that that's what's happening in celsius it seems like depositors are probably going to take some haircut when the celsius dust settles and so that at least was good about ftx but then morgan creek is like um why should blockfi only be worth 25 million dollars like this is somebody coming in and basically he's scalping blockfy when they're down and they're trying to raise some emergency capital to uh value the company at a higher amount and provide that 250 million uh injection i think that valuation if morgan creek deal goes through something like 500 million dollars so far higher than the fdx deal right but like you said this that puts the equity holders current and and new equity holders of block fi above depositors so this is not only a tug of war between ftx and morgan creek this is a tug of war of who gets who gets like bit like bailed out first i guess yeah i don't know that's the case i don't know all of the details of the morgan creek and what position it puts depositors in i i think morgan creek is trying to also protect um depositors um that's not clear to me but um yeah i guess there's a lot of dust to still settle right in the block phi case um but in good news i i um i actually had some funds i know i did i confessed two weeks ago that i had some funds on celsius again yeah ryan likes to try everything ryan tried some centralized lending lenders uh including celsius nexo a few others just a small amount of funds right because you gotta keep an eye on those crypto banks out there you gotta keep an eye on i gotta keep an eye on it not looking good for my celsius deposit all right but i was actually able to withdraw from blockfy in the last few days and so that's at least a good sign that's a stress test of some sort they're not freezing accounts yet so it doesn't seem to be it's in as bad a position as um as celsius is i have a block fight credit card like credit card too i hope that's going to be okay what do you think david if it's a credit card it's probably going to be fine there's a really good article out of the block that really summarized these whole things saying four big takeaways uh that from from all of the from a leaked investor call kind of recapping what we've already said block fire is currently being valued at less than 500 million dollars uh if the ftx deal goes through significantly less than 500 million we're talking about 25 to 50 million dollars if the morgan creek deal goes through maybe it's around that give or take uh morgan creek digital says block flies the loan to three hours capital was one billion and the collateral on three hours capital loan was two thirds bitcoin and one third gbtc uh during the call yes um ftx may the xbx deal gives the firm the option to buy block five but not if morgan creek can get there first and then of course obviously more layoffs may be in the works at block five it's kind of what i would be i would expect but ryan i would like to take this opportunity to go backwards in time about one year to june uh 2021 when blockfi was on the verge of going public right when the sec came into blockfly and told them that they could no longer accept new customer deposits in their existing uh their existing like lending products uh and block five fought them on this uh the sec wanted them to close their existing lending product products block five fought them on this and said hey we just won't accept any in new inbound but current customers get to be grandfathered in that's the settlement of that that whole thing can i just fight then can we just say like is the sec saving the day here i mean like not doing that they weren't wrong about this were they they weren't wrong nope not at all uh and so at the same time block five wanted to go public and so it was they it was going to raise 500 million dollars on their series e which would put them at 4.7 billion dollar valuation 4.7 billion valuation a year ago 12. one year ago fast forward to today block fi is on the day on the market for 25 to 50 million dollars in valuation oof yeah um that's uh that's down bad and it's unfortunate that retail has been involved and again it's people depositing into block fi you see the crypto contagion block fi issues uh some some loans to three hours capital three hours capital goes bust and eventually that flows back to retail right this is this is the problem um i think this is a great contrast point with um d5 did quite well during all of this a lot of lending going on in d5 and when crypto goes down 70 to 90 right a lot of the c5 lenders are caught like insolvent and yet defy unwinded very gracefully with a highly efficient mark we're going to get more to a take on that in a little bit but it's um it's quite the concept juxtaposition is just so clear exactly it's so clear more clear and as a quick fun little side quest before we go on to the next thing the sec thing uh there was an article out of the block that states that ftx was interested in making a deal with celsius kind of in the same way that they're making a deal with block fi but then they looked at celsius's balance sheet and they were like oh no no way we're out of here so declined buying celsius once they took a look at their balance sheet which is uh uh not a good sign allegedly according to a source uh celsius has a two billion dollar hole in their balance sheet so like no one would like to take responsibility of that one david did you did you see that meme it was like a person reaching down to someone someone's hand and they're in the water and looking like they're drowning and it says ftx and it's like i'll help you and celsius is the person drowning in water then the person goes down under and it's only the hand and like um the ftx caption is like oh you're too deep see you later sorry it's kind of like it's kind of what's happening i mean celsius is in a far worse place than blockfy was and so we're kind of seeing the quality of these crypto banks right now right we have some that are still left standing right uh nexo is still left standing uh juno which we talked about earlier they're still left standing yeah uh coinbase is fine they're going to be totally fine cz binance they're actually like buying things fdx they're buying things right now too ftx they're all a great position right now yeah they're in a great position uh anyway so okay what does the gdbc thing have to do with all of this we've mentioned it a few times and uh grayscale is actually suing the sec they are the creators of the gdbc product can you explain what's going on here for us david right and so the gptc discount is something like 30 to 35 percent at the moment as in the gptc is worth only 70 percent of what one bitcoin is worth and gdpc is a product that you can get in your retirement account right retail can buy in their retirement account because we don't have an official etf in the u.s we have to use products like gdpc which is a trust right and it's like like almost inarguably an inferior product like it's supposed to represent one bitcoin yet it's only representing 70 percent of one bitcoin and there's like a six month illiquidity lock-up period for creditor investors between when they deposit bitcoin and then they when can they uh redeem their gbtc so like a lot of capital lock up a lot of capital efficiency during a time where crypto markets go down like 75 percent on average there is a discount a 30 discount on gbtc and a liquidity lockup phase when people need liquidity the most this trust model sucks it all all dry and it's no fault of grayscale at all it's the sec's fault because the sec won't let them turn this into an etf and so the sec rejected grayscale spot bitcoin etf application which from all the commentators like jake stravinsky and others that i'm aware of i say like there's literally no reason why the sec should deny this this is totally above board they should accept this but for some reason people just got the feeling that the sec was going to deny it and so the day that the sec said that they are denied the greyscale conversion of the trust to an etf michael sonnenshein tweets out we're filing we've filed a lawsuit against the sec dollar sign gptc ticker sign gptc fifteen thousand likes which is a big big number uh and so they also release this pr report uh that talks about the details nicely there uh grayscale investment initiates a lawsuit against the sec we're going to court crypto is taking the sec to court uh and everyone i think in my opinion should be behind this conversion uh of the trust into an etf because it would immediately restore 30 of like like capital that should be there in the gbtc token and it would allow a one-to-one redemption window between gbtc and bitcoin so many people will get much more liquidity so many people would become much more capitalized anytime in a place in the market where people need it the most so statement out of grayscale says the sec is failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles and is thereby acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the administrative procedure act and securities exchange act of 1934. there is a compelling and common sense argument for argument here and we look forward to resolving this matter productively and expeditiously says grayscale take him to court grayscale go do it look man look indirectly the sec costs retail a lot of money so right because of this market inefficiency now i'm not saying like suzu's actions and block fi's risk actions um caused all of this but i am saying that there's an inefficiency in gdbc and the bitcoin spot price that doesn't actually need to be there and wouldn't be there if the sec just allowed gracedale to convert it to an etf and so it's just kind of an example of like sometimes regulators in the sec are helpful to the industry right in ways like okay we have a centralized lending provider all right we need some regulation we need some windows into that we need some auditing we need some insight into that okay so like there should be a role for regulators in um you know looking at celsius in depth and looking at block fi in depth and making sure that like they're on the up and up okay that's one thing that we could benefit from by the same token we also want from the sec an etf for retail like so why can't you get rid of like help us with the things we need help with as a crypto industry but then also give us the things that will protect retail that we need like an etf give us a safe um space to play and of course like this kind of silence on uh defy from regulators and almost hostility towards defau an undue hostility uh towards d5 and it's kind of a tbd we don't know if we're gonna allow that or not right when d5 is part of the answer to this right right d5 markets performed flawlessly transparent on chain it all worked we we did the same liquidations that the c5 lenders did except d5 didn't screw anyone over actually performed exactly as it was supposed to it's because our regulations are based in smart contracts so the sec and other regulators could view d5 as part of the solution here and they're not quite there yet i'm hopeful it gets resolved david but like i just feel like anything with regulators is kind of a a double-edged sword because we want you guys here to help us with the scams and like the clear like things that we need help with where retail is getting screwed over but we don't want you to like say the whole thing is off limits and hamper the entire industry and try to shut it down and get it out of like the us because part of the reason we're doing these things is because we are routing around dumb regulation that doesn't work for the people that's my that's my rant on the sec david love it so going back to the the market section where we talked about like the 15 different sources of inflation like here's here's the source here's like the four sources for the contagions in the crypto industry we had like irresponsible centralized lenders uh both unsecured and secured we had thrios capital taking advantage of that we had an inferior product out of out of grayscale with the gbt trust again to no fault of their own and an sec unwilling and un unwilling to work with this industry to provide clarity or or allow this industry to move forward in a way that protected retail investors and allowed these markets to do efficient and orderly clearing of liquidations like the sec which is their mandate got in the way of that so like this can the contagion of crypto the reason why it's so big is like three or four different interwoven reasons like some degeneracy culture uh like central like the same reasons of like d5 people like like talk crap about c5 stuff is like black black box human folly like you can't manage stuff so you let the code do it uh and then because of that inferior stuff you have like throughout capital who like exploits every single possible like way to get money out of it like that congratulations that is the the bear market of the last six months that's a full time roll on the hook for it's a lot of a lot of blame to be shared um across all groups doing this um david we got more to cover man we're going to talk a bit more about makers defy governance the biggest maker proposal in history most controversial also an update on arbetrim odyssey this is their latest update what's going on there guys we'll be right back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across its bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high

bankless listeners will know that maker dow holds a very close place in my heart i think it's a very cool project and there was the most contentious most controversial governance proposal over maker dow just happened the highest amount of all mkr showed up to vote uh and it was it was neck and neck up until the very end uh here's gfx labs putting everything into us into a nice summary 30 of all token supply voted which is crazy to think because like all so many mkrs scattered around like all of d5 30 of them showed up uh voting was neck and neck until the last two hours the vote was to add a new core unit to oversee the dao's onboarding of collateral assets and also form a specific framework for growing the protocol this core unit also came with the hefty price tag basically the framework was a little bit more of kind of like a constitution a constitution-ish about like what maker dow needs to do where it needs to go the direction it needs to go in and it was a pretty like like big turn off of its current path uh and so unlike uh the threat continues unlike most governance votes two distinct sides developed those who wanted to see more organization and control voted yes which is like the trad five vc real world assets camp uh and then the no's which are like the kind of the core maker dow community uh opposed the price tag and didn't really like the specific direction and wanted to continue with roon the founder of maker dallas his uh end game plan that's the name of a post that he wrote uh and so after the dust settled it ended up being that the the tradify and vcs uh did not make the did not make the proposal they got out voted by about 15 percent uh so the maker dow decided to go with a continued endgame plan uh but the idea here is that there are there's a tight there's a tug of war going on over maker dell and no one thinks that this is over and so after this uh hazu actually put a very interesting thread together about his vision for the future of maker dao hazu was on the yes side of these things like the the tradify and vc side of things and like i know trout fighting vcs are generally heard as a negative term like uh abstain your your opinions on that word in this particular context because these are crypto vcs who have opinions hazu puts a tweet out that says i just proposed a series of simple governing changes to make her dial that address many problems that exist in governance today this includes a general lack of vision and strategy as well as low accountability for maker holders hazu has been thinking a ton about dow governance lately and so he puts these like this proposal into place that basically like streamlines governance because there are so many things that's going on with maker dell that everyone has to vote on all the things and there's no just like there's no centralization of decision making basically like it's really taking the dow at heart so like he puts these vision strategy tactics and implementation categories together and promotes like three different ideas that just streamlines all of these things uh and so if you are into the world of dow governance and like on the frontier of that pay attention to what hazu wrote uh we're gonna get on the podcast soon uh but basically there's a very controversial maker down vote pulling maker down into two different directions uh and while this new direction did lose i don't think it's gonna be the last time we hear from this well i do think it's healthy honestly i think i think the two directions are kind of healthy right so it sounds like vc investors are just like hey we want more accountability and our method for solving that is like let's install a core unit a new management team effectively some more centralization right and here's the community saying no everything's good we have a plan let's keep going in the direction we're going and this is a healthy tug of war i think because like the other reality is everyone who owns the maker token does have another vote beyond this governance vote and that vote is just to sell their mkr tokens if they no longer believe in the direction of the project and so any investor in mkr tokens could do that at any time uh and anyway it's good to see i i do think sometimes communities vary on the other side of uh the whole decentralization debate too much and they're like no structure all structure is bad all leadership is bad uh any kind of you know token mechanic that increases the value of the token is is bad and that is obviously not the right choice either right it's like i i would love to see a bit more investor action in something like the uni token for example like i would love to see it there anyway let's turn on that fee switch yeah exactly i think it's all healthy and uh i'm anxious to see how this all plays out but it's playing out transparently in real time here's another governance vote from lydo what's going on here david yeah this is not the end of the dow governance saga also with related to hazu there was a proposal from the lido dow to itself to say hey should we cap ourselves should we limit how much ether is in lido because ether is like dangerously close to passing a threshold that would allow lido to have undue control over the entire ethereum network i wouldn't actually be surprised if that limit has already been passed so lido submitted a governance proposal to itself saying hey should we like cap ourselves should we prevent more ether from being deposited so we don't grow too big and surprise surprise 99.81 of lido said no we should not cap ourselves which like makes sense right like lydo's not gonna say like i think that we should should make less money because our product is too good like they're not gonna say that and so hazu again co-authored another proposal for lydo's stake to each governance which i think is really innovative and i think it is a model that we can take out for other dows right and so the idea here is that uh lido governance will stay lido governance but staked each holder holders ryan get the ability to veto any lido dow proposal so they don't like staked easeholders don't get to say yes they don't get to submit new proposals but if a new proposal is submitted by lido dow governance and the lido dial governance says yes then staked eath holders can come in and say no i think it's cool really quick it's really really cool yeah so like there's the safety holders get one tool which is no you get to veto right and so i think that's great i think that's really cool that's really smart and that's the kind of evolution which i'm most excited about in in kind of dow governance is new ideas like like kasu's idea here and to see how that emerges um no surprise though that lido would vote to to self-limit right in fact the original proposal i mean there i don't think anyone was calling for a self-limit like even vitalik was not talking about a self-limit he was talking about like raise fees a race after you have a certain percentage of market share so even the original proposal seemed kind of like constructed in a very binary way that was a little bit weird but of course token holders are going to vote in their own self-interest david let's talk about some layer two stuff too so odyssey from arbitram what is odyssey and um what happened with it this week right so arbitrary odyssey is basically this this journey around the arbor trump ecosystem where you would go and do some things and you would get some nfts the first week of the odyssey was bridge week so you bridge onto arbor trump and you would get an nft if you did that uh and so they were going to go from bridge week into like app week which is going to be the remainder of the odyssey like weeks two through eight uh but as soon as app week got started like arbitrage got congested because so many people came on to arbitrary during bridge week as soon as i started doing app week stuff they got congested and that's because a lot of the applications that it was in this first week was like heavy computation stuff there was a lot of um what was the app that was being used it was gmx which are perps and leverage which just required a ton of computation and so like you know simple transfers on arbitrom like that's that's not going to clog the network but like as soon as you do like computationally heavy stuff that will start to clog the network uh and so they are putting uh the odyssey on pause until they release nitro and once they get nitro back uh then once they get nitro online and they get the arbitrom like layer two updated to this new update uh then they're gonna resume the odyssey and the odyssey shall continue uh i asked some of the the arbitrary folks like gimmick if you could give us some numbers on like what the the scalability of nitro and they said a nice easy easy to interpret number of seven ethereums as soon as uh the nitro update is on online arbitrary is going to be about seven ethereums uh and like like all layer twos like these updates are just the beginning uh and so like going to where arbitrarily is now which i think is like two to three ethereums going up to seven ethereums nice big jump uh but then like there's also again four uh eip4488 that increases the scale as well uh and so um uh there's also like some crazy numbers that we have there's a dune analytics page which i'll have have you pull up ryan which just showed the sheer magnitude of people that went on to arbitrarily during week week one 250 000 new bridge ores at least bridging addresses uh that happened on arbitrary so 250 000 addresses went albert onto arbitrary in seven days and like that wasn't congested at all just again because like simple transfers are totally fine so can i ask you david did they they just paused the the odyssey itself right they didn't pause the network or anything oh god yes no no no no no no network is doing just fine like the congestion's not even here at this point they just paused their marketing program basically because they were like oh too much too soon right we want to deploy nitro first which is going to 7x uh their network and you know that so that's the reason why the pause why are people doing this for for worthless nfts david i mean okay so like this simple take is that if you get all the nfts you'll get all the airdrops that makes these are like participation nfts right participation ft's uh like it's so obvious that i'm kind of skeptical on it it's like yeah like our department obviously we're gonna give you nfts you can be on a list of people who got the nfts just seems so obvious dude eat this obvious right now the merch i think that that's what's totally gonna happen again none of this is can we don't know anything from the arbor term team right about any of this but like what's really nice about this is that if they're giving out nfts for real things that people are doing they get a pretty clean white list of actual individuals doing real things in the network well not even not if you farm it though you people are just farming nfts instead right farming nfts that's a concept i i bet i bet they'll i bet they'll find a way like around that but it gives a nice base of additional data to differentiate for a future airdrop which it's got to be happening man got to be happy oh well the arb token is coming for sure i've been trying to figure this out ryan what is the arbitration token going to be called a-r-b or a-r-b-i or something else arby rb barbie's kind of a cool name like arby's it makes you think it's like arby's barb is cool though because pretty cool arbitrage right air b um what is optimism op what's op it's just op right yeah which is i think super hot it could be a r a a r a r versus op gun yeah oh yeah i don't know i don't know we'll we'll have to see i do think optimism won the name the name debate or the name fight but that's just my take oh be pretty hot uh okay speaking about they're going up too trading activity surges on optimism's layer two as total locked value doubles david this is a layer two beat look at this optimism now number two ahead of dydx in terms of total locked value on the roll up the number two roll up behind arbitram which has 1.96 billion dollars it seems like the recent op airdrop has helped in terms of getting more value locked inside of this platform also impressive that this is happening during a bear market so roll-ups continuing to do well even despite a bear market any other takes here i wonder if the minus 11 flowing out of dydx is a reaction to their dydx chain or if just people are scared in the bear market so they're not trading leverage i don't know could be i'm tempted to say it's kind of noise for now but um that's going to be one to dydx no longer going to be on l2b david you sad about that right yeah there's gonna be a l1b yeah by the way guys we had an episode with antonio where they talked about earlier this week they talked about their transition to an app chain for a layer two you go listen to that episode i have some thoughts coming out of that episode i won't share them all here but um in the weeks to come maybe we'll share some of those thoughts but anyway great episode if you want to hear their rationale for doing this uh eat stuff merge stuff when merged david uh july 6th something we still don't we still don't know that the july 6 is not when the merge is happening that is when the sepolia test net merge is happening uh and so that's coming up that is the second of three test nets that we must get to to get to the actual merge the second one is happening on july 6th uh it's going to be live streamed on anthony's daily guay or maybe the east stakers it'll just be a whole entire event so that's on the horizon that's good another dress rehearsal down uh david's peaking him down though nfts have been down pretty bad yeah if you've looked at the price of your jpegs lately but it's not gonna give you any comfort okay i love all my jpegs i don't look at the price yeah okay yeah it's just dave is just here for the images um he's here for the art okay so nfts usd volume it's back to like 20 21 levels yeah like early 2021 levels right um down pretty bad but there is one bright spot in the nft economy and that is dots names outperformers right now especially the three digit numbers some crazy crazy sales have happened in the last three days uh zero zero three dot eth got sold for 83.5 eth eight eight eight eight got sold for 38 eth um zero zero three seven got sold for thirty eight three eight three got sold for 2017. ryan porno eth got sold for 184 eth so ens names are hot right now yeah hotter than sam.e they certainly came in at 100 eve so poor sam porno's got you beat sam sorry but yeah look at these numbers man may was like the biggest month ever for um you know for ens and june looks like it's gonna be strong too uh so pretty impressive all the while michael saylor continues to dollar cost average into bitcoin right in the bear market he hasn't stopped it's probably a better time to actually buy the bitcoin at this point in time but he just purchased another 10 million dollars of bitcoin david are you getting concerned that like sailor owns too much bitcoin at this point like he's got to be close to one percent of the entire bitcoin supply uh one yeah okay one percent is 21 201 210 000 and he's got 130 000. he's still got a ways to go for one percent the only the only thing i see when i see michael saylor buying more bitcoin is like dude you spent all of your ammo at the top like that's not dollar cost averaging he's just like putting in you can expand your time prize in the top of what not the top of the decade okay just a local top it's just a local top my friend oh god you can't time these things you've got a dollar cost average a kind of a useful website uh ryan you might want to pull this up while i talk about that is bitcointreasuries.net uh and so if this can just show you people and the treasuries of people around the world and how much bitcoin they have and when they bought it out uh the cost basis for microstrategy is basically four billion dollars they've taken four billion dollars usd and bought it and bought bitcoin with that which is currently valued at in today's dollars at 2.4 billion dollars so they have lost 1.5 billion dollars on their bitcoin trade they have down 40 percent uh and then you can see how much of the of the 21 million they have they have those sounds i've been down worse than this good job 40 or 1.5 billion dollars definitely the former all right i've been down worse than 40 i do think that like i mean i know people are making fun of him now um i do think this trade is ultimately going to pay off like really well like when you zoom out and you know the capital he's getting is is kind of basically free it's a publicly traded company it's taking these like loans at very low uh fed interest rates i know that's not what microstrategy should probably be doing directionally right their business analytics firm but it's probably going to pay off for them i still think this i just see the 10 million dollars is a drop in the bucket on their 2.5 billion dollar position which started at 4 billion like you should have saved your ammo dude oh yeah but that's what everyone says right you can't time these things i mean i i'm also sailor i still support you i'm telling this to myself too don't get me wrong yeah keep buying the dip sailor it's uh you know maybe you could reverse things for us uh david this is um tweet this is uh yeah from niraj from coin center and um just to the crypto industry's attention to this i thought this is an interesting story chinese officials are using the covet health code system to stop a bank run they turned all would-be withdrawals uh codes red before they could get to the bank effectively unpersoning them so what was happening in the banking system in china what's been happening is rather than suffer a bank run where individual citizens were going to the bank to try to withdraw funds the banking system would just give them a covet code a coveted red code you are code positive you cannot leave your house exactly cannot leave the house and effectively ex communicates you from the social system but also the financial system so cutting off your bank access that way in order to prevent a bank run this my friends is very terrifying this is scary this is the reason we can't have the nation states in control of the banking system and in control of the money supply and with the a bureaucrats ability to just press a button and eliminate you from the economy why to stop a bank run who like who knows who knows the why uh what the why will be in the future maybe because you're have different different political persuasions maybe you've voted a different way maybe you've said something publicly on tv this is very terrifying to me and i think i am most alarmed that um countries in the west are actually embracing similar capabilities this is what a centrally administered central bank digital currency right this is actually the power that that gives right they wouldn't even need to deem people's coveted positive they would just skip that step and just go straight to like no you can't have your money there's a quote from this article says the news about the health codes has gone viral on china's social media platforms sooner or later this sort of thing is going to happen to all of us wake up people one user wrote national pandemic prevention policy has been reduced to a private weapon said another this is the height of expansion of power ideological decay and evil influence oof oof guys coming to a cbdc near you the end of the decade we're only going to have two types of money there's going to be state surveillance controlled money and there's going to be free money it's all going to be digital the free money the only free money available will not be cash anymore it will just be crypto so you got crypto and centrally controlled money and those are the two options and this is why we need to preserve crypto as an option you hear you hear that from us every time on bank list david there was a bridge hack this week too we got to cover that real quick what happened yeah harmony to ethereum bridge 100 million dollars was stolen in another bridge hack i mean we've been here before uh ryan you want to know who was behind it um who isn't it nor north korea north korea it was north korea yeah so once again north korea hacked a bridge and now has all the money uh does not look good uh when half of this industry's hacks end up in north korea's pockets oof you know the uh it was interesting in our conversation earlier this week with matthew green how he said he was having conversations with uh the you know us national defense and they were like hey how can we come help the crypto industry to prevent hacks from these like happening because every time north korea goes and hacks something right they get more funding for their government to go i don't know what to do do whatever they do their weapons or something like this so it actually becomes a these hacks actually become a national security risk right interestingly enough right uh crazy angle on that uh layer two prevent nuclear war is that a fair take yeah that might be a stretch stephen there's something there maybe there's a future article david hoffman article um digital wallet maker dynamic raises 7.5 million dollars good to see a raise still coming through in the bear market anything special about this one uh yeah this is uh something that uh for those that pay attention to crypto twitter uh nick carter and castle inventures raised uh put money into this round uh an ethereum wallet that has like digital identity features baked into it and he got absolutely hounded by the bitcoin community like the cyber hornets just because like from their culture you don't touch anything that's not bitcoin and so nick carter the blasphemous sinning nick carter touched something ethereum and now he's being like excommunicated from the cyber hornet culture um just you know a small peek into the window of bitcoin maximalism did you read his post uh bitcoin maximalism is dead his banknotes i haven't but like i feel like i could already know it yeah i think he's over it man he's over bitcoin maximalism for sure as am i as are you always happy um still even in a bear market all right this is an incredible time to get a job in crypto because crypto is still hiring there was a lot of money created and raised during the bull market and uh good firms are still hiring here are a few firms i will lead them out uh read them out and their job opening number one alliance dow cto alliance style software engineer alliance dao is also looking for an executive assistant go check that out otter space is looking for a solidity engineer abstract venture is a front-end engineer boolean labs looking for a founder and web3 for their web 3 community analytics platform and a ceo that's a big one bagless was still looking at twitter specialist resumes uh blockchain capital wants a research engineer swell network a tech lead go check out all of those roles there's so many more stop sports so many more that's the place bankless.palette.com jobs guys we'll be right back coming back with hot questions from the bankless nation as well as some hot takes from twitter we'll get right back to that but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the

internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets bravewall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including ethereum and solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave brave dot com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started question time questions from the nation a tweet goes out of the bank's twitter account every single wednesday and it says what question do you have for ryan and david let us know we'll talk about it every time i put this agenda together in the mornings i go and check out all the hot questions and i grab some of the hottest ones that everyone seems to want asked so we got two of them this week dan scott says does bridging ether to a layer two have similar risks as bridging ether to an alternative layer one like solana or avalanche ryan you wanna take this one uh sure i would say it depends it depends on the bridge that you're using uh but one benefit if you're kind of like into visuals one benefit that a roll-up has versus an alternative layer one is it has a trustless immutable bridge that cannot be destroyed okay so it's a bridge that works regardless of any security dependencies on um the chain itself on the layer two itself right so if you're picturing kind of bridges in your mind uh the other bridges um routes around to layer twos and uh to alternative layer ones these bridges can be destroyed these could be like um these can crumble these can fall if some of the security assumptions on the other chain go by the wayside but a rollup always preserves a bridge where you can always withdraw your funds back to ethereum and that is why a rollup is a rollup because it doesn't have dependencies um that are external to ethereum for your security so there's always that bridge but there are some bridges you can take to these chains that are also like multi-sig and don't have those same security assurances um so you have to be sort of you know careful and cautious as far as which bridge you're using to uh transmit your funds onto the layer two i think there's a decent amount of like semantics confusion that goes around here when we bridge from like one layer one like aetherium to another layer one like salon or avalanche there's no actual like bridge being built like there's no there's no there's it's not like it's something you go across and you transport your ether from one side to the other when you put your ether into one contract on ethereum and then somebody else on the solana or avalanche or other layer one application is looking and observing that contract and say oh they submitted some ether here i will mint them in iou on the other side so it's a little bit more like a teleporter and like you have a central operator teleporting you with it with an iou and if the teleporter breaks your iou on the other side is worthless with a layer two on ethereum there is something like like a canonical bridge a cryptographic bridge that has much stronger assurances that that doesn't actually have to operate on like what is usually a multi-sig and so you have just an extra layer of risk removed because the layer two bridges they don't have to make their own independent blockchain they are giving up their independence in the name of security and having an actual like it's still not an actual bridge because like at the end of the day the metaphor breaks down but you have like strong cryptographic assurances that the bridge will always be there and if the bridge isn't there then the whole network's not there so like solana can go up and stay up ethereum can go up and stay up and that bridge can go down but on a layer two if the bridge goes down the whole network is going down right and so the network the layer two network on ethereum cannot stay up while the bridge is down that doesn't work uh and so it's always a bridge of last resort right on the ltu's and so it's less risky because i guess the short answer right um bridging to a layer two and that is uh essentially the point um okay so here's another question for us david what are some of the best daps that you can recommend to help beginners start living a crypto native life a bankless life david what do you recommend yeah i put some of my some of my favorite sounds first you know if you're going to go into the world of the bankless nation if you're going to go into the metaverse you need a name you need you need your new metaverse name and so you got to go get an ens name so go like just like how you would you sign into instagram sign in to twitter whatever you you make a new handle when you're going into the metaverse you need an ens name so go get one e porno somebody got porno.d maybe not that one um so once you get your metaverse name uh i i think the next coolest thing you can do is you can take some of your ether you can put it into make or dao and you can literally mint money that is the cool thing about crypto you can mint money uh and then you can take that money like put one ether into maker dow like make sure you're measuring the gas fees put uh one ether into maker dow mint some dye put that dye on a layer or two and then you've done like some really cool stuff and that's what i would say where i would start with i i think that's great i i think that like the path to going bankless is like number one you have to start taking custody of your own keys right so it's the move from an exchange to actually taking custody of your keys whether you're doing that in a smart contract wallet like an argent or something a hardware device like ledger or for small bits of money maybe metamask something like that you have to go through that step but once you're on the other side of that i think about still like the money verbs that we've talked about you know so often like what are the things you want to do with your financial life in a typical banking system well one thing you want to do is like save your money and invest and i can think of no better investment my friend and saving mechanism for the long run it's going to be volatile in usc and ups and down then something like eth okay and maybe after that a basket of some other tokens but you definitely want to have eth uh that you don't spend all right you also need some eath for gas but eat that you don't spend so that's like a store value type use case and once you have that um payment use case stable coins are amazing dude i could send money to anyone in the world for like fractions of a penny okay and like it can be any amount of money this is so freeing and so cool and it's something that you should learn how to do whether you're using usdc or die having some stable coins in your crypto reserves uh is is kind of cool then you can use something like pool together which is like a fun defy savings type tool it's a really interesting starter application and defy go check that out pull together and you can deposit your funds actually save your money they have a lotter it's called a no loss lottery they have a system that you know rewards various people based on the pool size it's really cool just check it out it's a good first app if you're lending and borrowing ave is fantastic and then trading of course like go check out uniswap so we got storing value basic payments savings lending and trading and that's a good place to start because you just knocked off like you know five of the different money verbs that you're going to need for a crypto native bankless life from there you can do all sorts of other things but that's where i would start um david let's get to some takes of the week man thanks for the week so uh here's a take from you my friend this is all about c5v versus d5 i say c5 lenders are blowing up specifically due to the properties of centralization they're black boxes you gotta trust them to withdraw your assets and they're subject to human folly human decision making not only now do d5 lenders have fewer competitors because like a few of them have blown up but their competitive edge is now proven and legitimized c5 is fragile and unstable defies robust and stable uh and so i think it's that last line d5 has fewer competitors because all the c5 things blew up they blew up because of the properties of centralization in the first place so now like not only do they have less competition but their differentiation is justified and proven out in the market and i think that's awesome i totally agree with you and you know i think another lens on this this is uh something i tweeted out is for regulators and i said this regulators around the world should be watching d5 protocols closely to congratulate them all right because d5 provided a fair orderly and transparent uh drawdown during the 70 to 90 percent downturn we've just seen well the c5 peers went bust you want to regulate crypto defy is crypto regulation self regulation on this tweet said yeah it's effectively what a smart contract is it's regulations written to code that's what we're doing the whole point the evm is the regulator for defy we we are like that that's the whole thing that makes it what it is exactly smart contracts are simply self regulating and self self enforcer enforcing themselves this is where regulators can lend a hand is maybe they need some smart contract auditors on their team maybe they want to spin up some transparency dashboards this is where defy can use your help not uh to say that like we're getting rid of all d5 anyway uh don't know how many regulators listen to bank list but that's our message to them here's another take david from aubrey what's she saying yeah aubrey the first time we got aubry taken here she goes sbf will own everything and you'll be happy why is she saying this because spf is like buying up everything he's like the lender of last resort he's like trying to buy ftx uh they provided a credit window for a bunch of other things spf and like alameda and all these people that like were capitalized during the the bull market and like had a lot of stables are now like looking at some pretty sweet deals right now so i don't think this is a fair tweet david because cz is going to own at least some of this too not just we're having cz on the podcast tomorrow so we're going to ask him about the cz of binance of course today for the listeners actually it's probably going on right now as you listen to it okay i'm listening to the roll up i really liked this take i really like the sake this is a kind of a snarky way that also is really educational as to how optimistic roll-ups work uh kobe gircam says the security of optimistic roll-ups is based on the fact that people will with great zeal strive to prove that somebody is wrong on the internet this is how a fraud proof works if you do something fraudulent in an optimistic roll-up you can get away with it but the way that security of these optimistic roll-ups work is like as soon as somebody's doing something fraudulent somebody's out there going to prove that and so security of optimistic rollups based on the fact that the internet people like to prove that other people are wrong and if they do they get rewarded so that is a little quick lesson in how optimistic roll ups are secured everyone becomes an auditor that's the model we're moving towards this is take from bartek being an ethereum roll up is like having the strongest army in the world securing your estate becoming cosmos chain uh you are now protected by your token holders unless you use interchange security an upcoming feature in this case which case you pay atom holders for protection i think this is probably background commentary on dydx's movie certainly from to its own app chain and i know you and i commented on this after the show we have a ton of respect for antonio as a builder he's built something phenomenal with dydx but it also seems like it's going to be a lot of work for them to spill spin up everything necessary for a layer one chain and kind of the analogy to me is like you want to start a butcher shop and so you're founding a country in order to do that right i was like why not just park your butcher shop in a country that already exists because then you mainstream yeah military and tax code system and money system and monetary policy and like defense network and legal like it seems like a lot less work and i think it is and so um this is a comment on that i i do think that there's obviously room for all sorts of chains to spin up but what they are spinning up is um sophisticated nation-state type of economies and um i think that's more difficult to do than some people assume i think that's exactly right and i think that is the loss of the takes ryan should we get into what we're excited about yeah what what are you excited about be bullish on do you see this like awesome brick background behind me ryan i i i do i do it's amazing it looks like you got a ton of room there right yeah so like look at all look at all this space uh and like my desk is in the middle of the space let's see if i can zoom out uh it starts off as a blank brick background but it's gonna it's gonna change in the future right right there's and i'm not just talking about me putting up my nfts on the wall that's what people are envisioning i'm sure you're gonna change i'm sure that's gonna what they're envisioning uh it's gonna change bankless studio is gonna become a thing uh i got some plans i got some plans live st live studio for live podcasts that's what you're talking about right yes what this means yes yeah i did a show with um julia from orca not too long ago and like we were very awkwardly like on the same couch as i interviewed her and then i looked at the youtube comments i was like well that needs to change so this is the change bankless studio it's gonna be awesome man yeah i uh i'm excited to come up there one time with you yeah we'll do your latest video i'll get you on a no i was gonna say i want to get you on a later zero that's my podcast bro i know i gotta interview someone who's gonna interview you you know anthony cesano interview you for layer zero it's gotta be me yeah it's fine yeah that's right that's right ryan what are you excited about um i'm excited i guess about the overconfidence of bears right now um here's something i tweeted out when prices go up too fast people get dumb of course that's true but when prices go down too fast people also get dumb and i'm seeing a lot of the dumb sentiment now david like you know just this morning it was like cruising around reddit the amount of threads this was like on the r slash gaming of like nfts were the dumbest idea ever ha ha crypto bros get wrecked you guys suck uh crypto's so useless it's a scam all of this noise is going on and like detractors and critic critics are absolutely gleeful right and what they don't know is like we've already been through this like three or four times exact same people not the same people necessarily exact same sentiment maybe different set of actors crypto is dead uh and um i i think the overconfidence of the bears actually makes me um optimistic that we are closing in on a potential bottom all right now this could still last a very long time we're still talking uh months potentially years i don't know how long it's going to last but um i'm starting to to hear that like overconfidence that feels very much and sounds very much like bottom type of talk and i think it'll persist for a while but it's actually making me bullish to hear these same kind of the same patterns that we've seen so many times in crypto start to play out in the sentiment right now so just curious uh when prices go up too fast people get dumb when prices go down too fast people also get dumb and what scenario do people not get them uh i think when like there is a sweet spot of sober time do you know like don't you feel like this in every every market like the sweet spot was probably for me for this this cycle around was probably like sometime 2020 early 2020s d5 summer yep and i think in late 2019 into 2020 i feel like we had six months or so maybe nine months of just the sweet spot where things were happening the builders were building the market sentiment was like rational so the end of the the end of the bear market mm-hmm right basically and then that's the sweet spot and then i start to hate my life again like i hate my life i hate my life now when things are like irrationally bearish and everyone's like you're such an idiot you're such a you have a crypto podcast but then i also hate like the market uh i don't know three months ago six months ago when you're like um you know this tara thing might not be sustainable and was like you loser you're so dumb you eat maxi like i hate that side of it too so we only get rest during like this this uh eight month period i don't know six to nine month period maybe in between these two cycles and that's when the market is less done i think i've talked to how i experience it i think i talked about this uh last week with uh anthony when you were on your little ai vacation um uh but like my mom would text me every now and then saying hey i met up with like linda she said like hey how's dave doing is dave doing all right during the crypto crash and like i've gotten these sex like three times like is david is david okay like they know i've been in crypto since 2017. i'm like can you guys please go look at the chart please [Laughter] i tell my mom like hey i'm hiring it they're looking to get a chart well no tell those people to go look at the chart like either a thousand dollars anyways um but just like yeah it's just like so frustrating it's like they don't really ask if i'm doing okay when ether is at four thousand dollars i didn't hear anything then mom david's mom don't be concerned about david until ethan's like double digit okay then you could start right now then i might not be okay at that point he might not be okay but bankless listener we think you're going to be okay this is all going to be okay ryan you said at the end of 2019 start of 2020 was when you felt like most rational and like just the best in the crypto market like that was the era in crypto and i was thinking about this earlier that was the era in crypto where all the people that stuck around during the bear market that's when all the people were like yo wait the bull market it's on that's what happens next like people that stuck around during the bear market they identified that the bull market was started in april of 2020. like we knew this we they everyone had a conviction like yes the mobile gets back on like it's on baby uh and the only way that you were able to know that was if you rode through the bear market and so the people that rode through the bear market were able to ride the bull market from genesis at in like april of 2020 when ether was two to three hundred dollars bitcoin was like six thousand dollars seven thousand dollars uh and then they rode those things like befo and then and then retail figured out that the bull market was on sometime in like middle of 2021 so if you ride through the bear market you have a one year head start in a bull market that generally only lasts about two years so like that's your alpha that's your advantage it's exactly where you want to be exactly and that is the reason you don't leave during times like this when prices are down the reason you stay uh is exactly for that reason totally um all right david let's get to the meme of the week what are we looking at on the screen i'm seeing a whole bunch of uh bulls here this is a these look like sad bulls though this is the uh a uh what are these called the dungeons and dragons like disposition charts or whatever so you got like lawful good neutral good chaotic good you know lawful evil nutrient evil chaotic evil so for the listeners podcast sorry that's gonna be kind of hard to explain and the lawful good corner we got good old usdc being the lawful good like everyone likes you they're all stable clothes they're all stable points they're everything on stable coin yeah uh in the neutral good top top center we got die it's neutral it's one dollar it's good then we also have chaotic good for frax the algorithmic 85 backed algorithmic stable that has admirably held its peg nothing wrong there coming up in the neutral camp we got the lawful neutral of the actual us dollar the fiat in your bank account the cash in your wallet in the true neutral corner we have the the curve 3 pool the tether die uscc curve 3 pool and the bull every single one of these has a bowl that's colored the color of the stable coin and this bowl happens to be both green for uscc uh excuse me blue for uscc green for tether and yellow for dye so true neutral is the curve three pool uh chaotic neutral we got mim didn't that one go to zero i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know um and then in the la in the evil row we got the lawful either which which is evil which is tether it's it's lawful because it's actually one dollar redeemable for one dollar but it's evil because it's a black box uh we got the neutral evil which is us usdd the the terra fork on tron that somehow is maintaining its peg and then we also have chaotic evil in the bottom right corner which is ust terra usd with also if you notice ryan mike novogratz wolf's tattoo only on the arm it's crazy man i definitely agree with the the bottom row i think and uh particularly the the chaotic evil being ust but also this tron stable coin man like that's got to be next to go yeah right like like justin sun i can't believe the the audacity of this i'm going to spin up a stable coin a month before ust go and it's going to be elga backed same kind of mechanism as luna ust and like like that is not okay and if you're in that like be very very careful yeah it's a game of check you're not listening bankless though yeah that's probably true i saw i saw a post that talked about how justin's son had plenty of capital to backstop the backstop the usdd d-pegging and d-peg down to 94 cents but he wanted it to de-peg more so he could buy it at like a cheaper discount so dumb this is terrible justin sun is a central banker no thank you give me give me eth give me bitcoin uh guys of course none of this has been financial advice it never is crypto is risky so is eth so is bitcoin so is all of it you could lose what you put in definitely but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad
