uh Bitcoin gets nfts but the community wants to censor it Banco station it is the first Friday of February and it's time for the what David the Friday weekly roll up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless Ryan I've drank about two times the amount of coffee that I usually do so that is a fair warning to the bankless listeners out there your boy is caffeinated yeah I could tell I could tell from some of your Twitter activity I had to like literally pull you away in order to do this show uh slow down there my boy all right we got uh this this month though for you you're doing a lot of travel right you got some conferences coming up I got two conference month but you're like it's not comfortable I'm like two

that and then at the end of the month in Israel in Israel yeah are you ready for those big brains I mean you are a big brain in your in your element but this is like that's the difference yeah it's cryptography big brain and no I'm not ready for that like uh account abstraction ZK Roll-Ups like it really stretches what I might bring is able to comprehend uh we'll see if I come back broken or or not we'll see or full of new ideas yeah hopefully the latter but you know we'll so you got that and then what else Denver uh East Denver at the end of the month which is where uh bankless the bankless nation is going to have its first ever in real life Meetup which we will talk about later in the show that's awesome all right so what are we going to get into this week David first we're going to talk about the markets Ryan because the markets are hot token appetite is absolutely in we're gonna talk about the layer two tokens that are up we're going to talk about the layer two app tokens that are up and some other layer ones as well so that's coming in first uh caffeinated and bullish today caffeinated and bullish is the best combination it's the best combination uh after this the FTX story continues uh we're gonna find out who exactly is paying for spf's legal fees uh and also SPF trying to engage in witness tampering seriously uh we'll talk about that and also third uh but also so much more after this uh Bitcoin has nfts oh cool yeah did you hear about this yeah I heard about this um so I'm sure everyone in the Bitcoin Community is super excited about it right everyone everyone loves it everyone loves nfts on bitcoin not only nfts on bitcoin Ryan but uh right before we were recording uh I was actually playing doom on bitcoin I could play that in my uh TI-83 calculator Bitcoin I'm not saying by the way that Bitcoin is a calculator and ethereum is like more like a smartphone not drawing that analogy at all but uh that's pretty cool doom on bitcoin I will absolutely draw that analogy Bitcoin is at least as powerful as a t84 calculator uh so that and like so much more is going to come in this weekly roll up so make sure that you like and subscribe rate and review wherever you are these YouTube these YouTube videos come out every Friday and podcasts as well uh so make sure that you're subscribed so you don't miss a weekly roll up oh only rated though if you're given a five star yes yeah five stars I think I think our rating is like 4.9 so if you give us a four star you're actually bringing us down don't do that oh wow a bunch of haters it's gonna be 4.8 tomorrow next week sorry about that guys hey uh one thing before we get it get in gotta tell them about this really cool new resource it is called metamask learn you want to learn some crypto you'd start here David what are we looking at green oh we are looking at a brand new educational platform from metamask and so not only is metamask giving going to give you a self-custodial wallet they will also teach you how to use it but also if your friends or family are ever like hey can you teach me how to do crypto things you can send is that the voice they use is that what your family sounds like that's exactly yeah you can send them to metamask learn and so that's learn.metamas.io and it will walk you through some very basic crypto web 3 Concepts it will also teach you how to manage a wallet but also teach you so much more what is digital identity why self-custody is amazing nfts and creators what is defy and so it's this uh immersive platform immersive and engaging platform for you to educate yourself or pass along the responsibility of educating others so you don't have to do that heavy lift onto metamask that learn so again there's a link in the show notes learn Dot metamask.io this is really cool you can actually simulate using a metamask wallet it's like a course type structure optimized for learning so thanks to our friends and sponsors at metamask for teaming us up with that all right David let's get to the good stuff caffeinated and bullish you told us about the caffeine now tell us about the bullishness what does Bitcoin doing on the week Bitcoin starting the week at 22 750 and it is now up five percent to 23 880 at least at the time of recording actually no it's at 24 000 because my numbers are already out of date he's probably starting the week at 1566 ending the week oh we are just oh we just broke 1700. oh that's great [Music] yeah when was last time we hit 1700. I'm zooming out look at this chart charting on Kraken Pro wow yeah the Kraken Pro ux is awesome I've been tinkering around so you have Bitcoin US Dollars you have ether US Dollars you have also the BTC ratio those are actually modular and you can drag them around and have multiple window views in the same screen I mean I'm not sure if you'll be able to Ryan because you're not a charter but yeah so other people's work experience out normal people can no normal people can figure this out it's not right not Ryan though well this is great man uh we're we're up and we're doing well I mean this has been a killer month where do we start at the beginning of uh January oh God it was bad it's something like 1200 1200 1200 yeah 1200 at the start of the month we're at Seventeen hundred and three dollars at the time [Music] is definitely some strong resistance we are just poking through it at the time of 1 40 p.m eastern time on Thursday the second uh if we can poke through this resistance and hold that that is a big deal that's a big one 1700 resistance is hard back to 4 500K 4 500 I mean 4 500 okay would be a large number yeah well no so like we have to actually break through it and then sustain it like we could hit the ceiling and bounce back down and that's also a possibility but the fact that we are have our eyes above 1700 is pretty damn good uh so it was up seven percent when we were at the price of 16.77 but now we're at 1702 so what is that eight or nine percent yeah I mean people getting bullish again and the question is bear Market dead is is the question but I gotta pause and say uh feels like it's been way too easy it has to kill the baby bear market like I mean it's it look it's all in one month right so uh it's been it's moved fast I think something it's moved fast uh it doesn't feel sustainable at least to me but what do I know let's look at the Bitcoin ratio what's that telling us uh .0707 almost up to point zero seven one starting the week at .069 almost up to .071 so definitely a good week for the ratio up uh 50 we've got to be above a trillion 1.1 trillion and one point five trillion yes yeah that's only two trillion off uh all-time highest casual two trillion yeah I mean it's not that it's not that far we've been much further away I love the 2017 Highs at least there's that so this is crazy I think this is a giga bullish if you're an ultrasound money fan like David myself uh we are the most deflationary since the merge I think we've ever been that's correct all-time lows in terms of each Supply since the merge am I right about this that is correct eth price is at all-time high since the merge East Supply is at all time low since the merge uh that is what I would call nice so eth is selling blocks that's what this is because every time it sells a block uh there's a little bit of a burnt eth and if that outstrips the amount of eth issued then you get the net issuance burn and that's what we're saying is burn so the product is hot the product is selling uh eth blocks are being sold and eth the asset is net deflationary since since the merge it's pretty crazy can we just run that that calculation again so supply chain since the merge that is in September September what was that September 14th yeah I feel like I should know that date I feel like I should know that 140 days since the emerge so 140 days ago and we are negative 7 000 eth let's just simulate if the merge hadn't happened let me press this button whoa 0.638 million wow big difference hold on I'm doing the math I'm doing the math with my calculator at 1700. I have to turn it I have to turn my iPhone sideways to get the number because it's it's too big 2.7 billion dollars of ether has not been issued since the merge because of proof of stake 2.7 well actually 2.8 2.8 billion dollars has not been minted and sold to minors 2.7 billion of selling pressure removed from the market we would have to sell that Ethan to the market and each price would be a lot it would be lower than 1700 if the market had to absorb all of that selling pressure through Buzz so instead of to instead of issuing 2.8 billion dollars ether has reclaimed 12 million dollars and 12 million is not a large number compared to 2.8 billion but the fact that we are reclaiming 12 million dollars of economic energy instead of losing 2.8 billion dollars of economic energy is massive geez I could watch this chart all day I think I could I could talk about this all day we know this is like uh a dividend back to all etholders too right because that burn gets evenly distributed I suppose in terms of upside to everyone that owns Eve so this is not a validator feature this is a you're just a an average folder feature yes so good all right well we got more markets to cover let's talk a little bit about some of the news in the markets gotta talk about the FED watch so the fmoc meeting happened this week did we go higher or lower uh or did we say the same on the interest rate David uh the interest rates Ryan went up they went out by 25 basis points AKA 0.25 I hate the word basis point it's so dumb you hate that word I hate it 25 basis points yeah I think you make two five percent yeah it sounds like you I feel like you have to wear a tie a suit and a tie to say those words I think that most people don't understand what a basis point is out there in the real world and so saying it automatically makes yourself like makes you a fin right like a financing or something yeah yeah it's like quantitative easing do you mean yeah do you mean money printing is that what you mean yeah yeah I get it I'm not a huge fan but I do feel a little cool when I say it sometimes I'm not gonna promise to never say it on Bank list don't call me a hypocrite anyway we're off subject but that is 0.25 25 basis points is less than usual right because usually it's about 0.5 or 0.75 is that what it's been historically for the last few races I think that's right I think this is the the smallest rate hike that we've had since we've started hiking I think that's correct well Powell says policy is going to remain restrictive for some time he says this we have to complete the job that's what we're here for have to complete the job that's what you're here for stay and steady staying restrictive but a lot of people say kind of the worst is over this was um some of the sentiment reflected on uh our podcast with not only Chris berninski uh that episode came out earlier this week but also Eric Peters which he has one River Capital Management a very large crypto hedge fund Dave and I caught up with him and talked to him that episode is coming out not next week but the week after he said the same thing basically the worst is over and so we might still get some more raises of course in the future but we've the rate of change has slowed right like we're beginning The Descent uh I suppose you might say and I think that's what the market is reacting to is that why we're up this week David uh that's as soon as the 25 basis points news broke markets across the board both crypto and Trad markets all pumped bigly the S P 500 jumped to one percent which is a huge move for the s p Big Move big moves yeah that's a one percent move yeah everyone's excited about that the Federal Reserve raised rates chair Powell says it's premature to declare Victory against inflation so we may have topped on inflation but premature to declare Victory um yeah the s p up one percent that's always like to point out just a little bit Genesis Capital was announced going to bankruptcy the markets did not respond negatively in fact they started pumping afterwards the lower interest rate hike was announced and markets did respond very positively to that so markets are not being negative to bad news and they are being positive to good news so that are those are signals to pay attention to I think the next big thing is the CPA the febu January CPI print which will come out in like a week or so uh and if that is negative that will be the fourth month Infinity row of negative inflation reporting and I would expect if that does happen that markets would respond positively to that if it does happen happy music again but it doesn't feel like it's over I feel like all of this has been too easy David there's something like that in the pit of my stomach uh d y d or dxy so that is the dollar Index down four months in a row this is a chart that you put up why do we care about the dollar strength uh the dollar strength is falling four months in a row which is just indicating that uh there is appetite to go out of dollars versus sell dollars for other things yeah yeah that's interesting in the Eurozone meanwhile in Europe inflation eased more than anticipated uh and there's some debate I guess being had over the European Central Bank rate policy what should they do in the future should they begin hitting the brakes uh or what so similar sentiment happening in Europe at this point in time I have no further comments I would like to I would like to talk about tokens now can we talk about tokens yes David has no further comments on the ECB very much I would like to talk about the tokens Ryan tokens are up up caffeinated and bullish I told you it was gonna happen uh what are we looking at is this monthly price for op immutable IMX and Matic uh these are no yeah these are actually 24-hour prices however uh monthly prices are also yeah I can't make coin gecko report monthly prices uh these are the prices in the last 24 hours optimize that I could do that screaming to brand new all-time highs optimism coming in at 2.82 cents that's up 25 in the last 24 hours uh immutable up 19 in the last 24 hours Matic up 13 in the last 24 hours but uh monthly price movements are pretty like they're green they're very very green like optimism has been hitting all-time highs all month uh Matic is coming back very strongly L2 tokens are in right now big in uh dude you know what's crazy the optimism fully diluted valuation is basically on par with the polygon fully diluted valuation what yeah yeah 12 12.1 billion for optimism and 12.4 billion for for polygon wow big difference is of course optimism has a lot more tokens locked up yes you look at that market cap in terms of liquid Supply so it's a lot lower on the optimism to point out yeah so point so 600 million is the market cap for optimism so that's how many tokens are actually liquid in trading uh but the market cap for polygon is 11 billion so a polygon has gone through much more price Discovery than optimism has did you say IMX too that's uh immedibox token that's up 20 yeah a month in the last 24 hours um pretty crazy well we got some more tokens here more tokens more tokens GMS and velodrome uh they are also doing things yeah so these are just a three tokens just because that's the space that we have on screen uh three tokens that I picked out arbitrum tokens all kind of just the charts just all looks so good GMX uh 68 up 20 that was the one that's the token that was the only token that actually went up in 2022 and it's continuing to go up in 2023 so far uh Magic is a token that I have exposure to so uh the disclaimer uh is is just printing new new all-time Heinz felodrome which is a token on optimism also hitting uh local highs just the the L2 trade is on right now Big Time LT trade that that is carrying over not only to the layer to asset itself but also to so yeah Flagship tokens in the app player on top of them um how about Kanto so this is another I think a layer one story and uh we brought this chart in here for a reason this is the 24 hour review but I want to look at the 30 freaking day view look at this from uh I'll view it Marquee cap has that so we went from a 35 000 35 million dollar market cap beginning of January all the way to 230 million dollars market cap at this point in time a little 10x in January wow uh should tokens be doing that we sure about this one what's happening over in Kanto world uh so variant put out a blog post about their position in uh Kanto and then also kind of talked about uh why what their what their deal is with it and why they're why they believe in it so they call it a layer one incentive experiment so Kanto uh they they use a bunch of just like um they use a bunch of wild going west metaphors which you know you know gets me going uh and they talk about like nationalizing a lot of the infrastructure that gets built and gets it built into the chain so Kanto has a decentralized exchange a lending market and a stable coin all uh quote unquote nationalize public goods built into the chain itself and so after they uh release this blog post it just kind of created a attention and sufficient attention on Kanto and now say nationalized are you talking about like in a similar way I almost think um you know Tara and Luna like um Tara kind of nationalized an algorithmic stable coin right because it had usct that was backed by Luna and it was sort of part of the same that the entire ecosystem is that kind of what kanta is doing with some of these protocols I think so but then I like communicated that point is like yeah like Kanto is taking like infrastructure and nationalizing and trying into the Baseline base chain and then Scott the founder was like that's not right yeah and so I'm kind of confused about I thought that that's right and that's what this article says uh is that what you've been getting on Twitter fights over all morning a little bit Yeah well you know what we're gonna have them on I think next week right to um understand what is happening with Kanto and how this change is structured it is not a layer two though no this is a layer one we are talking about a layer one right now yeah yeah a different different layer one what what is this built on is this built on a tenderbent is this like Cosmos uh app chain it's an evm compatible chain so evm Fork uh with a bridge to ethereum I don't know how the bridge works so bridge at your own risk uh yeah but we're having Zach Cole for those that remember Zach Cole uh super hilarious guy uh used to be at White blocks uh just been in the space for a very long time a very funny guy Zach Cole's coming on to talk about Kinto interesting well beware of this I think when a token pumps uh you know 10x um you know I'll beware but also it's something to investigate so we're going to continue the investigation uh of that next week um there's some other things that we got to talk about uh in in sort of Pump News well one was dydx we talked about that a little bit last week David dydx is pumping because they changed the vesting schedule I guess more information has come out about that vesting schedule it seems like maybe mistakes were made some of this wasn't smart contract secured uh tell us the story about dydx's pump and subsequent vesting uh controversy yeah so when dydx kicked out their vesting unlock like six months and then it created the dydx pump that we've seen recently at least that's how people are analyzing it and as a result of that that put attention onto the vesting schedule so this one uh on chain sleuth if you will on-chain investigator went to go check out what the vesting contracts actually looked like and they end up their tweet their their first tweet on a thread saying it's not pretty uh and then so that triggered me to read this thread uh to go investigate and I'm reminded of here's here's a fun little side side quest of a story Ryan there was this lawyer uh back in the Ico days that went and actually investigated the claimed smart contracts of the token lockup schedules for teams and so teams would say like hey here's here's the team allocation we're vested for this long and we have this much Supply and then the lawyer went and actually investigated the smart contracts to see if the smart contracts that of the tokens actually resembled what was stated by the public literature of the icos and he said the he discovered something like 85 percent of icos did not actually have their stated vesting schedules codified in the smart contract it was just like trusted it was just a just a pinky promise though Pinky Promise yes exactly when you could have put it into a smart contract you just didn't and said like oh we're we'll just abide by it you know um yeah guess what unbelievable what the name of this professor was yeah I don't know what's the name Dave Hoffman no way yeah we follow each other on Twitter he doesn't really care about the crystal world yeah I know he doesn't really care he doesn't really care about the crypto world but when the Ico Mania was going he decided right right that's right Dave there can only be one David Hoffman all right he's not bangers go flee to another industry anyways I think you can see where we're anyways I think you can see where we're going with this uh dydx did not enforce investing schedules in their smart contract it's a little sloppy oops yeah come on guys like this is what a smart contract does uh it does this work for you uh and so uh this uh spreak this account went and investigated all of the uh investor allocations and noticed that people were selling uh and then and then later buying back the tokens that they sold uh and it's impossible to to tell what is an oopsie versus what is actually being malicious uh Brian Armstrong's actually is in this list and it's I think it's pretty easy to identify that Brian Armstrong made a whoopsie uh he's got a lot to lose he's got a lot a lot to lose yeah sold his dydx allocations and then went and bought it back like pretty damn quickly afterwards uh because they didn't enforce it in the smart contract level other investors have very clearly sold their tokens and not bought back their tokens but I think the conclusion the speculative conclusion of this uh tweet thread person says that like uh it's clearly someone at dydx in the DUI DX comms or compliance are like reaching out to people who sold their DUI DX tokens and then say hey dude you're still vested you have to go buy background look a little bit of sloppiness right that's really slow they're trying to unwind it um I I guess what I'm excited about is uh we can see all of them we can see you we get to see it on chain you know we we had to take that um in 2022 the reason D5 held up and C5 didn't was because defy was right regulated and see if I wasn't D5 was regulated and C5 wasn't you know how it was regulated David smart contract by code Yeah by code I mean the reason why we're here yeah it was like we had the regulation on chain so you could see what was backing an asset like Ave what was backing asset like compound we didn't need The Regulators quote unquote because that regulation was enforced via code on chain where anyone can audit it okay but when C5 was involved it actually needed some Regulators to step in and make sure that people were uh people were respecting the pinky promise right they were actually doing what they said they were going to do right and that there were penalties if they didn't so I guess the takeaway here is like uh Hey defy let's make sure when we have vesting contracts let's make sure we are enforcing them via Smart contracts because that's what we have this we have the tools yeah let's not let's not be dumb about it uh anyway what else do you got here this is coinbase it is also up coin yes coin the token I almost said it's not a token is it what is this yeah so this is this thing called Equity the equity Equity ticker symbol is called where's that traded it is the equity of coinbase the exchange it's traded on the NASDAQ and it's also up 150 from the bottom there you go well you know it was ridiculously low before so we'll see if it can sustain that but uh also some good news of maybe uh out of the bear Market um this was a this was a funny headline uh cell token the Celsius token rallies 150 after Judge Martin Glenn ordered that Celsius assets put under custody by open ai's chat gbt uh depositors need a capable strong decision maker at the Helms at Glenn which is why the court has decided to turn full control over Celsius Asset Management over to chat gbt Celsius token pumps 150 percent David you actually got me this time oh wait really you actually got me I can't believe that okay this is this is the rug uh we said that we would do this last week uh so I guess it's not paying attention we'll be keeping this yeah so this is a rug uh so this is the onion of crypto this is not this did not actually it's not actually actually happen Celsius didn't even even rally did it no it did I don't even know I'm sure it's on the floor but this is Ryan rugged uh so congratulations to the team at the rug you guys are running again though uh so yes what is the rug if you'd miss it last week the rug is the onion of crypto it's a product out of the bank list Dao you can go to therug.mir.xyz if you would like to collect this rug collect the rug that rugged successfully rugged Ryan uh Ryan got rugged I can't believe it never happened again that's one of one all right all right that's markets David we got a lot more to cover though big news stuff what's happening uh coming up next the list of FTX creditors full of famous names so we're going to read off famous names that FTX owes some money to uh Bitcoin gets nfts but the community wants to censor it and there's also some other stuff as well there's uh the blur versus Open Sea Wars cardano Ryan gets a stable coin and Bedrock goes to governance vote as well as so much more but first a moment to talk about these sponsors that make this episode possible especially Kraken which is our preferred exchange for 2023 because kraken's

kraken.com bankless how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop Bitcoin has nfts but Bitcoin Maxis don't actually want this to happen of course David uh this is an interesting story I've been following a little bit on crypto Twitter um nudging there and here and there in the in the debate Circle as well but tell us what's happening how is Bitcoin getting nfts I didn't know this was possible yeah so there's this new protocol called ordinals which is a protocol that converts individual Satoshi so one Satoshi into a non-fungible digital artifact AKA nft um this has caused a bunch of controversy so this actually by a Satoshi David that's like the the unit of Bitcoin right the smallest unit the smallest one because it would be a guay uh away aguay is a thousand way away is the smallest unit God get your youth Maxi hat on um sorry uh and so yeah so ordinals so there's this um the uh when Taproot came into Bitcoin it created what is kind of like blob space on bitcoin uh an extra way to put data into the blockchain Bitcoin data availability layer for Bitcoin kind of it's not a one-to-one but it's the correct mental model to to understand this uh and so um the the way that this works is that because there's this extra way to add data to bitcoin you can add more kinds of data than what would otherwise be a compliant transaction and so ordinals allows you to Mint and store data on the Bitcoin blockchain with no external dependencies no ipfs and so when you put data like this on the blockchain the full kind of data is there so these nfts are on the Bitcoin blockchain forever so wait wait so the nfts I'm looking at right now and by the way this looks like almost like a sound nft yeah it's it's it's it's data dude you can put data on Bitcoin now through order wow so guys if you're not seeing this uh on screen if you're listening to the podcast what I'm looking at is um Bitcoin nfts that are actually on bitcoin a little slow to load um you know the TI-83 takes a little bit to boot up here it is um different Apes I see yeah these are not board Apes the well kind of resemble them I saw some you know sound files here some weird stuff stuff but like they look like nfts my understanding these things David is like these are fully Unchained yes so it's not like in ipfs right somewhere uh or our weave this is actually on the Bitcoin blockchain and uh you have to pay fees like Bitcoin fees in order to store this data on bitcoin blockchain right it's like Bitcoin Bitcoin gas they do too Bitcoin also just like ethereum Bitcoin also sells blocks and so if you like to put your data on bitcoin you have to buy that block space well this sounds great how exciting Bitcoin is now entering nfts I'm sure everyone was really excited about this if people want to consume Bitcoin block space and to put data there they are free to do so um not everyone was excited about this this is a nice visualization so this on the left side we have a what's uh this website is projecting as a projected block and so these are all transactions the squares are the size of the data so the big squares are like bundles of transactions where the smaller squares are individual transactions uh and then on the right you have an ordinal which you can see why it takes the whole block it takes the whole because you can you can take up so as long as you pay for it Bitcoin is supposed to go up to like ish one megabyte of normal transaction fees but because of the way Taproot works it can or segwit or something you can go all the way up to four megabytes and so through ordinals you can squeeze in four megabytes of data onto the block and just so I understand what I'm looking at so it's all what are the significance of the this is a Bitcoin a block right right these are transactions on the left yeah it's the purple basically um used block space and the green kind of unused box base I don't know no I I don't know the difference between um the colors the size is the size of data and the idea is that like more like you can bundle up multiple transactions into one transaction so like a big block on the left side would be like coinbase sending 50 Bitcoin transactions at once or 100 Bitcoin transactions transfer yes okay but then this actual block what was this Blue Block is an nft that's an nft on bitcoin wow yeah so um they're selling block space that's a good thing this big big block Revenue big block Revenue uh so this is Katie uh Casey excuse me Rhoda Moore uh who is the creator of ordinals uh and there has been a bunch of resistance from the Bitcoin World about this and how some are have said it is an illegitimate use of Bitcoin illegitimate transactions are the worst before we get to Casey's take can we talk about some of the like the the pushback against this show that show the revenue chart go up go scroll up into the revenue chart okay that one this yeah or excuse me that's not Revenue but that's block size but it's kind of the same thing uh so ordinals are inflating block sizes and weights also generating fees from for uh for minors uh and so block size is up block if fees are up and miners are making more money all right David so so what's the controversy they're selling blocks why are people upset well when you take all of that block space and you allow it to be uh for an nft you're pushing out you know what Bitcoin Maxis are calling legitimate Bitcoin transactions as in BTC transfers which is the narrative Narrative of what the point of Bitcoin is is Bitcoin what does Bitcoin do it transfers Bitcoins from account to account when you fill up all that space with a JPEG you get reactions like this who is uh this is Dr Nick which I'm going to guess is a Bitcoin Maxi evil jpegs are invading the sacred Bitcoin block space this is also could be satire this also could be satire uh but but the point is is that that is people's takes like people that is that is a Bitcoin take that that we've seen or or and with takes like it right so here's Adam back uh saying it's fair game for miners to censor this crap as a form of discouragement saying like yeah okay we don't have to allow this crap into our blockchain like miners to just like not allow these transactions to make it into the chain which is um a take that's a take yeah he's saying we can reckon add him back again we can recognize we can't really stop them and it's a free world with Anonymous miners but we can also educate and encourage developers who care about bitcoin's use case either not do that or to do it in a printable space efficient EG time stamp way the are trying to enforce this on the social layer I suppose because they don't have any other recourse and including in the social layers also miners maybe if you could convince miners not to process these sorts of blocks then maybe you've got something but aren't miners just interest rational interested um rationally interested actors and so they'll just block the largest fee yeah as much Bitcoin as possible so they take the highest view as possible and the highest fees can be paid by nfts what's Eric Wallace take on the Bitcoin takes here uh so this is a response to how like bitcoiners are like talking about how ethereum is quote unquote you know censored because of ofac even though that's completely not true so Eric Eric is saying Bitcoin Maxi's raffle coptered ethereum validators censoring o-fac transactions when's the last time you heard the word brothelcopter Middle School uh yeah and now themselves are deliberating ways of censoring Bitcoin nfts and so uh the irony is not lost on Eric Wall nor myself okay nor me no this is the creator of this uh protocol what's a protocol called again ordinals ordinals okay this is the creator of ordinals and what is he saying here I understand the argument that nfts are lame and stupid but I don't understand the argument that nfts are somehow illegitimate Bitcoin has transcended its original Creator and purpose Bitcoin is not for some things and not and not for other things Bitcoin just is which is just to say that there is no such thing as a legitimate or illegitimate use of Bitcoin block space if you pay for the blocks base it's a legitimate transaction is my attitude and that's what Casey is saying how come this guy sounds more bitcoiner than Adam and back does right now I don't know uh because some bitcoiners have lost the plot what are these what's this uh this is a looks like ether rocks were transposed to the Bitcoin blockchain ether rocks and nft uh so now there's a bunch of ethereum ether rocks Bitcoin yeah those things conscription is this the Doom that you were talking about yeah so this is what I was tinkering around with I couldn't figure out how to turn but yeah you you can probably play that right you can probably play that right now it's hit wasd on your keyboard uh yeah yeah yeah you're playing you're playing Doom shoot those guys shoot him uh with space bar uh I don't know actually people people are trying to figure out how to control this thing I've only figured out how you can go forward backwards I'm down but Ryan is currently playing doom on bitcoin right now wow what a magical experience you said Bitcoin is useless do you know what um here's what I feel about this debate though like uh transaction fees are real down oh I just got shot dude I'm escaping out of this game um let's go to crypto fees before these guys kill me go to crypto fees dot info let's look at the transaction fees so ethereum is selling 0.2 you haven't seen Bitcoin this high in such a long time Bitcoin is selling this is average daily fees 4.2 million for ethereum average daily fees are 328k for Bitcoin I remember a time I remember time when Bitcoin was way bigger than ethereum in terms of transaction fees and I remember um people like Nick Carter would actually talk about this yeah and say how good this was for Bitcoin showed the strength of Bitcoin now it's way down if you are a bitcoiner don't you want to increase Bitcoin block space sales because over time your issuance goes to zero it's going to go to zero and then the only way you can actually secure your network is through block space fee sales so you want these to be as high as possible don't you what am I missing here well so the the bitcoiner philosophy is that this uh removes the money-ness of Bitcoin so the the comparison here is that gold the money the value of gold is like 99.99 monetary premium and like .001 use in Industry like gold wires go like gold teeth gold plating and stuff like that and uh Bitcoin or philosophy is that it's bullish that to have only monetary premium and no utility because you're just a money and that is that like Immaculate Conception story it's all about you know premium campaign premium I get that but in order to do that you actually have to make um you actually have to win that narrative battle and make Bitcoin enough money so that the Bitcoin transactions crowd out all of the other use of Bitcoin box base you have to earn that you can't just this is the way we want it right Bitcoin has to earn those blocks doesn't it sure um yes uh so what's happening here is that Bitcoin is actually growing in utility as in hey we can use the Bitcoin block space to store data and do things with those data now fun fact this is actually the same philosophy as Bitcoin satoshi's Vision which is definitely not uh I don't claim to uh understand that right the scam project by Craig right yes that's right yeah uh whether it's definitely not satoshi's Vision not that I know what satoshi's Vision was but no one knows what satoshi's Vision was but the idea of satoshi's vision is like they had something like gigabyte size blocks or something like 256 megabyte size blocks something crazy and they would put like they would just like have it like weather like just log the state of the world like and and they started with weather data but the idea was that you would just be able to put all the data on bitcoin Bitcoin SV and so this is a little bit on that Spectrum right like enough like four megabytes for nfts on bitcoin so that you can host data on bitcoin and generate block space demand uh for that so like that's kind of what's Happening Here uh and then bitcoiners are like no Bitcoin is for money and money alone we should say some bitcoiners it's something more the fundamentalists all right sorry I don't mean to Blink it well all bitcoiners it's interesting I it's very interesting to see how this uh kind of evolves over time David and uh in order to facilitate these conversations because that's what banklist does we like to facilitate conversation uh I'm hosting Eric wall and Casey rodimer rodimer uh we're recording tonight we might be live streaming uh or and if we're not live streaming then we'll release it later uh but the creator of ordinals plus Eric wall who's my bitcoiner uh substitute co-host on Bank list uh to come in and talk about this uh so we're recording that tonight that show will be out soon that will be fascinating um all right let's talk about FTX so FTX creditor list it was released and it includes a whole bunch of star athletes crypto firms and state governments David who does FTX owe money at this point what are some of the names give us the juicy details I think I can do this all in one breath you ready yeah go okay a list of creditors are Apple Amazon web services meta LinkedIn Twitter Netflix Adobe coinbase Finance Capital Management chain analysis Hugo Labs Doodles block fight silvergate Bank Wall Street Journal coindesk benzinga Tom Brady David Ortiz from the Red Sox the prime minister of Bahamas other government officials for other island nations as well as U.S state tax consumer affairs and Attorney General Offices uh that was just that was just the name that we put decided to say there are other names as well nice job you Brett um this just in as well judge a judge rules the identities of two people who helped secure sbf's 250 million dollar bail can be made public so outstanding question is how did SBF get the money for bail because I thought his account was down to kind of zero at this point he has a hundred thousand so he says so he says so he says so you're about to find out who posted 250 million dollars of bailout we probably would also where that money came from but no we do not know yet who do you think it was any guesses uh CZ the least likely person to do it would be easy gotta have some friends with a lot of money like yeah somewhere I mean he still is who still is sbf's friend with a lot of money at this point because it seems like a Democrat a lot of the friends why do you hope this because because of peak drama okay David is optimizing for Peak drama right now optimizing for drama right now do you know so like because he's lost his friends a lot of money it's it's hard to imagine any friend who would have this kind of resource so yeah we'll see yeah yeah that's a good point there's zero people who have to consider themselves SPF friends anymore I don't know maybe still got some friends for some reason there's also some uh maybe evidence it's hard to know a witness tampering here this is a tweet from uh tier 10K the account it I should mention we haven't checked this as a source so I'm not sure right 100 but this is allegedly an email from Sam bankman freed to possibly a witness in the entire FDX case and this is SPF saying hey blank I know it's been a while since we've talked now I know things have ended up in the wrong foot I would really love to reconnect and see if there's a way for us to have a constructive relationship use each other's Resource as resources when possible or at least vet things with each other I mean what do you think is the implication of this type of an email assuming it's true David uh I mean I it's easier to tell an email when the through line is hey I have a request of you that's basically what this email is he's saying let's get our story straight before we go in there yeah also can you please help me uh spin my narrative what's interesting apparently there was multiple emails like this so that was just this is just one email there's other emails like here here's another one almost the same copy pasta so here's a different email to a different person hey Ray uh hey Mr Ray uh who is this uh Ray John Ray uh I know things haven't gotten off on the right foot but I do want to be helpful whether on the funds or on anything else hopefully it's just you guys moving the funds I don't know what that means but it's not good as I'm guessing you heard I'm in New York City for the next day I'd love to meet up while I'm here or eve even if just to say hi why does SPF have enough time on his hands to just say hi to people in case you're available I'm free before noon Eastern or from roughly four to six tomorrow Tuesday in the city why is he writing he's in New York yo SPF uh come over to my place you want you want SPF to come over to your house yeah we'll we'll I've got I've got a studio here in the back I'll sit right there and SPF will sit right there and we'll do a podcast SPF come on uh send me an email like this yeah Dear Mr Hoffman I know the last conversation we had was somewhat contentious I'm here to make events at first I wanted to say I'm sorry I'd be happy to swing by your place don't do it David um well you know what this is what's happening of course uh some things like that rumors like that maybe these are real emails and correspondences so a federal judge just barred SPF from contacting any of these people any people at FDX and any of the people uh uh at Alameda via signal apparently he was doing this via signal as well so um to try to put a stop to that to add on to that in addition to he is now banned from contacting FDX and Alameda employees he is also banned from using signal at all to contact anyone because yes yeah Dad says no more signal sorry SPF um so allegedly he reached out to FTX Us's General counselor Ryan Miller via signal and I'm guessing Ryan Miller went straight to the authorities which is probably why we know that yeah I think you'd probably want to do that at this point by the way David if you do get DM by SBF you should probably like uh I don't know would I get in trouble for not reporting that to the authorities if SPF identity on Signal and he was like let's do a podcast do I have to report that to this what else he said after that sentence I think SPF hit me up bro spf's mother and brother are not cooperating with the financial Pro uh apparently it's very weird how his family is tied up into this yeah and I'm sure we'll see some more unfolding there as soon as the documentary comes up produced by malk Mark Wahlberg this is not a rug this should be a rug like news article Marky marks it is so that's a difficult ask Ryan to make the rug produce the most ridiculous headlines in this space that is a hard ask so I've heard there are many different documentaries so Marky Mark's gonna have his work cut out for him if he's gonna produce the canonical documentary this one's about FTX and binance though some sort of rivalry uh wow how weird is this I Mark Wahlberg making a documentary about FTX this is a great time I just wish she started it who would it we we are we are deserved we deserve this this is in a good way yeah like we've got through so much pain we need Marky Mark to uh he's only producing it David I I need to oh he's not in it no it's fine fine that's fine I mean he would make a great let me see Marky Mark who's he the most like in crypto uh he can be hmm there's no one like Marky Mark and crypto you have any analog uh I don't I'm not very good at Brian Armstrong no [ __ ] close yeah I don't know yeah I don't know anyway Marky Mark's only producing he's not acting in it so uh that's the news this week those are the big news items David what do we got coming up next why should people stick around uh what's your stick around because this is apparently a very giggly episode ethereum ofac compliance is it up or down place your bets uh also after that which communities are willing to self-limit their staking percentage for the stake of the uh for the sake of the ethereum economy we also got talks about optimism Bedrock uh staking withdrawals test net immutable X Harmony mismanaging funds and bullying workers we're going to talk about that it doesn't look good the blur and Open Sea Wars cardano stablecoin we are able to look inside of world coin or are there so many reasons to stick around so don't go anywhere but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to Arbiter Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free let's start this off with some good news did you know David ofac compliant blocks are now down they're less than 60 percent that is down from something like 80 to 85 percent right at their Peak first of all refresh people what are we talking about when we say ofac compliant blocks we're talking the context of ethereum and why is that being down a good thing why are we saying that's a good thing yeah so there are certain sets of block relayers there's not that many of them and some of them have stated hey we are an of fat compliant relayer as in we will not process any tornado cast transactions in our blocks and so the percentage of blocks going through these relayers is what we're looking at here uh and so over time more and more of these relayers were processing more and more the ethereum blocks being ofac compliant that hit 85 at the peak I think is what you said it's worth noting that it only takes one relayer to process non-ofat compliant blocks so ethereum doesn't like your tornado cast transaction if you're outside of the US doesn't get censored unless one would never really be said it's never really been set down yes exactly and so even at 99.9 of ofat compliance you are still able to get your transaction in you just have to wait longer that like you said peaked out at 85 we are now down to 60 and uh the the this number is falling because there are more and more non-offat compliant relays uh coming up and online uh ultrasound money the ultrasound website that we love so much has a relayer there's agnostic boost which has a relayer and this is this is just going to Trend towards zero over time um not totally it'll never be completely yeah but like so people will want to maintain like compliance with their Nation say like shocker um but the fear and fun around this thing was always totally misguided and like Ryan and I said like it's it's was going to inevitably fix itself and we are currently watching that play out the lowest it's been since October 2022 why do we care so much about this is because the credible neutrality and censorship resistance of a layer one blockchain matters yeah all right if it's not ofac it's somebody else trying to censor you and that's a bad thing for a credibly neutral settlement layer for the world um David ethereum news as well the uh staking withdrawal test net has just gone live that means it's coming right we said that last week but uh still on track it looks like the upgrade to ethereum that will enable withdrawals withdrawals of stake is is coming pretty fast yeah users will be able to try out with various withdrawals and deposit features six days after the test net launches when it will be implemented in the Shanghai and capella test Nets and so users will can try out depositing two validators get a sense for how the user interface will behave et cetera et cetera et cetera on track for withdrawals in late March but that late March timeline is a timeline that is my speculation that is not uh any any official timeline yeah I'm sure we'll have a lot of content about what's going to happen at each price around that um could it go up could it go down we will see some news from optimism Bedrock is to be deployed but it's Bedrock Bedrock is the new optimism mainnet and so it is the first application of the op stack which I am super bullish on uh and so oh the optimism's Bedrock is their flavor of the op stack op stack is like this uh uniform skeleton for producing any sort of optimism chain and so optimism Bedrock is the proposal to have the optimism layer 2 upgrade to bedrock is now being put forth to the Token house so this is the optimism dual house governance model you have the citizens house and the token house the token house is of course the op token holders the citizen house is the holders of a soul-bound nft that makes you part of the optimism Collective it's basically like non-fungible governance plus fungible governance so not just token vote but also known citizens of the of the citizen house um making proposals and then the op token house voting and to approve or not approve so this is bedrock is the next crucial upgrade to a modular simplified and performant multi-chain future and like I said it is uh implements the modular architecture that separates the op stack into its three components consensus execution and settlement yeah pretty cool it turns it my the way I think of it very simply is it turns optimism into sort of a an app chain ecosystem where anybody can spin up an optimistic roll-up chain yes yes um this is uh some interesting culture wars between RPL the rockapole community and Lido this is the tweet from nixo saying absolutely wild how different two protocol votes can look when one Community is active invested in long-term health of the chain and the other is there for dominance and short-term gains well that might be a rocket pool cited uh tweet there yeah but what is actually happening what is the the neutral way to interpret what's happened some on-chain vote what were they voting about yeah so Lido voted as to whether or not they should self-limit and what this means is that if you are above a certain threshold of the percentage of ethereum stake that threshold being 33 you have more Powers than you would have if you had less than 33 percent so things are more decentralized if something like Lido were to have 33 percent of all Theory mistake so Lido Once Upon a Time voted do we self-limit ourselves to preserve the credible neutrality of ethereum and 99.8 percent of Lido voters said no don't self limit uh this that was back in June by the way this was a long time ago yes but what's news is that rocketpool just did the vote for the same vote saying uh should rocket pool self-limit ourselves uh and not go above that 33 threshold and 100 of rocketpool votes said yes and so this is just the difference of culture here uh and so the the Anthony cesano take is that it shouldn't need to be said but that Lido is a for-profit company while rocket pool is a protocol that attempts to establish credible neutrality uh so culture wars here we go yeah culture Awards I mean both approaches will be tried certainly what is they mean it's also worth noting and just to check our biases here Ryan and I and bankless are part of the Odell for Rocket pool uh so we do own a supply of Rocket pool uh we we do own a supply of RPL we also stake with rocket pool so we have exposure to the Rock and pull side of things the reason why we do that is because rocket pool tends to be more aligned with ethereum so bankless tends to be more aligned with rocket pool I think that's a fair take is that a fair take that's a fair take but we also have some Lido tokens too David and it's been a sponsor in the past yeah I did not know that the more you know I did not know we're uh we're bullish staking um generally bullish is taking yes immutable X they rolled out a passport this is instant wallet onboarding it says the immutable passport is a non-custodial wallet and authentication solution that streamlines user onboarding through passwordless sign-on okay here's a problem if you're trying to onboard a whole bunch of Gamers David is you have to make them create private keys and remember 12 you know word um seed phrase or 24 word seed phrase that's pretty hard for gamers like yeah I just want to play my game right what do you give me these words um well this is instant onboarding takes care of that through immutable X and it creates an authentication solution I'm also reminded you know of our news last week where um Doodles was like Hey we're moving blockchains we're moving from ethereum to flow why because we want people to be able to sign in with their Gmail account just an email account flow gives us that out of the box and also a bunch of money well maybe that's the cynical take maybe accurate take it's also the cynical take but uh immutable X is graduating to that as well obviously a core requirement to onboard the world is we have to make private Key Management a lot easier so that's what they're doing uh David Harmony execs mismanaged funds and bullied workers ex-staff claim that's the headline what is going on in Harmony and by the way what is harmony not another layer one eth killer from the previous cycle Harmony is one of those many evm clones out there and that tried to fight for relevancy in the alt layer 1 Mania um they were at East Denver they flew in some DJ some famous DJ for like half a million dollars at East Denver and the DJ this is a story that I've heard from previous Harmony employees uh the DJ was like uh you have to buy me a complete DJ set for this one set and they did uh cool anyways mismanagement of funds not no surprise so some quotes from the article um former contractors accused Harmony co-founders of misconduct and mismanagement uh there's a one of the founders of uh Harmony I don't know how to pronounce his name TSE say say uh is uh had this like kind of Adam Newman type cult mentality around him so he exhibited some particular Behavior which I would consider extremely toxic shutting staffer's laptop in the middle of work to command attention uh employees were forced to play over an hour of basketball every single day despite how busy or productive you're trying to be that's not normal no then there was multiple stories about how say TSE again a camera I don't know that how to pronounce the name gerwood grabs staff by the arm and move them around like chess pieces at company events talk behind their backs and belittle them in front of colleagues and Associates and also quote would often stand up in front of us and say I want to cry make me me cry and he would ask us to tell a story to try and make him cry which was very weird they were hiring full-time employees and paying them as contractors and the contractors didn't get time off or other benefits again from the article say was physically assaultive in Harmony's Palo Alto office by one wallet co-founder uh I don't know how to pronounce that name sorry um there was a fight he was physically assaulted man the amount of documentaries he can make in crypto you just gotta find the right one to do uh that's not the end of this one wallet was a application I think that was given a bunch of money uh yes was promised one million dollar grants to build a social wallet uh say ignored messages from one wallet about this funding promise and so promise funding didn't pay them and then uh yeah it's pretty bad the other story I have which is a story from a friend of mine is that they the employees or contractors of Harmony were paid in the token and so they were given a token at a certain price to compensate them for their salary as a contractor so the the token was marked at a certain price and then was sent to the contractors a few weeks later and over the course of 2022 that token price was down only and so they were never actually receiving the amount of money of that they were given in their contract because they didn't pay them in UCC or stable coins they paid them in the L1 token the issue that is going that uh this particular person who used to be a contractor for harmony um is having is that they are now two days after before the deadline having to uh they were given some like W-2 some like IRS statement saying like okay here's how much we paid you you have to pay this much in taxes but the harmony incentive is to inflate how much compensation they had so they can write it off for tax benefits which means that all of their statements their their claimed amount of compensation paid to contractors is over inflated because they're trying to over invest debate tax on the over-inflated money exactly right and they never actually got the money out and and so the story of Harmony is like you have this like cult leader L1 founder and the token price went way too high they mismanaged money they paid for DJs they're throwing their contractors under the bus and the reason why I really wanted to pay attention to this is this is some of the stuff that as an industry we have to make sure does not exist in our industry and we need to self-regulate against it and it's such a hard to be so dumb last like like last cycle people are so dumb I mean in harmony even specifically people like why why does Bank list not have Harmony on the podcast would you guys eat Maximus why do you cover other L1 ecosystems I'm like we don't have to cover every L1 ecosystem I I don't know anything about this the way it's presenting is uh it seems a little strange it seems a little anti-crypto values now you find out all of this this is why we're not like um bringing everybody on on on bankless and advocating for their projects there's a lot of toxicity here what a poorly named project though Harmony yeah like everything you described is a little bit of the opposite of how Harmony I'd say and uh yeah it's a shame um big big cringe Harmony so like the idea is like Harmony's trying to get compliant with the US government because they know that the eye is on them meanwhile they're just throwing all of their previous workers under the bus in order to do so Harmony be better [Music] um I'm just happy to kind of move on and leave projects like that Founders like that the Dustbin of History here uh nft stuff though there is a war going on did you know David between blur versus openc tell us about it this is a tweet from Panda Jackson giving us the tldr what is it uh yeah so this is a really good tweet thread so I'm going to try and speed run this but I'm going to read the whole thing open C and blur are the top two nft marketplaces three months ago open C defended against Blur by requiring new collections to block blur in order to get enforce royalties this was not necessarily like hey don't use our competitor this is Open Seas um enforcing royalty philosophy and blur doesn't enforce royalties and so these are antagon royalties for the creators basically yes I'm a Creator I have an nft every time that gets sold there's a five percent royalty I get that money it Open Season we want to enforce that for the creators right so that's the smart contract level yes unfortunately at that smart contract level and so openc trying to enforce that at the Smart contract level is asynchronous with what blur is trying to do which is trying to have the best nft trading experience for the lowest prices which means they don't enforce royalties blur tried to get itself removed from opensees block list but it failed three days ago from this tweet thread which was two days ago so five days ago six days ago since the time of listening sorry uh blur took a free ride on open CC Port protocol to bypass opensees block list I'll explain what that means so now all collections are now accessible for trading on blur and so the idea is that like nft collections would have to pick one or the other open C or blur what do you do you want to incentivize trading and then you go to blur do you want to incentivize and enforce royalties you go to open C blur found this clever way to embed itself into openc and open up the doors once again so collections can go back to blur so uh in November of 2022 openc implemented a new policy collection seeking enforced royalties must block marketplaces that don't fully honor them since blurred in honor royalties they are on the block list after blur's launch in 10 of 2022 October uh it was on the rise and even surpassed Open Seas daily volume for some time becoming a threat to Open Seas dominance opensee's new policy affected effectively created a defense line def to defend its dominant position from emerging competitors like blur in the short term Open Seas defense line has been proven effective as new collections like liuka's sewer pass chose to align with openc and they blocked blur blur responded by promising to enforce royalties for new Collections and then they made a request claiming that blur met opens these criteria so that they'd be removed from the block list openc however replied that his policy required enforcing royalties for all collections not just new collections as a result blur could not defeat its offenses and still existed on opensees block list so blur finds a loophole by leveraging opensees C port to create a new exchange system as Seaport which is a product out of openc as a smart contract is not on Open Seas block list it makes sense collections blocking blur become tradable on it through the new system and within Forest royalties as a result blur now has two systems to execute two different kinds of trades on this Marketplace the old one continues to handle collections that do not block it while the new one manages to manage his collections previously blocked user experience is smooth as blur chooses the system automatically so basically blur has two systems one that is openc compliant and the openc uncompliant one uses the seaport smart contracts which makes it openc compliant so like blur basically snuck into openc and can still do like no why do we can't why does any of this matter David I think the the answer to that is really just summed up by legion's tweet here she says it looks like we're converging on xero Creator royalties this likely leads to higher initial mint prices and more frequent mints creators Reserve or withhold more of their collections to capture ongoing value and they also incentivize carrots to uh incentivize optional royalties with more perks slash utilities this is really about the conversation of can we enforce royalties and does the market want that yeah I think it's really interesting right because there's an element where I could see some some creators wanting royalties right is this almost like it's almost like copyright yeah in the kind of the nation-state world if you're an author maybe you want copyright laws to protect your work so you can make the most money out of it there's an element I could see creators would want to enforce that royalty but assets liquidity markets Want to Be Free don't they and so if they can bypass royalties they absolutely will and so that's why Legion is saying well when you have blur fighting against Open Sea the one that bypasses the royalty is ultimately going to win because these royalties are not really enforced deeply at the protocol level um and so they can be they can be bypassed which is interesting and that just means the market will respond differently creators will be like okay I'm not getting royalties so what am I going to do maybe I mint a collection but I reserve a bunch of that for my treasury because I know I'm not getting royalties in the future maybe I do smaller more frequent um mints that's sort of the Creator response to this but in general I'm not concerned about this like I just think the market will figure it out and uh these are good good things to to have be figured out in the market cardano has a brand new stable coin over collaborative over collateralized stablecoin called DJ DJ djed pegged a US dollar backed by Ada with Shen as its Reserve coin congrats cardano you've made it to 2018 ethereum sorry uh moving on world coin is opening up the hardware powering the orb so if you want to take a peek under the or under the hood of the orb you can see how the orb Works uh this is something that has been kept secret uh the the secret sauce behind how worldcoin Works which is why I've never stuck my eyeballs stick your eye socket in this and they give you coins are you going to do it yes absolutely not no that is way too dystopian yeah you would never do this real world identity I don't even care if like me this I'll just put my bias on the table here I don't even care if they come out on the table and be like yo we don't collect any data we don't use your data here's we can prove that to you don't make sci-fi dystopian toys don't do that this image alone right here or I don't know that's that's gonna be enough battle I think for them people don't even like to go to the optometrist you ever been an optometrist David speak on behalf of all the glasses wearers you know that thing that like that um where they test your eye pressure makes you like a burst of air into your eye I don't know that I hate that thing I've had that you have to literally they make you like pull you have to hold your eye open and you don't know when it's coming and then just like a burst of air right in your eye that's what that sounds awful sorry World coin maybe it's way better than we're saying um who knows but I'm sorry you made a dystopian looking orb thing that I'm supposed to stick my eye into that's your guys's prep wow Dave's not even willing to embrace the tech yeah it's hard to go mainstream that way all right Celsius just listed the names of people eligible to withdraw what did we learn here Celsius has published the names of users who are allowed to withdraw 94 of their assets locked on the platform Ryan have you tried to get your money back out of Celsius so they haven't contacted me where do I go I don't know dude am I it's only users under a certain criteria transfers had to be less than some amount 7 500 uh what else and only specif I don't know some subsets were able to get some money out let us know congrats hey 94 recovery if that is what it is that's great for 10 dudes got this David that's probably it who knows I'm not very happy about like I'm sure Celsius users are not healthy about what's what's going on in Celsius for sure the money ain't there is the big problem uh this is something I saw which was interesting but I didn't get a chance to dive in maybe no more Elon Musk wants Twitter's payment system to be built with crypto in mind yeah so he is alleged to wanting to make Twitter into an everything app sounds like like the the China apps like the WeChat uh it includes having money in there uh not necessarily crypto but not not crypto and that's the news what else do you use besides crypto use a stable coin or something everything else you can do like venmo stuff you can do like nation state payment rails I know but that's all connecting into like the banking system and like you know plus he's not a crypto person you can see networks he's Elon Musk come on Elon I don't understand why it doesn't get on board uh David what do we got here Amazon nft initiative coming soon the exclusive from from block Works what do they what is Amazon doing at the nfts uh no one knows they just said that they're doing an nft initiative is coming in the spring that's the news really exciting we'll see what that is David what do we got coming up next incoming is questions from the nation if we have privacy and crypto will the bad guys be able to get away with it and also open nft mints are they an open thing and then also Ryan is going to talk to us exactly what Max Payne is it has to do with taxes so stay tuned for all of that and more but first a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet

bankless premium it's under 50 cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord guys we're back with the questions from the nation this is a question from Abraham CR they say I listen to the news on the wormhur hole hacker activity during last week's roll-up what will happen when we have fully deployed CK Roll-Ups will we lose track of how the hacker is behaving do we have an hourglass to catch these people before ZK check ZK is fully implemented so what happens David when we get privacy on chain do the hackers just get away with everything is that a bad outcome or a good outcome uh first I want to make sure that we're not mixing up something ZK Roll-Ups are not private by default necessarily yes necessarily they can be Aztec is a ZK ZK roll up uh and Aztec is private but anything like the polygon or ZK sync or any other ZK roll-up isn't necessarily it's not privacy technology but you can do privacy technology on a ZK roll up so I just want to make sure that is true Aztec is really the only one that we're aware that is kind of farthest beyond that is privacy on a CK rowlet yeah you know how actually is tornado cash Mark contract on the ethereum layer one is banned by ofak but can't you just deploy tornado cache on a layer two and then use that because it's a different contract address I don't know okay I don't know what happens if you do that it's going to have trouble I don't know thank you anyways what's legal in this country I don't know I I think the in spirit of this question is in the future we're probably going to have a bunch of privacy tools correct and the answer to that is a hundred percent yeah uh if that is the case will we just lose track of the hacker hackers uh the answer to that is probably but it's also going to be a cat and mouse game it's going to be just like an arms race like everything else so privacy tools will get better and then tracing tools will get better and then privacy tools will get better and tracing tools will get better I will say that uh cryptography always tilts power to the hands of the individual and so I would say individuals over institutions are have the advantage here but that does not mean that institutions can't Brute Force this and figure out where that stolen money went they can figure it out honestly I'm I'm fine with an internal an internal cat and mouse game I feel like that balance of power where individual side a little bit the state and they come back and forth back and forth I mean a lot of things about uh crypto and blockchain make things more easily traceable a lot of things about the internet make things more easily traceable but if you remove crypto and you remove privacy on chain right then oh my God it is complete surveillance the individual has no protection against this and then it's just like there is I mean there's there is no mouse there's just cats kind of controlling everything right and so I sort of like the back and forth of the surveillance tools get get smarter crypto gets a little better invent Solutions like I think that's important for a society like this and let's also remind folks listening to this is think about cash we have had the existence of cash money which is not digitally traceable for hundreds of years and before that we had other non-traceable analog forms of money for thousands of years the world didn't end it was okay like we're all fine I mean of course there was some illicit activity but authorities found ways to go find without elicited activity was in real life and bust the bad guys that'll be the same what we're talking about in the absence of on-chain privacy Solutions is a complete surveillance of every single track transaction that every person in the world ever does that does not feel like a good balance of power that that feels very scary to me so this is why bankless we are Advocates of on-chain privacy even acknowledging that there is some trade-off there and some bad guys may get away with some things some of the time and we know that nation states are going to make it harder for individuals to access privacy but as an industry we will fight back about this and eventually I have very strong confidence that individuals will be able to fully access total and complete privacy tools because that is our constitutional right we just have to have this phase of time where we fight where we fight them now let's fight for the social norms I mean like imagine if the nation states that all communication should be unencrypted right let's ban signal sorry we need a copy via our prism database of all electronic communication that all of us why to to make sure we don't have domestic terrorism right or International terrorism right I mean I'm not an advocate for that and what does it mean it means that some bad people will communicate bad things and organize using these communication technology but um yeah that's that's just the trade-off that we have to live with if we're going to have a free Society uh that's my take on it anyway here's a second question from Xerox Redden hey guys curious to get your thoughts around the open Edition meta that is happening in the nft space feels like creators are moving away from the traditional and a t721s and 1155s do you feel like open editions make nfts more accessible to the mainstream what's your take on this what's an open Edition David yeah nobody in addition is an nft mint that doesn't have a cap and so anyone can come and mint it sometimes they close it in time so like you have 24 hours to Mint this but there's no like Supply cap there's in the world of nft Twitter right now people are talking about like do they like open mints and I've heard a lot of collectors say they don't really like open mints um it kind of like takes the magic out of it but I think creators do like open mints uh why that is true I think is is interesting to unpack the question do you think open editions will make nfts more accessible to mainstream I don't really think that's the secret sauce um I think there are reasons to do open mints I think there are reasons to do clothes mints I think we will ultimately settle on whatever the market will figure this out and it's kind of the up to the Creator right because they're the one who gets to do this choice and they're probably going to pick the one the mechanism of nft minting that puts the most amount of money into their pockets if that's just a new experiment to try right so this is a a nft I believe this is a producer and artist um on the music side of things who tried an open Mint experiment and this is a threat I ran across uh David you know I was thinking of when I read this question he did a open Mint for an open Edition drop of some music I believe he said with just under two hours left and 200 Edition sold here are a few of his takeaways his takeaway was the pace of an open Edition felt overall healthier he had his OG collectors waiting at the doors eager to collect but he was surprised with the trickle effect he got through the rest of the day he sold close to 75 additional nfts after the first hour he said it was way less stress for The Collector because as a collector you can take the time uh to to buy the nft you don't have to go to the store being bummed that everything uh is on back order and he said there's less pressure on the Artist as well he said the price and quantity Dynamic goes out of the window making the decision for the artist's way easier so there were some benefits and he summarizes this thread in his experience saying open editions aren't necessarily the end-all be-all model but the overall steps forward for both the artist and collector feel like a nap positive for most cases so this particular artist liked the experiment we'll probably try it again and that's what's going to happen is a lot of experimentation around open editions and that's kind of bullish kind of healthy I think that's I think that's a good perspective uh you and I both missed the Chris uh Chris bernisky uh bankless mint because it was close our podcast our podcast nft podcast collectible and we missed it we were recording another podcast uh which bummed me out because I really wanted to collect that one uh if it had been an open Mint I wouldn't have had felt I wouldn't have felt rushed all of the all of the bankless nft Collectibles have like sold out inside of five blocks so if you are not there ready to Mint then you're probably not going to get it and then it's also like kind of a problem for collectors on the other side of the world so sorry people in Asia who want to collect the bank this podcast we do it in Eastern times um yeah perhaps an open Mint fixes this yeah maybe maybe it's something we try in the future uh David let's get some takes of the week McDonald's saying we're all gonna make it oh no this is binance uh God I hate it when corporate Twitter accounts talk to each other I don't know why McDonald's tweeted this but in January 26th they they tweeted out what did I miss I don't really know the context behind that tweet binance the Twitter account behind binance responds a lot of green candles and then McDonald's responds to binance saying uh wagami we're all gonna make it I was like uh come on guys that's cringe that's cringe yeah especially when markets are pumping they're gonna they're gonna cost the top all right that's that's your take all right all right guys Ryan's talking about taxes all right here we go tax time do you know what I got so uh people know I had some fun stuck in gemini or an account lots of fun they sent me this email and it says we are writing to inform you that Gemini's requests a 30-day extension from the IRS to provide forms 1099 msk misc to Gemini exchange account holders to the tax year 2022. I was like oh what is that oh it turns out of course because of taxes uh the interest you earn in Gemini earn is all taxable at the time you receive that interest okay so it's taxable you receive income so if you receive a hundred dollars in the month of May last year in your Gemini earned account then you owe the taxes on the hundred dollars that you receive right this is how Most accountants would kind of interpret these tax rules well the pain of all of this David is you're a Gemini earned customer you lost all of your money probably in Gemini Aaron maybe you get some of it back later who knows when perhaps years for all intents and purposes you lost it all guess what David you still have to pay IRS tax is on your interest that to me is the definition of Max Payne it's this wojak right here tears crying coming out and like and this this applies for Celsius or block Phi Gemini earned any of the C5 lenders the uh you can't you can't you have to pay attention on money that was stolen from you and that to me is like Peak pain and I don't know if you sometimes it's back to like You're gonna laugh about it you're gonna cry right or maybe do a bit of both but uh that is my definition of Max Payne my friend see this is why I have to get other somebody else to do my taxes because I would be like Oh I'm not paying that I didn't actually receive any of the money oh because you like the you're going by rules of fairness yeah Common Sense yeah oh rules of fairness and common right sorry that's not what the IRS does so they have their own set of rules because the IRS doesn't go by rules and common sense I have to pay someone an accountant to Care on my behalf or else I'll go to jail because I know I won't do it right yeah this is uh anyway that's uh I'm sorry for anyone listening who's in that position I'm somewhat in that position too uh and uh it kind of sucks that's Max Payne my friend okay this is the favorite tweet I saw of the week this was not added to the agenda by Ryan this was added to the agenda by me but this was Ryan's tweet so congrats Ryan favorite tweet of the week uh Ryan Sean Adams tweets out money and government will exist in Greater Purity the less they are mixed together I got Shivers when I read this one like this oh I loved it so much yeah what if I told you this was a stolen tweet no yes this is a stolen tweet I was sponsored comments like man this is not very AI of you but it is this is a James this is a James Madison quote who's that okay framer the Constitution Founding Father James Madison way back in the 1700s you know like uh one of the over chairs the Constitution you know yeah Madison Church in government is that where it came from wow he said his quote was church in government will exist in Greater Purity the less they are mixed together and I just sub that out for money because I think the same is true this is why you know I'm afraid like this is uncharacteristically human of you but then you gave me that expression I said no that's the most AI thing I can think of it's such a good take though it is such a good the thing about like um the like the framers the Constitution is money was already separated from State at the time they wrote this their big thing was trying to get religion separated from state which turned out to be a really good idea and a very strong protocol design for a democracy for a republic governed by the people well now we've got money injected into the state and I bet if some of the framers were around today people who really think about power dynamics in government they would be advocates for this position too is like we'll have money and government in Greater Purity if we don't mix them together as much if we can separate them and that is definitely um the take of crypto but like money in politics isn't that such a like a terrible combination money and state is not such a corrupting Force it's just like these things should be separated shouldn't they and uh yeah that's uh that's why I'm bullish crypto David yeah for any bankless listener that wants some light weekend reading read the article a most peaceful Revolution by Nick Carter and all it talks about when uh and this also fits with the sovereign individual thesis like crypto is going to unbundle money from this date and it's going to force the state to be Market competitive with the services that they provide when they can know longer issue money and print money out of thin air they have to be Market competitive with Social Service the safety net infrastructure stuff like this and so it takes away the privilege of them being able to just print money to pay for their mistakes and enforces them into being a uh at the whim of the market the market makes them good uh which I think the when the market you don't have to adhere to the rules of the market you become corrupt and stagnant and you rest on your laurels you know you're making me want to have uh Rowan gray back on the podcast and argue with him a little bit sure about this bring on a status yeah yeah well he would take the exact opposite position he'd be like no [ __ ] brain it's um he'd probably say that too it's actually it's like uh having money tied into the state actually makes money accountable in a democracy to the people that's the way you should actually do things get your capitalist uh ideas out of here get your free market uh kind of ideas out of here you know I actually don't really think Rowan gray and us like disagree we just have a roundabout way of coming to the same conclusion but we're like I think the one thing we disagree on is he's way too optimistic on like The Incorruptible power of the nation-stage and I'm like in like I think we are much uh yeah anyway that's a good debate if you want to go back in the bankless archives look up Rowan gray and bankless uh David here's another take what's this uh this is from lydo uh and just because this is so aligned with what we say uh Lido's doing the all caps lower caps caps lower caps like making a farceo statement and he's saying I don't understand the tokenomics of Layer Two tokens any continuous mate they have better business models than alt-layer ones like Solana the business model is easy they sell block space on layer 2 and they buy block space on layer 1 and pocket some nice spreads on the difference while still offering end users 10 times cheaper transactions I thought that was a great way of summarizing the layer 2 business model they buy block space on the layer one they sell block space on the layer 2 and with compression technology they can pocket the difference they are value-added resellers in a supply chain of block space but the player 2 is value-added resales the last take of the week who wrote this who wrote this report uh Fortune oh this is let's see this is from the financial news of London financial news of London meet the 20 most influential people in crypto who are they who are these people I have no clue these are all some like stock image headshots of people I have no clue who they are these are real people right here um these are some LinkedIn asphalts and Biggs ombre I I've never seen any of these people around for people but they are the 20 most but they are the movers and shakers in the digital asset sector they have never even heard they've never they haven't been on Bank list we should get them on I think we've been missing a whole lot how come they all have these same uniform headshots these are all fed plants bro I don't know I'm excited to I don't know what this full list includes but uh this is a joke around crypto Twitter about the 20 most influential people in crypto that no one's ever heard of uh day people were on crypto Twitter we would eat them alive really yeah anyone with that kind of like curated headshot get that don't judge a book by its cover what do you have against curated headshots you ever seen my uh Twitter profile picture let me show you this yours is okay because it's kind of meta because yours is uh look at this you getting a picture of that that lighting yeah this is you put your MFR as a profile picture for a while and then you took it away and I was disappointed you're mad about that this is why um a bit boy called me a suit is because of this photo because yeah you know what he was right he's right bit boy had a point see those glasses dude Woody bullish on David uh I'm speaking of mfers I'm a bullish on mfers uh and so this was a bracelet that I'm now wearing I'll put it up on the screen it's kind of hidden behind my watch but it's my MF bracelet I've always looking for a nice bracelet so now I've got this MF her bracelet where'd you get that uh so an MF are made up for me oh so and this is me an mfer buying MFR swag from MF or who made it for me so uh you can go link uh there's a link to the to this in the show notes this is a like an online store from idanco uh so if you're an mfer you can buy an MF her bracelet you can also upload your specific MFR and he'll make you a silver MFR figurine that is your MS right and so like we had that take a while ago that um the Nike Swoosh of web3 will be a decentralized like Meme and so this is an mfer who's made a business side hustle making MFR swag for mfers who want to wear a mepher stuff and this is how this Meme propagates and the cool thing is like this isn't owned by you know MF or Inc this is just a little it's a headless brand it's a headless brand yeah and I think I think it's super cool also can you go back to the picture of uh my watch can you zoom in on that uh I don't know I don't have the power can you read it we oh it is this Hoffman on your watch yeah dude Hoffman watch wait is this a brand name yeah is it well I saw it on Instagram and it's like Hoffman watches I'm like wait my name's Hoffman and it was a hundred dollars and so there could only be one David Hoffman in every every industry is this the watch your boy wears a Hoffman watch yeah the greatest Instagram purchase of all time yeah no that's uh I'm really happy for your watch and see this guys uh so you know just so you know whoever you are the financial news this is the wrist of a real crypto influencer right here sporting Hoffman Watchers yeah that's how you know that's how you know you're dealing with the influential crypto person yeah uh so that's what I'm bullish on mfers and uh I guess my last name also I'm going to Star four sessions tomorrow uh so I'm also bullish on Stockport sessions so shout out to all the people who are going out there cool I'm glad you dated our trip man yeah me too gonna learn as much as possible I'm gonna like literally I have like eight interviews lined up and I'm gonna bring them all back for the bankless nation going to turn them into content because that's what we do yeah so I guess I'm also bullish on content out there as well so I got three things Ryan what are you bullish on uh I'm gonna say it this week Bitcoin block space David unironically I'm gonna say that look honestly I mean you're selling block space more use cases uh some of these nfts on bitcoin could actually be something what else could you put in these blobs I mean you're not doing D5 but you can store some interesting things in it um you mentioned going to the starkware conference that is actually something that stockware wants to do is it wants to bring layer twos starkware Tech to bitcoin you saw this look of shock but like maybe you should be bullish on bitcoin black space I'm more embellished on bitcoin block space than I was previously I will tell you that's it man I'll just leave it right there and that takes us to the meme of the week this week what are we looking at David and so this is uh utility in an airplane just chasing down Peter Griffin from Family Guy uh utility in the airplane like you know you're trying to Gun Down Bitcoin and Bitcoin being Peter Griffin utility is coming from Bitcoin and Bitcoin just wants running away from it running away from utility yeah yeah so that's the negative take here's the positive take which is you have the the cringe crying guy and the cringe crying guy is eth ethereum the cringe crying guy is like we have a road map and then you have like the metallic roadmap piece and then there's the Bitcoin Chad and Bitcoin says looks like we've accidentally fixed the security budget that's a great take on it I'm getting a kick out of this whole debate is uh Bitcoin block space sales going up and uh people mad about it I don't know I don't know it seems like it's helping to me my favorite thing about it is that like bitcoin's a permissionless protocol now you can put nfts on bitcoin it's just gonna play out like the way that organic nature is going to allow it to play out and we're just gonna watch it every step of the way there you go and I'm gonna be busy busy playing a doom on the TI-83 uh well everyone watches risks and disclaimers guys we've got to tell you none of this has been Financial advice we don't know the use cases of Bitcoin block space in the future but we hope to find out soon crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot
