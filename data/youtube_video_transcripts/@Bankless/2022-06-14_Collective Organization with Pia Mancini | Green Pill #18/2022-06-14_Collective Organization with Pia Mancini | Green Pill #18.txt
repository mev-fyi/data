what up coordination holy guacamole we have pia mancini on green pill today pia is an og in the web 3 digital democracy space one of my inspirations for starting get gitcoin she started open collective which is focused on open source sustainability has had tens of millions of dollars worth of impact on open source sustainability pia is an expert in digital communities decentralized philanthropy mutual aid and co-ops a lot of things that we're calling daos before they were dao's pia has had experience with we talk about the cultural problems with daos in this episode unlearning before we learn learning to govern the exit to community that pia and open collective is going through to preserve their mission in a decentralized way and uh we talk about pia's deep belief that we are 21st century citizens doing our best to interact with 19th century institutions with information technology from the 15th century and pia is convinced that it's up to us to design the political and economic systems for the internet generation so we get really deep on that coordination pia is an og p is an inspiration to me i think pia is going to be an inspiration to you and without further ado i give you pia mancini from open collective when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange

a quick overview of uh of open collective in your work there yeah sure um so open collective is it's a constellation right and we're on a mission to make sure that communities are sustainable and so the way we do it is the following our financial and economic system is used to having corporations and moving money between corporations which forces you to be somewhere in the world it forces you to have a sort of hierarchical structure um you know even if it's non-profit you still need a president or an owner someone to sign for bank accounts like your folks in the web 3 space know that that level of concentration of power is not what communities want or need um and so six years ago we set out on a mission to make sure that communities could forget about all of that and fundraise and spend money in full transparency without needing to become a bank account sorry a legal entity or have their own bank account and this is how we do it we set up a platform that is open collective inc and that platform is open source is create is developed and maintained by open collective in car company and it's essentially a place where you can have a collective you can fundraise you can have events you can have campaigns you can connect with your community and you can spend money you can pay people for you know invoices or reimbursing for expenses that they incurred while working for their communities now this open finances transparent platform is paired with a network of legal entities around the world we have you know right now on the platform about 400 entities around the world that what they do is their custodials of the funds right because the money still needs to go somewhere right and that somewhere is this network of legal entities that kind of abstract out all the complexity of reporting taking care of taxes taking care of local regulation so the communities operate at one level of the stack and everything else is abstracted out by this kind of network of legal entities so we created many of them we have a charity in the us we have the open source collective that is dedicated to um supporting the open source ecosystem we have you know several entities like that but we are also the platform is also open and free for anyone that wants to use it to kind of support their own community yeah and i just want to say that you're an inspiration for me when i started bitcoin the work that open collective uh has done is been really i think influential in the open source sustainability movement what are your some of your favorite projects on the on the platform um that's almost like asking who's your favorite child kevin you don't do that right so look you know we started really strong in the open source world right because um the open source ecosystem was so ripe for open collective when we started in 2016 like all the coordination was already happening so the coordination problem was solved by github mostly and gitlab and you know but you know it was already solved there was someone already already that enabled like all of this coordination creativity collaboration to happen and the results of open source when we started like the whole cultural argument about yes or no to open source like was already done in 2016 like there was no question that we should be using open source the question was like how on earth are we going to fund this because we have all of these companies using all of this technology for free that is maintained by all of these folks who are not making a living out of it and this is this system needs to um you know to be better to improve and so that's where we started and that's still definitely kind of where my heart is in terms of the overall solution that that we that we provide and we've been working in sustain you know open source this festival for many years and kind of really pushing forward the open source sustainability digital infrastructure conversation um so i'm not so involved in that anymore because that's really running on its own it has i i don't know i think last last year i think uh we moved 12 million dollars to open source projects um and so just last year alone and this year we are already it's may and we're already there and so we've been you know it's been um they don't need me anymore which is great i'm happy that that is happening i like i work to make myself redundant that is an important part of what i do and so now i'm i'm focusing more on um the charitable space and thinking about decentralized um philanthropy kind of the mutual aid um mutual aid groups or the solidarity economy in general co-op so i've been like the past couple of years i've been really like getting myself into that space and i've been building networks there so so that is what now it's kind of for me in my daily in my daily work right well i love that answer as you know get coins sort of started out with the mission of growing and sustaining open source you and i met through this maine community and through eric berry and code fund um and that that cause is just such a close one to my heart and y'all y'all have supported some of the most prominent web 2 open source projects so i just think that that you're an inspiration um and so i see this kind of parody between the work that you're doing and in what we're doing in the in the web web3 space uh when you say things like digital communities decentralized philanthropy mutual aid and co-ops well in the web 3 space we just call that daos which is maybe an overloaded term i'm curious for you having worked on this for half a decade what do you think of dalles you having kind of worked on maybe a more web 2 analog to daos over the last several years uh so you're set to get me in trouble i see this is this is your mission today right i'm not and uh so that was so i think that davos is solving a problem that we are still unable to solve right which is like automatically totally distributed um sharing and transfer of value right and open collective and the solution that we provide is still it's still encored in the legacy system in in quite some you know in quite a way because you have you know your non-profits that at the end of the day sure they virtualize themselves and we have hundreds of them and what have you but they are like a layer infrastructure that is there and it connects to the legacy system a lot that you report to that whatever irs or or you know you still are regular highly regulated i don't know if that just what we want to do is kind of abstract that out for groups but those are doing that in a much more fluid and efficient way because it kind of it just escapes the problem altogether right you're building something else somewhere else and there's like no connection right no middleman no connection like it's there is you don't need to operate the you know dos operating system you're like somewhere else and and and for me that the way i see that is where we're going um i don't think we cannot get there right so that's the first kind of you know maybe maybe inside i think that we we still need to figure out like whenever you try to when you think of of um changing systems of systemic change right you have like one way that is like okay let's overthrow the existing system and build a new one right on the ashes of what we brought down like revolution i'm like sure you can you know try and do that but once you open the gates of hell no one knows what's gonna come out right um so the other option is like what open connective is kind of semi-doing that it's like we're gonna hack this freaking system and we're gonna kind of operate in a way that we look like something that they are used to seeing but we're actually doing all of this you know enabling all of this amazingness on the side right and then there is a third way that it's where i want to go to which is where davos are which is like okay all of these we're gonna build an alternative system and you know escape this system right like jump over it like leapfrog that which is what does is doing and that for me has an amazing appeal right because it's like it has this um it articulates an alternative in a way that is very clear right you have your own currency you have your own regulations you have your own governance you have your own voting system like you have your thing you know it looks like an alternative like it smells like an alternative it's clear it separates and i love that and that excites me a lot but what what we're missing is like bridges between the worlds right what we're missing is like a path where we can start moving people over from this system to the other one because if not like the new system is gonna be like a niche system right and you're not gonna accomplish like our goal of um really building an alternative because unless you have people using that alternative then it's not really a new system right um and so i think that we still have a lot of work to do that and that looks like you know better onboarding and usability and like lowering you know the cognitive leap that you need to make in order to use it and everything that we already know but it also has to at some point connect somehow with what it exists so i've been talking too many dolls about this because they are all many dolls are like or for example developers that work for those they're asking me like okay i still need a pay stub for my landlord you know i still need to be able to produce and invoice someone how how on earth do i show income if everything is like you know in this i don't know in kraken right like how do you prove to your landlord that you can pay your rent you know if you have all your money in kraken and it's very difficult but they're very concrete needs right so you know i think that we open collective needs to move more towards the future and then but dallas also need to start thinking about what links they need to the existing system and how we build them in a way that we're not you know centralizing but at the same time we can actually use it right that's where i see it amazing uh what a beautiful answer and i think that you have so much alpha having run open collective for all these years in helping helping these open source communities uh operate in a non-hierarchical way operate in a way in which you're building a a wedge into the old system and i think what i heard from you is that you can go the sort of like revolution angle or you can go the enablement on top of the existing system angle and i think the open collective it sounds like it's maybe kind of a bridge between the two i don't want to put words in your mouth yeah i think that open collective is like it's definitely sitting in we're gonna build on top of the existing system and abstract it as much as we can and then those are very much in the this is an alternative and we don't even talk to the existing system right and so i think we need to come closer together in building those bridges because i think that a lot of the that's how we're going to pull people over right that's how we're going to bring folks to a more decentralized kind of future do you have any sort of alpha or insights on how these non-hierarchical communities have worked and have governed themselves on open open collective i know that y'all are very transparent about spending which is something that the old fiat system doesn't have but blockchain systems have i know that you've got an ethos of democratic and distributed network governance at open collective is there anything you've observed on the on open collective that's alpha for people who are running dowels at all yeah i think and this is related to like the second comment i wanted to make about dallas that is like whether it's on dallas or open collective or like traditional system the problems are human and they're the same right participation is a problem for everyone dolls democracy collective whatever you call it right because it has to do with um our as human beings our challenges right to participating and to engaging um so so i think that we need to be we need to be super aware that i think the challenges are more cultural than they are technical right in many many spaces and a lot of folks don't end up participating right so even if you have like super liquid democracy quadratic voting kind of setups and you're like but you can vote on this like more often than not folks won't vote right and there's a million reasons why and we can get into into all of this but um at the end of the day you'll have and it happens if you go to any freaking like assembly town hall assembly you're gonna have the same problem right and i have the same voices that are the loudest that are the ones with time that are the ones who have the opportunity to kind of be there and pester and get involved and vote right um and we see that happening in collectives we see that happening in dallas we see that happening in politics so i think it has to do with understanding drivers of participation um and i know that dao has been like you know playing or experimenting which i think is phenomenal right experimenting with like earn to play and to participate kind of you know models which i think must be experimented with but we still don't know the result of that right we still don't know like the long-term consequences for govern governance or for accountability or for concentration of power right um so so i think that my one kind of you know thing that i would say for folks involved in governance in dallas like really kind of i would approach the problem not as a design problem but as a very much as a cultural and human problem and and you know the news designed to you know optimize for that but if you just if you think it's only design we're just gonna you know do this fancy quadratic voting which again i love okay but what i'm saying is like make sure that you're not forgetting that the folks you are you know that your units are human they're not addresses amazing yeah um i think that uh one of the things i sort of heard there is that you've got the the mechanisms and you've got the governance but don't sleep on culture uh and if if culture and the humanity gets away from you then no mechanism is gonna save i mean like what is how have you tried to design the culture around open collective i mean i i've seen some of it from the outside i've been to sustain web 3 educating people about the problem giving them the tools to solve it themselves but i guess i want to keep pulling that thread whereas where's the cultural alpha what should dao leaders be doing with with their culture yeah totally so for example in open collective foundation that now we're working very strongly in a solidarity economy we have a solidarity economy school we have a school right and and we've created this to um um i don't i don't know to involve folks in thinking about solidarity economy in thinking about like network building so we are we have courses we have um a lot of grassroots work that we're doing there we are connecting with organizations in the space it's so it's almost like old school organizing but like using using tech using kind of all of these like new um thinking around it um but yeah like the school is key we hold a lot of calls with people all the time we're now working on a different project to do conflict management and conflict resolution training and positive feedback training and circular leadership training right i think we are we we acknowledge we acknowledge that we're humans essentially i think that's the the key to this and as humans we need to learn and a lot of folks back when i was doing politics you know a lot of with the net party and democracy os and all of that just like a lot of people in monocytes who would you know we would approach with this look build this shiny software you're not going to be able to participate and vote on legislations and they were like well i'm gonna vote that's gonna be my responsibility oh no you know like i'm not i'm not prepared and i guess in some like subconscious level that you know i understand why you know this is um fabled by aesop right that says of this fox that tries to get the grapes on sour grapes right and johnson's tries to get their grapes and fails and jumps again on sales and then walks away saying like oh they're like you know they're sour anyway and the fox internalizes this notion that grapes are sour and never tries again even when it grows up it it doesn't try anymore and we do the same like we've internalized this notion that we don't know we can't participate we're not ready like we should leave that in the hands of professional politicians and because that's what we've been told that's what the system that we have is designed for right it's designed for excluding everyone except professional citizens that we call representatives um and so the system works great right so great that we've internalized that we can't really vote you know we can only vote for someone to decide but we can't decide and so we need to break like a lot you know a lot of baggage that we as a as humanity are carrying and in terms of our ability to participate we need to experiment how to to live through participating and you know we were talking just before we started about exit to community and this idea that you know we want to do with open collectives kind of future like the platform's future and my kind of my main kind of focus or concern beyond kind of the transaction has to do with how on earth do we train our community to own and manage something like open collective right because i don't want to turn around in two years and say like okay folks this is yours bye have fun right and but never trained them on how to manage something like a community-owned piece of infrastructure um and so that's kind of what um referendums do referendums in politics are kind of this really blunt instrument of democracy that politicians can decide on something and they're like oh we're just gonna throw it to the people they can decide it's like should we say or should we go vote right and that's not how it works you know we've never trained people into deciding you've never had like build up to that and so for me the core of everything that we're doing is how do we get communities up to speed with governing and being kind of themselves the ultimately decision makers we've never done that we've never trained communities to be decision makers like that or at least not in our space and so that's what we want to do beautiful yeah i think that the the alpha that i get from that is that it's not a technology problem which depresses me as a software engineer but it sounds like it's a cultural problem and that excites me as a citizen so aesop's fable people unlearning before they learn and then basically i want to pull on the thread of your exit to community because uh i think maybe there might be some parallels between get coin with git coin grants becoming a dow and open collectives exit to community how do you imbue the community with context in order to be able to steward your baby open collective i mean i can say from from get coins perspective i've just been like rage writing blog posts with all of my contacts to put it out on paper and trying to educate people as much as i can about the five years of context that i have but then there's you know there's governance there's i mean i'm asking too many questions at once but can you tell us about your exit exit to community what's the goal behind that how are you empowering the community to steward open collective in the future yeah um so exit to community so open collective inc is a privately um owned company that has venture capital and so we have a cap table um we are in a quite a unique position because say xavier my my co-founder um when we raised like a two million dollar round that was like the biggest round that we've ever in the last round that we've raised um four years ago when we did that he was adamant that there weren't gonna be any board seats any control from investors on the company he had a very bad experience when he had storify and he had to sell storify in the past and um and so we ended up in this like quite unique position for your traditional startup of you know u.s startup where we've we've gave away 30 of the company to investors the rest is like employees and founders um we investors don't have board seats so they can't really you know force us to give dividends or anything we have investors that are really long-term investors i'm so proud of the investors that we have when we raised we said like we have 10-year vesting on our company right investing is like the the length of time um that passes before you can actually fully execute on your or on your options right you accrue your stock in time normally the vesting period for any startup is four years we said like hours is 10. and the reason we did is like we know that open collective is not going to happen overnight and so if you want to join in we love you but we're here for the long haul so you know brace yourselves and um and they accepted those those those terms they were you know and they've been nothing but supportive and so we are in this kind of super unique position where we can have a lot of control on the future of the company we are not forced to grow like crazy to raise our valuation we are not forced to you know do 100x returns or anything like that like it's not going to happen and they know it and so thinking about the future of open collective and i said this before but i i really want to make myself redundant here because i think that a successful mission survived it survives its funders right it's a mission that doesn't matter who i am or where where i am in the world or my team is or you know the whole open collective families the mission survives right and so in thinking about that like what are our options for for a startup like ours we can sell right or we can go public or you know i don't know we keep going forever and ever but our investors eventually are gonna want something in return um and so none of those options are an option for us you know we don't want to sell because selling doesn't guarantee that you can protect your mission and we're definitely not in a path of hyper growth go public ipo that's not the path that we're in and that's not the one i do not believe in hyper growth i think it's it's bad for the world it's bad for environments it's bad for the communities anyway and so so thinking about that like exit to community seems like the right option for us now what does it mean exit to community in this context it means that we want to transfer ownership of all the open collective shares to the community now the open collective community is like 7 000 collectives you know 60 000 400 nonprofits right what and i don't know how many admins of collectives right so how wha what is and that spans around the world literally across the globe so how do we how is first like what is our community how are they gonna like get together and manage this what are options what's the kind of corporate structure option that we have um and so we are working through different options allow is definitely like an option on the table that would solve for certain problems like it's easy for us to distribute tokens to the communities it has an embedded kind of governance aspect to it potentially it could provide the liquidity for the transaction to happen right potentially it could protect the mission it's unclear but it has also a lot of like um cons right half of our community would would freak out if we did at all because they're you know it's it's it's like you know it's a very con um contested issue um to say the least um anyway so you know different problems there the cognitive leap how do we actually get people like using the tokens and voting right we're talking about really large number of of people around the world not all of them are tech savvy right so that's one option another option is to do a purpose trust right where we create a trust and then the shares start moving from the current owners so to the trust and then that trust has a governance structure that allows the company to to keep functioning developers to keep you know high being hired and maintained and all of that jazz now the transaction aspect of the exit to community to a trust is not what worries me the most i think yes we have to get the liquidity we need to talk to investors which we're already talking to them um and they're super supportive we have to find a shared revenue mechanism that works but the problem is like the governance of this right how do you design the governance of a thing like this by you know 60 000 people around the world it's really difficult for i like that that is the problem so we're gonna flip what you did right we're gonna flip like that process we are doing the blog posts and the training and the the podcast and the town halls and you know the whole thing with the community now and then the transaction will happen in about 18 months two years right because i don't want to get there and then have to train our community on how to manage this i think that conversation needs to happen now so now what we're working on is again with the school with a podcast that we're launching um writing about it doing you know using every tool available to get ideas and design on the design process of the trust is gonna be like what's gonna take the longest right and then we're just gonna do it um so it's i don't look i have more questions than answers at this stage to be honest i don't even know if the trust is what it's going to look like it might be like a global co-op it might be a combination of things you know it might be a trust and a dao for governance for all i know you know um it's unclear we know that like the metrics that we're optimizing by is like is this gonna protect our mission in the long term and that is like it's it's a bit more nuanced than what it sounds because right now and it goes back to what we were talking at the beginning right now the solution that we have is a platform plus fiscal hosts plus non-profits that hold the money for the collectives that has an inherent power dynamics in into it that's quite strong right you're a community you don't control your fans it's like not your keys not your money it's like the same thing here right like you you depend on your physical host that controls your money you know you need that because you need their physical status like the flip side is that they're taking all the risk for your activities right so like it works because it's like otherwise it's like mutual destruction but also it's like a cooperation system that works really well but that works today maybe tomorrow it's different maybe tomorrow we find a better way for communities to be sustainable and i can't create a vehicle for the future that kind of cements this powers um dynamic right because i need to be so the goal here is for collectives to be sustainable not to be sustainable through fiscal hosts so what we are like optimizing for is this um you know protecting the mission with the mission being we want communities to be sustainable right so that's kind of the number one thing then obviously we want like future proofing something that can be sustained in time um something that can provide the liquidity for the transaction and something that can accommodate like a multi-stakeholder like a global multi-stakeholder system um i don't like kevin i don't know what that looks like um we are like playing around with all of these we have time um and i think we're gonna come up with something that my my win is like we make this happen and in doing so we built like some sort of blueprint roadmap for other companies like open collective to you know um to use right yeah but that's what strikes me is that you're truly just a pioneer i mean not only six years ago starting open collective and focusing on open source sustainability but working on co-ops and mutual aid in in i think like a way that front ran dows and now you're kind of front running the the creation of dallas the exit of community and coming up with a playbook for others who would want to exit to communities so i'll be rooting

how are you going to use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only debt his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] i wish that the dow space wasn't such a hot topic and that dolls were more of an option for you is there anything that the regen movement in web 3 can do to make dals a more attractive option to pay down some of the concerns about hyper capitalism and ponzi schemes and all the like the bad narratives about web3 yeah i think i think that look i i quote your work a lot because i think that like the whole green pill and solar panels and regions kind of work i think that's what we need to do more of right and when i talk to the open collective kind of team and and folks i'm like this is what like i want to do a game i want to do a board game i want to do a video game i want to do art like we need music we need you know and i see what you're doing with this and i'm like this is the right you know path because you know the ethos is important the culture is involved and the way it sounds the way it looks you know it's all about building this storytelling so i think that doing more of this that you are already doing um i think it's the it's friendly it's appealing you know it's cultural it's fun it's it's the artwork the everything right um i think that that storytelling and that kind of branding and cultural output is very very important because you know on the other hand you have and i don't want to start a a fight here right but you know i have the broth eating meat in the lambos and i know this is a stereotype like you know me in crypto for like you know way back when but that aesthetic is very very strong right and that aesthetic is very off-putting right like super and you know it's very like again like we are forgetting about the human aspect of it right even if it's the best idea with the best kind of if it's canned in like we're eating beef in lamborghinis and you know if you're not self-sufficient then with your guns and you think then like you are you know stay have fun staying poor that i mean do it seriously like who do you wanna you know not everyone and so um i think that i see the work that like you are doing with solar panels and and green pillar of that as like oh my god finally someone is like understanding that the you can use the same tech the same kind of concepts the same self-sovereignty individual sovereignty like um um framework and and you know tools that are so important but we just package them differently right um and so i think that and then explaining like i know we're going to have to do this like till the end of time so i'm explaining about proof of stake and how that's different you know like the environment and all of that and then don't i guess i don't know maybe this is just me but do not laugh at poor people i think that would be that's the first first thing that you know i would say that that's kind of a big one you know if you want to build bridges yeah totally i think that you know we've got a uh it's the internet of money and i think that there's been a part of the web3 ecosystem that has fetishized his wealth um and i think that there's a lot of people out there that this technology could really help so keeping up things if you if you see what's happening with with uvi and proof of humanity and look i see the other day something like full disclosure santi city he's my husband he's like behind uvi but um like i was seeing that something put together for the pope of all people i'm not gonna get into that like this um it's a bit too much for me to handle but he put together like a video with all the testimonials of folks in argentina using you know ubi and how it helped them and i mean it's like of course you know like how can you say no to that right it's like also on on the other side of the equation you also folks need to understand that there's a lot of good being done with this and it's not right and it's not like and if they don't want to see it they're also like really blindfolded by their own kind of you know pisces yeah yeah amazing uh well i'll have to say uh uh thank you thank you for saying that uh regenerative crypto is is a whole movement i'm just kind of aggregating a lot of really other great people who are doing great work i am a fan of your work yeah likewise thank you so much um i got a couple more questions for you i think that we're probably running low on time um i i want to dive in on a quote that's on your website and and ask you about it i it says that you have a deep belief that we're 21st centuries doing our best to interact with 19th century institutions with information technology from the 15th century and it's up to us to design the political and economic systems of the internet generation can you tell us a little bit about that about that philosophy yeah that i still believe that wholeheartedly um yeah i i think that um our political institutions and so economic institutions in general like democracies you know political institutions economic institutions they're not generally created in the void they respond to a certain society to a certain technology to a certain education and access to education that was there when they were created right so if you think about it like having representative democracy for example it's like a brilliant idea when your means of communication is like pen and paper and a horse of course you don't want everyone in the room because they can't physically live in the room because they can't get to the room and also because they don't have access to the education they need that changed dramatically right and so we can all be in the room now we can all have access to the resources we need to make this decision we can all participate but we're still being excluded we're still you know forced to be um in the recipient end of a monologue instead of being active participants of our dialogue and that generates a lot of frustration it generates a lot of noise and a lot of silence in the system it generates like when things go bad people go out on the street in a very non-constructive way because that's noise right because that's their only option but also most of the times they're just quiet and they don't want to participate so kind of apathy is a feature of this system it's not a bug like that's what this system is intended to do for everyone to be a pathetic and go do their thing in their own private space and live you know the system wants to self-perpetuate right right it's exclusive so i think that we citizens are you know now in this situation where society moved forward to a place where we can represent ourselves but we're still stuck with institutions that were designed in a time where we couldn't represent ourselves and that is kind of the rift that we are seeing and it's not going to get better until we design institutions for this society right and i think going back to maybe one of your earlier points there's the culture of oh wait i've got a vote now but you know we so we can build the technology of high resolution democracy and preference expression but there's also the culture of asserting yourself and asserting a vision and expressing your preferences that i think needs to be built as well is is that a fair yeah we need to experience participation in order to and we need to learn how to fail right we need to we need to do it and fail and learn from it and fail failing should be okay until failing until we have like real stakes things decisions and we fail at them we're not gonna learn from them right so um we need to design kind of those spaces where we can fail at governance in a way that is more or less controlled or more or less contained so we can learn right so higher stakes we are already better trained to do so great does this quote that i found when i was doing my research on you political action is being able to move from uh agitation to construction is that the process of building digital democracy is starting with agitation i mean i think that agitation has more to do and this comes from where i started my political activism way back when um you know it was like the green revolution in iran arab spring you know all the student movements in argentina chile 2011 2012 like and we were like furiously on the streets thinking that social media was gonna you know open up democracy for everyone because we would tweet and you know i think that we missed we missed a lot of things there but we were trying to do was like be against something we're against this system right now occupy wall street you know we're against one percent like we were very much like defining ourselves against what we were seeing and so the result was that we undermined a lot of institutions but we didn't build anything instead right so that's what i meant about moving from agitation to construction we need to not only be against something we need to know what we want to build instead and until we figure that out that that's the hardest part like the system that is in place the status quo it's going to remain the status quo because we're utterly unable to construct anything else right yeah it's one of my worries about social media and even in the dallas space is that there's so much just tribalism and misinformation and deconstruction and and sometimes being able to produce and construct if for me it viscerally feels better um and i think that i think what what i'm sort of learning from you is that construction is actually a part of creating a new system the whole bucky menace bucky fuller quote about how you don't tear down an old system you create a new system that makes the old system obsolete and you can't do that without construction so building tools that are constructive instead of destructive i think is is what i think out of that yeah yeah 100 and they're tough conversations right which is a part of the problem like you it's a lot easier to go protest against something it's a lot more glamorous to protest against something and to sit down in a freaking room and figure out what you want right it's very difficult because then yeah you know deciding what you want to build implies that not everyone gets what they what they want and so that is we're not we need we don't know how to do that well we need to learn oh man it's such a frontier it is if we don't do it i mean who's gonna do it right we need to step up and build these things that's true yeah if you're looking around for someone to build the new system it might be you uh is there any anything that i didn't ask you that you want to i mean do you just have such this breath breath i don't even know what what to ask you next is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to say or talk about um no i think um i think we touched upon like all the things that you know um we can um there are obviously a lot more topics but i'm also conscious of time so um yeah i don't know i think like um maybe for the future really kind of um that question about like how can the you know what three the regions kind of space help close the gap and mend some bridges i think that's an important one and that's one where i think you and me are quite positioned to start like really like a movement to connect um you know so i think that for me is is attractive because i do believe that like dolls are an incredible tool to um collaborate at scale at a scale that can only be done otherwise in like the context of a firm or a nation-state right and so dows are like the tool that networks can use to collaborate at a skill that is unprecedented and so i truly believe in that and i think that there's so much that can be used to that with that i think that we need to kind of build bridges backwards and you know maybe that's something that we can start thinking about how to do amazing well i think it starts with doing this podcast together which i'm super thankful that we're gonna uh have this another collaboration and looking forward to building this movement with you uh pia where can people find you online um i'm on twitter um at pia manchini without age so m-a-n-c-ini and um otherwise um yeah opencollective.com but mostly on on twitter shoot me a message there my dms are open i'm happy to chat and collaborate amazing thanks so much all right thank you [Music] you
