there are technical experts who are saying things like you know should blockchains be regulated should cryptocurrency be regulated that's one question and there's another question which is does this technology have applications and when a bunch of people i respect technically say no it does not that's where i get off and that's that's what's so troubling about this letter to me welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode on why the crypto critics are wrong this is in response to a letter that was recently written to congress titled a letter in support of responsible fintech policy and this was a blistering letter written by over 1500 tech experts critiquing crypto we brought on matt green to talk about this letter and his response to that matthew green is a cryptographer he's an associate professor at hopkins so we talk about that letter the response we talk about four common objections uh from crypto and how to respond to those objections from those outside crypto that is and what crypto natives should actually do when criticisms like these arise how to react to them this is overall really great conversation with a cryptographer someone who's deep on the crypto side but also sees kind of the the regular everyday side of things and interacts with regulators all of the time we also discussed privacy a little bit which is one of my favorite topics david what were your thoughts going into this episode i think matthew is so perfectly positioned to span these two communities where he is teaching not just cryptography and distributed systems but straight up like blockchain and cryptocurrency courses at john hopkins so like the guy the guy can speak our language he can speak crypto native but he's also in academia he's like shoulder to shoulder with like all the other academics out there who you know which are shoulder to shoulder with you know regulators and other technologists and so he's really spanning these two industries very very well and so he's not so far down the crypto native hole where we would call him a dj i would not call him a dj at all he's very you know he's very academic uh but and he's also so far on like the the academic side where like the people that wrote this scathing review uh of cryptocurrency he's he knows these people he has relationships with these people uh and so he has a unique perspective to bring to this table as to why like why 1500 leaders technology leaders signed on to this like scathing anti-crypto uh letter to congress saying to regulate the hell out of our industry and so he gets us he allows us to get into the shoes of those people while also getting into the shoes of somebody who understands cryptography works on the z cash protocol and knows very like many many people in our industry as well uh and so it was just like a nice breath of fresh air uh then just like you know your typical crypto uh crypto native person who's like as far down the rabbit hole ryan as you and i as you and i uh to give it to like get us a step back and be like all right here's what your industry looks like from the outside but not just like your basic just you know your basic normie take of how like everyone thinks that the crypto's gonna scam them out of their private keys for example yeah i think he's a good good person to respond to the critics in this way because if someone like you or i responded they'd be like oh my god well these guys have a podcast they're crypto like evangelists uh you can't listen to anything with the data in the background yeah exactly loses all credibility but but matthew green is very credible and he brings a uh you know a steel man approach to their arguments as well so that's the conversation we get into today a really awesome conversation also we now have video of bankless podcast in spotify so previously video was only available on youtube now they are available in spotify as well so if you want to go check out bankless videos on spotify go to spotify search bankless and you can view them there before we get to the chat with matthew green we want to tell you about these awesome tools

guest first time on bank list matthew green he's an associate professor of computer science at john hopkins where he's taught courses on cryptography distributed computing systems even blockchains and cryptocurrency is one of the people who helped create zero cash which was very influential in the z cash protocol he's been involved in that project at times as well so he definitely cares a lot about privacy preserve uh preserving systems digital money all of these things the reason we're having him on is because he wrote a brilliant response to an article that was put in front of congress called in defense of cryptocurrency that is the article he wrote the letter which we're going to kind of start with was a letter in support of responsible fintech policy this is a letter from many in the fintech space in the technology space even the cryptography basic space deriding crypto and so matthew put together a response to that we're going to get all into that and why he feels the need to defend crypto matthew green how are you doing today i'm great thanks for having me on uh it's really a great to have you on matt um we've been wanting to chat with you at some point in time you know i think what i want to do is start by reading a few sections from this letter this letter in support of responsible fintech policy just to ground everyone does that sound like an okay place to start it's a it's a great uh it's a great letter to read from by all means all right so this was a letter that was put um put forward to congress i believe by some technical experts uh cryptographers others in the community matt can give us some more insight into who these individuals are american citizens though with concerns and they put this in front of chuck schumer mitch mcconnell nancy pelosi that you know basically all the figures in congress and it starts in this way dear u.s congressional leadership committee chairs and ranking members we are 1500 computer scientists software engineers and technologists who have spent decades working in these fields producing innovative and effective products for a variety of applications in fields of database technology open source software cryptography and financial technology applications today we write to you urging you to take a critical skeptical approach toward industry claims that crypto assets sometimes called cryptocurrencies crypto tokens or web3 are an innovative technology that is unreservedly good we urge you to resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers lobbyists and boosters to create a regulatory safe haven haven for these risky flawed in unproven digital financial instruments and to instead take an approach that protects the public interest and ensures technology is deployed in genuine service to the needs of ordinary citizens it goes on we strongly disagree with the narrative peddled by those with a financial stake in the crypto asset industry that these technologies represent a positive financial innovation and are in any way suited to solving the financial problems facing ordinary americans not all innovation is unqua qualifiedly good not everything that we can build should be built the history of technology is full of dead ends false starts in wrong turns append only digital letters ledgers are not a new innovation they have been known and used since the 1980s for rather limited functions as software engineers and technologists with deep experience in our fields we dispute the claims made in recent years about the novelty and potential of blockchain technology i'm not going to read the entire letter just suffice it to say it goes on uh to this effect a few maybe paragraphs i'll i'll jump in on we implore you to take a truly responsible approach to technology innovation and ensure that individuals in the u.s and elsewhere are not left vulnerable to predatory finance fraud and economic uh systemic economic risks in the name of technological potential which does not exist given these vast externalities together with the at best still ambiguous and at worst non-existent uses of blockchain we recommend that the committee look beyond the hype and bluster the crypto industry and to understand not only its inherent flaws and extraordinary um defects but also the litany of technological fallacies it is built on it implores it ends by employing congress to please act to protect investors and the global financial marketplace matt can you give us some context for this letter so who is writing this letter and what do you think their intents are so this letter is uh it's written by a bunch of people i really respect that's what makes it so hard for me right so bruce schneier is a pretty famous well-regarded cryptographer um you know uh nick weaver is a colleague of mine i don't agree with a lot of his positions stephen deal clearly he's a pretty vocal person out on the out of the internet don't know him as well has his feelings about blockchains and crypto cryptocurrency in general but you know there are a lot of people who feel this way so so let me try to tell you what makes me so frustrated about these folks you know they're they're saying two things at once and i may be getting ahead of what you wanted to ask me but you know there are technical experts who are saying things like you know should blockchains be regulated should cryptocurrency be regulated that's one question and there's another question which is does this technology have applications and when a bunch of people i respect technically say no it does not that's where i get off and that's that's what's so troubling about this letter to me but yeah there's a group of people who really have the credentials you know to make people listen to them and that that's that's really the problem with this letter so matt i'm curious if you could give us some context uh for yourself too so mention that you have a history in in um the crypto industry but you're not actually part of the crypto industry i mean you're still at hopkins and you've been very critical of crypto at uh various points in time give us some context for some of your more critical positions you've taken on crypto and just your general posture because you know people that are listing this podcast are probably like well you know david and ryan surprise surprise they're upset about a crypto critical letter but these guys are industry advocates they're very excited about the technology they're clearly very biased give us some context on who you are and um you know your relationship to this industry so i'm a computer science professor i work in cryptography i work in zero knowledge and privacy preserving protocols and so that's how i kind of entered and and just before i tell you all the things that make me mad about crypto let me tell you the things i like about crypto so i've worked in this area i've worked in cryptography since um the early 2000s and i've thought a lot about payments because payments i think are one of the most important things that you know human beings do they they transfer value to one another and we have these amazing cryptographic protocols to do this we've had them since the 1980s to allow people to pay merchants privately to basically get us the privacy features of cash back you know undo some of the damage that kind of the surveillance of credit cards the way that we've turned our entire financial system into a panopticon we could undo that and i've watched consistently i watched over about half my career as all of those attempts to build better payment systems failed and they failed for the simple reason that if you want to deploy privacy in a payment system you want to do anything controversial you have to ask permission to a bank and the banks say no and the banks control the payment industry and the regulators control the banks or vice versa it's not totally clear and so when bitcoin came along what was exciting to me about that technology is that all of a sudden it broke that you know that prohibition you now had the ability to start trying new experiments in a way that you could not do before 2008 and that's what excites me about it now that does not mean i'm on board with every single thing that's happening in cryptocurrency to be honest i'm not even that on board with bitcoin i think that you know the price volatility in bitcoin is all over the map i am not a huge fan of the bitcoin i i think bitcoin itself the community has kind of an anti-technology attitude which i'm not in favor of i mean they're allowed to do what they want it's totally fine by me but there are a lot of things that i'm not crazy about and and there's a lot of just plain centralized behavior where people are building essentially centralized scams and calling them cryptocurrencies calling them decentralized and just kind of stealing money from folks and i could give you a hundred examples i think in the blog post i wrote i did give about a dozen and come on we all saw you know ust the terra stable coin and luna what happened recently it's really easy to steal money from people in an under unregulated environment that's not good we don't want that at the same time that doesn't mean we want to live in the world before 2008 where a bank was the person you had to ask permission you know to to do any kind of experimentation there's a middle ground i'm all in favor of the middle ground but this letter that you just read from it's not the middle ground it's something else i think uh one thing i want to glean from your perspective matt is as of of course there are so many parts about the crypto industry that are completely indefensible and this letter definitely taps into them uh and just uh talks about how congress needs to regulate this industry based on how there are so many indefensible parts of the crypto industry and maybe that's something that people like ryan and i need to put more emphasis on is that while we see the best in crypto the best in crypto is really drowned out by the the mountain of just the worst of crypto and so sometimes maybe we don't uh talk about that perhaps sufficiently to answer to many of the critiques in this letter however at the same time so many of these uh statements in this letter are just so broad sweeping and lack the imagination that like ryan and i have and as somebody who is in in these circles you talked about how these are your peers who put these and when i read this letter it felt like kind of emotional like this was coming from a place of these people are in their fields when they penned this late letter i'm wondering if you could help us get in the perspective of the circles of people that signed on that wrote this letter and signed off on this letter like where are they coming from why do they have the why do they take time out of their day to put this letter together and sign off on it yeah good question it's a really good question why is that um you know it's easy to get polarized right you get into a a position where you're watching everybody else go crazy over something and you don't see the benefit and you don't see why this is valuable and with crypto it is easy to feel that way right like we're not you know we're not facebook right i'm not saying facebook is good but we're not seeing the adoption that say a facebook got uh i'm not sure that's a good thing or a bad thing it's just you know we are still seeking our first killer applications in crypto and that's fine right like the internet didn't find its first killer applications until 30 years after the arpanet was invented it takes time to find these things but like look you're a technologist you see a lot of things happening a lot of money being lost you see you know uh carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere you see scams you see all sorts of things happening and you can start to be frustrated and you see so much enthusiasm you don't understand you can start to react negatively and i guess maybe what i'm trying to say here is that there is a lot of enthusiasm right i know your audience is enthusiastic about these technologies and you're enthusiastic about these technologies but enthusiasm begets negativity it if people are not part of that enthusiasm they can become emotionally uh reactive in the opposite way especially when they don't see the benefits and i see a lot of emotional reactivity and let me focus on one person in particular so bruce schneier is a person i talk with a lot we see eye to eye and many many different things he's you know a very smart person technical engineer and you know he quite rightly says you know i don't see the application here people aren't using this that people are using traditional payment systems why do we need crypto and i have to say to him look these things are coming trust me trust me they're coming and it's going to make a big difference but i can't prove that right i have a belief i have this kind of you know internal belief based on my experience this is going to happen he has a different one nobody can win that argument there are just people who have different beliefs and so in so much as you have one belief other people are going to have a different one inside the crypto industry we uh tend to stratify into tribes like people tend to fall into camps uh there's like the bitcoiner camp there's the ethereum camp like every single chain kind of has its own camp then there are tokens that have their own camps it's all very tribal on the inside of the crypto industry and i'm wondering there there also seems to be this like tribe of crypto outsiders that definitely don't like cryptocurrency and they are kind of like the crypto haters would you agree with this like illustration of there's like this external tribe that's their common denominator is that they just hate on crypto and how how much would you agree with that this is that we are talking about that group right now have you ever spent time on twitter where you actually express a no coiner kind of sentiment and you say crypto sucks and have you ever watched what happens to your replies i mean look it doesn't take too much of that to become someone who hates crypto and even if you started out with just some mild opinions you're gonna you're gonna get polarized because that's the way it is people feel very strongly people feel too strongly right look these technologies important they're going to go somewhere that doesn't mean you know any specific community is going to win but everyone wants their community to win and you know like it drives some negativity there's nothing wrong with that i understand how people get feelings feelings are fine where i get off is i'm a computer science professor i'm a researcher and when people say things that are false scientifically unsupportable that causes me a lot of heartburn and that that i think is where this letter went i could have agreed or ignored a different letter but this letter went to a place that didn't have the evidence behind it and that that bothers me what always strikes me matthew is just i'm kind of like um you know a certain group will believe in crypto invest in crypto whether capital time whatever the investment is another group will will not decide not to why can't that other group just ignore it then we'll see what happens i mean maybe maybe bruce and company maybe they're right maybe we're right but like time will ultimately be the you know arbitrator of who's on the like you know whether the use cases are coming or not so what i what i guess i don't understand matt is like kind of the the need to it feels like a little bit of gatekeeping it's just like going to congress sending them a letter and saying that the technology is worthless and cannot be used for any practical purpose uh that is a solution in search of a problem the certainty of that so when i put on even my investor cap is like i'm not certain of anything like i i i'm not certain of to that level of anything in life that would cause me to like be so certain that crypto is a bad idea that i need to push this in front where is this confidence coming from or where is this like vitriol coming from and uh can you explain that aspect of it because i i understand the tribal the tribalism piece of it but there's always to me it's just like oh if you don't like it don't ignore it you don't like nfts don't buy a jpeg it's easy to ignore do you think there's actually maybe some concern here that i mean putting it in its best light that the the authors of this re this letter have for retail investors who are getting kind of sucked into the scams because if so that is one small area where i actually i share their concern and there could be some things that we do i agree with everything you said except for the small part right it's big it's a lot of money a lot of people who are you know frankly kind of idiots for getting into these scams in the first place but you know like people are idiots that's the the fact of life right a lot of people are losing a lot of money that's why you know the market cap of the entire industry in like 2016 was what fraction of the market cap you know at the peak of this all-time high right it was this has become a huge industry huge amounts of stuff are happening you go to the movie theaters and you're going to see matt damon uh i think by the way the matt damon thing was a really big mistake and i wish that i wish that commercial had never been made but you know like it's hard for me to go and see matt damon chilling you know ftx or whatever it is crypto.com and tell people that crypto is no big deal because we hit the point where yeah it is a big deal and we also hit the point where a lot of people lost a lot of money if it had just stayed amongst us you know people who know a lot about crypto and are willing to you know make bets it would have been fine so i i have to put on my devil's advocate cap and say they are right that the scams are getting out of control and we should all be worried about that because it is going to rebound even on legitimate projects and the second thing i would say and i hate to say this you know because i know it will offend people but like proof of work and the carbon dioxide output is a problem right everyone recognizes that some people say oh bitcoin's actually using renewable energy i'm very skeptical of that claim but regardless like we should not have this problem if we could eliminate that problem i would say 50 of the grounds people have to be angry at cryptocurrency in general would disappear but we haven't eliminated it right so people are looking at this it's you know some shocking amount it's like the entire country of finland's worth of carbon being emitted to secure one cryptocurrency network it's not good we should fix it and i think there's some that's actually an aspect that basically everyone other than the bitcoin community inside the world of crypto would definitely align with however this is part goes back to like the whole tribal side of things some tribes get really really loud and really really defensive and they can represent a larger force than what what they actually uh actually have behind the scenes um matt you you talked about like all the scams in crypto and i want to get your take on this because there's certainly a bunch of scams in crypto uh and they come in all sorts of flavors they come in like fake wallets that like you spin up a wallet and then you send your money there and it drains all your money that's a scam that that's the only scam that i've ever fallen victim to in the world of crypto uh there are like rug polls for tokens like oh we're gonna make a token it's gonna go up in price and then the founders just leave and it goes to zero like i could go on there's a bunch of different flavors of scams but the my explanation for why crypto so scammy is that it's kind of like a logical byproduct of something that has real fundamental value at the very foundation right there wouldn't be scams if there wasn't a there there and so i i'm wondering how you using that kind of frame of reference like how we as an industry should think about these scams what we should do about this this knowledge that like well if their scams are here then we're on to something and we know there's something significant here but like that's not gonna like land well on the ears of crypto critics like how how would you navigate this thing okay so the first thing i would say is look we are you know you could talk about all these tribes but right 99 of the world is outside of all these tribes they are sitting on the sidelines and so the battle right now is not about who wins in this one percent that's fighting which includes the you know anti-blockchain folks as well as all the pro crypto folks it's the other 99 and i have to tell you like giving the anti-crypto folks the weapons to make inroads on that 99 is extremely stupid like all these scams we should care about them as much as the regulators and all the politicians care about them because the battle for that 99 is what is actually gonna define the future value of cryptocurrency not whatever we've done in the past so okay great with all that said the um you know the biggest thing is look we what are you gonna do about this game the scams are they do indicate that there's value here right like watching okay there are two things about cryptocurrency that amaze me the first is that it works right like literally that we've we've solved this incredibly hard problem of building networks that you can trust um you know some of the networks aren't even that good right like some of the networks don't even have that many validators and they're not like heavily secured and yet they still don't get broken it's really really impressive technologically that's a huge thing that people are not valuing enough the second is that you know people human beings have this desperate need and want to transfer value that is a thing transfer value is almost the wrong word right like there is this natural human desire like you know what is that maslow's hierarchy of needs we want to give people five bucks for a cup of coffee it is a thing we need and you know we also want to invest we want to move money around we want to make money money is just this incredibly powerful thing has this deep hold in our psyche and for years we've had these machines in front of us that can do it that can transfer money that can make new kinds of money they can do all these things and we told people no you can't do that i mean there were companies that tried like liberty reserve and e-gold they had their doors kicked down by federal agents and we've tried to regulate all of that human need out of existence and the problem is that our regulators were so captured by the idea of stopping it entirely that when people found a workaround to the regulations they figured out how to build decentralized networks that were hard to regulate all of a sudden our regulators just threw up their hands in despair and they walked away and they can't distinguish between somebody who's starting some new decentralized reasonable project versus someone who's building a complete centralized scam and i don't want to use the word scam too much but there have been a lot of what we're seeing right now is these centralized lending platforms failing and i'm not here i've never used celsius i don't know if it was good or bad or a scam but i sure think it should not have collapsed right and it was fundamentally just a traditional centralized lending platform they had some crypto hooks and regulators were nowhere to be seen and is that cryptocurrency's fault or is that regulators failing to you know kind of do their jobs i feel like regulators have no idea what they're doing and they do need guidance to figure out how to regulate intelligently so i agree with all those parts of the letter the problem is they're not getting good guidance they're getting they're getting the wrong guidance they're being told shut it all down there's no shutting it down it's too late to shut it all down and it would be stupid if you tried matt this is what i struggle with so much is like at some level as like the letter that these individuals wrote should have been coming from people in the crypto industry if that makes sense it's like there is an element of what you're saying where oh we should be the ones to write to congress and be like hey you know all of these things that don't represent the the the fundamental freedoms of the of this industry and don't represent what we're trying to do here um like here they are and by the way we don't support them they're not reflective of crypto and here are some ideas on what you guys could do about them come please help you know i would love to maybe write a letter like this but but the problem here matthew is like i feel like what will happen is because there's such a delta between summon government and congress even and the crypto industry and that like there's just this massive knowledge gap but there's also like an intention gap okay i don't know if we go and invite gary gensler in if he's gonna be like yeah and by the way eth is a security so you can't have none of that oh and this uniswap thing we're shutting that down because you can't trade outside ats don't touch that oh and this defy stuff well it's the same as celsius in blockfi and the transparency that you say is all unchained we don't buy any of that so you can't do any of it so like we go and we invite them there's some money and it feels like we're yes it feels like we're inviting like the fox in the hen house and so i don't even know what to do about this other than just like you know what we are doing which is educate people advocate build from the bottom up help that 99 who don't understand crypto become 98 97 whittle that down and hope the industry builds some use cases that actually convince everyone in government the way the internet convinced people so that's my hope but what do you say about this so so my dark theory of this is you know which is a little paranoid and will probably make people mad uh in the regulatory world is that you know really what we're seeing is what happens when you have a captured regulatory industry right what this is all about is who are the regulators serving and i think the regulators for the last 10 years have been very happy serving the banking and the sort of traditional finance and brokerage industries and um you know they learned how to do that they learned how to do that so well that when people figured out how to route around them they had no idea no idea how to kind of do their jobs in a in a world where they couldn't just sort of say oh you know we're going to put that all in the same number of people and you're right though like going to the regulators there's a there is some kind of learning process they have to do where they realize through painful experimentation that you can't just ban things that you can't just will you know new technologies away that you have to adapt to new technologies and or people will find ways to route around you and that learning process hasn't happened we're in the process it's probably a five to ten year 15-year process where regulators try really stupid things they fail and then maybe for lucky they learn maybe there's another way to do this right now they're sort of in this place and i think this letter reflected where they're thinking people are thinking you know what we can go to congress and say blockchains have no purpose ban them and it'll work like but that's not that's over right we're not going back to 2007 that world is gone so you either learn how to do this intelligently in a world where this stuff exists now or you're gonna end up with a million celsius and a million teras and there's just there's there's a there's a new thing that's got to happen and unfortunately regulators as much as i love some particular regulators they're not the kind of people who can drive this innovation and i guess it has to come from you it's it's going to take us all to be sure and it's going to be a messy process i believe and we're not all going to get it right but um yeah i do have hope and i guess maybe going back to kind of the the education side of it so another thing that uh you express i think very well in um in your article is just addressing some common objections and i want to maybe spend some time doing that right now and this is as much as go send this episode to a friend bankless listeners if you if you're hearing this and somebody has some concrete objections maybe some objections you um that that we're about to go through they can listen to this section and and hear what the crypto industry what people like matthew would say about some of these objections but also um this can kind of arm you to have a response when you're asked questions from your family members at the next you know uh meeting of friends and and the subject of crypto comes up because right now of course we're in a bear market and so no matter what happens in crypto everyone's going to have a negative view on it uh and probably a biased negative view if they're outside of the space but let's go through some of these objections i want to start with the first one that we hear so often and you actually alluded to that hey there's some merit in this objection but um but not quite as stated and that is cryptocurrency is terrible for the environment um proof of work is going to kill us all and therefore all crypto is you know bad for the environment and this is a um something that we should ethically stop can you react to that objection what would you say about that when you're asked okay so first of all i really do think this you know climate change is real we are heading towards a bad place a really bad place and if you disagree with that i don't care um that's just a fact and at the end of the day the idea that we have to burn as much money as much carbon as you know an entire country to achieve about seven transactions per second or whatever the bitcoin transaction rate is globally that's just not workable it's not going to work um and we have technologies that can do better than this right we have proof of stake technologies which are now operating and coming online we have other technologies that are that are better we even have things like you know chia has this proof of storage or proof of time and space i think they call it you know it still burns through hard drives i'm not crazy about it but you know some smart people are thinking about this and you know like this is something that if you go out to the world and you tell them like hey this isn't a problem you've already lost right you have to start by saying this is a problem and then once you admit it's a problem you have to tell people what your plan is because if your plan is don't worry all these people out in the world are going to stop burning coal uh to mine bitcoins you've got a problem so i i can't i can't really tell you what to say like i i just feel like this is where the source of a huge amount of negativity comes from and when you've got these people out there who are your adversaries and they're trying to convince the world that your technology sucks that you are a problem in the universe don't give them weapons to do it like you know you don't have to go solve these problems yourself i'm not asking you to go out and stop the carbon emissions but don't defend it because you've you're just you're just putting yourself in a terrible place i'm wondering to what degree that this is certainly the weak point of the industry like the reliance on proof of work which is something that i just do not ever see bitcoin as a as a culture or community ever moving away from bitcoin will probably be proof of work until it stops working uh like but also bitcoin is increasingly a smaller and smaller and smaller part of this whole industry as a whole yeah it becomes this whole like anti-crypto because it's going to burn down the planet uh critique of crypto seems to be getting larger and larger and larger and i'm wondering if uh it's fair to call this just like an unfair uh like smear of the whole entire industry using this like much more smaller part of it like it's it's a weak point because you know people feel really strongly about the climate as they should uh and they're using this to like to you know defame the whole rest of the industry and it's a little bit of a malicious critique while it is a valid critique it's also kind of blown out of proportion how would you feel about that i see a lot of people who they hear the word crypto even when we're talking about a proof-of-stake system and they say oh it's bad for the planet and you know you see these arguments happen right where someone says oh crypto bad for the planet someone says oh that's a proof of stake network they're not burning any carbon or significant and then the person's so attached to their position that they say well you know how many even so like you must be doing something really bad and you know that that is a thing that happens people get very attached to that position or they switch to it's all scams and you know once people get into a position like you're a human right we we stay in our position we will fight even if we have to change our change the actual details of our position we're not we're not switching um anyway regarding proof of work my feeling is right now that the only way out is through that if we just let this technology develop like we are so close to fixing this problem just through you know the deployment of better technologies that if we just let that play out it will get better and you know the in the interim mostly we just have to buy the time to do that um the thing that actually terrifies me is congress or somebody says hey we're going to ban cryptocurrencies and in a world where you ban cryptocurrencies you know what happens like proof of proof of work may be the most robust solution in the world where governments are actually trying to shut down cryptocurrencies we might inadvertently build a world where the only thing you can ever deploy is proof of work and i'm actually very scared of that like let people advance let's let projects launch and try new things because if you go after them we're going to end up it's going to be like prohibition we're going to be stuck with the worst possible outcome moving on to the second objection that you put in your letter you said public blockchains you know objection number two public blockchains can never support banking features like transaction reversal and i'm going to go back to the letter and just read the sentence that came from there blockchain technology cannot and will not have transaction reversal or data privacy mechanisms because they are antithetical to its base design financial technologies that serve the public must always have mechanisms for fraud mitigation and alway and allow a human in the loop to reverse transactions blockchains permits neither i hear your your exasperated psy what are your thoughts when when you hear this sentence out of this letter i mean like this is just like apples and and pairs right like this is these are two different concepts the blockchain is and should be immutable right we record transactions on a blockchain it's hard to change those transactions but that's got nothing to do with transaction reversibility right if you're if you're a banker in a traditional bank let's say you go back to the 1920s and he's writing down on a paper you know ledger with a pen that you did some transaction and your banker decides the transaction was a mistake and wants to reverse it they don't need to erase the pen it has nothing to do with the pen and the paper it has everything to do with the fact that you've got the capability to reverse transactions and you could build that into blockchain based systems too in fact and you know one of the things i point out in the blog post blog post is that some of the recent backed stable coins like usdc and the paxos dollar and busd these have transaction freeze and burn capabilities built into them because they're regulated governments said we need you to put those into the smart contracts that drive those systems and yeah the underlying ethereum blockchain it's irreversible it's immutable but the smart contracts running on top of it the drive usdc they can do all sorts of things that ethereum doesn't you know the actual eth currency can't do and one of those is you know freeze transactions and reverse them and um you know the the idea that like we have to have human beings in every single modern banking system it's absurd right today if you send a wire transfer there's no human being in the loop on every single one of those if you send a zell i mean cells aren't even reversible right zell if you if i send you 50 bucks by zell there's a very limited chance i'm going to get someone to reverse that and mostly that's because it's automated so this entire every aspect i mean it's like it's wrong but it's like fractally wrong like it's so wrong that it's hard to explain how many different ways that statement is wrong it's technically wrong it's it's it's business-wise wrong and it's anyway i'm very exasperated by that particular one even though it seems like a small claim in the letter it just it's the claim that kind of shows that people don't know what's happening rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there arbitram is an ethereum layer 2

place of not understanding the technology where once we have blockchains and immutability like people aren't used to immutability in this new level like the we the crypto as an industry changed the definition of what immutability means we had never had this level of immutability before all of a sudden like we have to like reconsider what it actually means to be immutable and i'm wondering if you just think that this this what they're using here is they're just using an uh a misunderstanding of this new word of immutable which like the crypto industry has kind of redefined so i think we've always had immutability i mean cash the entire financial system that we live in was built on cash and other kinds of you know immutable assets they weren't ledgers right but if i give you 100 bucks or you know a chunk of gold i can't undo that just because i want to unless you're willing to help me or i'm going to go rob you so like the entire financial system we live with was built on immutable assets at some layer but okay that's that's a dumb you know technical point but here here's the real thing like i think a lot of people i i learned this myself recently i've spent a lot of time working with defy and smart contract protocols and kind of learning about the space and who's doing what and you know i'm a computer scientist i thought i was pretty well versed i've been i've taught classes on blockchain and cryptocurrency but my knowledge kind of was a little out of date i hadn't really been following what's going on with the d5 community and all the different tech that people are using and when i caught up with it i was i realized like hey you know i'm living in the past this is not how things work anymore things are moving so quickly in this community that you can lose track so somebody who was very familiar with the basics of blockchains in 2015 would think oh bitcoin ethereum immutable you can't reverse transactions therefore i'll write this letter um and the result would be that but this is not true anymore right like we're way past that we're technologically that's like talking about the internet in 1990 and you know it's 2010. things are different now and you have to be very very closely this is actually one of the problems with being anti-crypto if you're anti-crypto you're not using crypto you can't criticize something you don't understand and you have to understand it well to actually do a you know good job criticizing it this is the problem with this letter absolutely well said and it's it's you know retrospectively with statements like this it's it's hard to imagine they found 1500 uh tech experts who are really willing to sign this actually um particularly that uh blockchain irreversible irreversibility um you know piece was astounding to me as well but how about this objection this is uh an objection from all of the expensive gas fees and transaction fees that people in crypto have been paying which is cryptocurrency doesn't scale we saw this in the letter or you know the corollary of that is the fees are too damn high like transaction fees will never work uh because it's too expensive what do you say about this i worked at 18t labs in the year 2000 i was going to put this in the blog post i i worked there this is ancient for you but like for me it was when i was uh you know just coming out of college it was my first job and they were excited about wireless mobile phones like this is before mobile phone we had we had mobile phones before data mobile phones and smartphones were a thing years before and uh my first mobile data connection was 14 400 um bits per second it was 14.4 k and i think i checked my 5g cell phone recently and it was 50 million bits per second and so back then i was working at att labs and these these folks were visionaries and they were talking about video streaming they were talking about two-way video streaming like facetime things 20 years before this you know came to exist they were talking about things like periscope and they were older folks and so i was just this kid and i thought you're nuts like this thing does 14 400 bits per second if i'm lucky there's no chance i'm going to do two-way video streaming or something like tick-tock that does not that's not possible and they just looked at me and said you know like look we've been doing this we're 30 years into our career we know one thing which is that when it comes to technology you know if if your claim is that such and such a thing can't happen because the technology isn't going to improve to the point where you know the the bandwidth is going to be better like forget it you're not making a viable claim we just know this and now i sit here with my 5g cell phone and of course all that stuff has happened it happened super fast so when somebody comes to me and says you know bitcoin's slow i'm like yeah of course it is we made in 2007 it was the first cryptocurrency network they say ethereum slow i'm like yeah of course it was made 2014. it was you know the same design as bitcoin but now we're seeing networks that can do you know thousands of transactions tens thousands hundred thousand we're going to see the same kind of exponential scaling in terms of these these systems it's that is the one argument that you know frustrates me the most of course of course things are going to get better that's just what we do we're engineers we make things better and uh you know object to all the celsiuses and all the rug bulls you want but don't object to technologists doing technology things because you're always going to be wrong if you bet against them so uh for all the critiques that i hear in this letter and just around the crypto industry like we we've gone through like crypto's terrible for the environment we should probably address that one head-on uh public blockchains can never support banking features like transaction reversal like we can answer that when the time comes like regulation we need to address that head-on of all critiques though the whole like crypto doesn't scale critique i feel like this one's like safe to ignore because eventually it will just be true and then that critique will just be eliminated and we don't have to fight this fight would you agree with that matt absolutely it's going to be faster than you could possibly imagine i mean i would say five years i mean we're in this amazing place right now i can't stress how amazing this place is we're in we are about to get very scalable chains they're all coming online right now we have backed and regulated stable coins which i know that a lot of crypto people don't like but i think that is kind of the missing ingredient for all a lot of these financial applications that folks say don't exist we have you know privacy layers and zero knowledge coming and all sorts of things all of these pieces are somewhere between five and six five and seven years away from gelling and at that point this technology is going to eat the traditional financial system might take 15 years for it to happen but it's going to do to the traditional financial system what the internet did to the long distance companies and i think that a lot of people kind of know this but they're just not you know it doesn't really mean very much and by the way when i say eat the financial system i'm not saying we're all going to be spending bitcoin i mean that you know maybe you're still using venmo it's just that underneath the hood in some way you don't even see venmo is transferring and settling money on a public blockchain and that's going to happen because why would you spend you know why would you use technology from the 1970s when we have reliable technology from 2022 that's instantaneous and cheap and um you know what that means for cryptocurrency like floating cryptocurrencies like ethereum like eth and bitcoin um i don't know but you know they'll have a place too what's always funny to me is when when um critics like those in this letter say um cryptocurrency doesn't scale and then same breath they also say cryptocurrency has no use case it's like you got to pick one guys right it's like because people are using it and that's why that's why it's not scaling right it's like we can't be it's not scaling because there's too much demand and also no one uses it it has no use case so i really feel like you have to pick one side of that argument but often that is not done um the last objection here which i feel like is is pretty near and dear to your heart uh in the cryptography space matthew is this charge that there is no privacy on the blockchains that's one side of it the other side of it is sometimes people say um there's too much privacy on the blockchain and we need our aml kyc what do you do with this objection look i i i got i have i have so many thoughts about aml kyc and i should say by the way i am working on a startup uh right now this is my full disclosure that you know is working on how do we do this regulatory compliance stuff this is why i said this in the post but i should say this to you here too um this is why i care so much about this right i am actually kind of working for you know regulatory folks or at least i'm trying to you know i'm not sure the regulator's totally on our side either but you know i care about this i think people are gonna have to solve this problem for cryptocurrencies to go mainstream and so this is an ingredient i think that is worth building um okay good so what do we do about that well look you know the hardest problem in privacy is making things private right we built zcash and zcash was designed to be as private as possible um you know and similarly monero and other currencies they don't make allowances for regulatory compliance they're just private they try to be private so what do you say about that well is that bad no i mean look the hard problem is being private if you want to make things less private once you've achieved 100 privacy going to you know privacy with limitations is super easy going to privacy where i'm private from everybody but in the same way that once you go full privacy you can start to have less privacy once you go full immutability you can also have less immutability but you got to go all the way first yeah building things that are hard to do is hard that's a really stupid thing to say i but it's like a trivial thing right privacy hard immutability hard trustless networks hard making systems that add trust to a trustless network is as simple as like hey who's public key am i going to assign to be the trusted person making things that are less private is as simple as hey what data do i want to drop out of you know just put it in plain text these are easy problems and so look what's going to happen my suspicion is we're going to see privacy layers built and those privacy layers are going to have some regulatory compliance capability and you know maybe you'll have to kyc to use them and that's fine that's the future like somebody has to build those they haven't built them somebody's going to build those things and you know like what's the objection here like that you know it hasn't been built yet it hasn't been built yet is not an objection it's not a an objection to the extent that this letter wants it to be this letter is saying there will never be any use for this technology that's not true matthew i'm curious your take on this and the privacy side of things one um weird i guess starting point i see when people are arguing against the ability to have the privacy and crypto is they they seem to assume that in this transition that we're all making as a society and as humanity from analog to digital that that transition requires us to actually lose our privacy and what i feel like the crypto industry is saying is like no we're just trying to preserve you know that thing that we had for hundreds of years called cash where you just gave money to appear individually and they received it and they didn't need your name and your address and your citizenship and a photo id remember that thing and how that didn't collapse society we're just trying to preserve that in the digital world would that be okay is that too much to ask and like they don't pitch it as that they act as if having some base layer of assumed privacy is going to cause the end of civilization and let all the terrorists and child pornographers win can you talk about like that base supposition of privacy on chain like how do you feel about that and you know do you even go back to like kind of question the whole um starting point for the argument that we shouldn't have these things in the digital world i went back to uh i was recently giving a talk to a crypto conference on the history of uh payment technology and how blockchains kind of came out of that and one of the things i did is i read a bunch of stuff from the 90s and the 80s talking about you know this was the dawn of the era when people are moving to debit cards and cash was really king like back in the 80s 90s people used it everywhere people were moving to debit cards and more credit cards and online stuff and it's amazing how much of that debate that was happening like among serious people not among like cypherpunks and like crazy crypto people who didn't exist right was about this problem was about the idea that wait a second if we deploy debit cards everywhere what's going to happen to our privacy in people serious people like presidents you know as congress people they took it seriously and they were afraid of it that whole aspect of the debate has vanished right you talked to somebody in this debate in you know 2022 there's a position which is that maximum surveillance is the default and therefore we must stick with the current default and i think that that kind of goes to there's an overton window that is defined by what we currently do and in the 1980s it was cash so we just said that was fine the world isn't ending like you said it's fine let's build systems that work like cash and today the you know overton window says anybody with a national security letter or maybe just the credit cards can access all my transactions and extract mark data mine that information so let's build systems that look like that it's really hard to move people away from what they see as the current standard and you know sometimes to move people back to that world you have to do some things that you know force them to grapple with the privacy implications i think that is something we have to do right and uh it just i'm reminded of how like i as a child of the internet the data the world of data is something that i grew up with and now it just became the status quo in my brain and like these things like money money phenomenon money technology doesn't change very often and like for a good reason like money with the money that we use shouldn't be changing ideally in an ideal wheel world ever or hopefully longer than multiple generations but if you if your money the form of money changes in like inside of one generation it's because like things are chaotic and bad and so it's useful that the form of money is relatively stable and at the same time like you know grown up with like uh watching my mom write like checks at the the grocery store turned into credit cards like going up on the internet just like my mind is like i'm a child of data there's a data all around me i give away my data for free because that's the paradigm i grew up in i don't really know anything else and so like convincing people that like it feels like a very much like plato's allegory of the cave like we're all stuck in the cave and the cave is this paradigm that we just give away our data and like waking people up to this like new world where there's shining light outside it's like oh here's the world of you actually get to choose what data you disclose is like mind-breaking for so many people have you just had any like tricks or like just like communication tricks that you have for like helping people wake up to the world outside of the cave i spend a lot of my time uh when i'm not doing cryptocurrency i spend a lot of my time working on end-to-end encryption uh things like signal and whatsapp you know like encrypted messaging and uh mostly trying to convince government regulators uh not to ban it which they they really wanted to for a while and um you know the thing i learned from that is that the thing i've learned is that people love it right people love it even people who are the most boring people you know your suburban neighbors who have nothing well maybe have nothing interesting that the government would care about they just think it's great that they can talk to their husband or wife or whatever or kids on a channel that isn't possibly surveilled and is secure maybe they care about hackers more than they care about like the nsa but they care a lot and um you know the thing about it is like it's not hard to convince people that privacy is good it is not hard to convince them of that and um do i have any tricks for that well like i don't know i mean it just it's really it's it's really just it's not so much trick it's kind of combating the idea the only countervailing force is the idea that the world will end that you know you will be unsafe if um privacy isn't if if privacy is allowed and the problem with that is that you know it's very hard to convince people that the world won't end if you do a thing you know you can tell them in the 80s the world didn't end but they didn't live in the 80s so i i i don't have any tricks i don't have any tricks but i will say one last thing since i'm i'm kind of going off here which is that the winning recipe is not to ask people to change their lives right i know a lot of people who tell me like i i have amazon alexis in my house and everyone gives me crap about it because i'm a computer security researcher and privacy researcher and like amazon alexa is poison and they're right like they're absolutely right but i do this because if you live in a log cabin in the woods you've already lost if you tell people they have to give up technology that they enjoy and they like in order to feel secure you've lost the goal here is to make things that are as easy to use as the non-private version and then you know make sure that when it comes to those other systems that you push very hard and you use them yourself and you make sure that you're not just you know opting out of the rest of the world that normal people live in you have to live in the same world that other people live in and then try to make things better that is an angle that i definitely appreciate by some of my favorite builders in this space is that they see the values and the principles that are built into cryptography and they understand that the only way to scale these values is to by scaling the ux right at the end of the day like it just fundamentally like all other previous products of the world has to be a better product than the alternative and it's definitely hard mode to like get cryptography to be a better ux but also at the end of the day some of the things that you get out of cryptography are just useful products and it's just a matter of problem solving the way around and it's like the the favorite builders in this space uh they see this vision they see this future regardless of how many years away it is well a good example of this too david and we've been taught you've been talking so much uh matthew about like celsius for example and in the block five and i think a lot of the reason um people didn't use some of the more the d5 tools that were you know totally transparent and offered similar levels of yield is because they were nervous about taking custody of their own keys right yeah and you kind of understand because the ux is pretty tricky right and like you got to memorize these you know 12 uh seed words or these 24 seed words and so they went and they defaulted to okay well i'll just put it in celsius it's just it's just easier i don't have to think about it and now they can't withdraw their funds if they had kept their keys if they had kept their crypto then they wouldn't have that problem right now they would still be in complete custody it'd be the fully bankless solution but they didn't go down that route because it was harder and i think that gets at the heart of what you're saying i think one of the hardest problems in you know our field right now is key management how do you keep your keys how do you deal with the fact that people lose their phones how do you deal with this and make them feel comfortable with it and the only thing i would say to that is that we are slowly solving that problem and we're doing that you know like for example apple has been deploying systems whatsapp has been deploying systems that use hardware in data centers to fix this we can fix this problem but yeah we're not there yet i mean writing down you know 12 words or 24 words is a pain and then where do you put it like what do you do um you know it's it's rough i have 300 in a uh i shouldn't even say this i have hundred dollars in a in a meta mask browser wallet right now i didn't even bother write down the seed phrase like i i guess you know that money could get lost if i drop my computer and i will feel really dumb about it but uh it happens parts of uh one of the reasons why like people like me and ryan and others in the crypto space are so optimistic about the future of crypto is that we fundamentally fundamentally believe that eventually cryptography will be able to produce a better ux than all previous products that the world has ever produced which is a very grandi a grandiose statement which is kind of where i'm going with this next question where like for for like private key management we have solutions like account abstraction uh and you know for proof of work removal we have proof of stake uh for scaling we have layer twos we even have layer threes we've got validiums we have all of these like complicated names and complicated like technology solutions that are known quantities importantly like we know these things exist they're not theoretical they are products being implemented but it's not like these products being implemented just like become live and fix everything on day one it takes one to three to ten years for these things to like really uh get built out and part of like the core the core most inner like circle of crypto are these people that like see the 10 10 plus year vision like the 50 year vision sometimes even like the multi-generational vision of what happens when we have a crypto enabled society and like that like utopia that we can all like dream up as visionaries that are keeping us like why we wake up in the morning but like the problem is like that daydream is so far away and also for like explaining crypto to the average person like they're not getting on board with this daydream you need to understand what the hell of a lydium is you need to understand what account abstraction is and like in order to explain those things you have to explain like 17 other things and so it that starts to be this like dividing line between like the crypto natives and the normies of the world the not what we call normies which is also a conversation to talk about like these labels that we give people but it's from their perspective we're just like pushing daydreamy vaporware and it's a big hype fest and so like matthew coming coming from the external perspective i want to ask you like what's the most like annoying hype we push like what what should we like really like tamp the brakes on and kind of keep that just to ourselves before it's ready yeah i i okay so let me just say like one of the things that drives me nuts is when people say things like your keys you know your currency right like yeah fine it's true right if you own the keys you own the currency you control it and i really like that aspect of crypto but you got to get rid of the word keys you've got to tell people there's no secret key you've got to get rid of that and hide that from people and make it transparent because nobody needs to know there's tcp nobody needs to know there's http or https underneath facebook is irrelevant to their lives and you have to make sure those concepts the thing you know these are not hype things i'm not really answering your question well the idea that i need to send if i want to send you some currency i need to get your ox you know ethereum address or your bitcoin address horrible like these are not hype things they're they're perfectly workable things that need to go away so what do you think is something matt that matthew that we could be doing better as an industry in terms of how we talk about this to those outside the industry it's congress critics you know everyone we're just talking about the subject of sometimes we're guilty of over hyping things hyping things too soon but like david and i would say we can't help it it's cause we're so freaking excited like this stuff's gonna change the world this is like an internet level you know movement we're just not saying it's it's just not going to happen overnight so what advice do you have people given that you've straddled the side of being on the outside looking into crypto but you've also been in the industry how can we better communicate this i would i would say there's three different answers to this one is you know stop talking your book when people look at you and they think you're talking your book uh you know that you're you're you're just showing this particular currency or whatever they don't take you seriously so say things that make it clear that you actually care about the issue and it's not just you saying like this is my my particular financial interest i happen to think that whatever is best for my particular financial interest is best for the country uh that's not gonna make you credible so if that's true maybe it is honestly true but try try to think a little harder the second thing i would say is like put yourself in the regulator's shoes your congress right what do you care about you want to have some innovation in the financial services industry that's fine you do care a lot about those moms and pops who are getting caught in the celsiuses and in the taras and the other rug pulls you care a lot about them you want to do something come up with answers like there have to be some answers like clear public answers i'm not saying answers of the forum don't do this but answers of the forum if i were you i would do this and then the third thing which i think is super important is defy in particular i'm thinking d5 maybe it's the whole industry needs to think harder about how it can police itself and by policing i have one let me give you one very specific example i was talking a few weeks ago to a person who's pretty high up in the national security establishment in the us government and they were asking a whole bunch of very influential crypto folks in d5 mostly how do we regulate you and you know what are we going to do and one of their big concerns was not about like crypto scams it was about north korea stealing money from d5 poorly secured t5 bridges or bridges and d5 projects like the two of two multi-sigs uh you know like the rainbow uh bridge and uh the one that happened recently just tons of money like hundreds of millions of dollars and you know their point was pretty valid which is like it's not the us government's job to defend you but also we can't tolerate a billion dollars going to north korea because they're going to use it to build you know hydrogen bombs and i would really like to see the defy industry in particular come up with an answer to that question an answer that's compatible with their values an answer that's not like regulate us out of existence but also isn't do nothing i think that it's perfectly for for what amounts to pocket change that industry could come up with some way to like get ahead of the attackers find the vulnerable places and get there you know and fix them and i'm not just talking about fix their own systems right like of course the wealthy d5 projects and the wealthy c5 projects can fix their own systems i'm talking about going out and defending the ones who are stupid who happen to have 200 million dollars that's about to get stolen and i would like to see some of that kind of self-policing i know everybody in the space is a libertarian and but you know like they think that it's you know they're not even libertarians they're more like anarchists like let this problem solve itself but like libertarianism doesn't mean do nothing well the world burns it means sometimes self-organized and you know self-police fix these problems ourselves so that governments don't have to step in and i don't see a lot of that plausible self-regulation self-organizing happening so if anyone knows a way to do it do it like that's the key that's a great point especially on that white white hat hacker sort of motif i think we could definitely do better better with that and create a better incentive program did not think about the the collateral national um security damage that uh that happens when a rogue nation state um actually steals the funds that's a very interesting line of uh conversation for sure um but matt this has been so much fun and so helpful and i just want to say thank you for writing that post in response to that letter um we need your voice we need people in the crypto community we need their voice to help push back against some of these ideas but also to do so in a way that's you know humble and kind of admits where the critics have a point this is very important too so we're not just talking our bags and talking our book but we're kind of standing up for these core principles i want to maybe end with um with this question uh to you um and you know you take this as a summary or take this as kind of like an encapsulating question for the entire conversation we've just had but how would you summarize things for you yourself why is crypto worth defending in your mind i i think i was hoping you were going to ask me what is my favorite thing that has happened what is my favorite project in this community which maybe is close enough to your question and then it will answer your question answer that too answer that too get us both it's iota no it's it's not literally it is i will tell you i will tell you which project and this is going to sound really stupid and everyone's going to think i'm an ass for saying this but my favorite project is diem libra dm facebook's internal token project and i know that sounds ridiculous it's not literally my favorite project i had nothing to do with it i never i don't even know if there was no like token but i'll tell you this like that was the one project where i saw real companies come together and say you know what this technology is going to revolutionize a huge part of our industry and they did it and they built it and you know i think there are a million things that are stupid like facebook having access to all my financial transactions horrifying you know facebook being controlled the banking system horrifying but what was impressive about that project is they made a bet and a lot of other people made a bet too that said this technology is going to replace everything else and really interestingly when you look at the critics of that project their objections were not this is stupid this is going to fail this blockchain based system is not needed their criticisms were if this project goes forward facebook's going to take over the world and it's very weird it's very weird for me to hear the regulatory folks including the folks in this letter saying things like blockchain has no applications in a world where facebook's dm project was killed because folks were scared of it and i think that is the strongest indication that this technology has legs even though it's not like a crypto native thing and again like i said not defending it don't want it but like that is that is to me the biggest indication that that that that things uh this technology is going to kind of devour everything and um by the way matthew isn't that isn't that another example of a time where the crypto industry kind of went to congress and said hey can we have permission to go do this it's like zuckerberg and the libra team and then they were like hell no you can't do that i don't know sorry shut down your project right so this is what i'm saying it's like it's very hard to engage in congress and the government when you're not sure exactly how like this letter could have come from us but the la all the times we've asked for permission it's always a no so why would we ever do this i agree i agree but you know you've got to have both sides right you've got to have the people who are building things and doing things and you gotta have the people who are you know after the fact going to congress and saying look you screwed up you banned diem and the result was you got 60 billion dollars in stable coins on chain anyway and now they're running on public chains which you have even less control over like don't do that again and there have to be smart voices who are able to take you know there have to be both sides there has to be the carrot and the stick and you know the stick can be just building stuff that congress can't regulate but the carrot has to be people explaining to congress why their regulation doesn't make any sense and so you know there is benefit to writing those letters if you write them if we said that to converse congress though just to push back on that a little bit uh like i you you i mean you alluded to it if facebook controlled the financial system that would be absolutely horrifying and so the fact that so many public uh so many stable coins ended up on public ledgers in my mind is like yes huge win uh and so like isn't that like the good thing isn't that the good outcome it's the good outcome maybe uh except you know like okay so i i think what you're saying is yes if regulators go in and they kill some projects and we still get the end result that you know that that project was pushing towards is is it a good thing yes i mean sure it's good i i think that's because you know there is definitely a pressure towards a particular outcome and that's going to happen anyway but it's not good right regulators could have been going after the scams and instead they poured their effort into going after libra and diem or what libra slash dm whatever they were that's just a bad use of resources how many people got scammed from perfectly recognizable scams as a result of regulators looking the wrong way and i think that's a bad outcome um matthew as you express this technology to the rest of the world how do you express your optimism to like the world of the skeptics and the naysayers like obviously you see the potential in applying cryptography at scale in cryptoeconomic ways what ways you say to these naysayers like hey here's the good out of these out of this technology how do you say these things so i would say that you know the two things that everybody agrees on is we do not like the banks we do not like the banking industry all that much and we certainly you know we don't think about the payment industry they're just a part of the banking industry but um the thing that i like to try to convince people of i never succeed is that every working poor person every uh poor person in my city of baltimore of which there are many when they go to the supermarket every time they buy a banana they're paying three percent of the dollar they spend on that banana in um you know payment fees and those payment fees are ending up in my wallet because i'm a you know affluent consumer who has one of those credit cards that gives you points back and so they're paying those prices those prices my my rewards are baked into the price that they're paying even if they're paying cash and that three percent you know baltimore's sales tax rate is six percent the entire state of maryland and baltimore city are basically collecting only twice as much money as you know their credit cards are are collecting and i would like to live in a world where that isn't the case i think that would unlock a lot of money for people i think that would unlock a lot of possibility um it's not a compelling point you know because people look at a number like three percent they think what's the big deal but it's a huge deal it is a huge deal we could do so much more for society if that three percent was going towards our infrastructure or just going back to people and i would like to live in a world where these kind of cartels don't control everything i would like to live in a world where you don't have to pay 10 for your student loans i would like to live in a world where you know cash backed loans didn't have a five or four percent interest rate because that makes no sense why would you pay a four percent interest rate on a cash backed loan that's crazy yet that's what the banks are charging right now and that's just inefficiency that could easily be swept away by by properly functioning competitors and um you know maybe it's not the top of mind for people people have other problems but the world would be better if we could fix some of these problems well we certainly agree with you matthew and uh well said we will uh end it there thank you so much for joining us on bankless today all right thank you bankless listeners a couple action items for you so first the letter to congress that we
