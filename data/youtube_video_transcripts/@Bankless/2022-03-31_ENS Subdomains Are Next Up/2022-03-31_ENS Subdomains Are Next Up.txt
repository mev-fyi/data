whenever i try to think about how big it will be i always just think if board apes did it how crazy would people go so if if board that's a good limit if board apes offered you the ability to link an ens sub domain bayc.ef which they own they have it they can do this your brand then your favorite community and then eve your favorite chain presumably because it's you know it's the best one then you're saying a lot in your username it's also your wallet what if you could just click it and it takes you straight to a gallery where you can walk around those nfts or it takes you straight to the wallet itself and you can just browse this person's collection in a way what you're saying there is this is me and it just turns your username into a profile picture so if profile pictures are such a big thing why can username projects not be such a big you know just to kind of play on that
