[Music] is [Music] is welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm speaking with jonathan mann who might be known as the song a day man jonathan mann has been creating and singing and producing one song a day for a really really really long time something like over four years now uh and so we talk about uh and i also discovered him for the first time in 2019 at east denver uh where he was kind of just a an mc of sorts uh and where he gave his talk about his journey of creating one song a day uh and there's a number of these a day people that have gravitated in towards into into crypto a people being being one of them but there's another there's others as well another previous podcast guest of lair zero justin aversano also took a birth a picture of somebody's uh of someone on their birthday every single day for a year and there's a conversation to be had about the relationship between creative output hard just work provably hard work because if you do something one time a day for years you know you're putting in the work and also the power of assets crypto assets uh so we unpack that a little bit and we also go into what um jonathan has been up to with his uh dao the the song a day dao and so that'll be in the second half of the show so let's go ahead and get right into it uh i bring you jonathan mann right after we get to some of these

once inconceivable is now within your grasp are you winning some hey jonathan what's up hey good uh how are you doing good really good um the first time i ever discovered you was that east denver 2019 yeah 2019 is that when you were like the the mc of sorts i was the mc for like one minute so so what happened was um they were trying to do like the judging of the uh hackathon and all the judges were taking too long and so john pallar of of denver was like jonathan like go up on stage do something stall them and it just happened that i have i like had my computer ready and like i had this talk that i used to give all the time like ready to go so i was like i'm on there and so yeah so that's probably where that's probably where you saw me if you saw me there at that time right right you gave the talk about your story of making one one song a day which that story i don't think has stopped at all ever since then no that yeah it's sagaday is nuts in that way and that it's just kind of relentless and you know that's like that's literally a thousand songs ago that's how i think about it that's a thousand songs ago three years is a thousand songs so that's like that's pretty intense so most of these later zero episodes i start with somebody's backstory and then try and lead it into crypto but with you i actually kind of want to do the inverse because of just the nature of who you are so sure let's start with crypto how did you find crypto yeah that's fine um well from listening to the podcast i know that you came in around 2017 also that's like that's my that's my entry point i was at a conference in um in ontario in like at a summer camp and i saw a talk by ethan buckman who um does uh cosmos and uh he's just he was just great and i had never been interested in it before it seemed like it wasn't really for me it seemed like a finance bro kind of thing it didn't really seem like it vibed with with just didn't really see how it related to me but something about his talk and i can tell you exactly what it was it was like he explained proof of work in a way where i i kind of got it for the first time and i started and then he also sang a song which helped like he had a little like ukulele who was singing it was great and i started i had this really dumb thought like looking back on it it's kind of dumb but also it makes sense which is like oh yeah proof of work like i have that like like i've been doing a song a day since january 1st of 2009 like that's my proof of work like and then i was like oh like is there some connection between like blockchain and my song today project and like what could that be and i talked to ethan about it and he was like really supportive and then i got home and i tweeted when you could find the tweet and i said like hey like does anyone know anything about the blockchain like i have this crazy idea for a project and my friend boris reached out sent me some eth said go play that was literally his words and um and about a week later he showed me crypto punks and that was the moment that was like that was the real lightning bulb lightning strike light bulb moment for me was seeing crypto punks at that time which was you know like um maybe six months five months after they had launched uh and it just blew my mind wide open okay so let's let's put a put a pin in that part of the store now let's do song a day how did you start doing song a day and also what is song a day yeah song a day is an ongoing project where i write write and record and make a video for a song every single day and i've been doing that since january 1st of 2009 i started really just trying to go for a month it was literally just 31 days that i was aiming for um within that 31 days of january of 2009 um i had a couple songs go kind of mini viral and like it just was going well and i was unemployed i was like 26 living in berkeley i had nothing else going on and so i decided to try for a year and then at the end of 2009 i just kind of i just kind of decided to keep going and not stop um and that's how that's how i'm here you know 4 76 songs in to the project but why yeah yeah uh well that that answer has changed so much over the years if you asked me back then and people did and i this is the answer that i would give back then it's basically like um it basically like talked about how as a creative person who i've been writing songs since i was 12 and like well i've always been somewhat prolific there was a piece of me that would often run up against some kind of form of writer's block where the problem with writer's block is like you you feel like you want to make something you have like the urge to create but nothing comes out and that's very frustrating um i found i sort of stumbled into song a day as like a uh just a a a a writer's block proof method of creating um and that's like one that's one reason that i used to give and then another reason was you know to get attention is like in this in this day and age you need to have a hook and like that's my shtick like hey i'm up here doing a song a day like that's just like a good shtick to have that's another reason um but as time goes on you know it's it becomes it's become something quite different in a lot of ways it's become almost like i don't want to say spiritual but it's become like it's become just a practice you know it's it's just become something that like there's there's a there's a weight to like sitting down and just doing something every single day and doing it and there's something there's just like i just find so many benefits that come out of it that that it just be has become part of my life it's like part of the firmament of my existence now what are the what what are some of those benefits so the only way to get good at something right is to is to is to fail a lot is to make let's do is like to [ __ ] up a bunch um and song of day is a really great um framework for [ __ ] up and for like making a lot of [ __ ] and a lot of crap that's bad you know and and even for me like doing that in public for all these years you know they all live on youtube there's like there's something about that that is um humbling i guess but also also is teaches teaches me a different thing which is that like no one really cares whether you suck you know what i mean no one real like like there's haters and there's trolls and stuff but like in the grand scheme of thing like no one's really paying attention to you most of the time and and so like what's wrong with making something shitty on the way to making something good and to not be afraid of that so that's so that's like a lesson that i learn over and over and over again and then just in like a pure kind of practice way i've just gotten better i've just gotten better at things as a musician as a producer as a singer i've just gotten better from literally doing it for 13 years like every day um yeah do you feel like it takes a similar um role in your life as perhaps like meditation or journaling does for other people yeah i think that's definitely the case i would say you know i i again like back in the day i wouldn't have i wouldn't have said that you know i wouldn't have like it's that's not something that i set out to do but looking back on it especially now you know if you go on the song and they dot world and like you just like like shuffle through the songs you know you get a real sense of like of my life in a lot of ways like it it is literally a record um of my life you know there's people you know gazali just went uh viral for taking a picture of himself every day for five years and my friend noah kalina has done that for like 21 years now um you know there's something about like documenting yourself documenting what's going on in your life every single day that's kind of that's really intense and then um what was the other what was the other part i don't remember what you just said there's there's yeah i just asked if it feels the same niche as somebody who like meditates or journaling oh yeah for sure the meditation part uh absolutely in fact um like the one time that i feel uh um free from anxiety the one time that i'm like not anxious well it's two times one of the times is when i'm sitting down writing my song like when i'm really lost in creating a song um and like in that state of flow if you're if you're familiar with that idea the idea of flow is where you the the task that you're trying to do is right at the edge of what you're capable of doing and you know you're you're pushing right up against that edge that's when you get into that flow state and i find myself in that all the time when i'm doing a song it's never boring that's not true it's just boring a lot of times but when i get into that zone it's like it's and and and and i get and almost every day i can get there even if it's just for a few minutes if i don't have a lot of time to work on my song but when i'm actually in it it's the only thing i'm thinking about you know what i mean whereas every all the other times of the day i'm like and anxious as [ __ ] about everything uh but when i'm like actually in it doing my song um i'm so present like with the song so in in that way i don't know if it you know i don't know if it um in the meditation sense i i haven't gotten as good at like taking the benefits of that you know taking that kind of uh hereness that i feel when i'm doing a song and applying it to other places that's the sort of key of meditation is like you learn not only to do it when you're sitting there but also you're just like standing there doing the dishes and you sort of notice yourself like whoa here i am um that is a that's i think it's a different muscle than than this one but but for the purposes of like an everyday moment when i am just here with myself uh sagaday i would say fills that for sure i'm sure there's gotta be like days where i don't know it's in the last part of the day and you're like damn i haven't done my song today god damn it i just have to bang this song out how how often are how do you get through those days yeah yeah so um by giving myself a lot of leeway basically i call those phoning it in phoning it in days where where um sort of to what i was saying before is like no one [ __ ] cares no one cares if you're gonna phone it in one day who who the [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] and so and so ultimately i give myself a lot of latitude to just suck if i need to suck on at a particular time that's cool that's right uh and so i'll phone it in i'll just i'll literally just like improvise the song on the spot i will there's days when i put like as little effort as possible into it um the other thing that i've learned about that though what's wild is another term i have for is like these songs that i just sort of poop out like the songs that i just sort of poop out in those times when i'm like i don't feel inspired whatsoever and i'm like like you said end of the day i'm exhausted you know especially my kids are you know four and seven but when they were infants forget it i mean that's like when you have an infant in the house but uh what i found is like oftentimes those songs they still resonate with somebody somebody somebody still hears it and says wow i really like that one or like wow that one really like that one really hit me at the right moment or whatever so so who the [ __ ] knows like i i'm not you know you we're like not the best judges of what we're what we make um and it's easy it's so easy to get in your head about like is this good is this bad when the when the fact of the matter is is what you think about it kind of doesn't matter because somebody else is going to think something completely different about it there was a a podcast that ryan and i did a monday podcast like one of the big ones and i won't name the guests just because of the nature of the story but both as soon as we got off of the podcast him and i were both like oh god that podcast was awful like do we even release that like that was so bad and yeah we just didn't have enough time to like scrounge up another podcast in time so we released it and it turned into being a number three most downloaded podcast in that spot for a really really long time and we got so much positive feedback about it and we just learned a lot about ourselves like sometimes like what we think is good and what the enjoyment that we got out of it is just not at all what like everyone all the listeners get out of it i can't tell you how many times that's happened to me where where like songs that i think are great and i'm like really excited by do nothing and then songs that i literally put no effort into people were like this is the best i love this one like you know there's a famous story about how like tom petty wrote free falling where it was like he was just trying to make everybody laugh like he was singing this song he's like he's just like making up the lyrics and he's like she's a good girl crazy about elvis and everyone's like just cracking up about it and it turns into like literally his biggest song ever yeah you know uh there's something about um two about about like uh you know a lot of people will say like oh you gotta like to make good art you have to like be all emotional you have to put your emotions into it it has to be like this deep thing that's [ __ ] like you know what if you sit down to try to be emotional you know if you sit down and you're like i'm gonna write an emotional song you know and i'm gonna make it all come out you put a lot of pressure on yourself to like to live up to that whereas if you just sit down you're like i'm just gonna write something let's see what comes out you know you're not putting any pressure on you and that's when that's when you can just like open up and let something come you know that's that's how i see it i don't think you can you can actually like go go for emotion right like that's not something that you can optimize for no right you can't you can't just decide that you're gonna be emotional today exactly and and sometimes you feel emotional and sometimes you're able to like to channel your emotions but on days when you don't to try to do that you know is fruitless i think but also on days when you don't there's a lot of power in just sitting down and showing up do do you have any of uh like your your favorite songs that you've written either out judged by the output of the songs that you created or the process of you making them um like a lot of my a lot of the stuff i'm most proud of making are on like albums and things that i've done like a big part of what i do with song days i go back and kind of mine the songs for things that i think could could stand to be polished you know because because a lot of times what comes out of song today sort of is is you know ultimately like a demo in a lot of ways um so i put out an album like 2019 that i'm really proud of and um i did this narrative fiction podcast called songanats and the music for that i'm super super proud of as well so those would be i'd say like the the ones that i'm like most because i put so much work into them uh to talk about like the process like i really you know i really honed and and try to get to the heart of like what each song was and so yeah that that's that's like that's definitely what i'm most proud of i'd say are the ones i like the most so picking up the crypto thread uh crypto is a very interesting industry do you think that like you've used crypto just as like inspiration to like yo crypto has so much content inside of it uh like i can just get a lot of inspiration from my songs crypto's gonna make writing about songs so much easier are these some of the thoughts that went through your head no but but i in my life you know because song a day is just part of my life like i said the firmament of just what i do anything that i get into i end up uh folding into song a day right so you can you can look and like on i think it's september 17th of 2017 i wrote a song about crypto punks because i was just so into crypto punks and that's just sort of naturally what i do you know i wrote a song about dada like dada um the dada art people i wrote a song about and i did a song about what's another one i did i did several cryptokitty songs back then because i was just so excited about nfts they weren't called nfts back then but like that's what i was excited about uh and and so that sort of that sort of continues now where now i'm like really deep in the space and so yeah there's just like there's just so much so many different things to write about i'm working on today i asked twitter what to write about and and some people said uh and i also put i said i said what should my song be about no shilling was the and then like because i didn't want people to come in and be like all right song about this project my project this project write a song about my bags yes exactly and so several people were like no shilling that's a great song that's a great and i was like oh yeah you're right that is that is a great song that's a fun one so so so yeah so so that ended up being that end up being a song and and that's you know oftentimes like there's so many projects in the space that i that i just love you know that i'm like really aligned with philosophically and just that i'm such a fan of and i'm going to write a song about all of them eventually you know um and that and that's just sort of like got a lot of songs to write so so why not write them about things that i enjoy one of the more recent songs in your trajectory that you've written is uh but the ennis dao one uh yeah that was super catchy by the way uh i posted that into a couple of my discords like yo guys like uh this look at this look at what the energy of ens dow created like we have you know singer songwriters writing songs about it but also listen to how catchy it is uh and also i think a little bit of what's going on here is uh you're becoming a bit of a storyteller or you you have been right you're like so much of the story of ens got baked into that song yeah maybe it's me reaching for something when i kind of say like the the vibe of the song is also part of the vibe of ens like the the melody and the tune is it very very ens like but also just straight up the lyrics were illustrating two people about what it was uh and the fact that like somebody would write a song about ens it's not like you wrote about like uh like coinbase or insert your equity company here or or you know like showmybags.com you wrote about ian s dao a community project uh and so that is also part of the story do you see yourself as a little bit of a storyteller in like these short little snippets of songs um that was my job pretty pandemic that was literally my job uh um the reason i had you know when you saw me at eath denver the reason i had this talk all ready to go is because i would go around to conferences give that talk and then watch all the other talks at the conference and get up at the end of the day and recap everything that everyone said and that was literally that's what i was doing like i was doing like maybe like 15 of those a year and like that was my that was uh my main job uh right up until the pandemic um [Music] so yeah that's a huge part and and um i stories are compelling and i find obviously and i that's sort of a dumb sentence stories are compelling yeah uh but like the stories that are within the stories and lore of this culture i'm sure the i'm sure like every culture has has amazing stories and lore um and so because i'm so steeped uh in this one right now i can't help but just be attracted to the different uh um narratives that are popping up um you know for a long time it was all about crypto punks for me and like the different kinds of like like i wrote a song about uh snowfro you know who who made our art blocks uh his his burned zombie punk like he he accidentally burned a zombie punk which i love like there's a great story about like how that happened and even the story of how he made art blocks where he sold a bunch of his really valuable punks to fund art blocks and then art blocks becomes this amazing like that's just a great story you know there's all these amazing stories in the space and so ens dao is just one of those stories you know it's just like uh what an amazing project and what an amazing kind of like coming to fruition of something um in the space and so it was a no-brainer for something like that to write a song whereas like you know not to [ __ ] on this or anything i absolutely do not mean to do that but like everyone's like when are you gonna do a song about irene dao and i'm like i'm not sure what the story is there necessarily if there's a story there that pops up then i'll be compelled um um whereas with gozali did you see gosali this kid who took a picture of himself every day so there's this kid from indonesia took himself took a picture of himself every day for five years and made a pfp project basically by accident like up he like upload and it's it's just it's it's great and like so that to me it's the guilelessness of him that like makes it compelling and he became like an instant meme overnight uh and that to me was like so compelling and i was like he has this long history of like all these other people who've done picture a days things and like that to me is an interesting story so that's something that i'm going to write about there's just a lot there's just so much in the space to do there's i feel like there's enough people at this point in the world doing one thing a day yeah that could turn into a doubt like oh yeah yeah yeah oh is that a thing no it should be yeah right so for all the people that do one thing a day and have been doing so for a while like we should get all those people in the same discord just i've always had a fantasy of doing a conference that was just a conference where all the speakers were people who who do things a day you know because there's a ton there really are like you you know uh um i feel like i'm i feel like even you know uh i find out about new ones all the time like like people show me folks who are doing it i'm like i didn't know this person existed yeah are is there is there like a thing a day community out there just like all the people that know no there isn't i mean you know when we find each other i think we feel some kind of kinship i know so noah kalina entered the space recently and he's gone viral many times for his um a picture of himself a day thing and i knew him i knew of those and i'd been following the project um but we were able to connect over crypto because he started messaging me asking about song a day and nfts um and it's great you know it's just great to connect with people who do because they sort of understand things on a on a really specific level so there's another layer zero that i did uh with uh justin aversano who took a photo of somebody's birthday every single day for a year so like you you have the challenge of you need to put output like a couple minutes of creative output every single day his challenge was that he kind of go find somebody whose birthday it was every single day for a year which is a very different challenge yeah um and uh there's just something about doing something a day that was fine people find really compelling and like the cool thing about justin's story was that you couldn't i don't think you could have taken any single one of his photographs and created the value that he got out of the whole entire thing right like right the his photographs are great but like it's not one photograph isn't gonna do it it's the fact that he did something every single day for a year which was challenging that created the story that created the total like valuation of his combined work like why do you think humanity could and one of the things that i think is cool about humanity and crypto assets is that like we actually find ways to put market value upon the things that we value and all of a sudden there are these people out there that are doing these a day things and they're fi they're gravitating towards crypto to be able to find a price tag for these things evaluation for these things but before we get to the crypto part like why do you think humans value the a days the the people that do things a day and like why why do we like that because we die we like it because we die we like it because um time is literally the most scarce thing that we have and uh the everydayness of something is a reminder of that it's sort of it's the most grounding kind of way of structuring something uh um and so i think a lot of it has to do with death it has to do with like our connection to the fact that we have only so many of these days on the on the planet um and and that ties right into crypto honestly because what you have and what you have with nfts especially is um you have this uh artificially scarce thing right because because in the real world everything is scarce just by its nature that's just how the real world operates but uh in computer land as we know like you know things are infinitely perfectly replicable and so we have suddenly this way of making digital things scarce which is holy [ __ ] that's like amazing but then we have to then we have to confront this idea of well what does that mean like uh how can we make something digitally scarce in a way that feels legitimate that feels um true and you know uh we would talk about this kind of [ __ ] all the time back in the old days you know back in 2017 2018 and a lot of it was sort of theoretical whereas like you know uh on my podcast digitally rare we would often say that like you know for this to work there's gonna have to be a really strong narrative like any any project that's going to succeed is going to need a really clear story about like why it exists which which is not true that's not turned out to be true at all that was a theory that we were sort of working on back in the day before there was very many projects uh but you know ultimately we are still confronted by what is and we're so early that actually we don't really know the answer because in the long term 10 years from now you know who knows but when we're confronted with the idea of this artificial digital scarcity what can make that feel real one of the things that we're seeing now is that you know uh um og projects you know and depending on how you that's one way actually to to value something because it came before all the hubbub and you know it's it's scarce but the fact is you know when larva labs decided to do 10 000 crypto punks they could have easily have decided to do 5 000 or 20 000 or infinite i mean near infinite crypto punks they could have done out of that out of those combinations so it's sort of an accident that they chose ten thousand in a lot of ways you know to me that's a really interesting philosophical thing uh is how do you ground how do you ground this artificial scarcity in something that feels real and doing something once every day is one way to ground it time put put it in time um my compatriot matt condon one of the many mats uh is also obsessed with this question and he's come up with two other really great ways that i love and so one is that you may have heard of this he has a chip in his hand do you know about this yes i've met him yeah yeah so matt has a chip in his hand where you you scan it with a with a near field communicating thing nfc and it gives you an nft so the scarcity comes from uh proximity to him whoa that's like that's really cool and his new one is even cooler where he uh he sleep talks have you seen this alliatoric so matt found out that he's sleep talks uh um and so he decided to make this nft project where um when he sleep talks his phone records it it gets translated it gets uh like google translated into text the text gets fed into an ai thing that shows it as a visual thing and that gets sold as an nft on zora and so the scarcity of this project he has no control over how many are gonna happen it only happens when he sleep talks which you know there's been months now where he hasn't he set up this whole project he's sleep talking all the time and then he set it up and he hasn't been sleep talking which is just fascinating so that's another way of creating real scarcity in this digital realm um you know so that i just i find all of those uh experiments like the most the most fascinating can you elaborate on the relationship between scarcity and market value of assets and what that what the blockchain has to do with that yeah although you know i'm i'm i'm skeptical of of most of the ways that people use scarcity to assign value to uh most nfts um because it all feels so arbitrary to me so let me let me actually ask that question slightly differently can you elaborate on the relationship of the scarcity of human time and labor and creativity oh yeah okay and the market value of assets on public blockchains yes yes well that to me is way more interesting than you know the other thing that i was thinking when you were saying that is like you know this one is this one has like lasers shooting out of his eyes and that may and and that's rare it's like okay really why i could i could just go into 100 erc20 tokens and say scarce yes yeah yeah yeah exactly it needs to have when i didn't realize this for a long time when like you know when when when projects are choosing like bankless how did you decide how many tokens to make what was your rubric uh a billion is a big big number you just you just break the number like this this to me like i didn't realize like you mean there's no and people said like of course there's no it's just you can make up any number it's just whatever i'm like oh yeah right oh man that's crazy and so like eat denver you know they decided to do like the the the length of colorado or something and the the height of the mountains or then they multiple like uh but in terms of like yeah labor and time and putting that into i don't know i don't think that right now we are at the point where we are ready to actually value these things correctly in the nft space i think that there's too much froth and there's still too much like wild westness of it but i think there's a chance that like over time um nfts can become it's not going to be perfect i don't think it's ever going to be perfect i don't think it's like a panacea in any way it's not going to like solve this but i think that it has a chance to be a really powerful tool for um rewarding creative work uh in a way that hasn't existed before and certainly hasn't existed for the last 20 years um and we you know when you when i i come at everything thinking specifically about music and what's crazy about music is that you know prior to the invention of recorded sound uh the music was ultimately extremely scarce in the sense that the only way to hear it was in person when someone was playing it for you like that's crazy and then suddenly we had this ability to copy it and we lived through this sort of golden age of musicians being able to get paid for their work because it was copyable but not infinitely copyable yet and that was one age and now and then for the last 20 years we've been in a completely different place where mu the value of music just plummeted when it went away um completely and i don't think i don't think nft's or digital scarcity is gonna solve that but i think it it's just gonna it's this has the potential to be this really powerful tool uh to to help alleviate some of that and i don't know how much of it has to do with scarcity or not i think that sort of still remains to be seen i wouldn't be surprised if everyone's obsession if if if our cult our cryptoculture's obsession with scarcity itself becomes uh not the thing i wouldn't be surprised if that sort of goes by the wayside and ultimately it's we we settle into something that's more just about like another way to show your appreciation and support for a piece of art um but yeah i think this the the speculation has to the like wild rampant speculation has to die down for that to happen um and that and it honestly did happen you know 20 2018 2019 things died down so much and um that's when a lot of so many interesting things uh came about in that space that's that's definitely true and that time was for d5 really where like we had like early d5 which were icos before we called it defy and then it went away and then we actually had true d5 come after the fight right and so like we having this first nft frothy movement in 2020 and 2021 um and there's a ton being built right now but you still a lot of that froth hasn't left the market quite yet no no and it will eventually i assume hey guys in the second half of the show we get into the subject of the song a day dao which is the dow that jonathan has spun up to help manage the funds of all the money that is raised from his song a day sales and other conversations around this topic as well so let's go ahead and get there right after we get up to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer 2 life a cross is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer one assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across these bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to ethereum across is critical ecosystem infrastructure and ownership is being handed over to the community you can be a part of this story of a cross by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across dot to to bridge your assets between eth optimism arbitrary or boba networks bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswap grants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless my my hot take that i think is true is that these adair artists people that do things every single day find crypto sooner than all the other artist types of the world do you think that's true and then why i think that i don't know if it's true that we find it faster i know that i feel like we um [Music] maybe we get it faster uh i feel like as soon like i said as soon as as soon as i was like properly explained what what proof of work was and how that operates it really fit for me and then and then and then seeing crypto punks 10 000 crypto punks three thousand songs you know there's ten thousand of those there's uh there's as many of i can make until i die of these like it just there's something that's sort of like me there's something that clicks in that realm uh it's hard to know now because because now there's meant there's quite a few of us thing a day people who are doing it although it's worth noting that like you know people when he came into the space unless i'm wrong about this he didn't it he didn't like make it into into something that had to do with his everydays it wasn't like he put out all of his everydays he was like much more curated about it and it was like here's this every day and here's that every day and then you know he did his big sale but that was like all of his every day is all at once it wasn't quite the same kind of like here you know here's the group and i'm gonna put them all up for sale um i think that i think that it's the people that get at least from the nft side the people that get it the most are the people who have been uh robbed of the ability for their artwork to be valued uh and beeple is a was a prime example because you know he makes these really cool images and there's just no way to monetize those in a way that is you know clearly what they're worth and you know i talk to eclectic method all the time and like you know he was tired of djing he's like that's how he had to pay his bills but all he really wanted to do is make like cool little 3d music pieces and like who the [ __ ] wants a cool little 3d music page like what are you gonna do with that you can't do anything with that but but now you can and those those are the places those are the spaces where uh i think people ultimately really get it is where the thing that they make has no like place to live you know has no place to like really reside which is true of me you know like i uh um writing a song a day for 13 years putting them all on youtube that's not a living you know that's not even like that's not even like an eighth of a living you know um uh so that's why that's why it was i think we it's it's maybe less to do with the everydayness and it's more to do with like the lack of of of value put on the stuff that we create i'm glad that you took us here because if you hadn't it's going to be my my next question because there's a there's something i'm trying to circle a circle around and i think it's time that we descend there you started off with talking about the connection between what you're doing in proof of work and in in another way like one of the ways that i like to explain proof of work to people that are asking like the one-on-ones is like i point at um the egyptian pyramids because when you go to the egyptian pyramids like it's a proof of work like you know that that took a lot of work like you don't have to verify it you know that it's true you just have to look at it right and so that's one of our early og like proof of works like if aliens came to planet earth they could see the pyramids be like oh that took a lot of work [Laughter] [Music] and then they can go to your youtube channel and see your upload rate and it's like oh once one song one a day they're all unique they're all different oh man that that took a lot of work and you're telling me that like all these uh dares these creative adairs are finding crypto because of an insatia and some sort of need to fill a monetization niche and one of the fascinating aspects i've already said this once before and many many times throughout the bankrupt ecosystem like one of the cool things that really makes me bullish about crypto is that an ethereum specifically the ability to tokenize stuff uh allows and tokenized stuff on open public permission list networks that allows the whole entire globe to come and impart their perceived value upon these things that we now have ways to produce market assets financial assets that more closely align with our human values so we have the market value of our assets more closely aligned with our human values and so i think we have like these creative a dayers that are putting in the work that it's verifiable and that's backed by time you have proven provenly burnt time to produce this output yeah and like maybe it's not a financial asset like staked ether is or a bond a treasury bond but at some point like it doesn't matter because so many things in so many market the value of our market assets are perceived right we tell us we have these narratives of like the price to earnings ratio or price to sales ratio and that's a that's a value a fundamental valuation but it's also perceived yeah and then we go and then we start to zoom out a little bit and you're like oh well what else is perceived like uh a monet is also perceived but no one's gonna like argue with you about like the value of a monet and at some point like what's really happening here is like because we have so many creatives out there in the world burning their time in the same way that proof of work miners are burning their electricity to produce some sort of creative output and you don't need like in the whole entire financial system to agree upon oh yeah this this token has strong fundamentals you just need a hundred people or a thousand people to be like yo like the wave form of this guy's like sleeping words is like kind of unique i guess i'll pay a couple hundred dollars for that and all of a sudden like we have enough people to like support up these creators and the only thing that the creators really need to do is provably burn their time in honest and real fashion yeah and just to keep doing what they've been doing all along anyway um and and i think that gives it a that gives it like a another layer of legitimacy i think you know where um you look at someone who's been doing it every day anyway or has been creating their songs even if they're not doing it every day they're just you know someone like latasha has been like putting in the work for years and years and years so many people in the space doing that you can see that that there's you can't you can't fake that right there's no there's no there's yeah so um yeah absolutely and and i mean you know um i love that i i i take a i take a you know i take a pretty like measured approach to this and like i said i think it's it's more for me it's just like it's gonna be another tool in the tool in the toolbox ultimately same with dowels same with everything like ultimately they're all just going to be like this really cool tool that we can use uh where appropriate to like to like make cool [ __ ] and it's fun i have so many i keep getting calls from far-flung friends now who like yeah dude tell me about nfts you know that's that's happening more and more now so but when you discovered ethereum and and crypto and nfts before they were called nfts you didn't really see this as like oh this is how i can monetize my my song of days you were just drawn to it for whatever reasons no i was immediately i was like i i immediately saw it as there's a great there's like a video that i found actually um we can maybe share it in the show notes a video of a talk that i gave in uh right in 2017 not long after i had discovered crypto punks where i lay out the entire song a day nft project in 2017 like like i didn't know this video existed my friend had sent it to me and i give a talk about crypto punks i'm like here's these crypto puncture so aren't they so cool like and i point to this zombie one i'm like this one for instance like there's only blah blah of these and so it's really rare so it's very valuable see it's 333 dollars somebody's willing to pay 333 dollars for this zombie uh but then after i talk about that i'm like oh and like here's what i want to build on top of that with with song a day um and from the very beginning i saw it as like this way that maybe if you know if i could if i could be putting out my song every day and even just making like a hundred dollars or something somebody paid me like a hundred dollars in each every day for my song i'm gonna come out so far ahead then if i wasn't able to do that um and that that was like the impetus for me from the very beginning uh was it was was the monetization part uh you know and then the the further i got down like just like you said you you start going down these rabbit holes and you start discovering like oh right everything is made up like everything is completely just made up uh it's all stories stories like entirely down it's always all the way down it's all stories and so whoa oh that that's that's mind-blowing and then uh you know and then back in those days too there was so nobody um i've heard you talk about this too like even vitalik like nobody got nfts nobody gave a [ __ ] about nfts or understood and and there was a small group of us like me and like the dada people and the super rare guys and um jason bailey from art gnome there was a bunch of us in new york and we would have all these meetups and we would just get together and just like geek out about nfts in digital scarcity um [Music] uh and yeah anyway i don't know where i was going with that that was a really nice time that was like a really like warm fuzzy feeling time for me because it was like it seemed like endless possibilities at that point it was like we don't know what we're doing and if you know uh but a lot of it holds up a lot of the things that we wrote back then a lot of like the podcasts we did it holds up we we we called this i think in a lot of ways like we called the nft what would be compelling about nfts so what was the original monetization plan for your song a day with using nfts and how did it start and did it change over time it did change over the time but the basic idea again you can go watch this video the basic idea is exactly the same for the very beginning take crypto punks make it into song a day like that was like that was my goal from the very beginning and what's so funny is that like but not the generative aspect right like there is there is even the generator really well because there's the images i i hired a different illustrator for for each year of song a day and they each made layers of the illustrations which is like old hat now right like now that's just like oh yeah of course you would do that table stakes you know but back then it was like really like i had to explain it it was like really hard to explain to anybody it was there's like it was it didn't make any sense but i was like but look at crypto punks now imagine that and each song has an image it's generated from these layers and each layer each song each year is done by a different person and i did all that like that that ended up being my project and that was there from the very beginning each each crypto punk has all these traits and again the traits are like yeah of course of course you're gonna have traits like what your your thing isn't gonna have traits but it was like no no you don't understand like no one got it they're like trace what are you talking about traits what are traits no no so like there's a location like i sang my song and like there's a topic and there's like a there's all these different traits of the songs and they're like what are you saying like it doesn't make any sense but from the very beginning that's just what it was it was just take crypto punks and map it onto song a day and the main thing that changed actually was the dao the main thing that that changed from then to now was uh seeing some of the amazing experiments specifically like nouns dao and and the song that owns itself and those blowing my mind in a whole new way and deciding to like bring that part of it and glomming that on to the song of the nft project that i had been building for forever anyway um uh yeah so that that that's the main thing that changed was was bringing in the dow aspect yeah so what's this date of the song a day project now like as of right now where is it at so we on was a ton of work it was like ridiculous amount of work to to get this project going um i spent i spent probably like like six hundred thousand dollars maybe more total building this project which is like more than i normally make i make i up until this year i made about a hundred thousand dollars a year for the last 10 years that's like that's been my my my where i've been basil level yeah so the idea that i spent like six years worth of that just this year just in creating this project and funded through um this other project they made called [ __ ] trolls which is a pfp project making fun of other p p p projects i have to look at this i did not know this uh many people sell their trolls for zero so you can get some um uh which is which is just glorious it's just wonderful but we made a [ __ ] ton of money on [ __ ] trolls um i made a [ __ ] ton of money off of just selling random nfts this year and i was able to finally fund this project that i'd been dreaming of since 2017. i hired 13 different illustrators i paid them each like 50 000 to make um ultimately they made around 1200 layers all combined um i i hired raid guild which is a wonderful uh dao collective of people who who you can hire them to just just slay your project they call it slaying dragons uh and and build it so they did all solidity work and all the front-end work and all that kind of stuff uh and we launched on on december 31st and it sold out um like roughly 4 000 songs sold out in like an hour and a half which was amazing that's a whole other story of like how that happened um very specific to crypto story actually we can get into that if you're interested um but now what's been happening since january 1st and this has always been part of the plan is that i have been selling my songs on my website songaday.world every single day there's a new song it's being auctioned each day and all the money from those auctions goes to the dao now and so the dao has roughly i don't know 31 eth now um in its treasury just in like the last 16 days 17 days um and that will go on you know indefinitely every day i'm just gonna sit down do my song like i always have and tokenize it sell it you know we're going to see each other at east denver right so like um i'm uh hosting the shelling point conference that that uh owaki is doing a walking at somona and uh and so i have this plan where i'm hoping i don't really know if they're gonna let me do this but like my my my idea was i'm gonna bring each of you up on stage with like with like a little verse of a song that i'm gonna write about you and i'm gonna have you stand there while i sing your verse and then i'm gonna stitch all these verses together and that's going to be my song for the day then that song is going to get sold on my website it's going to be tokenized and auctioned off um and that money i imagine there's going to be some bids for that one i hope so i hope so and so and so that will you know that money goes to the dow uh and it's fun it's been super fun people are coming into the dow we're still getting our feet under us like we're we're working on um the voting of how we're gonna do voting because the way we're doing voting is one person one vote um we don't have a token we just have the the nft there's no token in the style yet maybe someday and and it's an nft curated dow rather than a dao about a new rc20 token it's it's if you own one of the songs of a song a day yeah if if you own one of the songs you are eligible to be in the dow the only thing you have to do to become fully in the dow is to get verified on bright id um and then you can vote once you're once you're verified with bright id and that's that's what we're trying to do right now it doesn't actually exist this is like a we're hoping to make this like a public good thing that doesn't exactly exist yet which is a snapshot uh instance or whatever you call it that um has bright id as part of it so that you can have a snapshot where you're sure that everyone who's voting is a person every single person who's voting is one person um which not a lot of projects are doing currently because it doesn't exist and that's what we're building right now um and it's cool man it's like it's it's crazy it's it's a it's a crazy world it's a and i'm i'm just so like excited and uh as jazz as i as i was the first day that i saw crypto punks how much do you let the dow dictate what your decisions are so the dao the the all mem anyone who holds an nft um ultimately is welcome to um have creative input uh and at some point once we have like the voting up and running we will be doing you know things where we'll we'll take certain questions to the dao like uh i have a lot of like collabs that i want to do and we can we can have them like suggest collabs or like uh uh steer the collabs in a different way um the dow ultimately if you are a voter if you if you're verified with bread id that's when you can deploy funds you know to to do grants or to do whatever ultimately um i would say that like the creative direction stuff is more of a suggestion and the the treasury stuff is more binding like that's the that's the ideas like once you're you know once you are verified that like you or you and you're gonna be one person one vote then we're gonna you know then we'll abide by what everybody wants you know like we have we already have proposals to do like a nftx uh vault for the songs and like you know um i'm down for it but like depending on what people want to do then we may or may not do that does allowing the dow to dictate your creative output make you uncomfortable no because like i said it's not it's not binding that part the the part but as because it because perhaps it would make you uncomfortable if it was yeah yeah well um i just think it would be less interesting because um uh i found that like most people don't give great suggestions is what i found and sometimes they do but like but i found that like you know it's it's more interesting to me what they will do with the money than it is to me what they will do with me with the songs leave the songs the professionals i guess is like is is is the way i'm thinking about it so what what about the dynamic of like there's only one of you yeah and so like the there the dow is really a dow around like the treasury not the song creation what's the dynamic like of you have this one guy who's responsible for the actual inflows of ether into the treasury what's that yeah well what's interesting about that is that i mean so we're only 17 days in so i don't really know what it's like yet um and i would like to get to the point where you know part of why i wanted to do one person one vote and that includes me is that i tried to because it's so me focused i wanted to give as much power as i could to everyone else knowing that i wield obviously way outsized influence i wanted to find a way to like to counteract that as much as i could and so that's the part of the idea behind one person one vote um but ultimately you know it remains to be seen ultimately like like how people are going to respond to it or what it's going to look like um so far it's been really fun and i would like to get to the point where um it's not just me bringing in the money um because there's a lot of opportunity for other people to you if someone got a song placed in a movie or something that could bring in an enormous amount of money to the dow uh and we have pathways for uh because the dow is a legal co-op like sporkdao is we have pathways where if you do something like that you can get paid by the dow um in eth you can you can get paid uh um from money directly from the treasury if you bring in it's called patronage activity there's this there's this co-op term called patron objectivity where things you do that um benefit the co-op entitle you to money from the treasury um uh so yeah i just imagine someone being a music lice licensing person and you know there's a lot of songs to choose from like listening through i mean like oh i like this one like maybe this one could fit here maybe or something and then if that happens uh all that money the all the royalties and everything flow into the dow all the off-chain royalties i mean like from spotify and from the the ideally i would like to get to the point where paramount pictures is not doing a deal with me they're doing a deal with my and and ultimately it's the dao has who has the lawyer who's deal who's hammering out the details and all of that money flows right back into the dow and the person who is responsible for that can see some of that upside how do you think the mere existence of the dao impacts the valuation of the nft songs do you think like because like you could just pocket all the money for yourself right and be a lot more direct yes i mean for a long time that was the plan right and right and part of the reason i valued part of the reason i i minted the songs the original songs the the archive of the songs on january on december 31st i had the mint price at 0.2 which is like really high for a project like this but the reason i did that was because that was the number that i needed to feel comfortable to give the rest of this money to the dow but i think ultimately it's a long-term prospect right like uh i don't know what's gonna happen and like right now we're living through this moment that's really interesting in nfts that i've that i've noticed i keep talking about this because it's on my mind we're living through like a it's it's burgeoning this like really burgeoning pure meme nft time that we're living in olive garden was a was maybe like the the first that i noticed gazali is another example this kid and now irene dow just like these three just like pure uh almost a reaction to the rallying cry that's been around for the last like six months of like utility what's the utility of the art the art needs to have utility and now there's a reaction that we're like [ __ ] utility this is a pure we're going dogecoin people were just going like pure meme there's it's just a it's the funny [ __ ] thing and we're all getting behind it and you're buying it and you're buying it yeah yeah right um uh so ultimately i don't know what's gonna happen but uh i've set up song a day in a way that i think you know i think in like really long-term ways you know because of i i i think about you know uh three like i said three years is a thousand songs which sounds like a lot but honestly man like the first thousand it felt like they took forever the second thousand kind of took a while the third and the four thousand went like that they're just like going so fast so i think about like three years in the future when i've done i've literally auctioned off a thousand songs uh and and all that money goes into the dow what are nfts even gonna look like like is is any of the stuff that's around now still gonna be around i don't know but i but i've i've built song a day specifically to like to be able to hopefully weather that weather whatever comes you know um having lived through the one the one uh winter that i did do you see yourself um changing what changing the songs that you write and how you write them or how you sing them or what what they're about because you now know that there's like a dow behind this and you're trying to want to be like a prophet maxie for on behalf of the dao yeah definitely and i and i you i talk about this even in the in the that very first talk that the the crypto punk talk that i was talking about from 2017. i sort of was aware even back then and i thought i thought what the vector was gonna be actually was rarity i thought the vector was gonna be rarity because that's what cryptopunx was and uh that's how people were valuing different crypto punks um so i thought oh like maybe when i'm doing my song a day like if i play with an instrument i've never played with and i do it in a location where i've never been and i sing about a topic that i've never sung about and i'm wearing an outfit that i've never worn like maybe um which i don't think is the case anymore and it's more about the stories about the space that that are that people want um now that's not surprising to me in the least because always the songs that get the most views are the topical songs right um all of my most viewed songs are either political in nature or about pop culture or whatever like those are all the ones that have the most views right uh so songs about crypto you know makes perfect sense that those would be the ones that people are willing to pay the most for uh i would imagine that like if the ens dao song for example yeah it would be really compelling for the enns dao to make an offer on the ens dow song well they own it they so it got oh they do oh yeah yeah it got minted it got minted you know i minted all the songs randomly in the drop and so somebody got it but then they bought it off them they they they were able to secure it there's a bunch of ones like that where the people who ultimately the song was about like they were able to secure it after the fact because i did it randomly i wanted to be fair and that's why i did random but uh yeah they own it they own it now um it it's it'd be really an interesting strategy to make a bunch of songs about a bunch of dows yeah and then allow the dolls to bid for the songs perhaps even in their native tokens so they don't actually have to keep or give up any of their uscc or something oh that's interesting yeah yeah yeah and then and then your dao has just a shares of all the other dows and just by just because you sang a song about them they kind of have to buy at that point yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah and there's you know i did a song about constitution dao when that was a thing um i've done yeah i've done a bunch of i've already done a bunch of dow songs i have a bunch of like collabs lined up with with nft projects that i love i should probably do some more dao uh aligned things we can do do you allow your songs to be commissioned by projects so that is something that i've not explored in this new setup because because um because of the auction nature of the thing basically there's been a few times now in the last couple weeks people have come to me and i said well listen i can't let you pay me directly uh it needs to go to the dow because because if i do it i'm going to make it i could do a song outside of song a day you know it could be like a separate song don't really want to do that don't really have time to do that so it would have to be a song a day song and so i was like you just have to you just have to like bid on it and just hope that no one's bidding against you and that's fine and then i'd be like i'd be like i guess what i'd probably say is like you know bid at least like two eth or something and then and then like then i'll just i'll do the song for you and you just have to promise that you're to bid at least two eth and then that's and that's probably how i would do it now if i was going to do that um yeah and i'm open to that i've done a lot of commissions over over the years you know a ton uh that's part you know part of how i made my living and so um as long as it's like something that i don't totally hate i'd probably do it have any uh community members from the dao stepped up to wear a leadership hat yes they have it's been super exciting um uh my friend boris who was like the first person to introduce me to crypto is in the dow he's been helping a ton i have a couple like mods that i picked out and they have like a
