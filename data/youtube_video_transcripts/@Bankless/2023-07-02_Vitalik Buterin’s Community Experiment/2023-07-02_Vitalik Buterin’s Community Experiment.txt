in the last two months I was in Montenegro at this thing called zuzalu a brainchild of vitalik buterin zuzalu a two month long experiment in a temporary Community the way that I think about the experiment is conferences have thousands of people and they last for a week right and those already exist hacker houses last for a very long time but they only have up to 10 and 20 people but what about something that has 200 people so more than a hacker house and lasts for two months so more than a conference and it has both of those at the same time basically bring people together from a couple of different communities with um medium level of organization and just like see what actually comes out of that
