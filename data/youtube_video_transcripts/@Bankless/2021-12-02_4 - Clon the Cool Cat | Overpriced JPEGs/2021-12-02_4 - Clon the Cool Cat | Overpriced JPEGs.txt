overpriced jpegs i'm so incredibly excited to have you on the show grateful to have you on this show when we launched this show uh coolcats was one of the very first projects i wanted to talk to because i think you're such an interesting story you've blown up so much and i really wanted to hear direct from the horse's mouth how this journey has been how this all happened and i know there's a lot of people out there who want to understand the same so thank you so so much for being here yeah thank you for the introduction and uh it's been a crazy ride a crazy journey to get cool cats to where it is and it sort of all started with me just doodling on a piece of paper and just keeping at it until nfts came about and that was where i went with the character so let's talk about that i guess we should say and maybe this is obvious but you were the artist behind cool cats so yeah you've drawn all the cool cats so start us like when did you start making art tell us your background and what was that journey from you're an artist and then you discover nfts how did that how did that go yeah because i mean for a while i had been looking at nfts from the outskirts and just like many people didn't understand it didn't when was this when did you first hear the term nft but you're like what is this probably 2020. but like i didn't research anything i was just like i heard the word nft figured out that it stood for non-fungible token and i was like this has something to do with crypto i only kind of know crypto i'm going to stay out yeah and like that the libertarians doing weird things trying to take down the banking system no thank you yeah like what's going on here what's the internet on and so so that's how it was and i had always been drawing like i said and but one day uh my friend evan aka ilu another co-founder of cool cats he actually brought me on to a different project um as a motion designer because that's what i did professionally before this and i was just creating digital content for him that's all it was i got immersed into the nft space through doing this and that's kind of how i learned about it and so i was learning about like board apes because they had just released and so now we're in 2021 now like you've been doing this work we're in 2021 and you're starting to be like oh okay and things are starting to pop okay and to clarify all of my crypto experience is in 2021 um i officially started my crypto journey in february when i like started investing in cr and eth more and a little bit of bitcoin um so i had kind of been saving that up as well just as like a second savings account for myself because i started to understand it i was like oh this is a cool global decentralized uh currency and that you can do so much with that so what was your aha moment for nfts was it was it fort apes or do you did you have a moment where you were suddenly like oh oh my god like i get what this is now it uh honestly it didn't because i and i understand board apes now obviously at the time i was like i don't get it i don't understand why people would pay this much for this image uh because i was also coming from it from an art art standpoint that's like i'd pay this for like digital like art like a one-off like a complete one-off kind of thing um but i was only looking at it from the art standpoint and not that this is literally a token like at the end of the day a lot of people will strip away the the visual and only see it as a token um and because you could make money off of it and it's i guess when it really clicked with me was like oh you're investing in the project the like kind of ip of it it's no different than buying a stock in a company like that's what you're doing you're buying it so that you believe in it don't tell the sec that you're a cool cat you're about to get slapped with yeah yeah yeah some sort of security now i'm just kidding right right right but like that's how you could kind of like understand it if you had any idea of the of the market and so um it really clicked with me i guess with board apes as well but a few other projects none really off the top of my head because the it was funny the nft space was so different back then uh people were doing bonding curves and like it wasn't all about pfp projects um and things like that so um back to when i was working with evan when on that project he we were doing that whatever and then long story short our dev fell through and like completely rugged us and was like i'm not helping you anymore and so we're back at square one and we're just like uh what do we do we need to go find developers and through that whole process like even before that developer said i'm out um i invested in another nft called phaticorns and i was talking to the devs there we were getting close um turns out that's tom and link the other two co-founders of cool cats so that's all how we all met was through their project um and they didn't want to help us with the project that evan and i were working on because i didn't want tom literally said i don't want to destroy your project what was that project uh i don't want to say it because it hasn't been publicly said yet um but and that's the only reason but so he didn't want to help with that and then evan and i are like really depressed the next two days like what are we going to do with this project we just spent like weeks and weeks and weeks developing or like designing and stuff and now we don't have a desk and yeah no we don't have a dev i was going to point at the poster in the background but i'm laying on my there used to be a couch here i was laying on the couch and looking up and i see this poster this old the catoonis poster the work i did before cool cats and it was blue cat in a bunch of different outfits and just like stacked on top of each other and there's probably like 50 of them and i was like wait a minute i've had this character just sitting here right in front of me this whole time and look at board apes they have this like generative costume thing going on what if we just did our our take on that and it boom hit me and then i just went wild like just sketching and sketching and sketching and i was like let's call them cool cats um and this was just between evan and i and then we go to tom and link and we're like hey we don't want you to help with our old project we have this new project and we think it's going to be a hit and then from there we all like as a team equal parts like started cool cats together wow and then so let me let me ask a silly question you you said the name cool cats kind of hit you or you and evan decided together on that did that have anything to do with tiger king no like hey you cool cats and kittens like as i was researching for this i was like i wonder if there was anything there because tiger king was such a you know 2020 this kind of general era absolutely still have never seen it oh wow yeah so definitely no definitely not but it kind of hit me because um like i said the catoonist was my instagram account before cool cats um where i had always been drawing the character yada yada yada the point of me telling you this is i always hated the word the name the catunist the further i got along because so many people either called it the catunist the cartoonist they just didn't even see the play on words or they just misspell it and that's nobody's fault it's just a confusing word and so i was thinking of the names for for cool cats and i was like well cool as a word anyone in the world probably knows and cat and it's just and it's already a phrase people use like oh you're a cool cat um so it just felt like a no-brainer to me and um again it my analogy or not analogy my example is like if you're at a party and the music's blasting and you're trying to tell someone your name of the project it's like cool cats you're going to hear that it's easy it's easy yeah exactly and just any situation like that you know you can tell someone it and they could spell it and that's important to me um it's not confusing at all that's fascinating so i want to actually talk about what your your strategic thinking was in advance of launching but let's again orient ourselves time-wise here so you and evan approach tom and link and you're like hey okay we've got this other project idea they're now like oh these are some cool cats we're in where are we in 2021 and how how long was it between that conversation and then launching so that conversation probably happened around may 19th and give or take not to be tuesday give or yeah well i have it written in a notebook like may 19th and i that's kind of what i've been going off of okay um and so we started there and a lot of like the first week was just brainstorming and like our what action we're gonna take and at this time i'm also like drawing the character but in like a like template way um and then we have something there and we're kind of going with it and tom uh and link are just such geniuses in the developer space like we're thinking like oh how do we add rarities into this like what crazy things that we can do um and so from like that may range to july 1st our launch date like was just pure development and i don't know how it was for them but for me i i was a freelance graphic designer and for a while my my clients kind of just went under the radar so it was this perfect time where i had all the time in the world and i just went all in on making these assets and um you know i would draw a bunch of little hats whatever shirts faces throw them over to tom he would put them in a bunch of code and it would just like you could just spit out a hundred in like a second and we'd like go through all of them and that's how we'd look at them did you think about this as a brand at that point where you like were about to go build a brand and an intellectual property brand was that in your mind at that point leading up to launch i guess yes because with blue cat the character it's always been a brand for me i've always been trying to make that a brand uh just this one little blue character and then his friends uh so but then with cool cats yeah because we were taking that step into like i felt like we was a rebirth of the character um i'm curious if you did any like branding or traditional what people would think of as like traditional branding exercises and and what i'm asking here is i i interviewed betty nft from dead fellas and sort of off the cuff based on the conversation i asked her which harry potter house dead fellas would be in and she said slytherin and then it actually struck me that's kind of an interesting almost like branding exercise of like this is the intention behind the character like what house are you in so a what what house would cool cats be in i think would be gryffindor yeah yeah or maybe or hufflepuff yeah for sure for sure for sure but both could fit but did you think probably not about what harry potter house it would be in but did you think about okay what's the what's the culture we want to create here what does our brand stand for like some of that traditional brand thinking work in that time um there's actually a this kind this doesn't quite answer your question but and this won't show up in the the live stream but i had this sticky note anyways it was a scale it's scales of justice kind of if you're if you're listening in the podcast yeah scales of justice thank you let's visualize this skills of justice and on one side it says cool and on the other side it says cute and it's it's this balancing act where i need it to be both cute and cool but it needs to be a little bit cooler than cute um and that was my like i know it's so simple but that's what i was running through my brain i think that's important and because i know a lot of people who listen to this show are interested in maybe doing their own project one day like having people realize the kind of thoughtfulness that gets put into these projects that i think end up being successful is so valuable what did there any couple of things you could point to that were decisions you made to make it cool like what were the what were the cool decisions to like help boost the cool if you look it's certainly a trace it was like certain traits i'd come out with um you know you're like cowboy trait that was like cooler or something like that versus like a flower in the hair which was cute you know because we needed to have both and it wasn't like i was trying to make traits that were for females i was trying to make traits that were either feminine or masculine and kind of everything in between so that it didn't feel like blue cat was being gendered in any way um sometimes you'll hear me call blue cat him and that's just how it's been but like i love when someone finds their forever cat and they call like oh she's so cute i'm like that's what i want i want you to say whatever you want kind of thing yeah and that's kind of the going back to your other question of like the what audience or whatever we were looking for um it was actually tom who really spearheaded the idea of like let's go all in on being family friendly like as uh founders let's not like cuss anywhere you know our none of our cats are smoking drinking beer none of that and that's because it's already so playful and friendly that we just double downed on it and what we found was there's a lot of people with kids who now can introduce nfts to their kids through cool cats because it's a safe bet they're not worried about it being it's like g-rated you know and so they can show their kids and it'd be fine um and that's helped out a lot and a lot of people have told us their stories of like it's fun that i can do nfts with my kids and they can kind of understand it um and that was just big and so we've really gone like extra fur like further with that after hearing all these stories um yeah so that's kind of the audience and so you had that idea in mind even before you launched this family-friendly idea and then and then you and then it really was apparent like after the fact and that's oh no pun intended up here there you go so you launch in july and was it successful right out the gate like in the first day you sold out quickly was it did it have all the makings of that kind of we had a weird launch day in in the best way possible it was a weird launch date where we came out of the gates with a .06 um ethereum price which at the time was like and 150 dollars and uh you just got one cat for that you minted it and you instantly saw it and we initially had a lot of sales but it only got to like 300 out of the 10 000 and you could see that it kind of just plateaued and it was just like some sales coming in and then there was a a user that came into our discord and was like hey i'm ready to buy a bunch of these if you were to lower your price uh and then everyone in our discord is like oh my gosh yes we'll we'll buy even more if you do this and so we switched it from .06 to 0.02 which was like 50 bucks and um we sold out in the next six hours it's like it just kind of took to twitter and then everyone's like wait a minute this these people aren't like cash grabbing they just like want their thing out there and so it's sold out and because of that we had a lot of people who didn't have a lot of money and only bought one and they're still holding that one um or or they flipped it a bunch of times and then now have made more uh got more money and more cats or whatever but it was just cool because we let in this bigger audience and because of that this community got formed because it was just a lot of different people not just people who had a lot of money in their wallets and so it created this really positive space so that decision it sounds like are you crediting that decision in part with then kind of launching the community in a certain way and setting the tone for what the community was in a way yeah like the art definitely definitely lends itself to that and us as a team because another thing you didn't see often in the space was the devs like the founders of the team were talking to you because usually there's this veil of like we're we're the founders of the team you're buying our thing we're gonna like only feed you information when it's important versus us where we're sitting in discord every day like you have a question we'll answer it like we're here for you um no no question is dumb kind of thing because this is a confusing space and it's really easy to get scammed or do one thing wrong and you lose a thousand dollars or something so so that decision was huge i'm curious though because there are so many people who want what you have right and one will launch a project and have it sell out in 24 hours even if you know there's a plateau period right what else do you think you guys had done right in in terms of building a community or where you got lucky or what were the factors that you think allowed for you to sell anything on that first day when you launched the project right so funny enough uh our marketing wasn't the best people didn't really know about us so it's not just marketing that's uh can like make or break you but um i think we got lucky with dropping our price it's just that bit of news like hit the fan and it was just a bunch of people who never knew about the project because our marketing was like whatever and so um i think what audiences really attach themselves to is like in our case art that was friendly so like and that really went a long way it's hard to explain but then like just a community of people who are literally willing to help each other at any cost like we're in it together kind of thing and because of that now months later there's a lot of people who were in our community that have now started their own project because they met through cool cats and that sort of thing is just so crazy to me that communities like this can com conform and then like a new project comes out and we all show interest in it and like the cats as a whole like move to this other project and like invest in it and whatever and start more communities and it's this like web that's growing um it's really cool we're all like i said willing to help each other do you feel like at the time you were filling a gap in the market where there wasn't maybe this because i think of now i think of a lot of there are a lot of cute projects but this cute cool balance do you feel like at the moment you guys launched you were filling a gap and that was part of what you said people resonating with the art and that's something you know how can you do something different or innovative or see what's not in the market at the moment and and absolutely try and deliver that yeah and we didn't really know that's what we were doing at the time uh but it hit us after the fact and people have told us was like there was nothing cute on the market just straight up nothing cute existed on the blockchain it was all for like i hate to say this or generalized it's all for like the bros in the space that were like they want laser eyes they wanted smoking a cigarette they want it like hardcore looking and that's how the majority of them were um super yetis had come out and that was kind of leaning towards like a little bit cuter but apparently their metadata whatever didn't work so well i was a little late to that so i don't know too much but anyways like we came out with this like cartoon style like cute very easy to understand and even through the catoonis one thing i've always said is people gravitate towards cartoons more because it's just like more welcoming i don't know yeah i interviewed matt lavelle that that episode is airing this week actually he came up with the idea for cryptokitties and he back in the day and he was like i had been in like consumer goods products for years and i'd learned that cats were opt out not opt-in like if you were making a consumer product yeah you had to justify why you weren't making it a cat not why you were making it again so you you hit that well um well and there was also like other cat projects out there and so we were worried that we were just going to be one of the other ones so that was but they weren't cute enough they weren't cute enough they weren't cute enough exactly you said you said your marketing wasn't great leading up to launch why was that what do you think you guys could have done better i don't know i i felt like we were creating like decent content um i think oh actually i do know where we went wrong and it's because none of us were thinking about it we needed to get onto like twitter spaces or clubhouse and just be talking because we were kind of under the radar just posting like promo videos and stuff which i thought were good um and thought that that would be enough or just like interacting with people on twitter but it didn't get enough reach and i think i realized that post launch when we did get on twitter spaces and we just kept getting more people more eyes on us um because you have someone like like the first one we went on was with faroq on clubhouse and then now there's this whole other audience of people who never knew about you and now they know about you did you think do you think going on for roke would have been possible for you all before you launched though or was that something that became possible because you sold out a project i think it became possible for us and that's the difficulties is like how do you squeeze yourself in to get noticed or does the artwork itself speak for you know i don't know um it's tough it's definitely this has been in the art world for years and years and years it's unfortunately sometimes who do you know and that's how marketing can can be better is who do you know i think we'll we'll definitely circle back that because i want to do a whole section here where i hear your thoughts for artists who are trying to get into this space and artists in general so putting a pin in that you said something interesting which is you feel like part of your success was because the team was so accessible and was in the discord and was chatting with folks and as i've been thinking about this space in general one thing that maybe makes me nervous is that projects are really dependent on their founding team you made the comparison to the stock market but like if coca-cola the ceo of coca-cola says he's going to step down or she's going to step down like maybe that impacts the stock price you know people like her whatever but nobody's freaking out yeah they'll be another ceo of nowhere yeah exactly like this is not a death blow you know when founders of a project leave it's called a rug poll you know yes and and partly if that's a joke because you know you can have a founder who leaves in an honorable way versus a non-honorable way right right i'm curious if you think that we are in a stage right now with nfts and how you think about cool cats where they're still very dependent on the founders themselves you know and if that makes you nervous and if you think that'll change in 10 years if it's an established enough brand or how you think about that central importance of the founding team yeah well and i think for us you know we're all very very very passionate about we're we all have achieved what we think is like a dream job and so we're in it for the long run but that's obviously not every project and like with cool cats the reason we want to be the reason we hold a town hall meeting every friday even though sometimes i'd love to have my friday but uh it's because we want to talk to you and make sure you know like we're still working on this our like we're not going anywhere we're not just going to leave one day because we have kind of seen that sometimes where the project doesn't do well and then it just fizzles out and it sucks because a lot of people invested money in that and now they feel cheated so for cool cats we just try to make sure you know like no matter where this graph is going like we're in it for the long run and we're going to keep going um so if you believe in the project like thank you well let me suggest a way i see this playing out in the space kind of in general but i use cool cats as an example and okay tell me if it resonates for you if you're like yeah that feels right to me i think what we're still in this very nascent stage in nfts so the founding teams are really really important i i used to be sort of a student of warren buffett i worked at a hedge fund that like did everything based on like how warren buffett saw investing and uh warren buffett has a very funny quote that is a ham sandwich could run coca-cola and his point there and he actually has another line that's like invest in companies that even an idiot could run because eventually an idiot will right like his whole thing is you want brands that have such a strong moat that it almost doesn't matter who's in charge because the moat of the brand is really strong so it seems like where we are in the nft stage right now is that all these brands are so nascent that they're still very dependent on the founding teams and the the kind of myth and cult following of the founding teams in the best sense of the word but that the goal for a project like yours is to build an intellectual property that becomes so sort of recognizable that eventually it can be somewhat separated at least in the mainstream from the founding team right and so in 30 years you wanted to retire you know whatever right yeah you have a brand that can now stand on its own is would that be how you would describe maybe your goal yeah you know 100 yeah that's that's exactly how i see our goal like our goal is to be a hello kitty of the block chain is to be so big that you're going to see blue cat's face slapped on everything and that's why like um the ip is so important to us is because it's not just an it's not just a cat it's a character of a cat and so it's a character that has personality and a brain literally a brand formed around it and we want that everywhere and so that's kind of the long and we're going to do that through different ways whether it be like a video game tv show books like you know we're just trying to get into uh the real world too because i don't think you should just stop at nfts i think there's a bigger picture here um and we're we have to get into the people who don't want to get into nfts but now you have this this launch pad because of nfts to get into other people's eyes um and so whether that be through like i said merch or tv shows video games whatever um are you having conversations i'm assuming with i don't know studios or like these irl you know right people and brands about partnerships and collaborations and building shows and not to be too specific about anything right right and i'll stay vague about it um but for sure like we're we're having these conversations we're like cool cats is in it for the long run we're thinking not just right now in the nft space of where the blockchain and web 3 is going to end up and how are we going to still be there kind of thing and so by talking to different companies and whatever is you're just solidifying yourself as a brand because like when time magazine came in that was a massive deal because it's like whoa this company that's been around for 100 years like recognized our brand and said we want to work with you and you know obviously that was great for cool cats but it was great for the space in general because it's also validating nfts and that this we have something here and time and keith grossman approached you for that deal is that right yes yeah and it's funny because i've read about this and it seems like the family-friendly element was actually what keith was was drawn to is that right is that like that ended up being why they approached you and how that came together absolutely and that like i said that's why we double downed on being family friendly is because we're gonna see bigger brands coming into the space and are they gonna want to take a risky bet or something that you know could rub people the wrong way or the safe bet that's family friendly you can show your children and it goes back to that scale of cute and cool like we want to make sure it's you know cute enough for kids but cool enough for adults and that is the scale what is your pitch to these i call it brands or studios or whatever you know you're on the phone like hey work with cool cats what is that pitch like oh we tell them about the ip we tell them about our community because i think that's extremely important we have people who are ready to like stand with us and i think that's a hard thing for any company to establish um and do they get it do you find people are getting it immediately when you or is there like an explaining the blockchain process or are people so hungry to like work with nfts because it's so hot that they're like yes teach us your ways like we'll do anything it's a little bit of both some people come into it knowing about the blockchain other people are coming to us because they're trying to get into the blockchain and there are going through us is kind of their route to getting like onboarded i guess so and you all recently hired a biz dev person is it pete yes we got pete yeah we're and we're hiring more people in general uh we've asked how big is your team now and gosh it's gotten actually kind of big um i think we have around like 15 people now and it started with four um i could be exaggerating that number uh because there's some people who are like on the team but are more like use case but pete is great he's helped they're all because we were wearing so many hats at first when it launched and it was just the four founders um that's like i can't answer emails anymore if i want to draw like i can't do xyz and so we've been hiring people on and like i said our marketing kind of wasn't the greatest at the beginning so we hired uh one of the community members that had been in the community almost since launch and she always was trying to like promote the brand do anything she could to help and then eventually we're like well you're crushing it on twitter do you want to just be paid for it kind of thing and it was like yes and so we're constantly trying to bring in people from our community because they obviously like the brand and they understand the space and it's helped out immensely it's like it's funny you grow your team and you slow down a little bit but in the long run you speed up exponentially and so that's kind of where we're at you you all made the decision i think early on or from from launch point that twenty percent of all you know eth that came in would go into a treasury that would be given back to the community i have that number right is that correct yeah the twenty percent although it was twenty percent of the initial sales oh twenty percent of the initial sales not an ongoing basis okay i'm curious but we kind of do still kind of feed into that just not like an exact 20 it's kind of like a oh we did this charity piece or or a piece that's directly going into the community wallet and things like that and that's how we kind of compensate and keep filling it up well i'm curious how you think about because your community is really strong and that's obviously a huge part of not the core to your success how do you think about these day-to-day community management activities with this longer term brand building and balancing that and do you think of those as two separate work streams are you all working on both all the time how do you how do you approach that yeah well the brand is like kind of something i guess i had already established before cool cats and it's now like making sure that that gets executed um do you mind repeating the question i think i missed out on one aspect of it and i was just about to ramble i i appreciate you your honesty you know i was asking um how do you think about the balance between long-term brand building so some of this biz dev stuff we're talking about and partner partnerships and all of that with day-to-day keeping the community engaged giving 20 back to them with giveaways etc like are these two separate work streams you work on both are you know do you have separate you know plans when you look ahead how does that work oh we try to do both at the same time but that was another reason we brought on like more moderators into the space is because unfortunately i can't spend as much time in discord if i want to keep the brand going you know it's like this trade-off of like do i want to talk to everyone or do i want to help out the project that they're invested in um and so it's definitely a balancing act of we as founders are having our talks of like the bigger picture stuff and then we're kind of relaying that down to people and working with them still like we're still doing those things but they're helping us like make sure we execute them um and getting to the finish line that we want to of the brand and where we all kind of see the bigger picture of it and it's crazy because some things could take like like there's things we have in the in the works that are you're not going to see until later next year kind of thing and those are like the bigger things but then you have to come up with the smaller things like oh it's christmas time how are you going to do like christmas themed things and keeping your community engaged because you can't just within this space like you have to keep fueling your community or else you're gonna get forgotten about um so yeah it's a weird balancing act and it's really it's really difficult uh so you all grew from a mint price i guess really of 0.02 so you dropped it to at one point hitting a ten eighth floor i'm not somebody who advocates like tracking a floor like crazy i think you should invest for the long term but you know still heck that's that's crazy growth um why is a cool cat worth 10 eth why is a cool cat worth 10 needs so to break it down for especially for anyone listening that has no idea how these jpegs cost so much um the best way i put it is it's a collector's item and it's a token as well so it's like yes it's a visual it's a picture of a cat but it's also a currency it's no different than ethereum or bitcoin you know but now it's visual um but it's all tied around the company and so you know how well the company does etc so because there's only ten thousand of them the more people who find their forever cats or are just as we say diamond handing it and holding them on so tightly and never giving them up that the scarcity goes down and so it's like well do you scarcity goes up oh i'm sorry it's more scarce thank you thank you i'm always double negative yeah double negatives i always get those wrong and so because of that because of the scarcity going up we it it gets harder to get into the project because people aren't willing to sell them and so some people you know when it gets up to the 10th floor everyone's like well i'm not selling it for under that so if you want to get in on this project to get into the community events to feel like you have ownership in it or just to simply have a cat that you really relate to that's how the price goes up and it just fluctuates with where people think the price should be or if they're just trying to get as we call liquid just get your money back um and things like that and then the crazier thing here which i didn't really grasp in the nft space was people are looking for digital identities a lot of people have gotten a cool cat and made an entire brand around that and the best example of that is andrew wang who is a journalist and he bought the upside down cat and that was like a big story at the time because he spent five eth on it um but he had like a whole story about it and definitely researched that it's a lot it's an interesting story and through it andrew found a community he found friends and he found a voice and that all was around this cat that he bought and so if you ever see a upside down cat that's andrew like ever just even referenced anywhere it's andrew's cat or something that's upside down and so like people make brands off of it too and that's you've built an umbrella brand that people have clearly responded to and clearly resonate with and when you're able to kind of command a community like that you know that's the thousand true fan theory right or like you know when you're able to command a number of people who feel really bought into [Music] sort of the feel and the brand that you've created that's a very powerful thing and nfts are doing it in a unique way yeah and you guys have done it incredibly well it's weird when prices get up that high like even i have to like take a double double take and just be like what and i remember i was leaving my this is a separate story tangent but i was leaving my job after launch and i was trying to tell my employer or my my client at the time i'm like hey i i'm leaving to go do this full-time uh and he's like wait explain this to me i'm like all right here this thing's sold out like these are a bunch of cats i drew yada yada and i laughed with them but he's like this you just sold a bunch of cats like this and i'm like yeah he's like i don't get it i'm like it's okay not a lot of people do but it's uh it's a currency and that's how you have to see it um it's weird i want to talk about ownership rights and and derivative projects because i think this is a battle that the space is gonna face in general for a while it was recently kind of resurfaced the crypto punks crypto funks thing yeah and i think cool cats recently had to deal with this you all had a medium post that talked about your where you guys stood on copyrights and and if i may summarize this briefly it was like if you own a cat you can do anything you want with that cat with that cat yeah but you can't come at our project and like rip off all of the cats and rip off its project in the entirety i think where there was recently some confusion was in that original blog post it sort of sounded like but hey we're not gonna go out it's not worth our time to go after ripoff projects and then recently i think uh little baby cool cats you all did pursue in some capacity can you just talk about how that's evolved why you took action if this is the right way to phrase it against little baby cool cats yeah how do you think about that in general well and this is obviously a conversation that will always keep coming up um it's like where do you draw the line with your ip and like i've been saying with cool cats our ip is just so important to us mainly the silhouette of blue cat and the traits like and so with little baby cool cats where we poorly we had an a medium article that we realized after the fact oh we did mess up we um could have made this very we could have made this clear as what we see as a derivative and where we crossed that line was that they took our exact like trait assets and just scaled them down and to me that's just a copy and paste project that's not a derivative to me a derivative is reimagining or like redrawing everything and taking a fresh take on it and there's another project that came out on cool cats at like the same time and they were a great example of what a derivative project should look like and they like took the idea of cool cats and then just made all sorts of like crazy traits outside of it that they hand drew and redid and like in my eyes that's a derivative project the problem is because it's decentralized and it's web 3 we're fighting this battle of what's allowed and um it's tough because there's very much two sides of it there's a lot of people against what cool cats decided and there's a lot of people who were for it and we're just trying to figure that out and in my eyes like i think cool cast is just a little different and we can get into this more but like we were really the first 10k project to come out with an artist as as like one of the founders and uh and it's like my life's work kind of thing so i hold some of those things more dearly to me than something that i would have just paid an artist to do and that was our project it's like i've been building this brand for a while i put on the blockchain and so when i see something that's an exact copy that's where i cross the line and what did you do did you is it right today took action against little baby cool cats or i know the dmca like the did you try and delist them or what was sort of your your response there we just reached out to um open c and told them that they had been using our assets and it yeah mainly that they were just using our assets and stuff and so they got taken down and so then you know a lot of stuff had happened on twitter and we ended up talking to them and kind of what got resolved is that we're going to leave it up to our community to decide if they want something that's a copy of the thing they own or not because and that's another thing i didn't touch on was like we're also trying to protect the people who bought into our project who have spent that someone could have bought in a 10 eth they bought like it cost a lot to get this asset and for someone just to like copy their asset and now make it cheaper like they feel powerless when they see that happen and so it's up to us to be the voice for for our community and to take actions in that way and so we're working on it now but we're creating a way that our communities can community can be the one to kind of make these decisions because ultimately like it's their it's their decision on an individual cat by cat basis right right exactly in that way that's interesting it's like are you fine with that because normally you know you you have your cool cat you can do whatever you want with the image you own like and so when someone else is doing something with your image you're like wait what this goes against everything nfts is about nft is about ownership so um and that's why we did that so xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the tokens across all of your wallets but it also displays the nfts that you've been tirelessly collecting xerion even reports the

special thanks to overpriced jpeg partner blockblock not only because they are a sponsor of this show but also because they are my employer blockblock is an innovative blockchain lab we work across nfts and the metaverse and our goal is really to push the industry forward with every new project we take on we founded and currently run the meebit style which just partnered with larval labs to create more metaverse friendly renderings of me bits which is awesome we are also partnered with a sundance award-winning filmmaker to build the first dow that will own a feature-length documentary film we have a ton of cool projects down the pipeline and are really looking for cool people to partner with on this so go to blockblock.io to subscribe to our newsletter and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io i want to talk about milk slash gold which first maybe just explain what they are and the distinction between the two yeah as something that's coming out as part of the cool cats project so milk and gold is our token that we're offering um and i know that might be confusing you're like wait with the erc20 okay yeah exactly and so this is literally like a cryptocurrency like very much that's how you should view it and what's cool about it by introducing a token into your project it offers all of these interesting like new scenarios that you can do like going back to decision making like maybe there's you know it's about how many like coins you have or something that's that's actually a lame example but there's a lot of things that you can now buy with milk and gold and the first case that it'll be used is with the the cool pets that we're coming out with which is like our second offering for cool cats and each cat that you own produces its own milk and so by owning a cat like we're adding utility to your cat and that it generates milk and this milk will be like i won't use that example i was gonna say your milk is like your gold and but then it gets confusing because we have gold but like the milk is like the you know the higher end token but the only way you can earn it is by owning a cat or buying it from someone who owns a cat and so that creates this whole other market within our project and like um that just adds to everything that we can do and there's an expectation i'm imagining that milk will be available on uniswap and will itself become a token that has an economy and gets traded i mean people refer to these and there's mixed feelings about it but i'll say it and see a reaction of like it's a passive income stream essentially as part of right this project i think cyber kong's is kind of is yeah originated this with banana tokens and of course now people can make 270 000 a year right off of the passive income just by owning a cyber con right and like kind of taking it back a little bit that's why you invest in projects early is like oh i minted a cat for 50 bucks and i've held it for this long believed in the project now they're releasing gold and i get passive income through this and you can choose to sell it or not you know that's on the user um but we have use cases for the milk like if you want to upgrade your egg um and oh well egg is part of the pet and for every one cat that you for one cat you get one egg so you own 20 cats you get 20 eggs and each one of those cats is also generating milk and so with the milk you're buying items to then feed to your pet and your pet will slowly grow up until it gets to the last stage and turns into like an elemental creature or like pet i we used to call them creatures but they're pets now so that's kind of the use case for the milk and then we're gonna have different ways that you can use your milk in relation to your um your pet and then gold comes in for the people who don't own a cat and they we still want this other currency getting generated so like you go on a quest or you do like some event that we're doing and you get like plus 100 gold that's just a number i'm throwing out there and so we're great we have these two currencies that will work in tandem with each other and kind of feed into our ecosystem or you're just trying to play the crypto game and like you know you want to play the market with that so it's really on the user so is it safe to say is this publicly said or not that you've mentioned you're trying to build out potentially games with cool cats or a kind of a gaming type ecosystem and milk and gold would function as like in-game currencies within that hypothetically speaking i forget what we've said publicly but basically yeah like it's gonna be a an in-game currency for this whole pet offering and further like you know that's just step one as pets and so the reason i find that interesting is because one of the concerns i think around these again call them passive income streams and and i think what's like cyber cons in particular is it can feel like there's this circularity there where if i'm not mistaken banana which is cyber kong's coin can really only be spent for breeding and you breed kind of new generation kongs but so each thing just props up the value of the you know like the only reason banana is worth anything is because kongs are worth anything but kongs are worth what they're worth because banana is worth what they're worth and there's kind of a scary it feels like a little fragile to have an ecosystem that that's circular i think it's it's much more interesting if if there is a game component like if if this is for more than just you know kind of this this yeah this this circular process i think that um that's a much more interesting way to probably explore this concept and we're so excited like we're coming out with the beta test this this friday um and people will get to test out this whole system because it's tricky like it's not that easy to just be like oh we're adding a currency and that's it there's like obviously there's legal stuff you have to go through and then there's balancing so that no someone doesn't just get dropped like a bunch of money and you're like wait why did that happen so um are you dealing right now with lawyers with questions of like is this a security or you know you feel comfortable that you're on the you're on the non-security side oh no we're definitely getting help with all this because you don't wanna like you really kind of only have one shot to go live with it because the second your currency's out there you don't want to flood the market and now there's no value behind it so or you do yeah you just make a misstep so we're definitely talking to people is a longer process than we first imagined but we're taking the right steps to make sure when it goes live it's picture perfect i want to talk about your advice for artists and upcoming artists or you know in the nft space otherwise i'm sure you get artists who come up to you all the time and are like i want your life now or you know give me advice yeah what would you have you know one main or a couple main big pieces of advice for artists in this space particularly in this space yeah because sometimes i just try to convince artists who are outside the space to get in it and they just shut me down it glaze over yeah they're like ah you've you've said too many words and i get it because and too many of them involve blockchain and i heard decentralized somewhere in there but for artists in the space um i personally think making a brand of yourself as an artist goes a really long way because like obviously what you as an artist whatever you do you're attaching like whatever project you're on is also attached to you so like i mentioned earlier i'm pretty sure cool cats was really the first 10k project to come out with an artist behind it and no one had really seen that it was mostly people like hiring artists to to make their work and so just being the voice of the work that you're making goes a long way and people really like to connect to the artist and so that's why like getting on twitter spaces just having good content on twitter like it's tough for people just to find you i've been there for for many many years and people unfortunately don't just find you if you're not doing anything you have to kind of be vocal and of course like can they relate to you people are going to relate to artists they like and there's plenty of people in the space who don't relate to me but then there's people who love video games and watching anime or like being a d-gen on the internet and like those are things they relate with and they're like oh i like this artist i like their work like i feel that connection and that's what it's going to keep people around is forming that connection um and so because i just know i i've been there as well but i've seen a lot of artists who kind of stick their nose up a little bit and think that you know their work will speak for itself and maybe it will maybe it will but um i think making a brand of yourself helps out a lot yeah i saw something recently and i think that was like picasso was one of the only painters who actually was famous while he he was still alive or like one of the only artists like you might be a genius but assume that other people aren't going to pick up on your genius and that unfortunately you still need to you know market yourself in in a way what i heard you saying there it felt like was it was a note about authenticity so you're like some people won't relate to me and i think that's actually a critical piece of this is like to build a brand and to build a whether it's a personal brand or an art brand or whatever that people love and strongly relate to the way they do something like cool cats you inevitably have to have people who don't relate to you like if you're appealing to everybody you're not going to have that i'm not going to make it that's right that's sort of not the way it works and so being really authentic to who you are means you'll you'll find your tribe is i think what i hear you absolutely you synthesize that perfectly like you have to find your tribe you're not going to appeal to everyone like it's just an unrealistic view you kind of have to find your niche and then like stay within that and then that will grow you know if people like relate to it or whatever but you know how important do you think sorry finish that no i was just gonna say like i said i'm just trying to ride that cute and cool scale that's like the sphere i'm in and and staying light-hearted and just goofy like i'm not trying to take it seriously how important do you think networking is in this space it feels like kind of a not a dirty word but we think about like in finance you want to network and this space it feels like not cool to be like all like business networking but i think it's important for people to to realize it might be important i don't know if you want to say any words on that oh it's it's very important like networking is huge some of the contacts that we got like um our first collab with ghost and ghost is a for people who don't know is a very big artist in the space and i he'd actually reached out to me and i didn't know who he was at first and i forgot to get back to him and then you know i'm in the space like a week later and i'm hearing people talk about this ghost person i like buy their piece because i like it and then because of that it created he messaged me again and we started networking that way and like that's the reason we ended up collabing with each other because we networked and we started talking and that like be be a good person as well like you know don't be full of yourself because in at the end of the day we're all friends in this that's how i view it and like a lot of the people we've collaborated with i've had a a great conversation with um and you're just creating these bonds that get tighter and tighter um because we're in a lucky uh time in nfts right now where the space is still so small that you can make a lot of friends with a lot of people in the space and propel each other up and um there's a reason we say we're gonna make it like we're all in this together let's help each other out like oh board apes just did something amazing well that's good for all of us it's just jimmy fallon bought aboard ape that's amazing for all of us that's just validating the space and so um networking i think they're huge do you think they're any main or major pitfalls that you see artists in this space fall into or that you'd warn against don't defend yourself too hard the internet can be rough um and it can be easy to see a comment on twitter talking about your project that some guy out there is like oh not gonna make it and like don't let that get you down um just keep striving with the community that you have or you know things like that it's just because it's so ingrained on the internet we have a lot of strong personalities who sit behind their computer and i've seen some artists get defensive when they get in that situation and it can end up harming them because it's just not a good look you know and that's maybe a specific use case but i have seen it and it's unfortunate um so you have to pick your battles or just like brush things off and keep showing people why you're amazing i want to close by talking a little bit about the industry as a whole you mentioned buying uh one of ghost's artwork yeah i'm curious like are you still somebody who shops in the space do you you know are you still like an nft degen do you have any projects right now that you're super into that you want to call out like what i'm calling now yeah okay go dude and so recently um shout out to doug the artist of toy boogers and toy boogers just came out um and i it's funny i bought into the project without doing my research which is a no-no i recommend everyone do your own research but luckily it was a good bet um i their their collection is so fun and minting it gave me the exact feeling i got minting cool cats of like you you clicked the button to mint and the thing you saw you instantly fell in love with and it was just this like wacky combination like like cool cats you have like a night helmet with ninja like crying or something stupid i don't know and so with toy boogers it's like like it's wearing a donut head with a squid body like riding a skateboard and it's so light-hearted and fun and that's why what really let like uh pushed me towards it but then what me what really like solidified that for me was meeting the artist and like understanding their process that they weren't really like an artist in the space like they just liked to draw and so they like hand drew every asset and then like changed it into vector so it was digital and then just started piecing all three thousand and thirty three thousand three hundred thirty three of them by hand so they didn't have a dev like coding the general oh my gosh no they put each single one of them together and to me that was like this person wanted it they didn't have the right tools to just like give it to a dev and make it happen they wanted it they that was dedication right there and so that's what ended up like i was already sold on the project that drove the nail through the coffin how did you find them how did you find this project so another like what i love about the community it was a cool cats uh community member who's been in there since day one and they reached out to me were like hey i'm on this project of this artist who's doing you know toy boogers and i only saw like two of what they looked like and i was like oh cool like i get it and i like i had different ideas of what it was and then i looked at their collection like as a whole and i was like oh my gosh these are so much fun they all seem so unique and different um and so i minted three of them forgot about it all day got on twitter and their their twitter page was like oh klon got one and it was like i'm so happy blah blah and then uh people reached out were like you got a rare one by the way and i'm like wait wait let me look at all these and uh it was just so much fun to see them and i got so excited i minted like six more on the spot i was like i want more of these i had so much fun and so now i was spending all this time in their discord just chatting away um and like i think that's a great example of the networking we're talking about where like because this person had been in your community for a long time had been active had like had built a name for themselves as a community member there they were able to get access to you where somebody who's just trying to like shill you a one-off is not gonna connect that way so like you know and i'm not an artist in this space but i do have artists ask me because i talk about this space like how do i get into it and i'm like take time like if you're not already in the community i mean make your art all along but like it maybe it takes a year but like i you know hopefully last year's space moves really fast but correct immerse yourself be in these discords be an active giving community member to other people's projects yeah and that feels like the best way to have it fed back to you if you launched it absolutely yeah discord is a great purpose to get even closer to people like twitter there's a little bit of a wall because it's all social media but discord you get to like have these conversations like i just talked to the artists right away like because they're in their discord um and that's how you network and i agree like because i knew this person through cool cats i was willing to give them the extra bit of like few seconds to be like oh let me actually look at your project this isn't just you shilling to me like you said um because you get a lot of that and it gets taxing and you're just like then you start to shut people down which is unfortunate because i don't want to be that way but it's like i can't just look at i can't buy only so many hours in the day so many hours so much ease like i can't just do it all so yeah do you think the pfp market is oversaturated today i do i do i do it uh and i'm really waiting for what's next in in blockchain and web three um it's something mentioned that earlier what do you think that is like this is this is this is a big question i had for you gamifying like yeah i guess kind of like what games because it's already like what a lot of these people already do is game and so but it works well with web 3. um i really want to see more musicians in the space i want to see more people using the idea of what an nft is i've seen people use it as a ticket for something so like i recently just bought a ticket for someone who's gonna go put my cat on a mural somewhere because that was what they were offering they're like hey if you buy one of these seven tickets i'm painting this mural in this place and you can be a part of that if you've gotten a ticket and it's like there's cool things like that that you can do with tokenizing an asset that like has a receipt behind it has you know you can see the transaction that's what's so beautiful about the blockchain everything is transparent um and so i'm really interested to see where people take this and go i think we're in this stage of pfp projects because it's easier um and we've seen it done so many times like obviously cool cats was not the first one to do it um board apes was not the first one to do it uh crypto punks kind of was and so they started that idea and then you saw these personalities coming out people forming a brand behind their pfp and it gets to the point where people have already made their brand so they don't want another pfp to represent them and that's why i don't think it's going to last too much longer um unfortunately i was going to ask where you you think the biggest opportunities for innovating are you know given that but it sounds like you kind of referenced some just now i mean obviously gaming musicians it sounds like you're saying do you have any others where you're like here here's a gap i see that if i didn't have all of my time locked up in cool cats i might be taking advantage of i want to see someone who really ties their nft into the real world um if that makes sense like like a pokemon go but it's yeah you're going and finding nfts i think yes and that comes back to gamifying it so that's why i say gamifying it's just a blanket term of like how do you make it even more interactive because the biggest thing the biggest selling point behind an ft is is what's the utility um because if there's no utility they have to like the art and if the art's not good then no one's gonna buy it so um yeah it's tough i i'm so curious like people smarter than me are gonna figure it out or uh or cool cats will will hopefully set a uh pave the way pave the way or open okay final question i'm curious like what does a day in your life look like now after launching cool cats like what does like an nft superstar artist do today it's not as glorious as some people might think it's a lot of talking um and it's funny because i i through cool cats i've gotten better but i was not a talker before i didn't like uh well you're doing great yeah thank you because i get really nervous inside i did a an interview where i had to go like be in front of a camera and do that and that was like i essentially like in my in my head i like blacked out and i was like i couldn't remember what i said but they're all like you did great like that was awesome like cool because i don't remember but to go back to your question of what's a day in the life like if i just literally tell you like i wake up and i have to wake up around like i wake up at six and then get at my computer at like seven days you're an early bird i was luckily always an early bird but because of this um we have people who live in the uk we have people who live you know in asia like there's so many time zones but mainly the uk because there are the founders i had to shift my whole schedule to like work with that um because i wake up and like i wake up to a bunch of notifications because i'm the last one to wake up and so i first wake up go through all that make sure i'm good i'm the worst at responding to people that means discord i assume discord and dms and things discord twitter uh slack to talk to the team and it's just a whole thing but then you know we have a team meeting where the founders get together we talk about what we want to do for the week or the day whatever where we're at um and then i get to some drawing if i have some time um and it's weird i'm drawing like less sometimes because i have to talk more and like put myself out there network like we talked about um it's at that stage where you just want to keep networking you know you have the project um and then mainly just either yeah like draw or talk get on twitter spaces be active on twitter make sure people know you're still alive um and then twitch streams where oh i'm doing one today do art okay so that was an idea that started before launch and we were like hey let's make cool cat assets with people and so some of the assets you see were drawn on the twitch stream and so i've kept that going every wednesday um so i'll do one today and it's just a nice way to connect to the audience even more just like making that community bond even closer they get to see that like oh i'd see klon's process as he draws last week i did a tutorial video explaining how to do a generative project from scratch and so things like that people really respond to and you know just education so i do all that i get my work done and then uh my best friend who lives in georgia we have a like a cut-off point where we like to play video games together and i just disconnect from reality just play some video games and then usually like eat dinner and then draw a little bit more at night just like doodle on my ipad so that's the day in the life sounds like a good life man that's that's great it's crazy yeah well thank you so much for all this insight for coming on
