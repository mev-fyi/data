a material number of people are going to participate in a dow over the next five years they won't know it they don't need to know what it's called remember the average person doesn't know what a hypertext transfer protocol is we should be thinking about nfts the same way we should be thinking about daos the same way right these are underlying protocols we are so damned down in the weeds the average person only cares about user experience if i'm building here i'm thinking about this stuff and i'm thinking about how do we abstract away so much of the crappy parts of the user interface to make it seamless for people to get value out of this new technology being long-term greedy in this environment is going to be so much more selfish and such a smarter move financially than being short-term greedy if you're really creating something of long-term value for as many people as possible like that actually in this system is going to create a lot of outsized value for you in the long run but also do the thing that we need which is building things that people actually want and and actually sort of moves the needle on progress not just another lazy cash grab
