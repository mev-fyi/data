stable coins are one of the three uh trillion dollar narratives of crypto and i think that three trillion dollar narratives are bitcoin ethan stated points hey bankless nation we've got a fantastic episode for you today this is the stable coin wars we're talking to sam from frax who is deep in the stable coin wars he's he's one of them uh actually and you know his framing is maybe not so much wars but we're going to talk all about algo stable coins we're going to talk about um ust the four pool uh curve pool that was just launched what all this means how it it turns into actually we are pre-recording this entire episode so we've already had our conversation with sam and it's a fantastic conversation david what were some of your takeaways well first off stan sam starts the uh the conversation with a story about central banking kind of kind of a made-up story a parable uh but really grounds we like to say uh a number of times before in banquets that cryptos are speedrunning the history of money and finance and so sam speed runs through the history of central bank management right uh in a very fantastic story that really frames the whole rest of the conversation and i had a fantastic time just sitting and listening to that story and had so much to learn just in that one story and i kind of understood exactly how the rest of the conversation was going to unfold because of that story so i'm excited for listeners to be able to because that's where this conversation starts first but then we even get to uh lean into again the the four pool the usc the document spiciness and and how fracs has gotten caught up in the middle of this to frax's benefit yeah i'm gonna be honest david i walked away from this conversation really bullish on frax yeah like really actually excited um it's been a while since the project was just like wow this is really neat and so we were in uh we were in education mode that that entire time actually like on the receiving end learning um guys we're going to get to that conversation one one quick announcement though we've been telling you for the last week or so about these mac nfts from consensus keith herring nfts we're telling you that that was released would be released on april the 10th which is national hiv youth awareness hiv and aids awareness day those nfts have been released okay a whole bunch of them are sold out uh i managed to get my keith herring red just now because i think the yellows are sold out but the reds there are still some reds left at least right now i minted this baby i actually you could pay in credit card david so i didn't have to spend any eath on this what no gas fees just paid with a credit card pay you bought one you don't have to spend any yeah dude so i no gas fees i just like and um it's minted on polygons so this is it this is my openc account it says the floor price is 179 okay but i'm sure there's no liquidity on this uh these red you pay 25 for and of course all of the proceeds go to 100 of the the revenue i i should say go to support national uh go to support aids and hiv youth affected by by that disease so super cool there and there's still time there's 195 owners of it and there's and there's 250 total left so that's 55 of these ones left and you say there's no liquidity you want it but that's because no one's buying a 180 nft that they can go and buy for 150 dollars right yeah yeah that's another liquidity well there you go so uh anyway there's still an opportunity to do that and just enter your email address again no gas fees so quick psa there that's the status david i want to ask you the question i asked you before all of these episodes which is what is a say to the nation today oh the state of the nation today ryan is learning we are learning we're learning every single bankless episode but we're learning a lot sam had a lot to teach us he's a great teacher he's a great orator uh and so if i just felt like i was in the middle of like both a history lesson and a lesson in in finance and economics and it's my favorite type of show when when i i am not only learning but also being entertained at the same time and so um the state of the nation today ryan is learning all right great episode learn with us guys on the state of the nation we'll be right back with sam but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this

next guest uh sam kasmian he's the founder of fr frax finance a lot of f's there uh he previously got into crypto same way david hoffman my co-host did via gpu mining he also worked on the decentralized wikipedia project everpedia but in 2019 he started this really interesting algorithmic slash hybrid stable coin project called frax finance which is the topic of today's show because we're gonna talk about stable coins maybe some of the stable coin wars that are going on and what sam thinks of the situation sam welcome to bankless how are you doing i'm doing great thanks for having me this is uh awesome a huge uh listener and um you know excited to be on discuss everything stable coins cryptoeconomics awesome well um we're gonna get i think in the back half of this conversation to some of what people are calling the stable coin wars uh with the introduction of this four pool on curve and sort of what that means but um i i think we should start with maybe uh maybe maybe the top explaining fracs a little bit um but before we do i want to talk maybe get some context on why the stable coins are in in the focus of all of crypto right now so there seems to be like this narrative of of stable coin wars and a lot of conversation around ust these days and algorithmic stable coins this wasn't the case in 2019 when you started frax right like stable coins weren't as talked about and certainly algorithmic stable coins weren't in the limelight why do you think everyone is having this conversation now sam yeah definitely uh that's a great question so like you said i've been in the crypto space for a while kind of like how uh david got into it it got in around 2013 2014-ish um yeah i was at ucla a college student and i started kind of just mining uh cryptocurrencies dogecoin was actually the first one uh i started mining i still remember uh you know being like one of the first people to sign up for the uh eth newsletter when it was announced in like 2014 when uh when you know vitalik started talking about uh ethan back then it was uh counterparty and colored coins were the thing right as you guys probably remember um and stable coins were not even in the conceptual like framework back then right the earliest thing that's kind of i think i like to call the uh stablecoin whitepaper is uh robert sam's signer it shares white paper which some people might have read uh i actually like to call it like it's one of the most kind of like important pieces in in like stable coin design because it introduced the two token system of you know you have a stable coin on a blockchain and then you have a share token or like you know the volatile token that represents you know future cash flow or sign range or whatever and you could try to stabilize these things and that was even before you know smart contracts came out his thing his his white paper was about uh proof of work blockchain you just have a proof of work blockchain and and you know you have two tokens in it instead of you know one one volatile one um and so the industry has come a really really long way right and and just like how there's uh really important trends that you know you know grow exponentially like defy summer 2020 right like all of the yield farming d5 primitives and all these things and then nfts i think the next big thing is is uh stable coins and the reason for that is i think the the infrastructure and the ability to launch your own you know uh stable asset is finally mature enough to have that kind of cambrian explosion right like i actually like to kind of say there's you can now uh there's like a wordpress of stable coins now right you can you can create your you just you need like a deep curve pool or uni v3 pool or something some really concentrated liquidity you have to make sure to give enough yield uh there and it's like a cookie cutter playbook now right the infrastructure is there just like how the infrastructure for nfts with openc and minting and degenerative art and stuff was there and then you have this kind of curve right we're at the point where you have the infrastructure to kind of cookie cutter uh stable coins so there's gonna be a cambrian explosion of uh these kinds of things i think in the next you know from now until the next like 12 months basically do you think um we had a guest recently who said uh stablecoin is crypto's killer app would you go as far as to say that like staplecoin is the big thing that um yo crypto is meant to deliver i think stable coins are one of the three uh trillion dollar narratives of crypto and i think that three trillion dollar narratives are bitcoin ether and stable coins that that's my that's my uh view and so that's why i got really interested in stable coins that's why i've like kind of i look at it from a historical point of view like you know the first you know stable coin white paper you know this and where frax falls in line and maker and all these things i try to actually almost study it like a like a evolution right and um i think it is a trillion dollar narrative and so uh i actually am um of the belief like for example bitcoin is is a different kind of asset and eth is a different kind of asset and stable coins are a different kind of asset all three have such large uh potential that they're the three in my opinion multi-trillion dollar you know narratives the t the t uh size uh narratives of crypto people have spent their entire careers focusing in on stable coins when there's so much to pay attention to in the crypto industry uh sometimes people just get compelled by stable coins and that's just the thing that they are interested in and in inside of that algorithmic stable coins have had their own very rich history in the crypto industry um there's plenty plenty of history lessons to learn as algo stable coins have tried to get out the door there's uh there's the the story of basis uh then there's like the exploding stable coins of empty set dollar and dynamics that dollar and it really took a while for the algo stable coins to really get their engine revving uh i think frax being one of the first models of the stable coins that the uh kind of algorithmic stable coins that really started to work and then ust being the second one but uh correct me if i'm wrong sam but we've never seen a pure algo stable coin actually work um uh frax has algorithmic components ust has algorithmic components but they all step away from the purely algorithmic stablecoin model and i'm wondering if you think that the algo stablecoin model is actually impossible um maybe just based on perhaps some of the design decisions of that goes into algosable coins like do you think it's at all possible to produce a purely algorithmic stablecoin uh that's a good question in fact i think a short story about central banking is is like a good way to frame this conversation and i actually got this short story from jp koning's blog who's like a money blogger but basically this should kind of answer your question um this is like a short story about a central bank so it goes like this at the beginning there's a central bank and they issue pieces of paper that say one ounce of gold right and everyone's familiar with this right and every single day there's a redemption window at the central bank physically right and people are able to come and give their pieces of paper uh to the central bank you get an ounce of gold for each one okay and the the next part of the story goes that uh central bank says that hey there's a two-month renovation at the central bank and so we have to close the redemption window uh but the gold is all there for every one piece of paper that says an ounce of gold there's an ounce of gold at the central bank but we're closing redemptions for two months because the central bank has uh renovations and it's gonna open after two months okay after two months the central bank officials come and say okay actually uh the renovations are taking much longer than we thought uh it's gonna take six months more and the central bank is still closed but we can't just have these pieces of paper that say they have one ounce of gold written on them not trade for uh an ounce of gold right especially because you know there haven't been redemptions for two months so what we're going to do is every day the central bank officials are going to go in the central bank grab some of the gold go out into the trading markets and and buy and sell the pieces of paper for an ounce of gold from the gold that they take out of the central bank aka they're going to provide liquidity at the exchange rate of these pieces of paper and every day they're going to go back and get more gold if they need to or they're going to buy more of the piece of paper for an ounce of gold to make sure that the exchange rate of the pieces of paper that say an ounce of gold stay there but no redemptions right the central bank is under construction no redemptions no one-to-one uh getting from the central bank but the gold is still there it's all it's all one-to-one backed by bible uh okay so after the six months of the renovation uh turn around and six months later the central bank comes out and says okay look uh there's actually not one-to-one gold in the central bank we actually lent it out during construction and sold some of it but we have assets we've sold it out for uh loans bonds and these things we have some gold which is what we're continuing to go every day and market make the pieces of paper so that they are always worth an ounce of of gold per per piece of paper but we don't have one ounce of gold for every single piece of paper in the open market so construction construction's done but no more redemptions we don't there's no more redemption window no one can come to the central bank and actually ask to be redeemed for but we will keep doing the thing we're doing whereas we take some of the gold we have it we're going to go buy and sell pieces of paper for an ounce of gold we have a commitment or a central bank with the largest market player in the entire economy we will make sure those pieces of paper trade at an exchange rate of an ounce of gold per piece of paper and so after a while right the final part of this story and and one one thing i actually want to say here is is uh the the gold standard that everyone talks about right like 1972 when nixon took uh the dollar off the gold standard the gold standard everyone really likes is this part of the story right now where there's you can't redeem dollars for for the the actual backing because there isn't one to one at fort knox there isn't enough gold ever right but the government has a complete uh you know duty to maintain the exchange rate of of the piece of paper as best they can right uh so where does our story end right the the final part is after a while right the central bank says okay look it's really hard to keep these pieces of paper that say an ounce of gold pegged at an exchange rate of an ounce of gold with very little gold we sold most of the gold we have a bunch of loans that are making money but but that's not gold right the prices of those things change and stuff so what we're gonna do is forget that one ounce of gold per piece of paper we were no longer going to market make at that price and guarantee that what we're going to do is that we realize that an industrialized economy the most important thing is not that our pieces of paper are you know pegged to an ounce of gold what we have to make sure to do is the people that are getting paid in these pieces of paper we need to make sure what is the most important thing in an industrialized economy that people need such as food such as rent medical care cars electronics you know just good consumer items right things that keep your standard of living the same you need to be able to afford medical care rent all of this stuff and what we're going to actually do is we're going to compile all the prices of those things against this piece of paper and uh if the price of those things are are going up right then what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to buy some of the pieces of paper back with the assets that we have which is very little gold but a bunch of other stuff right and if the economy is becoming more and more productive so more food is being produced and more cars and all these things and the and the prices of those things are going down actually what we'll do is we'll just print more pieces of paper right to make sure the price actually uh stays the the same right and so we'll buy more balance sheet assets forget the the gold exchange rate right and that's what happened after 1972 right and uh i wanted to tell this the story to actually frame this this full conversation about stable coins because obviously uh this is actually the full true story of central banking evolution right you you start with one to one redemption and then you you stop the redemption you say you can't actually come to the central bank and get stuff from us and then that's when the central bank can be like we can sell some of it right there's no longer need one-to-one we can invest it in stuff and make money but we have to make sure we have some to market make and make sure the exchange rate is always the same thing we want and then you start realizing or the the the government starts realizing like holy crap it's really hard to keep the peg of something when you don't have a lot of that thing right and then they're like it's actually much better to just peg to a consumer basket of items and that does actually have obviously certain advantages right but back to the stable coin question the reason i i wanted to say this is that every financial thing including stable coins evolves somewhat similarly and has properties of these things uh you look at for example tether right tether started out as saying look we have pieces of paper they're called usdt tokens and each of them have one dollar behind them right after a while tether was like okay actually you can't redeem them anymore because like you just just promise that that we will keep the exchange rate the same but you can't redeem them from us only some people can or whatever and then after a while they're like actually we don't have one-to-one uh like dollars for the pieces of you know pay for our usdt tokens right it all looks the same and obviously like there's there's like laws that uh are passed as a society where people are like uh look if you issue a piece of paper that say like there's something behind them right you need at least 10 of that thing at least right otherwise uh you're committing a crime right that's called reserve requirements right and so um back to your question uh i think it's interesting because at first people thought that you could have algorithmic stable coins with absolutely no anything right like like the equivalent of this would be a the the central bank with zero gold with them saying uh the the pieces of paper have to have one ounce of gold you know exchange rate that's that's not gonna happen right like that so the answer to that i think is is no unless there's you know a lot of market making going on so someone's got to pay for it right and so that's actually where frax falls in line here is like we like to call ourselves the inventor of the the fractional stablecoin right and the thing is fracs is named after that the name is a portmanteau of the word fractional and algorithmic right and the idea behind it is it actually sits right in the the kind of second to last point which is you can have a fractional banking system that works pretty well obviously there's constraints right if you don't have enough of the thing things start to fall apart right but most of our financial system revolves around the fact that if you keep a currency stable you need some of it right you need some of the gold if you're pegging to gold you need something very very very very similar to uh dollar equivalents if you are pegging to a dollar but you can have an algorithmic you know supplier expansion contraction kind of thing and that's what fracks this fracks actually invented that before frax no one else was talking about that uh and you know i think if there's one thing uh in terms of crypto economic design that you know uh we're hopefully going to be known for is that uh we invented the fractional you know algorithmic design and one thing is that we've never broken our pec and our definition of the peg is one cent uh of uh one cent on each side so one dollar and one and ninety nine uh zero cents and we only look at like on chain stuff because all of our liquidity is on chain so like centralized exchanges can trade whatever they want but on unit swap on curve which were the largest pool on uh unisocker number five or six uh we have never broken our pick and we have billions of dollars of liquidity uh on chains so like that's one thing we're very proud of that we've uh we've designed so that's kind of where prax falls along sam i think we want to get into the design of of uh frax a little bit uh more but that was a really really interesting story and i think for for a lot of people yeah i really enjoyed that that was lovely um jp conan by the way is uh you know really fantastic on this space interesting sometimes jp koning is um crypto skeptical which i actually enjoy as well but you know uh the story also reminded me of um this chart from ray dalio i don't know sam if you've ever seen this right it's like he's like the the macro cycles of money where you start with the hard money like metal coins and then society inevitably goes to claims on hard money so from type 1 hard money to type 2 claims on hard money which is bank notes and then you get to type 3 which is which is fiat money which is the us dollar today where it's not really backed by any claim on hard money it's certainly not hard money and it strikes me in crypto we have all three of these experiments kind of brewing at the same time we have the hard money which would be you know the first two pillars of trillion dollar use cases you might say which is the bitcoin and eth and there are maybe some other examples in crypto of hard money and you've got the claims on hard money and then you've got like fiat money and i'm wondering like what what what what fracs is in this is it sort of a type to you claim on hard money would you say it's it's certainly not full um type three uh fiat money where it's you know more kind of algorithmic uh is it something more like you know a claim on hard money yeah so this is actually uh a great uh thing as well the the the cool part about the story like uh you're saying is we can actually ask that question right like where in the story that we just talked about it does this fiat money come into play is it where you can no longer redeem the uh pieces of paper that say you know an ounce of gold for gold from the issuing entity or is it when uh you know the issuing entity says that they no longer have one-to-one behind it but they'll do everything they can with the assets that they have to maintain the exchange rate in the open market is that where fiat money is or uh i think personally so for from the question i think it's when you as like a government say okay we're no longer maintaining even an exchange rate to something that's hard right something that is you know something like gold and doing something like the basket of uh consumer goods because that like when people talk about the gold standard right when nixon took us off and stuff the u.s government did not have enough gold for the circulating supply of like the the the money stock right the monetary base there's uh and so the way they were doing it is just stabilizing the exchange rate right and i think that right now most people would think that fiat money is when you just completely float against an exchange rate of like any hard asset right and so uh that's interesting because as you guys uh probably know we'll talk about we have the frax is a two stable coin system right there's the frax price index that we actually released last week uh but i think that frax basically right now is um partial our uh claims on on like hard money right because we have hard assets right and we try to keep an exchange rate to to the dollar can we um can we actually look at this i know david wants to get to like more talk about stable coins more in general there's more triangles more trilemmas ahead of us but um just really quick so so we understand so i'm pulling up app.frax.finance this is sort of a chart of fracs and fxs and a few other things wondering if you could just kind of decompose us a little bit so we see here fracs we see this number market cap of 2.6 billion dollars we see this other number over here of 85 percent collateralization ratio we also see this other asset called fxs which is a 1.8 billion um market cap can you explain some of the things that we're seeing on on the dashboard so that folks can understand fracs with with the numbers and what it's actually composed of yeah definitely so fracs launched with just two tokens frax and fxs all the way until last week actually when we launched the the frax price index stablecoin so frax is just the dollar staple coin each frax is is one dollar super simple uh price is great um frac shares is the uh governance token of the frax ecosystem and it's actually named after the robert sam's white paper that i think is his historical one because it's called signer shares we named this fact shares um and so that's just the governance token the collateral ratio there is actually the hard assets that are in the reserve or in the smart contracts in the series of you know system smart contracts uh we started out a hundred percent as you can see and then quickly kind of stabilized or kind of moved around between 90 to 80 and those are the hard assets that the protocol can can lay claims to a lot of them are curve lp tokens as you can see right on under the value there a lot of them are collateral from lending operations which we call uh amos algorithmic marketing operations those are just very similar to maker now right you you have a bunch of fracs that you can borrow right and and you collateralize it with uh over collateralize it with ether or everything else right so that's kind of like the the maker dow dye kind of system the algorithmic section is the section that is kind of the supply is expanded and contracted based on minting or burning uh fracture tokens right like the the actual governance token some people like to call it fracs is a hundred percent collateralized but there's just some of it that's clatterized by its own governance token these are it's it's not just uh semantic but i think it's important to think about like i would never say like something is necessarily backed by itself because like you can't say like the dollar is collateralized by other dollars at the federal reserve i don't know it's just it seems a little nonsensical help us understand that again so these curve amos these are curve lp tokens right so these would be composed of other stable coins basically basically it's a young bearing stable coin position right yes exactly so dye usdc uh us like tether that sort of thing plus trading fees and curve exactly and and crv emissions and cvx emissions got it and this liquidity amos you said that was more like maker dow collaterals those are like protocol and liquidity so like we have like you know some eath as collateral that we we don't keep idle in a smart contract we actually like deploy in like a you know uniswap pair or other places uniswap v3 lp positions exactly exactly so there's a lot of protocol on liquidity just outside of curb um and and we're on many chains so a lot of these are actually on different chains that are like natively protocol owned liquidity fraxes uh mintable and issued on 12 different chains a lot of them evm and l2s um like the harbour trim optimism polygon moonbeam you know phantom all these things so a lot of that is on those other chains as well cool and this this algorithmic section which is about like i don't know 15 or so is that about right that's that's on the back side that's the unbacked side or it's backed by the value of x uh fxs which is basically the frax governance token um now if you're to contrast this with like ust for example ust would be like almost entirely this algorithmic type section which is like all kind of luna tokens aside from maybe you might start to count the the reserves the bitcoin reserves that the lfg group purchased recently yes is that the contrast chain lfg group yes yeah i i would say that that's that's correct like in fact you know um i think a lot of stable coin projects especially terra which is like the the largest decentralized one currently are seeing there's a lot of you know important strengths to the fractional model right so yeah i think that basically before the bitcoin announcement this if you were to make this chart with with tara most of it would be black right most of it would be algorithmic right and now there would be a big slice uh i'm not actually exactly sure i think it's like anywhere between 10 to 30 or something like that would be bitcoin right it would basically uh there would be a slice of bitcoin it's funny because we see ust moving in your direction they're moving more in the the like fractionalized direction and less algorithmic so it's almost like i i don't know frax is moving more algorithmic but they're certainly coming more towards your design yeah i mean so we so like i said one our our name is literally after the fractional stuff we we invented but i don't really even think we like own the idea or anything i think what's interesting is like i said financial evolution has the same kind of uh evolutionary pressures it's just economic right so i like as as things progress right and like in economy they start looking the same in terms of what the the kind of right answer is in terms of efficiency and and kind of like how everything will work i think i think most things will look a lot like this the only difference is like what collateral ratio they'll they'll keep stuff at right and in fact you know you you could argue that you know maker dao for example is is not algorithmic it's it's over collateralized but the other way that i like to compare you know maker dao actually is that going back to our kind of central bank story right maker dow started with a very fundamentally sound thing right they were like we're going to issue pieces of paper that uh say a dollar but like we can't actually hold dollars right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna back the pieces of paper with like two dollars worth of other stuff for every one one dollar that we have a piece of paper that needs to be a dollar we're gonna have two dollars of other things right or like a loan on two dollars basically um after a while again everyone whether you come from the algorithmic side of like zero percent or the maker dow side of like over collateralized the theme here is you start realizing it's extremely difficult to issue pieces of paper that have an exchange rate for something without holding a substantial amount of that thing right and so that is part of the reason why you know the closest thing to you know dollars uh usdc is is both maker it has exposure to it and as as do we right like you can you can look and there's there's curve lp tokens in this stat and so for example even tara right like tara works with uh jump and all of the largest market makers right if you don't have the you know the actual asset in your central bank you know inside of the building or whatever right you have to at least pay someone that does to go out into the market right and and like you know make sure that the unit is is trading at uh that amount right and so it's like like jump is absolutely massive right they're absolutely huge like if you recall the wormhole like uh the unfortunate which was really really unfortunate i was saddened to see that but the warm whole heck of like what was it 300 million or something eth jump was a guy no problem here's 300 million uh let's let's you know uh let's make everyone whole which was great and respectable the same place where all that money comes from is also the same place that you know market makes the the biggest of uh stable coin markets right and so the thing is if you want to actually autonomously and internally be a central bank which i think tara is going to be the biggest and most impressive one with frax and probably maker right and us you know these are the big three right now you need to actually have uh stuff to to go out and do that right you need to have the actual assets the hard assets rather than uh having other people kind of do it and i think that's where the evolution of this stuff is going right where that's what we're seeing both honestly both with maker right with with frax with tara with with everyone right and that's that's the honest truth sam so there's a bunch of different collaterals uh in the the frax reserves right and this is the the ammo that that frax has to defend the peg right it's going back to your story about the credit window right where i've got my frax tokens and i go to this to the frax d central bank on ethereum and i say hey i would like some assets uh do do i get to pick like which of the assets i redeem for or how does the peg get defended when i come and come with my stable coins of frax tokens and i i would like to redeem them like how does that work yeah when the when the redemption window is open which is like if the peg is even one third of a cent off so like literally point uh three three of one cent right you can actually go and redeem them on the redemption tab and what it is is that you get a mixture of assets like you could see here if it was open you get usdc and fxs minted to you at the ratio of the clutter ratio so that there's never actually uh there's never like no reserves even if you're the last five percent to redeem obviously you know the the thing is everyone gets a piece of the fxs which they sell right which might have like negative price action and things like that but the idea behind the way we've done redemptions is everyone gets a ratio of the balance sheet right and so it actually is an anti kind of bank run mechanism in the sense that it's not that the first redeemers get you know uh uh one one usdc per frax or one you know dollar worth of assets and then the last get all of the you know governance token that's like plummeting it's actually uh equal you know it's egalitarian and so the collateral ratio also as you could see is dynamic right so the cloud ratio has moved up and down uh across you know all the times that we've launched and the collateral ratio will go up during times of uh you know market you know turbulence and and like volatility so that we give back a higher ratio of assets and it'll actually sell fxs you know to stabilize at that collateral ratio even if there's no redemption even if no one's actually aiming to make sure there's actually like that much assets if the clutter ratio is at you know 90 percent right so it's actually been a very good uh at dampening the you know the what people like to call the reflexive you know bank run uh spiral since we've never had one right yeah that was one of my questions is is like is there risk of people running for the door right and this was a conversation that we had in our ust episode where uh people are fearful that if there ever is a lack of confidence in ust there would be a rush for the door and if you are unfortunately later to get through the door you end up holding these tokens that don't have any collateral in the reserves but what you're doing with with frax is saying well it doesn't matter if you're first through the door you get a pro rata share of what you are owed which disincentivizes going in through the door in the first place uh so kind of instilling confidence in in the in this in the value that you would get uh in the first place kind of disincentivizing the actual uh run on the bank that's exactly correct and and not only that but if there's uh times where there's a a lot of redemptions happening or if the peg is even off by a third of one cent uh the clutter ratio uh will go up right and so like the actual amount of hard assets and and uh you know the share token you're getting is actually going up you're getting more hard assets so it's like an anti-bankrupt mechanism and all of these assets here are these all like sort of on chain or does does some entity uh have to some off-chain entity have to maintain custody of some of these assets right it's like we're we're talking about ust an lfg group actually has to maintain custody of uh bitcoin it's not like on chain it's not kind of smart contract back is this uh all on chain or is there a portion that's not entirely on chain in fact uh we take an extremely decentralized uh and like autonomous kind of approach and there's no actual legal entity right because because there's no amazing op chain uh yeah there's no off chain assets everything you see here is not only on chain but also uh readily available right it's not like oh there is a there is some assets here they're on chain but like they're over there and like you know we'll you know we'll go get them or something it's entirely on the system smart contracts it's entirely uh readily available in terms of you can actually go see exactly in real time literally per block where everything is where you know you can it's amazing yeah it's crazy you even have to ask that question ryan why i mean the reason i have to ask it is because um because ust doesn't have it on chain well so what's interesting about this so uh dave and i just finished up last week we did a uh you know ust episode just unpacking that and learning all about it um it was it was a pretty good episode but like there's kind of the contrast point of sort of the dichotomy be behind like a maker dow type design a maker design and a ust design i guess i walked out of that episode seeing the trade-offs on both sides right so one of the strengths of maker is it's far less prone to like these these tail risk type of events and like depending in a catastrophe a run on the bank because it's collateralized right so it's more safe for illustration the collateralization radio the ratio that we see the 85 percent which is very strong for an algo strabal coin maker dow is something like 250 so very very safe right and so it's got you know safety but the you know the maker bear and i guess the ust bull was saying yeah cool it's safe good nice nice good job bro but it's not scalable it's not scalable at all right and so they're saying the ust design look how fast this thing got to 16 billion dollars and it's because of this kind of memetic uh utility demand sort of aspect and and the bear the ust bear was saying yeah cool but hold on that's not safe and it hasn't actually been tested what's interesting about the frax design is it sort of maybe takes the best of both worlds or takes a little bit of column a little bit of column b and it says hey we want to bring some of the scalability of an algo stable coin design model without having the tail risk event of like it being fully uncollateralized there being a run on the bank that could absolutely wreck this thing i'm wondering if that is sort of the trade-off space so is is fracs more scalable than something like maker uh and likely a little less safe but maybe you know like acceptable risk parameters but tell me about the scalability profile of something like like frax is it can it scale in the way that a ust can yeah i thought that episode was great by the way i think that everyone was too polite uh against each other i was like yeah i was like well uh i think that you know this is a great point but i was like where's the animosity you see on on oh my god people thought we were like uh we were terrible like ethmaxy's asking even the questions we asked that was just oh it was it was actually so uh it was actually very polite in my opinion uh for everyone i think so i thought it was great yeah but yeah so what about the scalability yeah so i think like like you said earlier i think a lot of these uh stable coins will probably look something like fraction fractional uh algorithmic like fraxes model the question will be like what collateral ratio right like well is it something that's very conservative fractional uh like fracks like 85 86 percent or like right now tara is moving upwards a little bit i think there's 10 to 20 percent btc i don't know they they're increasing it that's for sure right um but it i think it just depends on the the actual uh protocols aggressive like growth strategy right now one thing i will say is that um people focus too much on the actual collateral ratio and less on the actual ability to keep the exchange rates of the thing at the the actual desired you know peg right going back to our like story about the the one ounce of gold per piece of paper it's really hard you know it's really really hard and uh let's be real like uh both fracks are right now and uh maker frax has less but but still they have exposure to usdc right and so maker has like what 60 something uh 60 57 or something like that it depends on how much leverage for each there is uh and in terms of that but the reason that's there is because it's really hard to keep an exchange rate to a dollar even if you have you know two dollars of other stuff uh or two dollars worth of loans and you can't actually still keep an exchange rate without having some of of that thing and no one's been able to fully exactly figure it out now i will give really big props to to tara's guys and and like they're they're really smart and they're really really really uh good at um strategy and getting uh terror adoption the thing is they obviously have a lot of market making activity from people that have a huge say like interest in in ust working out right they have billions of the people have like billions of dollars of luna right luna is like the number seven largest uh cryptocurrency right is absolutely massive right and so when you have a lot of other people that have billions of dollars of of dollars right and they have as you know a huge interest in making sure to buy and sell the stable coin at that at that peg right then it becomes a little bit easier right but but when uh for example frax and and maker what you see on the chain is what you get we there's we have like no uh there there's no market maker uh none that we've ever talked to or that i'm aware of that for the goodness of their heart is is like you know deciding to uh keep uh fracks at a dollar peg and so what you notice is the two stable coins that have every single thing on chain uh they do have some usdc exposure right like like again it's very very very very difficult to keep a piece of paper that says one ounce of gold trading at an ounce of gold if you don't have a bunch of gold like a lot of the gold itself right um but we actually uh are doing a lot of stuff to lower usdc uh exposure in fact don't quote me on it right now on the spot but i'm pretty sure if you actually do the calculation going down underneath um again don't quote me on it now but i think we have significantly less usdc exposure uh than than dye currently does i think we have like 40 something or low 40s in terms of like actual usdc and tether exposure when you when you check the actual lending amounts the algorithmic amounts the the curve pool which uh some of it is is dye itself as well right so like die underneath it is half or 50 60 usdc but when you go through it we've actually done a fairly good job of being entirely decentralized and consistently weaning off as much as we can fiat coins right usdc and tether while making sure everything is on chain everything is what you see is what you get which is an extremely difficult thing to do this is really cool decentralization maxi and me likes the on chain words yeah same here i might be getting frax pilled right now it's uh yeah that's really cool um i i want to just draw our attention to this chart really quick because you said um there are three you know elga staplecoin designs and we're looking at them here for people we're seeing on youtube this is ust in proportion uh looks like a market cap of about 18 billion dollars so the largest now and die is is uh kind of second if you if you sort of count die as an algorithmic stable coin right maybe it's a d5 staple coin and some people would say nine billion uh die and then frax up here is about 2.7 billion dollars worth but there's also mim here which i didn't realize that has um gone up as well this is a 2.7 billion can you tell us a little bit about uh mim that's is that danny cessa's i think it's an over collateralized model actually we we and this kind of goes back to you know what we were we might talk about with like stable coin drama or news and stuff but uh we love everyone um and and so we tried to work with mim a while ago and they weren't really that interested and then uh they i don't know they had the the weird sifu episode or whatever and i think that their uh liquidity is kind of a little bit weird these days but it is an over collateralized model it is fairly uh large um i think that part of the thing is like it's used for a lot of dj and leverage right and so this is actually a good example like you can be over collateralized i believe bim is significantly over 100 at least right but it doesn't mean that it's not risky right so that's actually a really good counter example of of like just looking at the cr right of like how much of this thing is immediately redeemable for hard assets like if there was like a redemption window or something doesn't actually give you a very good uh picture of of like the the full risk because the risk is is an entirely uh summation of all of the possible market activity right and so for example uh i think actually to be honest obviously like i think fracks is as as safe as as dye right um i i really do in fact um i think it you know dies extremely safe i actually think that to be honest i think ust is way more safe than people think um and hopefully you know this is uh not you know people don't think i'm saying that because we had the four pool partnership and stuff because there's a lot of people that have a very strong interest in the ust peg right and so even though that's a very difficult thing to measure right like it's difficult to model because it's you know it's it's hard to actually quantify it's it's much safer than what people think about uh like there's nothing here other than uh the governance tokens volatility if that were the actual truth right if that was the entire picture there would be way more times that the ustpec something that they would have collapsed in in all of these like you know these crazy uh downturn you know markets like right when when like whenever we wake up one of those days like and then crypto market's like negative 30 right and everyone's like oh my god right uh it would have happened way more than that right so i actually think the big three uh and i like to call it big three is like ust frax and die they are much safer than than people actually think that's my personal opinion one last piece sam because we talked about this in our usc episode of course like um par part of the backing of ust is a big part of the backing is the the luna token itself which is driven by like utility value right which is of course we've talked about this in layer one chains but presumably aside from kind of the meme uh monetary story value potential behind the luna token there's also some utility of luna being used in uh in the luna ecosystem right what are the drivers of um fxs price like why why would that go up or or down in terms of value is it purely sort of like meme value monetary premium value are there some fees that uh fxx holders get can you tell us about the drivers behind this yeah definitely um so the fxs token can be staked as as vefx so a lot of people that are familiar with curve know that this is a model that's fairly popular and what that is is you come and you can yes exactly you come in you can stake uh your fxs tokens for anywhere between one week to four years once you stake them you can't transfer them right you you actually they're they're staked they're not tokenized uh and then you have a ve fxs balance proportional to you know how long you've uh staked your fxs tokens and you actually get cash flow from the profit of the market operations of frax we call them algorithmic market operations and you can see right now the apr is is four point seven four percent uh down there um it goes anywhere between you know uh three to like twenty percent depending on how profitable things are and and yield opportunities that the protocol is actually conducting stabilizing market operations in um and this is entirely uh self-sufficient actual profit not token emissions not inflation um and like one statistic that i i put out is like so fracs is about 2.7 billion supply the protocol makes about right around 200 million dollars of annual revenue oh my god that's a strong ratio well in our usc conversation apologies to keep going back to that but i think it's useful context so just let me say to everyone's listening uh if you haven't listened to our bull and bear case of ust go listen to that because i think that's also helpful to understand this entire sector but one conversation we had which a big driver of ust value and market market cap i think has been the 20 yields that are being distributed from the the anchor protocol on on the terra network and um the conversation there is that's basically marketing spend right so like the jump capitals of the world we're not sure exactly who the sources are but those who are incented to push out ust into the world or subsidizing that and heavily subsidizing that the 20 rate it's not necessarily long-term sustainable to do that but maybe it's worth it for now this 4.7 that that's not coming from the like marketing spend um large issuance higher relationships yeah that is entirely cash flow wow all on chain cash flow then economic sustainability you love to see it love to see it very good sam just a last a few set of questions before we get into the uh the spicy side the four pool the stable clone wars and why do why do you think doguan has it out against dai we'll talk about that but first just the remaining road map uh that's on on the uh on the road map for for frax let's talk about that uh can you explain what the fpi is uh and what it is how it works and and how it helps uh increase the adoption for frax yeah definitely um the fpi is the second stable coin in the the frax ecosystem um it's the first ever uh stablecoin peg to the cpi a consumer price index which is the prices of a basket of consumer items in fact we we started working on this last year um and last week it coincidentally we launched and and it was a very successful launch and it was uh hotly anticipated um again going back to kind of the grand vision right like the thing i said stable coins are are the third trillion dollar narrative of of crypto the evolution of stable coins will probably look like the evolution of of central banking right and remember the last part of the story of the the central bank was that after a while they said okay uh let's not actually peg to some external exchange rate that that we can't control let's peg to a exchange rate that is our definition as like a society and a government of of like a standard of living of like items that we we want this you know piece of paper to be able to afford right um and that's where the fbi is like the fpi is basically uh in my opinion like the final evolution of stable coins on chain uh we'll probably see a lot of uh stablecoin projects kind of taking inspiration from like the fbi design in fact we are uh working with volt protocol which is uh um led by kirk and a few other guys uh close to fey which is another project and i think there will be a lot more of these and that's a great thing right and again like i think evolution no matter you know what you think about it it's going to evolve in in that direction right and i think it's really powerful because we're going to basically be able to be kind of the the bitcoin of a self-sovereign peck right and so the idea is at the beginning we're going to have the cpi uh of the federal government right and that's a lot of people have a problem with that they think it understates inflation or all this stuff uh eventually the idea is having the weights of the the basket of goods be entirely uh governed on chain right like basically a self-sovereign economy with a self-sovereign definition of standard of living and inflation right inflation is defined as uh the actual price divergence of the currency you use against the basket of items right against the thing that you need that's exactly what the fed actually defines inflation to be right and coincidentally uh today was the you know fed and bls.gov report on cpi right which is every month the u.s government releases the prices of the basket of consumer goods right in dollars and the inflation rate is defined as what are the prices of those things in dollars compared to what were the prices of those things last month in dollars right if the prices of those things went up if you need more dollars to afford the same things as you did last month there is an inflation of the dollar right its value is going down you need more dollars for the same consumer goods and coincidentally uh you know today is i think the highest cpi uh reading of in like 45 50 years in in the united states which is very concerning obviously but that basically means that in the past 30 days the value of those pieces of paper to what they were supposed to track is uh not doing very well right can i just break this down for people right so it's like crypto has just produced something really cool and new in the fpi and in frax right so everyone saw the headline it was a headline around the world this week uh cpi now 8.5 so and that that's a lower bound estimate as sam just said but your dollar is worth eight and a half percent less than it was a year ago at this time so did you get an 8.5 raise your paycheck and the answer for just about everyone is probably no i didn't maybe i got a two to three percent if i'm lucky well you lost money you lost five percent as a result less money making less money going forward by holding it in the dollar you're making less money and by getting your your uh paycheck denominating the dollar you're actually making less unless you've got a raise to compensate so what does crypto produce this thing called fpi which doesn't actually track the dollar it attract it uh tracks cpi inflation so that 8.5 percent that everyone's like oh i just lost 8.5 percent oh my if you held an fpi you would have actually been neutral you wouldn't have lost that 8.5 if you got paid in fpi you would still preserve your purchasing power versus getting paid in the dollar that's something new that crypto is producing that no other system on the planet is producing uh because central banks don't produce that like they're not in tune with uh what consumers actually want and demand and uh this is what's so neat about this project yeah and and that's exactly correct and so like uh that you said it better than me actually um and and so the thing is uh that's exactly what it is uh we actually just launched it uh last week and i you know we see a lot of people minting fbi you can mint it with frax at the actual peg price so like obviously the growth of the fpi stablecoin will be going higher and higher as the the actual peg tracks cpi itself right in fact it's it's kind of interesting because it's almost like currently it's almost like a dollar stable coin that is growing uh at the inflation rate because we use the exact same cpi basket as the fed uses for the dollar right now obviously right the trillion dollar vision here again is like eventually crypto is this self-sovereign digital global economy we can vote on the weights of those things right and then at that point the fbi could float against the dollar it could grow higher than what the fed defines as inflation or lower i mean it depends on what they vote i think we'll take it i mean protection from even the 8.5 percent in this in this climate this is like back to the 1970s that like that that's that's definitely worth it and i guess the one dependency that this is introducing as well is this um connected to like a chain link oracle or something like that to get the cpi data on chain yeah so they actually use a custom chain link oracle that we we designed with uh chain link and vault uh projects um and the good news there is like there's usually two issues with oracle's right one is the actual publisher right that needs to be honest and then two is the place they're getting the actual data uh correct right and so since we're using the the government currently right it's unlikely the government is going to lie about what the government actually says it's more about like is what the government is saying is it you know unbiased or non-political that is obviously just going to be fixed when there's on-chain you know ability to uh have governance on on the cpi gauge all right guys so that was the deep dive into the frax uh got way deeper than i thought we were going and we got excited because we got excited and uh like we always say uh we haven't said it recently so i'll say it here crypto's always speed running the history of money and finance uh and frax really seems to be like skipping right to the right to the end like right to the point of the frontier uh so that's really what gets me excited about this story in the second half of the show we got to talk about some of the current events going on because dokwan's recent proposal for the curve 4 pool uh is uh cause eventually the the fxx token the frax token to go from 22 dollars to over 40 dollars inside of a day uh and so now there's a bunch of just like clamor about what's going on in the four pool so we're gonna get to those subjects and also just the long-term equilibrium of the stable coin wars or what sam thinks that the long-term equal equilibrium is going to be right after we get to some of

of this month and he writes introducing the four pool between frax finance tfl redacted pretty much we own all the cvx the governance tokens for curve and he's introducing the four pool uh a new curve stable coin liquidity pool between uh ust frax usdc and tether and he says the curve wars are over all emissions are going to the four pool uh and so this is one of the spicier tweets has come out lately because it's uh what it's doing is it's removing a lot of liquidity from dye and it's redirecting the liquidity from the former dominant three pool out of curve and pointing and saying it's going to be pointed towards this four pool which instead of die the dominant decentralized stable coin inside of ethereum is pointing it towards ust a decentralized stable coin that is non-native to ethereum fracks another decentralized stable coin that's on ethereum and then uscc and tether and so um first off sam uh did did this surprise you if this proposal surprised you well so so first yeah i think some background uh no it didn't surprise me because i've been talking with with doe for a while um dough as i think everyone knows is one of the smartest and most ambitious guys in in the entire space i mean luna is like i said before literally one of the largest uh cryptocurrencies in the entire space in the entire industry right um i i've known doe since like 2018-ish right when they like started uh tara we briefly talked about stable coins and stuff and then you know we went off and and worked on our own things and one of the things that's really impressive about dough that i think a lot of people might not get is like he's a very very good strategist but also you know taking everything literally uh and i think jose said this too right like i don't think uh he straight up means the you know the classic meme of it's not like i should succeed but it's everyone else should die or fail you know i i don't think you should take that super seriously in in that literal way um but the the back story here with the four pool is that we are frax and tara are are very methodical and aggressive about how we want to grow and actually permeate right if you're a currency issuer which is what terra is and fraxes and maker is right uh you want to get your currency out where there's economic activity so people can take debts denominated in your currency they can uh trade in your currency they can hold your currency they can save in your currency they can do all of these things right and there's multiple ways to do that but at the end of the day this the success of how big a currency is is how much of economic activity and people are actually using uh your thing right and and a good mixture of it right like everyone's using ust right now to save and anchor again like it's it's great um but you we need to get like uh if you're currently sure you need to get your currency everywhere else we're willing to do really big things with the four pool uh like like basically giving a lot of yield working with other projects to actually uh use for pool as the as their meta pool of choice and curve like i said curve is kind of like the the wordpress of stable coins or making pegged assets whether it's stable coins or ethan steeth or whatever right and and like correlated assets curve is a really important piece of infrastructure because it's basically allowed this kind of cambrian explosion of these projects to evolve we want to support that we want to actually give incentives and actually spend part of the uh money that fracks makes right or part of the money that you know tara's foundation and they all have access to right and there's there's nothing wrong with maker not wanting to do the same thing with dye there's you know and so for example i'm not going to come up here and be like uh i hate maker and stuff and actually i think i tweeted like if maker does want to actually do a like die for pool we will give maker the same thing we're willing to spend on every other uh project and i actually i know the maker guys you know i talked to nick at maker i've talked to seb i've talked to a bunch of them uh they're all great guys they have different uh execution opinions uh i've tried before to see if there's like appetite for like a frax psm or just kind of a lot of different things and i think they take a very uh thorough slow methodical and i don't want to really say like bureaucratic but sometimes it might feel that way approach to to governance and things like that and it never really went anywhere because i think there was just kind of lukewarm uh you know um desire for it and but doe and i have a really good relationship and like we like to strategize we like to move fast yes our kind of like risk to growth tolerance is is higher um i don't think that means we're in in any case like enemies um or not at least at least i'll come up here and say like fraxes is not um but but it's just something that dai is not interested in um and if they are at least from fracks the you know we're always willing to outstretch the hand and i think uh i think so is dope i mean obviously i can't i can't like put words in his mouth but i think the knowing him and and knowing both how strategic and smart he is i think that's that was his way of saying the same thing i'm saying just just in in his uh personality and uh i think that's what jose said on the show as well i think this kind of lines up okay uh so there is like this one piece of real estate which is curve which is really really important for liquidity and with stable coins and curve is designed to be fought over right it's called the curve wars for a reason and so like do you think we this stable coin wars the where do you think the equilibrium of the stable coin wars ends up is the stable is the war word even appropriate or is that just like the like the click baity headline that people like to talk about so where do you think the the long term like equilibrium of the stable coin fight for liquidity and defy ends up at yeah i think curve is more important than some people uh think in fact part of the reason maybe that uh maker is not that uh interested in like working with us is like i think their opinion of like how important curve actually is is different they're like okay this is just like a dex it's like losing money on all the crv emissions and and stuff and it's just a funny game people can play uh we're doing real world assets and our you know our focus is over there um and stuff and that's fine and that's actually fantastic you know the difference of opinion but we want to focus on this because like i said we do think curve is more than just a dex at least i do i think it's a algorithmic savings account where people can deposit the ratio of of stuff that's you know in the curve pool and they get a yield on that in in crv and cvx which is a convex governance token and then anything else right like uh you know if you if you do the uh bribing system or whatever like you're saying but like some people don't think that's actually interesting some people think that it's just a ponzi game of like a dex that's not profitable or something like that i think it's an uh incorrect assumption because curve is not just a dex um and you know we could have an entire uh podcast just describing like mechanisms that look like something but are entirely different uh and i think curve is is one of those but the that's the thing uh fracs has the largest cvx holdings uh which is the convex token which does control parts of curve terra also has a very large amount maker does not they could purchase it if they want to but i doubt they will based on their strategic opinions they could also you know work directly with us in in terms of that but i don't think they will and there's nothing wrong with it i i think though that it the four pool is going to be absolutely massive when once things get going we just actually launched uh the the four pool on arbitram and the gauge for that which is the thing that earns the crv emissions should be going up any hour now literally and then the one on phantom is already out this this period there will be emissions to it the one on uh i believe on polygon is actually also already out and then the emissions will start soon so i think this will take the entire stable coin world by storm i think it's actually going to be bigger than what the headlines say once everything is rolled out it's going to take slightly longer than people think to roll everything out like this week and then the next week and the week after that but once it all comes together i think it's going to be the savings account of a very very large part of the crypto industry that is cool and um yeah thanks for explaining that i guess one thing to impress upon our our listeners is um they call it the staplecoin wars but um that can be the focus uh but there's also a massive amount of stablecoin synergy here so even like frax itself is backed partially based on on dye that's in these lp tokens and curve and what is dye um backed by well increasingly these other real world assets so at some level frax wins when uh dye makes a deal with tesla as they did like two weeks ago to use uh to provide um blending lending protocol services to tesla so all of these real world assets coming into defy actually strengthen fracs as well and i do think this uh this lattice approach of all of these different experiments and different strategies to address stablecoin actually makes the deep five space more resilient and stronger because we don't just have one strategy we have like five different strategies right and they're all happening at once and yeah some some will win some will lose some will prove more successful over time but there's strength in having this uh this plurality of approaches here i think i guess sam as we draw to a close and this has gone on longer than we thought just because i think we've been intensely interested in what you've had to say and learning more about this project so so thank you for your time i'm wondering if you could give us some predictions on what happens next in stable coins just like you're you're thinking about this day in and day out do you have any hot takes any any predictions for the next one year the next three years in terms of how the space evolves and what happens next just anything that comes to mind yeah definitely um so first thing is i actually always like to say uh were were positive some players at frax and and i think a lot of this is actually catching on because i always like to say uh stable coin pegs are stronger together than they are trying to actually take from each other it's always a good idea to grow the entire economic piece of the pie rather than take other people's pieces of the pie whether it's liquidity whether it's like size market cap or users but basically that's the philosophy we always do at frax right so like we we love tara we're willing to work with them and we're we are going to do this absolutely massive for pool uh we're willing to work with pretty much anyone we love faye and those guys as well joey is a great guy and and the people building volt which is the other uh project in terms of where we see the space going i think that you know i i don't want to like kind of toot my own horn but we've been pretty spot on with with like you know the things like looking like fractional uh stable coins us releasing fracs is like the first you know fractional algorithmic one and then also releasing the first cpi you know packed stablecoin in the fbi i think what's going to happen is that in the next 12 to 24 months there will be a consolidation around three maybe four uh decentralized stable coins uh and by consolidation i mean it's going to increasingly look like you know things like ust frax dye probably fame maybe and stuff are are going to be kind of the the ones that are all the new projects are using as collateral right like like what we like might be using for usdc i think it's gonna there's gonna be a consolidation on the decentralized stablecoin level right um and second thing is i think there's gonna be a lot of uh the narrative of these uh inflation resistant assets talked about it in terms of is is bitcoin and eth uh better for inflation resistance or are they better central bank reserves on these decentralized central bank uh protocols like fpi and and like you know terra and stuff because one thing that's really uh important that doe started the narrative on is like btc is like the new gold right and they're using that as as like tara's uh basically gold right and we think the same thing for eth and and basically uh some btc right to have some kind of exposure to but i think that eth is is basically the same kind of trillion dollar asset as as bitcoin and what's going to happen is there's going to be a lot of shifting of the narrative of you know inflation resistance is is where you go with like bitcoin and eth and instead it's going to be you go to these stable coins because they literally have an inflation resistant peg and then you invest in like eth and btc and stuff to increase your your net worth denominated in these like fbi stable coins or or like dollars if you still use those that's my kind of hot take and the reason that i'm uh people call me like a stable coin maxi or something like that and and i always try to not you know take the the maxi moniker but it's like i think that for stability and inflation resistance uh stable coins or currencies with like an actual algorithmic monetary policy are uh superior but i believe that the two big other trillion dollar narratives which is ethereum and bitcoin make the perfect reserves for those kinds of stable coins so that that's kind of the the way to end this i think that's a really good take and i think bankless is um definitely the bankless thesis agrees with what you're saying and certainly i think our our listeners listeners can relate to how painful it is to spend their eath and spend their bitcoin right you'd rather be sending something like uh is a fpi which is which is kind of like in earning an fbi and and you know keeping kind of your your one to two month reserves in that and uh never having to spend just stack your eth stack and stake and uh the same with bitcoin as well um thank you so much sam this has been a lot of fun and i think you turned on the light bulb for a lot of listeners so we appreciate you coming
