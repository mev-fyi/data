bankless nation it is the first week of may david hoffman what time is it it is roll-up time ryan we are rolling up the first week of may the crypto industry moves so incredibly fast that we need to dedicate a whole entire episode to making sure that you can keep up with it and so we are going through all the things that happened in the last week of crypto markets releases news takes what we're excited about ending with the meme of the week stay tuned for the meme of the week it's a good one we're gonna try to jam-pack the entire week of crypto into your friday morning enjoy this with a cup of coffee david we've had a busy week man i heard a dow launched uh i did it did what what doubt yes a very important doubt oh tell me more it's it's called the bankless doubt and you should be a part of it i think i think i will i think i like that doubt you should be a part of the bankless movement david how do i become a part of the bankless movement ryan dude we're gonna get to all that actually so i think we have a section for bankless doubt when we talk about releases i think we have a section where we talk about news i think we have a section when we talk about what we're excited about because it has definitely been an exciting week um so if you haven't heard bankless has launched a dow basically uh through a genesis team and uh it is going like gangbusters like i i can't even keep up with the amount of activity that's going on some exciting stuff uh brewing in the bankless community and the bankless movement yeah inside the bankless dow discord it really just feels like a shaken snow globe and every everything is start and it's chaotic and crazy and everyone's really excited everyone's buzzing and like we're starting to see the first like little drifts of settlement as to people are finding their niches people are self-organizing emergent organization a lot of thoughts are going around as to how dows work nowadays especially a media and culture doubt and there's nothing we didn't actually do too much on chain stuff there's no smart contracts there's we don't have a protocol we have an organization of people and that's something that is unique it's completely zero completely people and uh just like a shaken snow globe it's pretty beautiful yeah like seeing all of it come together all right man let's uh we'll talk about the dow many times throughout this episode but let's get to the markets first david that's what the people are here for they want to know what the bitcoin price is right now what is the bitcoin price bitcoin price 55 720 at the time of recording bitcoin just hovering between 50 and 60 000 would be the range that i would call it at uh just a very long consolidation period for bitcoin so we're up on the week but still like you know it's it's it's not hitting it's it's bull highs as it was previously uh what does that mean for ether ether quite the opposite quite the opposite story ether has hit a new high act actually of the day of recording at three thousand six hundred dollars it is currently at three thousand four hundred and sixty dollars at the time of recording uh and it's really done a fantastic job of not dumping which is absolutely crazy either started the week as low as two thousand seven hundred dollars and then went all the way up to three thousand 3 600 and a lot of people in my circles and the people i talked to were like all right this has got to be like too steep too fast too steep it's gonna dump and then it continued to keep on going up so i would call this precariously high but if we want to call this a quote-unquote new financial paradigm where people are were under exposed to ether and now they are trying to snatch back what ether they could because they were underexposed to it now realizing that perhaps this is actually going to be a new global store of value then it kind of makes sense that you know people are fomoing into ether not just individuals but institutions and there's been a lot of conversation uh this week especially that this extra basically insane buying volume and buying pressure for ether has been coming from institutions rotating into ether and and understanding and accepting ether as a macro store value asset yeah i think that's the big story in markets this week to be honest david and um what's interesting about what you said is like people who are are worried about the price of ether they'll point to bitcoin and say well can ether sustain this level of price uh and continue to grow while bitcoin is is stagnant because that hasn't been the pre the case previously except david if you flash back to 2017 when this was happening from march 2017 on for to to most of the rest of the bull run was ether it was story of ether outpacing bitcoin uh maybe we are repeating 2017. again we've talked about this on bank list we talked about it last year we even talked about it like uh at their earliest episodes of like we think that 2021 is going to be somewhat of a repeat of 2017 and maybe that's what's going on but you mentioned institutions this is ash he works at a crypto hedge fund institution this is a tweet thread he put together about 14 reasons eth is a higher upside treasury reserve asset interesting term treasury reserve asset versus bitcoin david i think we should do all 14 but we got to be quick man yeah there's a lot in here yeah i think before we get started because ryan i know you're going to take number one the the interesting thing to know is he's calling it a treasury reserve asset that's basically what i was saying when i was saying a store about macro store of value different words same same but the important note is higher upside higher upside so keep that in your brain as we go through these ryan you want to kick us off yeah man let's do every other okay so i'll do one so heath is a proven store of value having an appreci having appreciated 85 000 since inception five years ago six years ago in 2015. eighty-five thousand percent since inception proof that the numbers go up absolutely crazy yeah do two for us two uh eth is only 25 of the market of bitcoin uh ether is uh or bitcoin is one trillion dollars versus ether 317 billion dollars so there's that upside right like if you believe that ether is equivalent in bitcoin store of value nature you would see ether being only uh 25 percent of what bitcoin's market cap is eath staked is now going up each staked now exceeds nine billion dollars so that is eth locked in staking that is 3.26 of each supply and going up if justin drake ultrasound money thesis pans out that's number three number four scarcity is here eip1559 effectively cancels out eth inflation rate which really puts ether as a macro store of value treasury reserve asset it cancels out each inflation rate of four percent um so we ip1559 no inflation there you go another ultrasound money theme 22.5 percent of eth this is number five supplies e-liquid locked up in smart contracts this is eth being used as economic bandwidth another bankless theme uh for d5 and ash says number will only grow up go up over time as use cases accelerated we're certainly seeing defy use cases accelerating what's number six david six whale wallets are growing wallets that hold more than 10 000 ether right this is actually people largely institutions i would say who are actually putting more and more ether into their treasury into their balance sheets so people with big money are buying more ether we report on this number seven every week 66 billion in us dollars locked in d5 protocols that is aggregate of everything that's locked in d5 protocols and that's 66 billion already growing at a rate of 40 per month absolutely crazy grayscale at number eight grayscale holds roughly three percent of all ether supply which quote unquote won't be sold anytime soon and if you are a lazy institution and you don't want to set up the infrastructure for just uh you know more sophisticated holding ether you just go to grayscale right so that three percent that's not just grayscale as an institution that's other institutions using grayscale to access ether and put it on the balance sheet won't be sold because it can't be sold as well the way grayscale's product works number nine ethereum has over 2 000 active monthly developers compared to bitcoin at 360. development leads to more apps more innovation more disruption look that developer score is only measuring ethereum specific protocol libraries so it doesn't even include all of the developers that are building d5 protocols on top of ethereum and ethereum is still leading the charge there what's number 10 david number 10 derivatives have gone from 50 million in april of 2020 to 3 billion total open interest institution adoption signal institutions love derivatives they love options and that is really how they elect to get exposure to assets like ether and so not only are we seeing a maturing in the derivatives market but we're seeing adoption of it which means that institutions are using it this follows number 10. this is number 11. each futures positions have seen a 20x increase now stood at 7.5 billion in open interest another institutional adoption signal 12 24 hour eat options trading volume has gone from 1 million in may 2019 to exceed a 1 billion dollars in daily open interest again same same thing as before this is what institutions use looks like they're using it number 13 etfs in canada full stop etfs in canada they're coming to the us soon right that's the tweet [Laughter] number 14 eth is starting to gain and decorate with bitcoin and this will continue as developer activity rises and more use cases are created that decoration from bitcoin is key to actually people understanding it to be a uniquely different and compelling macro store value asset ash summarizes it with a price prediction eth currently range from ten thousand he says is inevitable hundred thousand best case scenario hundred thousand absolutely crazy numbers here and he says there's more incentive to hold ethan bitcoin due to ethereum's growing use cases again ash works at a crypto hedge fund he's been listening to bangladesh for a while i think he's tuned into the narrative here and that is the narrative being presented to institutions right now so if you're confused by why eath price go up while bitcoin price stay flat take a look at this thread re-listen to the last 14 points we make all right david let's go to the d5 token watch d5 pulse index where are we right now yeah dpi currently priced at 560 dollars hit an all-time high of 584 dollars is that is that right that's not right no the all-time high was uh earlier this week at 610 or so and it currently took a little bit of a tumble from that high down to 560 dollars but overall dollar price performance of d5 dpi doing great doing great going up not as fast as etho tell us the story in our dpi slaughter dpi being slaughtered on the eth ratio it had a valiant effort at point two it had another about valiant effort at point one eight but it ultimately has fallen down to point one six uh ether per dpi uh and so defy assets getting just absolutely demolished in ether terms as you would expect are you happy david i mean yes it was eat's turn it was its turn it has never been eat's turn since like literally december of 2017. it's it's it patiently waited its turn and you know it's it eats the moment right now um you know i'm eyeing the the e to dpi trade like i'm i'm eyeing it it looks tempting like dpi is going to reverse at some point in time it's just a matter of like do what knife at what point do you want to catch the falling knife you think we're going to have another d5 summer but we might have an eath summer first is kind of the point right and it's hard to trade we've already had an east spring two seasons and eath in a row you would spoil me sir we'll see how it plays out all right uh let's talk about stable coin supply because these are hitting new all-time highs too the first stat we have is usdc which is coinbase circle they hit 15 billion so 15 billion on trade on chain in usdc another follow-up to that is is tether actually hit on chain volumes of one trillion the one trillion mark for the first time stable coin adoption is just going up and to the right yeah and it just makes sense all the times that ryan and i talk about how like terrible the banking ux ui is obviously stable coins are going up and to the right uh congrats to teller one trillion dollars in a one year period that's pretty phenomenal guess what man i had to wire funds from a wells fargo literally from a wells fargo account uh this week right so had to schedule an appointment with the banker had to go there in person appointments right the banker asked all sorts of questions where's the money going like what's happening all of this uh and i was just like oh my god you guys this is a fax machine you guys are so dead wait did you you're operating a fax machine and we have the internet here what was it like small talks like oh where's your money going or was it like please fill out this form it was just it was a little bit like oh so where is the money going and like like just weird questions that's right he asked about money marginally personal questions yeah and it was also like a you know it was a nice person good conversation i guess but the fact that you have to show up in person to actually like make that transaction schedule something with like the banker right jeez friction friction that could be done in two seconds my my roommate he was gonna transfer me some some money and for for some reason we just did it in cash because he's my roommate just handed it to me so i took the cash real cash paper dollars paper dollars like literally the worst form of cash right so i took that to the bank and i just private though i gave it to the well not when i come to the bank with it i give it to that teller and she was like oh like did you make a big sale and i'm like don't ask don't ask about that that's not your information what are you doing yeah no yeah exactly cease it incredibly ethereum doesn't ask why it doesn't ask exactly all right david let's let's get to this while we're on markets man doge is pumping so like everyone many friends that that i know that they'll text me about doge price these days right so like what's going on why and why why so sad because we live in a goddamn meme culture that's what's going on yeah deep's eye and like it really is but we love memes don't we good memes what's your problem with their they're good games yeah i mean why is this a bad meme it's the people's money right it's soch god god damn it elon what look what you've done elon the thing is like we are doing our best to promote the real values that this industry has to offer and then doze just eats itself okay wait goddamn moon joe weisenthal do you know him bloomberg um commentary on finance has lots to say about crypto of course um he says that okay david doge is no different than bitcoin it's just a meme buddy it's a community that says it's going up hold it as a store of value it is money it's no different than bitcoin what's your take on that yeah like the thing is like doges is it's a it's a funny meme but bitcoin is a meme and the same as like the us dollar is also a meme like it's just something that you have in your head and you ascribe value to it it's like the different when we talk about memes we're just talking about narratives right the bitcoin narrative is serious bitcoin narrative is is uh you know uh personal sovereignty with money no money printer uh you know power by the people for the people and doge is like haha cute dog number go up like the the narrative behind the meme is important like the doge meme is very like nihilist like you know and like i'm all i'm all one to say like the system but i want to the system with a better system doge is like you know what let's actually just burn everything because nothing matters anymore and let's pump it to the moon like you know i think of it as it's look it's i feel like it's a low conviction meme like it's a meme but it's a low conviction yeah i don't think there's good you're not going to get holders of last resort resort in dodge they're here for the pump they're going they're going to be gone and by the way have you looked at doge distribution near the top it's awful it's awesome it's terrible right uh yeah the reason why doge makes outside outside news is because like i bet you a higher much higher percentage of doses lost than bitcoin because why would you keep on holding on to your dose right you would just lose it and so that's why it goes like from one penny to 60 cents in under like three months because there's no supply there's no supply point there garyvee just said that he had some doge and he lost it because he didn't know what it was like yeah he just said that on the podcast anyway doge we'll we'll get back to you when we get to the elon snl news but for now we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the unit swap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the una swap dow apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries

start with the unicorn man uniswap v3 you heard about it with our podcast with with hayden adams he finally came on david he told us about it and now it is here may 5th it arrived uh talk about it what launched mainnet yeah unit swap v3 finally here and so there is now this a little bit of a tug of war between unisov2 and uniswap v3 right unit swap v3 is not the simple transition that unit swap v1 to v2 was uh unispot v3 has much more dials much more you know switches much more things that need to be tinkered with and people need to learn how to use it uh and so um that that's what's here today and i actually think the really cool thing is right there ryan tweet number four in this tweet thread is that if you guys remember when you deposit liquidity into uniswap it is a uh it's a specific band of price action right so you are only depositing for a very narrow band of price action or or a wide band it's up to you but the point is it's unique to you and it's unique to what you you chose and so when you make a unique deposit in providing liquidity you get an nft back and the cool thing is they've actually made cool little gif uh gifts for the nfts so i would imagine that you can like see your nfc your nft lp deposit into unit swap v3 on something like openc or any or other nft explorer it's going to show up next to your bankless badge or any other nfts that you own so that's kind of cool which is actually kind of really bridging the world of defy to nfts because they're kind of two separate worlds and and now they're it's getting a little closer it's kind of fun look and that's an incentive to open up a uh a pool so kind of neat that way too david let's go to the high level i thought this tweet from hayden was actually pretty good he said it's been 24 hours since the launch of uniswap v3 and here are some stats v3s 24 hour volume was already 150 million they've got 300 million total locked and volume by efficiency which is a really interesting score is 50 um and he compares that to uniswap v2 and the bottom line is in its first day v3 has already seen twice the volume that v2 not v1 v2 saw in its first month so again kind of we're on this exponential curve of growth the v3 is like 2x v2 volume in its first month and it's doing that in the first day pretty crazy volumes already coming out of unit swap v3 yeah there were some complaints from people who are just trying to use unit swap v3 that some things were broken some things weren't weren't working and as you can see there's a comment right below that hayden's tweet saying oof it cost me 150 bucks to provide liquidity providing liquidity that that transaction is just more intensive right and so hopping in and out of liquidity pools it's going to be more complex now that it's an nft there were a few other things that the migration from v2 to v3 wouldn't work with a ledger just for some developer coding reasons that's over my head um but there is going to be transition friction because like i said this is not just like an upgraded an upgraded v1 to v2 this is a brand new amm system uh and so that the porting of v2 to e3 is going to have some friction there's going to be some some learning curve pains but i think in the long term it's going to it's going to all work out yeah absolutely some like things from the beginning and i i uh tweeted this out like hey who's tried it what what's your experience so far with v3 and people mentioned some ui bugs the analytics aren't quite working uh there's an issue with connecting a hardware wallet to meta mask and using an issue with a signature that is probably not resolved as you guys are listening to this so some ui friction but like overall man that's not stopping the volume right we should you know what we should unbox this ourselves so i haven't spent much time here david myself using this uh and i'm gonna pull up uniswap v3 and actually see what's what's different about it so it looks like i've got the same swap interface slightly different but pretty much the same yep looks really simple you know it's kind of that google level simplicity of the interface and let's say i want to trade um you know let's say a tenth of an eighth for some dye uh what am i doing here yeah see that that slit the dice slippage a lot a decent amount of slippage and price movement yeah right um i i mean that might it's 24 hours old i'm sure it's going to get worked out again liquidity providers are going to have to learn how to provide liquidity uh and so i think people are being methodical and slow about that look at this button though it says get a better price on v2 so i guess you can get a better price on v2 it you know button pops up to show you that because this is a lot of slippage almost a full percent slippage um price movement for that action but the the big thing that v2 was supposed to provide was sort of um you know stable coin to stable coin trades in the way that that curve does with very low slippage so here's usdc to die and the slippage is you know fairly low looks like it might be a better price for a hundred usdc um to die than uniswap v2 uh you know the the price impact is point two percent zero point two percent i should say i wonder what happens if we like scale this up yeah see that's where that's where it gets pretty cool i'm pretty sure yeah so you're already up to a thousand dollars and it only got a little bit more uh illiquid yeah and so you oh now we're up to ten thousand dollars and it's actually just the same amount of uh illiquidity as uh one less uh zero right and so actually now we're up to a hundred thousand dollars and it's still point four point three four percent uh and so it's actually not getting any more hey you keep adding zeros it's actually not getting any more illiquid and at some point you're you have to max it out because you're going to just completely wipe a a market maker from one it's starting to max up max out 10 million trade ten million ten million dollar trade three percent what's one what's uh one million dollars how much slippage uh let me count my zeros here one two three four five six okay one million dollars gets you point four percent in slippage on usdc to die if you add in one more zero ryan if you go to 10 million dollars it gets to be 3.5 percent slippage if you add one more zero that's all of it that might have nine 90 slippers that's all of it okay so if anyone was interested in trading 10 million dollars of usdc to get a better price on bt you might get a better price on v2 but overall that's that is the power of uniswap v3 right it historically was terrible for uh stablecoin transfers because uh it would put the same amount of liquidity across the full spectrum but now liquidity providers like this is the easiest most basic way to use v3 in the upgraded fashion is only providing liquidity against a very narrow band of prices which is particularly well suited to like uh price assets it's super cool dude i'm gonna look at um liquidity here so i can create a new position it looks like yep um what if i want to or i can migrate v2 liquidity maybe i'll put a new position here is this me putting it creating a whole new pair yeah so yeah uh yes well you would have to select the pair but i think the really just the adding liquidity page really illustrates all the different things about uh unit swap v3 right so it lets you select the three different feed tiers for the die each pair yeah i think they're 3.3 percent that's the unit swap v2 and v1 uh you know default fee is 0.3 percent but you can add you can pick different ones and there will be liquidity in each of these different pairs but one of these uh one of the fee tiers is going to become the shelling point for every single trading pair uh and then you would set your price range right and so you would pick where the the band of price that you would want to to uh supply to so ryan is providing uh 2000 for die to eat between 2991 to three yeah it's got a little clunky interface right over overwrite all that and go back to three thousand and uh four thousand three thousand keeps changing it up yeah it keeps changing yeah it's a clunky little ui stuff it's close though it's very close close very close so if i wanna play that that's the difference if if i want to provide a price range band for my liquidity i couldn't do that you need to swap v2 i had to provide for the entire spectrum but now i could set a spectrum of somewhere between three thousand dollars and four thousand dollars where i'm providing that liquidity right that's the difference yep exactly interesting all right very cool uh let's let's take a look at how it's doing so far i guess at the aggregate level and i think this is where uh uniswap analytics come in so you took these screenshots david on the left we have v2 screenshot from v2 on the right we have v3 what's what are we looking at the differences in terms of liquidity or total locked value and also a 24-hour volume here well obviously there's just no comparison right because vmswav v2 is many years old and it has all of all of unit swaps money basically um swap v3 is very very young only 24 hours old so people are still migrating liquidity over but i think that for understanding the ui what's important to know is on the left side where we see unit swap v2 we have liquidity that's the the name of you know that they've bestowed upon how all the money all the value of all deposits into unit swap v2 on the right side we have tvl and the reason why they've changed this wording from liquidity to tvl is that in unit swap v2 you deposit like a hundred dollars worth of eth and 100 uscc into the uscc eth pool and that gets spread evenly across the whole entire entire trading pair so that's all liquidity it's all liquidity right but on unit swap v3 you have to specify uh where you are putting the money and and and so it's not all liquidity it's it's tvl so a slight change in jargon uh but i think it's a more accurate and more precise right um and then on the other side kind of the the the under the point i'll underline here is you can get more liquidity for less tvl that's the efficiency factor yes yeah i forgot about that part right so tvl is is the same thing in unison v3 as liquidity is in v2 but it with tvl and unix v3 like the same amount of tvl would actually in theory perhaps give way more liquidity that's the whole point of unit swap v3 is that your dollar goes further in liquidity liquidity terms and you swap v3 all right very cool so what's this uh second chart we're showing or this list i guess yeah second chart uh again on the left it's unique swap v2 on the right is unispot v3 and we're just looking at the different pools right so we have the fei ethe and fey tribe uh you know swap v2 pools is the largest pools in unison uh v2 and then goes uh uscc eth and then the other common pairs at ethan usct and uni eth and then on the on the right we have the uniswap v3 pools and what's also added here is that each one you see that 0.3 percent fee tier that's something that's going to be new in unison v3 because uh oh there's the you could you do see the one of die to usdc which is a stable coin to stable coin and also uscc to usdt and those are 0.5 which makes sense lower lower fees lower fees for stablecoin pairs right and so this is new in unison v3 is and so these pools are going to be also um so there's not not only is there a theoretical you know die usdc point zero five percent um uh you know swap pool that's not theoretical that's exactly what's there but there's also a die usdc or die usct 0.3 percent and also one percent um but those are just illogical for stable coin disabled coin pairs it might be more appropriate for more illiquid assets um like unisoc unisox for example would actually be a great one percent lp fee uh t fear um and so that's something that you need to pay attention to in v3 is that there are the same pools of the same assets but they can be segregated by trading pair or trading fees what's kind of cool here is what we're seeing is i think what we expected to see uh it's happening it's still early but a lot of the the you know stable coins are receiving a massive amount of of seven day volume um you know pretty pretty interesting that that stable coin pairs are the one seeing a lot of adoption uh and you'd kind of predict that from the way unit swap v3 is is optimized for for those types of um curves i i do wonder speaking of curves what curve is thinking as a d5 protocol because many have said that v3 was going to be sort of a a curve killer right in curve curve being a protocol optimized for stablecoin to stablecoin types of trades and it looks like uniswap v3 is absorbing maybe some of that right now we'll have to see how that plays out i think the last take to have here is that not only do we have up to three different liquidity pools in unison v3 with three different v-tiers even though one of those feed tiers will be the dominant one there will still be three and then we still also have unit swap v2 and so as a user it's actually getting a little bit more complex to use unit swap and unit swap have done a great job making that very easy to navigate that complexity because they have that button that says like this the there's a different uh feed here or different trading pair that's more liquid or more liquid um but i still think the role of aggregators and index aggregators is going to play a very large role here because they're just going to obfuscate everything and not only are they going to aggregate across all uniswap trading pairs but they're also going to do every single other decks and so i really only think that aggregators are just going to be the place to to access unit swap v3 yeah absolutely we don't lose anything swap v2 is still there no one's lost anything we are just gaining in d5 all right david we we focused on that release because it's such a big one we just have a few others this week uh this is the first one is this launch me bits it's an nft this is from the folks who uh created crypto punks right so that's why this is getting such um i guess such press and such adoptions so early so what is me bits yeah me bits is crypto punks 2.0 basically they are uh it's except that you know where crypto punks 2d pixels me bits is 3d pixels right so very much minecraft looking characters uh and this but the same basic rules apply like each one has different traits there are many different traits there's uh you hair different hairs glasses shirts pants and shoes but also you can have multiple different kinds of traits inside of the same category right so you could have like a mohawk that's red a mohawk that's black you can have round blue glasses you can have starry yellow glasses and so it's really just a crypto punx 2.0 um and off there's been some criticisms of of me bit some think that they're the prices for these things in the amount of revenue that uh larval labs is going to make it's going to be insane for this uh people are saying that this is kind of them making up for how they just never monetized crypto punks yet crypto punks are like billions of dollars in market cap uh and so there's a little bit of controversy but at the end of the day the market decides and right now the market's kind of hot for me bits yeah it's the 80 million dollars david they've sold um me bits nfts some of them are selling for six figures already and larval labs has banked 80 million dollars dude yeah like that's not not something that's got that that is not something to scoff at at all eighth largest i believe nft market right eighth most successful nft market uh project of all time based on the secondary sales volumes as well so i don't know what are your thoughts in general here are we we've had this conversation a little bit but is this bubble territory uh again for crypto for nfts well i think the reason why crypto punks have done so well is that people get to buy them and then put them as their avatar uh and that's kind of cool because like you you get to kind of you know brag about your crypto punks but you also in in a very virtual world that is crypto twitter and crypto discords and whatever social signaling social signaling right yeah and and these these are what these things are crypto punks are are avatars and so are me bits right uh and so uh they're what what uh larva labs is really doing is they're really borrowing from their success at um on crypto punks which they did not monetize and uh using using our episode with italic borrowing legitimacy from crypto punks and bestowing a little bit borrowing some and putting it into me bits because you know one worked out so well speculators are saying well the second one might work out pretty well too uh and so there's a lot of buying pressure for me bits and um i think that i would separate this from the rest of the nft market um because because this is one this is something that you know just like crypto punks very uniquely crypto sir you said vitalik legitimacy episode quick plug coming monday guys you have not heard it yet but that is coming monday right that's the next weekend early release for bankless paid subscribers absolutely so if you are a paid subscriber you already have access to it um david you know i'm going to come back to bank list out because i want to end there but let's talk about this which is super exciting okay x is a crypto exchange we call these crypto banks they are now supporting direct deposits and withdrawals not just on ethereum mainnet but to a rollup arbitra this is something that we had hoped would happen predicted would happen crypto banks actually depositing user funds directly on to roll ups and layer 2 chains rather than mainnet this is definitely the future i feel like a whole bunch of other crypto exchanges will follow suit and it's super bullish to me and he takes here yeah the amount of surface area there is on l2s for just innovation and integrations is extremely large and it's just going to be overall where people end up where they have their money and it's not on ethereum and then they want to go to ethereum but they don't want to pay gas prices what do you do you go to an l2 first and there's no reason why you can't go to an l2 first i think l2s are actually going to become the dominant onboarding vehicle onto ethereum ethereum the center is actually going to i think be become like the harder place to get to in the long term because people are just going to want to play around in l2s in the first place difference between an l2 and a side chain of course an l2 is secured by ethereum by the asset price of ether by the economic security of the main chain a side chain is not that might have its own validator set uh absolutely so it's it's bullish news there okay speaking of l2s i think a long-awaited feature enhancement for crypto has been privacy so all of this information is public on the blockchain if i send you money from an ether account somebody knows what my address is i send it to you david they know what your address is they know exactly how much i sent you but we are adding privacy to layer twos as well this is aztec protocol with a private roll-up now supporting zk dye not just eth kind of cool get into this for us yeah uh so they they launched zk east not too long ago and again now they are launching zk die a hidden through line again let's cite the vitalik episode on legitimacy coming out uh where uh he said that defy apps prefer dye because of dye's legitimacy as a stable coin uh so hold that in your brain until monday but when you listen to that episode um absolutely cool not only do we have private youth but now we have private uh crypto dollars or die um so that's absolutely fantastic i keep going back to like david this is the vision for crypto since it was born right imagine if we had a non-sovereign um money that was peer-to-peer and completely private right and and now we do uh it's super cool what's happening in crypto for those that are paying attention again this is not reaching cnn mainstream news yet but the price of doge is somehow uh david let's talk about the last release bankless dow welcomes you the bankless dow has officially released genesis team put out a post about this man i'm super excited about all of the activity that we've seen in the bankless dallas inch lot since launch it is like that that snow globe as you said what what are you excited about dude that's that's our last question i can't ask you that don't answer what you're excited about maybe talk about the distribution of it and and how it launched yeah so uh we want we wanted to do this uh differently and the bankless style is already a different dow kind of like i said at the beginning like this we aren't uh yearn we're not uh you know sushi swap we don't have an on-chain defy app we have an off-chain group of people who are interested in a shared common banner the bankless banner uh and you know there there's really like we got ryan and i uh on on in the bankless llc side and we got lucas and we got a couple other people uh and so many other people approach us to be like yo i would love to help out how can i help and i i don't really want to be a manager and i know you don't want to be a manager ryan so we bankless llc doesn't have the surface area to onboard all the people that want to help yet bankless dow as a digital organization which if you just the difference between discord and slack by the way is they're the same apps but one is open and one is closed right and so discord where the bankless llc is is like the open slack right for a company except it's not a company it's a dow and so although when i talked about the the snow globe and the settling of people people are finding they're parts of the bank list now that they want to contribute to uh and and so and it's an open organization like you can find your find your niche inside of the bankless doubt and contribute in ways that you think is interesting to you and and that's how the dow grows yeah we go we already did this kind of in small ways right david so as you said like we're a very small team producing all of this content but we've had people in france reach out and say hey we want to translate bank lists and spread the mission in france and it's like yeah go do that and like bankless france has been doing that for the for the past year right as an offshoot bankless russia there are bankless chapters all over the the world there there are even bankless clubs inside of universities now and so we can't coordinate all of that activity the meme is really the coordination layer it's like what's the bankless movement about it's about going bankless right right it's just like that's all you need to know and with that rallying cry now others can get involved in the movement but now we have a mechanism to coordinate some of that activity that's the difference with bankless dallas so super exciting man and like the energy around this the quality of people who who have joined so far like i go through everyone joins the bankless dow and they introduce themselves in the intros channel we've got like harvard professors there's some tech and like rocket scientists and like i'm like you listen to this podcast what are you doing but they do and uh yeah i'm just excited to see what what comes of this uh this experiment really is an experiment yeah let's talk about the the genesis proposal ryan can you bring that up on the screen okay let me let me find where that is i think that's the announcement post yeah yeah so this is something again different a different way to do a doubt is that we distributed the genesis team distributed the bank token to a bunch of different people based on different criteria right like if you're a bankless badge holder uh fun fact that's why we were we're telling you to get the bankless badge so often um uh and a couple other different vehicles did you donate to the git coin uh did you buy it buy a bap zero t-shirt um and a few other ones uh and then we saw and then uh so i got my airdrop ryan got his airdrop but we didn't get any air drops in outside of what other people got right we got equivalent air drops and then we submitted the genesis proposal and that's where bankless llc requests a distribution of bank from the bankless dow and so bankless llc is requesting permission from the bankless community to bestow upon us a par a portion of the bank tokens that that we propose that we think is fair uh and so if you are a bank token holder you can vote yes or vote no it's up to you yeah it was really it's really like um the vision for this is for bankless llc to be one media node on the the network right along with other media notes and so the genesis proposal is really was really like a uh a question like here's what we think we can provide the bankless movement um would you like us to continue doing that would you like us to to coordinate our activity so i think it's it's not only like about um bankless llc getting more involved here it's it's also a template for other organizations other media nodes to to get involved so it's super exciting and dude like i i had you know um i had no idea what people what the what the like people in the dow would do whether they would vote yes whether they would vote no whether they would uh fine-tune the proposal negotiate it's it's all up for discussion and it has been um and the proposal the vote doesn't close until tomorrow so anyway this is just a really exciting experiment and um i'm i think that now we have an internet scale organization that can live long past uh a set of five individuals that run bankless llc right so like if something happened to us david uh you know this movement lives on as a media entity and that's what's so cool about ethereum and so cool about the dow structure yeah yeah that's exactly right again it's it's things are a bigger tent under a dow form right like we could not fit enough people under bankless llc and and to the point where it was started to have its own spin-offs and like you said with bankruptcy bankless france but now everyone can find themselves under the bankless dow tent right and just as you said the the bankless meme needs to be some like the whole point the bankless meme is literally about being a bigger tent it would be stupid if we kept it under the llc it can grow into its fullest potential in dow form uh and so uh ryan are you familiar familiar with google's 20 time yeah that's where like they encourage employees to spend 20 on a creative project right right exactly right and so you you and me we need to help help bootstrap this down right we're part of it uh and so i propose that like fridays are our dow days right where we're instead instead of uh working on bank list llc we work on bank list dow obviously we're basically in the bankless dow discord monday through friday plus weekends too but yeah we're also juggling bankless llc stuff perhaps on fridays is only dow day friday is down yeah dude that's a good idea the other thing is like all of the 20 hobby time that all of these professionals outside of their their work activity um they can pour their skills and talents into the bank list down that's super exciting i want to say one last thing and then we'll move to news and that is this if you are upset or disappointed that you weren't part of the original distribution like what i want to say is this is four days old right right the entire purpose of future seasons of the bankless dow is uh to invite more people into the bankless dow and so there's i think the community has lots of things planned um the best thing to do is continue to like monitor raise your hand volunteer do things for the movement uh get noticed when when your grants grant proposal process comes available apply for a grant like there's tons of ways to stay plugged in this is just the first week so anyway just stay tuned for that if you're excited about the bankless movement want to help out again this is like this is for the builders of the bankless movement this isn't necessarily for the consumers right like if you're just listing the bankless show absorbing the content on your journey you don't have to be involved in the bank list now at all right um this is for the people that are building it for those users right uh anyway that's it man should we get the news before you move on just to you can't stop yeah i can't stop stop i i think that the world of dows and the new culture around digital organizations will benefit people that advocate for themselves and so there there are already proposals out there to include some missed people in the initial distribution people that you know had a bankless badge but you know some some weird scenarios and so the the final distribution of bank is unknown because it's in the hands of the dao right the dao will figure it out uh and there there have been some people and i want to change to try and attempt to change the culture in the dao already is there are some people who come into the dao and they ping david and ryan and like hey uh i think i think this like it should be like this and yeah and i'm like i was great like yeah again we have we have no we have no control we don't have any any governance over this thing above and beyond our airdrop so advocate for yourself formulate a proposal submit it to the dow and let the dow decide because again like it we we can give our opinions about it but that's all we can give is only our opinions yeah absolutely it's very active very uh cool thing uh definitely get plugged in and advocate for yourself and advocate for the movement too right it's like ask not what the dow can do for you ask what you could do for the dow that's what i'll end with here we go there we go all right now we gave it it now we can end it that was a perfect ending uh news ethereum stuff let's talk about the first one defy is now funding defy let me skip to that polygon launches a 100 million dollar fund to support d5 adoption this is polygon a successful side chain slash layer 2 solution getting a ton of defy adoption and they're now launching an entire fund to build up defy infrastructure yeah and the matic token the token of polygon is definitely one of the the outperformers in recent times and so it's really good to see them recirculate some of that that wealth back into defy i'm reminded of kevin owaki's regenerative finance coindesk article which has been a fantastic mental model of mine where using defy using one defy app makes that defy app valuable and then that defy app invests into the rest of the ecosystem and new d5 apps are built and then those d5 apps are built and those become valuable and it just recirculates and recirculates and recirculates and that's how you you bootstrap a network and polygon sticking true to the ethos of regenerative instead of instead of degenerative if you didn't get that regenerative finance well said uh speaking of polygon polygon is now top 10 overall on d5 pulse so they've been added they are now top 10 with 24 billion again they are a somewhere between a side chain and an l2 solution so not completely roll-up dependent but they are definitely culturally invested in the ethereum ecosystem and what it's doing there let's look at this so my wife actually uh sent me this home page it was the home page of cnn and vitalik was on it and it was ethereum's 27 year old ceo a co-creator is now the world's youngest crypto billionaire vitalik a billionaire i don't think he cares though david i'm willing to bet that he didn't even know i bet this is news to him i just think this is probably one of the billionaires that cares least about like having recorded like five or six podcasts with them like you feel like you get to know a person you spend a lot of time talking to him he doesn't care about this at all i remember reading uh cami russo's book um uh the infinite machine and and uh there was a a section about how vital would stay at like the cheapest hostels while ether was yes over a thousand dollars in 2017. yeah yeah it's uh it's cool but look this is a milestone i think for for for the community as well uh definitely eath price appreciation is the reason why um let's talk about this speaking of dows the maker foundation is returning all of their dev fund holdings to make her as a dow is this maker foundation like disintegrating bowing out and yeah bowing out yeah saying bye bye yep yep and so into the community exactly so the maker foundation has a pretty large supply of mkr because that's where mko got minted in the first place and the maker foundation about a year ago committed to dissolving itself in the future as it was ready and so this is the process of um gradual decentralization and i would like to to give a shout out to all the bitcoiners that came on my my other podcast pov crypto pod and talked about how gradual decentralization is not possible this is gradual decentralization being completed being finished the maker foundation is dead the maker dao is alive the king is dead long live the king is that a shout out when you when you call someone out like you were wrong is that is that sure call out shout out whatever i could i could list names if you wanted me i got it there you go next episode oh save that for the debrief david names that's where he named names all right um got received more disruptive to banks than bitcoin who says this not not the bankless guys ing insurance is saying this this is a headline from a quote they released a paper lessons learned from decentralized finance a few quotes here defy is an integral part of ing's digital asset vision um researching d5 they're spending a lot of time doing this they're they're commenting that it has 76 billion locked up the best of both worlds is achieved if centralized and decentralized financial services cooperate by mullet defy mullet oh yes sir i heard that one before d5 mullet uh in a in corporate exact speak analyst speak ryan earlier i said that defy season is coming like this is why and again while we have retail aping into things like dogecoin we have in my in my opinion in my from what i can tell in my analysis we have institutions putting ether on the balance sheet and using ether as a store of value and also investigating defy assets and so i would like to present the possibility that there are strictly different cohorts of buyers between why doge is pumping versus why eth is pumping and i think people are also settling in around people were circling the institutions were circling around ether and then they just landed on it recently people are also institutions are circling around defy assets like uni know like yfi like ave comp whatever they are circling around defy assets and there's going to be a defy season that is institutionally driven and i'm bullish for that sir i accept that proposition and i'm also bullish sir well said all right let's talk about bankless doubt already making its own news two days old it's already giving 100k away to charity i said we would inject bankless down every single section of this conversation here we are doing it i don't know if it's a meme of the week but here it is david what's going on 100k how is bankless doubt already donating to charity what's going on here yeah if you click that snapshot link they'll we'll give it a little bit of the backstory so udi wertheimer who uh you know famous troll uh has publicly stated that he is interested in coming onto a podcast to uh articulate the vision of bnb as hyper sound money uh finance coin binance coin right and cms holdings another famous twitter account uh said that judy should go on bankless uh and and then ud responded saying that they're never gonna invite me on and that's true he was right probably true right but then cms holdings was what said what if i donate a hundred thousand dollars to the to the charity of bankless choice uh and so i mean i kind of feel of a personal responsibility ryan to to say yes to that that is uh i can't say no to donating to charity an hour of our time david to have a conversation with udi is definitely worth 100k to charity yeah and like he's a conversationalist like we can have a conversation it'll be fun it'll be fun i don't know if it'll be useful but it'll be fun it'll be funny yeah um and and so what we're what we're doing is instead of uh bankless llc uh saying where the money is going to go we just handed handed the rights to that over to the dow so the dow chooses where a hundred thousand dollar goes right now git coin is in the lead followed not too far behind by uh india covet relief uh followed not too far behind by by coin center uh there's this is only let's see there's only i think five or six percent of total outstanding bank voting and so this is this current vote is completely swayable in any direction i'm kind of bummed that bitcoin mining carbon offset isn't really in the lead but you know fair enough like i'll give that i'll give it to you that was yours that was mine well you have you have it like a point zero zero one percent to vote on sir so you should do that yeah i would definitely should do that but you know get going in the lead so uh you know maybe if this this comes through we're donating 100 uh bankless dow plus cms holdings donating a hundred thousand dollars to get coin cool how silly is that dude i don't understand but okay dude what if what if though bnb is actually hyper sound money man and what if i think we'll find out what if we're wrong what if we're wrong and what if he'd be to be continued when's that podcast happening we haven't scheduled it yet yeah well first first first we have to come to a head the bankless down needs to pick which uh charity to donate to then we'll forward that off to cms and then he'll donate schedule time and then we'll schedule it with ud yep stay tuned guys to be continued all right uh ethereum is headed to 10k not again the bankless guy is saying this but somebody on cnbc saying this gary tan a famous venture capitalist angel investor saying this live on cnbc for the world to hear he said a few things eth going to 10k he said eath is ultrasound money wow david two months from the creation of ultrasound money genesis of ultrasound it wasn't the creation the creation happened in like september of 2020 but it was really starting the articulation the the heavy heavy justin drake yeah yeah yeah yeah so dude that's uh you know look we've said before social layer meme layer it propagates up here it's propagating up to traditional finance cnbc gary tan now sporting ultrasound money kind of fun yep all right let's talk bitcoin this is a big one this is bigger than bitcoin like this might i mean we should have we could have led with this us banks are allowing bitcoin trading in 2021 says ny dig execs nydig is that how you say that and why dig i'm not sure but um new digital investment group has inked a partnership with fintech fidelity vitality has been in crypto for a long time since like 2015 and 2016 doing a lot in the space that's fidelity um the investment company and now uh ny digg is going to be signing on a whole bunch of banks i believe to be able to um actually buy and sell crypto assets in particular bitcoin so like the this is david i think this is the banks wanting a piece of this right the bank's not knowing how to custody crypto assets not knowing what to do with it and this agency ny dig helping out with that with with a partnership with fidelity so pretty soon it's it's look this is something we predicted when coinbase goes public all of the other banks are going to look at their financial statements in the sec they're going to look at all those financial statements and start salivating and being like oh my god this is possible where's our cut and this is them coming back and trying to get their cut of crypto and so you'll basically have the ability to buy and sell crypto at your local bank that's what this leads to yeah there's a typo in this article where they say new digital investment group is actually new york digital investment group okay the way that this works is that nydig takes care of the trading and custody and they just have apis to apparently hundreds of banks and so all this is from what i can tell uh an api integration if you want to hear a better explanation of this to listen to nlw's uh podcast with somebody for actually from nydig explain this but apparently very simple integration where they just put in an api and then all of a sudden next to your usd balance in your bank account you have a bitcoin balance that's so hard for me to fathom to even picture that world but uh that's what's going on as of the profit incentive for banks to get aboard this all right let's talk more about profit incentives nfts there's a profit incentive in nfts as well we had garyvee on the podcast he's doing some stuff with nfts and he's just launched the friends which is his take on nfts there's some cool features here i think um that we we covered in our our episode with him earlier in the week but i guess a few takeaways one i think this on boards more people to ethereum wallets so in order to get these nfts you have to have an etherdress so it's crypto native from that perspective which i like you're also buying these nfts with eth which is kind of cool too so again onboarding more people this is not necessarily something for me not necessarily something for you um but it is something that his community is uh is interested in and uh we'll we'll see how this uh this goes after he launches it yeah and i think that's really actually the big takeaway with uh garyvee and his nfts you know with crypto punks or euler beats or all the other like more general nfts there's like anyone who's interested in nfts can start to speculate on like the cool nft these gary v nfts are really just for gary vee and his fans it's kind of more of a not formally but informally a closed ecosystem because you know if you don't care about gary vee then you're not going to care about his nfts but if you do care about gary vee then you probably are really going to be interested in his nfts and these these nfts aren't just like some weird weird drawing that you saw on screen it's not just some thing that gary drew is they're actually redeemable for some sort of time with gary uh and so they're like hang out with gary collateralized nfts right like dinner deer he just drew a random picture of a deer now it's an nft and if you buy this nft you get to have dinner with gary and gary has a massive fan base and if you are not in that fan base and you probably don't care but if you are in that fan base then you are probably downloading metamask loading it up with ether and then buying it a dinner deer nft uh and and credit tip tip of the hat to gary could have done this on you know solana could have done this on some other chain no he did it on an ethereum l1 with with ether uh not not not with fiat on top shots not on he's doing it right he's doing it right yeah i agree and if you think this is stupid that's okay it's not for you right like my wife thinks cryptid punks are stupid and like i'm never going to explain why they're actually valuable to her right it's just not for your community not for your culture um but the fact that you could do these for your community is pretty cool david let's go on more nft news uh coinbase is partnering with sotheby's which is i believe a large art auction group uh to announce a collaboration with coinbase commerce so that people at sotheby's can buy a banksy image with crypto so bitcoin and ether can be used to buy banksy right now bitcoin and ethan's money wow real world banksy you can use it for that now i guess it's becoming more money-like david this is cool too upshot has just announced that they've raised uh 7.3 million dollars i think of upshot what they're trying to do is be sort of the zillow for nfts where they give you like a price estimate for all of these nfts and there's actually an opportunity for uh bankless badge holders here that we can get to but what's what's your take on what upshot is trying to do yeah so it's kind of like i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of butcher this explanation but then i'm gonna get back to how it's actually accurate so like think of like swiping left or swiping right on nfts or kind of like a hot or not right so you're presented with two nfts and you just pick the one that you like the most uh and this is an nft appraisal platform and so with more and more data everyone remembers uh you know in the the social dilemma the social network where mark zuckerberg did that hot or not thing for with like college students on campus very controversial good thing nfcs don't have emotions um and so you can just pick your favorite nft and with more and more and more data of more and more and more people's inputs we can actually come to some sort emergent pricing or emergent appraisal for the value of nfts and so as an appraiser you are incentivized to pick the same nft that everyone else is going to pick and you have to do a little bit of due diligence not only looking at it and seeing if you like it or not but looking at how much supply there is previous trade history who made it uh and so there's there it's a two-sided marketplace people who want to earn money appraising nfts and people who want to pay to have their nft appraised and then there's also a wisdom of the crowds mechanism where if you pick the other things that other people pick then you get rewarded outsized and that at the end of the day art is just valued as how much other people value it and so this is a pretty cool nft appraisal platform again uh already beta access available to bankless batch holders and bankless badge holders only yeah so if you have a badge right now you can log on to app.upshot.io if you connect your badge with metamask you should be able to access the interface and become an appraiser and start earning for appraising these nfts super cool protocol excited to see where that goes david uh we'll end the nft section on this crypto punx is now being valued at 1 billion dollars usdc is this triple comma club or what man yeah and go ahead yeah dude like i just an nft that is worth three billion dollars in ft market that like blows my mind um are you i mean does it feel frothy though yeah i think it's inflated in the same way i saw i was talking about how the doge market cap is inflated because so many people have lost doge so many people have lost crypto punks right and so uh i think i think over 50 and it could be even higher than that that has to be heartbreaking right yeah imagine that there's a lot of wallets that just i mean because they were free to claim and so back in 2016 when they were they were released where gas was like below one gray people would be like oh i'll take i'll take a thousand crypto punks and then i'll throw away my wallet and that's where we are today and then it turned into the value of a house right sorry i'm sorry that's sad a more than reasonably sized house i might add crazy all right uh let's get to a few others before we leave goldman sachs is leading a 15 million series b into a round for coin metrics coinmetrics is super cool great data site for crypto doing fantastic work our friend nick carter over there and this is goldman sachs leading the round so like big financial institutions getting involved in crypto really cool really bullish any anything more you want to say there yeah top tier data analytics platform with a seed round from a top tier i mean i'm not going to say nice things about a bank but you know as far as banks got gold goldman sachs is like really high up there in tier status and so tip of the hat for coinmetrics uh and this is uh illustrates just the value of good data in this place i'm gonna blaze through these because this is all the same theme which is uh traditional bank uptick of crypto here's another one s p dow jones famous index of course they're launching a bitcoin and ethereum indices in 2017 this would have been huge news this week it barely is a blip on kryptos radar but it is huge news uh paypal has held exploratory talks about launching a stablecoin dude the rumor mill keeps swirling paypal's absolutely doing something in the stablecoin space so is visa i wouldn't be surprised if they come up with something this year paypal has the largest d5 mullet or at least it will have the largest d5 mullet the largest dankest nastiest reese's d5 mullet imaginable that's what david's predicting all right here's something else david galaxy digital is acquiring bitco bitco of course is a very large crypto custodian galaxy digital premier crypto custodian definitely they are one of the go-to's besides like coinbase and a few others they're definitely the go-to galaxy digital is a large crypto fund of sorts they're acquiring them for 1.2 billion dollars i'm not sure what galaxy's intentions are but it feels like they're planning to maybe flip them to another acquirer that's what i would guess but have no idea what their intents are interesting activity nonetheless let's get to the next one oh this look we'll park on this for just a second because we talked about it in markets elon musk had an snl appearance saturday night live of course he did he say something about dogecoin he must have wait no he's going to have a saturday night live appearance on saturday because it's because it's live right it hasn't already happened yet of course yeah of course and so he's been shilling how he is the doge father and he's going to shield the doge father is that really what he's done that's what he's been saying and i don't have time in my life right now for elon musk sorry what you could be doing i mean he bought he bought bitcoin and put on the balance sheet for tesla so i guess dude he's launching rockets and making space-age cars he's making a farce out of my industry ryan okay well i'm sorry yeah i mean he he's a big memester and he's apparently going to be shilling doge really hard on snl this summer how do people know this oh because said he was because elon's been been tweeting about it because that's where the doge father meme came from why i don't know what's he's a meme so i what i don't understand is a lot of people um who text me asking about judge coin uh say things like yeah elon's involved in this elon thinks it's a big deal and that therefore gives it legitimacy which is why i worry again low confidence mean low conviction meme is why i worry about dogecoin should we say you're we should send elon the bankless podcast uh and he should listen to it to understand this industry a bit more i know elon very smart dude understands a lot of things but um i don't know why he's doing this yeah come on elon all right david uh a16z is raising another fund as much as one billion dollars for a new crypto fund what's your comment here uh yeah a16z always pioneering the charge into crypto one billion dollars going into this industry uh is that going into crypto assets is that going into seed investments probably a little bit of any of everything but overall our industry is about to get one billion dollars better all right how finney would be 65 earlier this week uh rest in peace how finney 65th birthday what do you want to say about this uh possibly satoshi would have died in 2014 due to als a true cypherpunk uh happy birthday alfini yeah super cool david we're gonna get to takes in just a minute and don't forget the meme of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics metamask is your go-to wallet for the bankless journey if you're going bankless you need metamask period browser and mobile get them both this is your tool to unlock the world of defy here's my favorite part now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe this has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens choose a token you own a token to exchange it with get your quotes if you like what you see you hit swap that's it what makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes it compares dexes aggregators and market makers to

better liquidity you don't even have to think about it try it out download metamask for desktop or mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping all right guys we are back with some hot takes for the week let's go to the first david etherium is green what's the take behind this yeah so this is a post made by a state status uh status um uh app that uh talking about all about how exactly green ethereum is and i think the the i'm gonna lead with the punch line actually and say that if you want to be green you don't turn your energy consumption into renewable resources you consume less i mean you can do both you can do both but consuming less is actually the greenest path forward rather than just reorganizing how you consume resources if you can just stop consuming resources you don't actually have to find renewable resources to consume you can just stop consuming resources at all and so what status is showing in this in this blog post is that ethereum is green because it actually just doesn't consume anything and so under a proof-of-stake paradigm uh it is 99 more efficient in energy consumption than proof-of-work dude i just feel like this is checkmate to the proof of work argument basically right so like um or the the environmental impact of proof of work it's basically like yeah the answer is we turn it off right we stop doing it it's it's not this convoluted answer of how much energy is bitcoin or ethereum proof of uh work using and how much of that is renewable versus non-renewable and how much of it is like net new innovation versus not like the answer is like we just turn it off and even if you don't care about any of this that is a better narrative to go mainstream with and a better narrative when your friend asks you about crypto's environmental impact or the media announces you about how much energy crypto is is using on a given day you just have to say uh like none zero now like so anyway we've we talked about this before but i i just feel like that's a checkmate answer and ethereum to be fair can't say that yet right until the merge right you know and that's uh nine months from now 12 months from now and i see the same like i i saw like three headlines this week like uh bentley is commit committing to uh we produce only electric cars by 2030 like a you know x car manufacturer committing to only electric cars by x date that the model the move towards electric feels like also the move towards proof of stake like proof of stake is just like the most efficient green like minimally consumptive thing and like proof of work feels like a gas guzzler it feels like a hummer it feels like a tank and that's kind of the the same uh ethos of protecting bitcoin is like well we will just pile on armor after armor after armor whereas proof of stake is like we'll just be really agile and lean uh and i think the society instead of one wanting a big hunking gas guzzler they want something agile and lean yeah definitely um all right let's talk about the next article or take from the week and this is a take by charlie munger successful berkshire hathaway investor uh he and warren buffett of course uh very rich individuals great great investment advice too um both these guys but bitcoin's success is disgusting is what charlie munger said this week he's got some other lines here of course i hate the bitcoin success monker said i don't welcome a currency that's so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth nor do i like shuffling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air peak i peed okay i'm gonna keep reading this because it's great i think i should say modestly that i think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization david hoffman is what we're doing contrary to the interests of civilization my friend no it's true contrary to charlie munger and his idea of his civilization it's just he's very aware that bitcoin is popping his bubble and no one else is uh and he sounds really insecure about who he is in his position in the world yeah it sounds pretty pretty angry about it and here's the bottom line i don't think crypto is for charlie munger yeah like he's not gonna have to deal with the problems that younger generations are dealing with right as a result of like charlie munger's success again fantastic investor but has done it on the fiat you know the whole fiat money printer pumping stock prices and all of these things of course he's made great decisions from an investment perspective but he's also benefited from the status quo banking system right so yeah it's not for him is is is is what i would say too when we're talking about the creative destruction that this industry brings this is the part that is the destruction part like goodbye charlie yes with that the actual take i don't know yeah i don't know if that was the actual take but uh there's something there for sure all right david let's do this take um man really good eva uh bailin at three dollars it was just a joke talking about ether here at 30 it was a good hobby at 300 it was a group of builders at 3 000 it's what it's a revolution talking about the price of ether really cool take here yeah there's just something to say that we can we can talk about the revolution but until it actually shows up in the market value of these assets then it's only talk when it's here in the number you can say that the revolution's finally here it's showing up uh eth price go up is economic strength is economic security is legitimacy david let's let's go to our friend rob paone who we had on the podcast uh this guy recruits for positions in crypto for for jobs and crypto he helps people find a job in crypto uh do you want to read this take out and then give your comments yeah he wrote an entirely long uh a nine nine tweet long thread so the whole thing is worth uh reading but i'm just gonna read number nine uh it actually goes to ten um he goes long thread short if you love the crypto crypto industry and you want a job here go for it is there career risk yes but everything in life has risk sitting in a cubicle at a big bank or big four droning away for the next 20 years is also a risk if you want it go get it uh yeah hell yeah bobby uh and i remember in in uh 2018 when after i went to east denver which was like the impetus for me to get into this industry uh i i i flew home and reflected on the plane ride home and it's like well am i seriously about to go home and study for the gre so i could get into school like what's the point what's the point like am i seriously going to miss this whatever the hell this i don't even know what this is but i'm seriously going to miss it absolutely not i am not risking missing ethereum over the next you know three years right i'm not waiting for the next bull market if this one's ending and then and then you know what i did ryan i what'd you do i used a bunch of defy apps uh i used unit swap then i got the uni airdrop so i didn't miss out on that that risk i you know learned how to use all these things uh started a podcast you know i would have thank god i didn't risk not doing all those things because it pays to be in d5 david's profile shot few know this they found out on april 1st though when we published the the joke post the prank his profile shot is still him sitting in front standing in front of a wells fargo for a job interview am i right about that uh one of my first days on the job but it was actually at a crypto drop oh my god that's funny though yeah it's like uh i think great bit of advice here like drop out of university and join a dow mm-hmm you know like i'm only half kidding about that we talked about this on the josh rosenthal episode which by the way i listened to um a second time this week because it was so good that that's the crypto renaissance episode and he talks about this and with his in his action items where he kind of sum summed up the last thousand years of history he said the thing that you where the place you don't want to be at this juncture in history is a part of the old institutional guard because that's not going to accelerate the path so you can't trust the path in the career like opportunities that the existing institutions have set out for you right you have to find something new you have to start exploring this new frontier and you have to position yourself for the change that is coming about and i think that's uh good advice being echoed by rob in this thread here absolutely david in the inside of a revolution the risk is staying the same all right david it's time what are you excited about this week my friend you ready to see it because it's a show-and-tell yeah you ready to see it here we go look at this look at this piece of unit oh my god yeah wow check that out okay so if i can zoom this in even more you can actually start to see some pretty cool stuff in there uh there's a little bit of easter eggs going on here and i think i hope this isn't a mirror image okay but here here eth is money he's right there what yeah here's uh here's wait wait i'm gonna see that can you bring that closer it's kind of hard i see it yeah i see it yeah here's here's welcome here's welcome wow there if you stare closer you can see in the uh over there is better together better together wow and so there's there's just a bunch of really positive ethereum focused words written all over this unit swap uh uniswap logo but in different languages uh many different languages there's hindi in there there there's arabic there's english and there's there's welcome bienvenido um etha's money where did you find this yeah so i got the i met up uh with this guy in twitter dms uh you you saw my kaya i i hope i pronounced that name right i probably didn't uh and i saw him post something similar and i was like yo like can i have that uh and then he he said no i want to make you a better one so he made me a better one commissioned it and then he sent it to me and so now i'm going to get it framed and put it up on my wall that is awesome is this an nft or is this like just old school traditional art traditional art pre nft nfts that's awesome but it is representative of crypto culture crypto meme culture and unit swap man good week to get that too did you receive it on uniswap launch day or is it a couple days before i've had it for a couple days now yeah that's awesome man very cool so thank you so much you saw my really really really cool present a bunch of creators in this community absolutely ryan what are you excited about uh i gotta say bankless dao one more time just one more time i told you we'd fit it in every section i think we've talked about it at length but just to see the amount of experimentation the community kind of rally around the movement um gives me hope that we have started something here that is much bigger than ourselves and that can continue to carry crypto forward under its value set which is like this is a technology about coordination this is a technology about self-sovereignty this is a technology that's going to make the world a better place and if those values are instilled in any way in this movement it's just the most exciting thing ever it's like that's my answer for every single week after this if i could give the same answer and it was still interesting but um there you go that's what i'm excited about yeah what i'm optimistic about is i think we also have found the right people um the right people have found their way into the bank of style and we'll continue to david let's get to you meme of the week all right this is one from our friend chris berninski okay explain this one so this is the classic uh boyfriend looking back at a girl in a red dress while his girlfriend is upset at him for doing so another one you know the one the boyfriend is the institutions the upset girlfriend is btc and the girl in the red dress is eth um our eth maxi's hats are definitely on on this episode but it's also reflected in reality in the markets and so um yeah uh awesome awesome meme chris you know how to meme for sure yeah well done not just a fantastic investor an explainer he actually wrote one of the books that got me really excited about crypto um crypto assets fantastic book i think still holds up in a lot of ways i hope he writes a second edition and now he's talented at meming some people get all the gifts he's got
