when we look to kind of the globe how about events like hovid lockdowns in china also we have the russian ukraine conflict how much do these things impact world markets right now in the macro picture a lot ukraine is a large producer of grains and other foods and the economy's basically shut down right now and russia got penalized and they have more commodities than any other nation on earth so you take some of those commodities out of the system so that is what was driving prices higher which is causing demand destruction the china situation is more complex so china is obviously the second biggest economy on earth you've now shut it down again so that's destroyed demand but they're also the largest supplier on earth so now we've got a lack of supply so could this feed into more inflation again this is the thing i'm scared of is what happens if this causes another rise in inflation inflation doesn't come down and this is when i don't think the governments have any choice but to start giving handouts to people who are worse off that's a stimulus check but unlike the coveted stimulus check you're not at home with nothing to spend it on so you punt it on robin hood you're actually going to do it to pay your bills
