stats updates what's happening with different projects across the nft space over the past week um i'm gonna talk about lazy lions if you're like what is this project that always dm's me we're gonna talk more about it uh we're talking about the big news this week honestly to me or the big thing that i want to get into is the let's call it open c scandal i don't know uh openc claiming they might do an ipo i want to talk about that and the reaction to that uh my reaction to my interview with marcus blatcher again can't pronounce his last name from the sandbox and uh gonna be a great gonna be a

available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io okay diving in so stats updates wanted to talk about the ross ulbricht nft i mentioned it last week that it was going on sale well we now have the results the ross albrecht nft went for over a thousand eth it sold for 6.2 million dollars holy hell good for ross uh really fascinating honestly i i expected this to do well i don't think i expected it in fact i did not expect it to do that well as a reminder the proceeds from the sale will go to a foundation that is dedicated to helping free ross it also goes to support giving for art which is a nonprofit set up by ross and his mom to support families of the incarcerated i also found out there's another detail to this that i learned which is that contributors anybody who bids on this genesis collection receives ross tokens in return and those ross tokens can allows you to like vote on proposals and contribute broadly to this free ross dow that is being set up so there is a governance component to all of this that's worth knowing about okay other news there is a sweeper a floor sweeper going going on i don't know that's probably not the right way to say that but there is there is a wallet that seems to be sweeping floors they swept the board eight floor they swept the world of women floor and zenica 33 who y'all know i love has said that they think that same wallet has now swept the loot floor so those projects all saw bumps this week really mean mainly due to one one primary wallet the other project that that did very well uh at least over uh one particular 24-hour period here was lazy lions they they bumped like 50 i think wednesday to thursday they seem to have bumped on the basis of coinbase news coinbase announced that lazy lions would be listed as part of the coinbase platform and that seemed to be the the real precipitating event for for this huge jump it still is interesting to me that that the coinbase news would do that we've had plenty of other projects get announced on coinbase and it hasn't always had that that same effect um okay lazy lions i feel like lazy lions is like the project we all love to hate i i initially i thought maybe this was just me you know i think of lazy lions in sort of an eye rolly way because they just show for their project so hard uh they're always i think it's calmed down a little bit but for a while there it felt like you know every day you were getting dms about joining their discord they're very loud on twitter and the project itself felt a little bit derivative not even a little bit it felt quite derivative from the standpoint that actually the the founders have said they really admired board apes it came out not too long after board apes came out this summer and it's like follows the same general formula right it's like an animal cartoon with an adjective before it bored apes lazy lions right it's sort of in the in the name and the art was even kind of similar in this you know giving a personality to a to a animal um and you know looking at their road map it felt feels very standard it's like at 20 if not even standard it feels like vaguer than standard i want to read a couple moments here i'm focusing on some of the negatives right now but i am gonna have to i don't know maybe eat humble pie if that's not too lame of an expression um the the road map for the project it says uh you know once 20 of the project sells out the community wallet they'll establish this community wallet which will be used for a variety of things for ensuring longevity i've said before i actually like vague road maps zenika has said that so it feels hypocritical for me to say i don't like this phrasing because it's too vague but there is just something about it'll be used for a variety of things for ensuring longevity that just feels i don't know kind of lame to me um but with all of these negatives said and i learned that i'm not the only one who has this impression like i reached out to a number of my friends just being like hey what are you all what are your like lazy lines what's your first reaction and like across the board it was like they shill too much or like you know feels kind of lame so i apologize lazy lion holders please don't don't don't come for me what i'm about to say is that so with all of that said with that being i think a a common impression of lazy lions the project is doing quite well it it broke a one-eighth floor today i think its all-time high was over three eighth back when things were really crazy i don't again i don't like to over focus on floor prices i think you know we time will tell what projects really have long-term staying power but this project has a real community i've now spent time in their discord they're they're definitely there they have over 4 000 individual nft holders which is big and the the big piece that i've really learned about as i started to dig into this project just to kind of understand it better and deeper than just my kind of eye roll initial impression of them is they have this roar wards program which i actually think is what feeds the shilling potentially so this rewards program is somewhat interesting it's on their roadmap as once the project hit 40 sold or whatever it says lazy lion holders are eligible to participate in a program that rewards community engagement and essentially you as a lazy lion holder you have to set your profile picture to your lazy lion you have to put like a lion emoji in your name you have to set your twitter banner to something i don't know there's there's a there's like four things all social media related that you have to do once you do that you connect your wallet to this like lazy part of the lazy lions site and you'll literally get ethe back you get rewards for uh for doing these things i can't i don't have a lazy lion i couldn't connect to their site and see like what else there was to this so i don't know if they also connect this ever to like you know ghostband people on discord essentially go spam people on twitter if you do that you'll get more rewards i i wouldn't be shocked if that was a piece of this but i don't know for sure i couldn't really get clarity on that i do think this is interesting it feels like an interesting way around the securities problem that a lot of these nfts face which they can't come out and say that they're gonna reward you or pay you because then you're getting real close to that securities violation line in this case it seems like hey buying a lazy lion gets you access to this membership club and once you're in this membership club if you do other stuff we'll pay you for that other stuff i don't know if this is sustainable i don't know how long a project can sustain itself on paying its people to shill for more users again that's where you sort of get into this multi-level marketing territory that i talk about quite a lot with these projects where it feels like the entire project is propped up by people going to shill for the project to get more people in to show for the project lazy lions in their road map their end goal they say is a play to earn game so that is really the test and that is really the question will this project succeed in making a game and therefore transitioning from just being a you know multi-level marketing scheme to something with real uh end utility assuming that the player in game itself is able to have sort of end utility and isn't itself just a matter of getting more money in the door um but is actually something that people enjoy and want to play that is the question so many projects promise a game that is like the premise of a lot a lot of projects these days and not all of them will be able to deliver i listened to an interview or part of an interview with one of the founders of lazy lions he seemed like a smart kid uh i don't know how old he is i'm not trying to be dismissive he seems he seems sharp um you know i they maybe have a chance they have they have a really die-hard community so if you haven't looked into lazy lions before because you like me sort of rolled your eyes anytime you heard about them might be worth looking into i'm by no means saying go buy a lazy lion like i said i don't own one this is you know do your own research not financial advice all of the disclaimers but i i i do give them more credit than i think i previously had after now digging a little deeper into what they're doing the rewards program thing roar awards program thing is is interesting and and actually some feels feels somewhat unique in terms of its execution okay the bad news this week or the project there were there were several projects that were down this week but i wanted to just flag that wolf game the new wolf game migrated assets were were down pretty significantly like 33 at one point over the week i think we talked about this last week i don't want to belabor the point but wolf game they had this this sort of big exploitation in their original smart contract so they've migrated the whole game onto a second smart contract a new one they're paying bounties out to anybody who tries to find exploits for that new smart contracts they're you're doing the kind of auditing thing within the community uh and they have this new game it's called the risky game where basically uh any wool you held as part of you know your your assets in the last smart contract and the original version of the game you now have the opportunity to get all of that wool back um via a wool pouch but you get to kind of gamble on it you can either take the wool pouch and get the get all of the wool you were initially entitled to or you can take a gamble and you can either get and you can opt into basically taking a chance that you might get a wool pouch with a lot more than you were gonna get or a wool pouch with like nothing or something so again this whole game is very gambly in a fun way i mean that actually as a positive i think that's what's fun about this game um but apparently the the community is i don't know losing faith feels like an overstatement but uh but the project did take a bit of a hit this week so it's definitely fallen from that original hype there's some speculation that like gas prices have to do with that right it's just expensive to play this game at this point uh that was brought up in an episode of proof the kevin rose podcast they talked about wolf game and they flagged as part of that that hey you can actually go play something called the sheep game which is on avalanche where gas fees are are much much lower and so there's a much lower barrier to entry cost to sharing your sheep etc but it's the exact same game this this was something they talked about like a week ago on the proof podcast so a week is forever time in this world i don't even know what what what is happening with the avalanche game seven days later but if you have been wanting to try your hand at the wolf game and felt like it was too expensive on the ethereum side might be worth looking into the avalanche side of this like i said i will be tracking this game closely i think it's a really interesting case study in what will happen with play to earn and like the potential for a farmville type game in web 3 a game that many don't think is a game many think is actually quite boring but somehow gets like a strong following okay don't want to belabor the wolf game thing i know i talk about it a lot the big story today what i really want to talk about is this open c scandal if you have not been following this and scandal is probably a strong word but if you've not been following this openc appointed a new cfo brian roberts he was the cfo of lyft the ride sharing app previously he has now come on to open sea and he in an interview with bloomberg you know as part of his press tour for taking this new role he said when you have a company growing as fast as this one you'd be foolish not to think about it going public so he clearly indicated that he's maybe working on and thinking about openc going public and the community response to this was swift and fierce and angry because there was a feeling that oh you're thinking about going public but you haven't made any comments or indication that you're going to reward the community that has been using your platform for the last number of years via a token drop like what ens did for example earlier this year uh with a lot of success so this backlash i'm gonna be honest and this is probably not a popular opinion but this backlash like triggered me a little bit in the sense that i was somewhat skeptical of all of the ens hype at the time and so when when i saw these people being like you need to do what ens did i was a little bit like like it almost pushed me on the side of brian roberts and the ipo not actually but but let me explain this so you know earlier this year the ethereum name system ethereum name service ens um did an airdrop where they dropped these ens tokens for anybody who had purchased an ens name domain and connected it you know and if you connected it to your to your ethereum wallet you get extra tokens you guys probably all know this it the the price of ens tokens promptly went to like 80 at its high and then came back down and i saw a lot of commentary on twitter at the time saying like or i've seen commentary even since being like holy this is the biggest thing ever you can own a piece of ens like this is going to moon think about how much bigger this is it's like own and go daddy and godaddy is worth x amount of dollars and if you'd own shares and go daddy you would be this rich like you know on and on and on and it felt like what was consistently missing in this conversation was that by owning an ens token you own a piece of governance you you can vote on proposals for ens and and you have a certain amount of therefore you have control over ens in that way but you're not entitled to like revenue and profit share as a result of this ens drop which is substantively different than if you are a shareholder of a company i think what i'm getting at here is there are two ways you can think about i would say ownership there's ownership where you control a company's decisions and there's ownership where you have a stake in their profits and ownership in like the private and public markets separate from web3 those things tend to go hand in hand right you control its decisions and you also receive the financial upside of it that is not so much the case in web 3 necessarily you have a lot of these governance tokens where it doesn't necessarily entitle you to [Music] profits of the thing and i sometimes feel like the broader dialogue around it acts like it does it acts like it's the same as a stock and it's not because it quite explicitly can't be because all of these tokens are trying to say they are not securities so i was sort of like if opens the ipos we all get to own a piece of open sea in a way that i think is more substantive to some extent than just owning tokens from it now this was not a totally fair perspective this was actually kind of a naive perspective i think and i've subsequently talked to folks who who are delegates for ens right who are heavily involved in the ens tokens and the governance and i think there were some really good points made there notably i talked to uh maria badwa i hope i pronounced your last name right maria and she's fantastic she's been part of the stoner cats team she's super deep in this space and she is a delegate for ens and she was like look the piece you're missing here carly is that if if openc ipos the community then has to go out and actively buy a share of openc stock to get to participate in it and that's available to everyone there's nothing special you're not rewarding users in particular and whereas what the community is agitating for here is an airdrop where openc users and participants get something back for their participation and that's like such an obvious point that it's embarrassing that i kind of missed it but again i think i was so triggered by like my ens flashbacks where i was like people do not seem to understand that this is not you're not like a shareholder in this now so i think that's a really valid point and i think it's really wonderful that in this space we hold leaders accountable to to their communities and we say hey open c like don't you dare forget about us right you're the people who have made you successful and that is something that does not happen in contexts seemingly outside of of web3 right if like lyft went public or is public like lift ride users people who use lift the app weren't like mad like but you owe us but like they kind of do right like the riders are what made them successful so you don't have that kind of agitating happening in like the traditional world and i think it's actually really wonderful that communities have started to demand that companies reward them the people who made them really successful and big so it's like this awesome awesome thing that happens here i i don't know though and i'm somewhat skeptical that these have to be mutually exclusive in terms of c ipoing means it can't issue a token to its community and and probably th that should happen maybe in reverse order where it issues a token to its community and then ipos because there's definitely a utility token here that could happen that's outside of uh like a governance or you know profit sharing token which of course isn't really realistic this was a point mario made she's like you know i think the the utility token element could be really interesting here she mentioned like super rare i was looking into the super rare token system it's really a curation system where if you have these rare tokens you get to vote on artists that get these like store fronts through the super rare platform that strikes me as something open c could fully do while still [Music] ipointing and maybe i'm being naive here tell me if you know more than me about this but i don't think an ipo has to mean that there isn't uh that there isn't a token and there isn't a community reward system those rare tokens from super rare are now trading at like 11 a share and they were airdropped to users for free of course so i think that's that's pretty powerful everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infiniti decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's

in each when you set up your first crypto paycheck sign up at onjuno.com crypto to get started that's o-n-j-u-n-o dot com slash crypto um the other thing i want to say is i i i want to be wary of thinking that decentralization is always in 100 of cases the right route for a company i think it's really valid to have companies with with centralized decision making especially in in a case of something like openc where there is like a product development component of this and you need to be able to make decisions about that quickly and you know efficiently group decision making is often a very inefficient and sometimes terrible way to go so i i don't want to necessarily penalize open c if they go a different route than an ens which strikes me as uh like a really awesome example of where you should decentralize i want to say one more thing about decentralization in just a minute but i want to pause to also say talking to maria you know i think it's wonderful maria and it strikes me from talking to her that the other people who are delegates for ens and are really involved in what's happening with ens are in it because they are passionate about helping to shape the future of what ens is they're passionate about the governance component of this they're not trying to like flip these tokens for a lot of money and to me if you want to hold on to ens that should be a big part of your motivation like you should want to be keeping up to date with what ens is doing on the governance side the proposals that are coming up shaping the future of this there's no doubt that ens is a huge huge thing and a huge property and i think we'll only continue to get bigger and if you want to shape that future from a governance and decision-making perspective that is the reason in my opinion to hold ens and i'm i'm heartened to see that i think maria and a lot of the folks who who are big in ens right now that is why they're doing this if you are holding e s because you want to make a bunch of money in the future i think it's important that you just get really clear on like how the mechanisms by which that might happen like as in ens tokens mooning so to speak i think the argument for it is that it you know like the arguments for a lot of nfts is you're making a bet on social signaling you're making a bet that as ens as web 3 becomes more mainstream and ens becomes really the social identity layer to all of this holding ens tokens has value because you were able to socially signal i mean of course yes you get to have a say in the direction of it and that's the first piece we talked about but you're able to socially signal sort of owning a piece of this in a particular way and if ens gets bigger and more mainstream the tokens will therefore be worth more that's interesting that's like a different that's this new world we're in in web 3 where like it's sort of the meme stock thing like it has value because the brand has value and so there's cache in getting to be a part of it rather than it having value because some like underlying fundamentals are in terms of like revenue or profit are going up so that's really interesting the other bet you could be making is that ultimately ens and and and the governors of it essentially will decide that there there could be payouts to token holders uh you know directly like in the form of payouts or something else i mean sort of like what we're talking about with with lazy lions um so you could be making a bet that that might happen it just can't be explicitly said up front because again then you're really bumping up against the limits of securities laws if ens came out and said yeah uh ens token holders governance token holders will also get to you know vote for a dividend and they'll be paid a dividend essentially to themselves like that's that's a security now and it's all it's a whole different ballgame so but those two paths i think expecting ens as a brand to go up in value and therefore the social signal capacity of owning ens going up in value so the whole thing goes up in value i think that's one route here and then the other route is is again expecting that there may be a dividend component to this down the line if you think there's something else i'm missing here about ens and its value and why people should want to own it if they are are really just looking for like a surge in price please let me know this is something i want to understand a lot better i think social tokens governance tokens they're all huge and a huge part of this ecosystem and are only going to get bigger and i plan to dive a lot more into this stuff as we continue through this journey but please let me know what you think on the ens front i do think the the backlash against openc was a little overblown but i think it's really fantastic for the community to hold these companies accountable and say hey you know we don't forget us we want to make sure we're benefiting from anything you do in the future as well what i would really love is like if if there was a way for openc users to basically cut the line in like an ipo like vcs like private investors who can get like earlier better deals i think our legal infrastructure doesn't like simply doesn't allow for that properly but again i'm probably speaking i'm getting a little further out from where my like understanding of this stuff truly works but that to me is like the ideal like allow openc users to get their hands on these securities before the the rest of the market can um that's how i think this should go okay uh i wanted to make a last note sort of on this question of decentralization i said i don't think decentralization is in every case the best thing and i know that there's some purists out there that really chafe at that notion so i wanted to say an area where i really love the concept of of greater decentralization and you know bordering on full decentralization and that is with these metaverses i interviewed marcus this past week the marketing director for the sandbox and i i really do believe that the sandbox between my conversation with marcus the conversations i've seen with with the founders of the sandbox like they really want this to be something that is driven by the community and the community builds what they want in the sandbox and then that's what the sandbox ultimately becomes as opposed to you know the executives of the sandbox being like we're going to become the gaming metaverse and like we're driving towards that and we're making this decision in a top-down manner no they're like hey we want y'all to tell to build what you want we're giving you the tools to build in the sandbox now go build what you want to see here i think that's that strikes me as the right strategy and awesome and like because your users are then just building what they want you don't have to do focus groups and be like what do the people want it's like no they're just gonna build it for you essentially so i think the metaverse is an example of where we really want it to be user-led decentralized user controlled obviously that's in direct contrast with what we're probably going to see with meta which is why i think the broader world but certainly the web 3 community is very turned off by the meta metaverse play though i continue to say it's brilliant and i think it is absolutely brilliant um but i i that's an example of where i think decentralization has a huge role to play and is is very valuable um i sometimes cringe a little bit i wonder if anybody else has this when i hear projects be like well the community will decide that right when you ask a founder or whatever like what the plan is and it's like well we really just want the community to determine like what we do here sometimes i have this feeling where it it feels like people like shirking responsibility like i don't know and sometimes as users or holders of projects that say that i'm kind of like well i don't know i want you to make this thing a success like i'm busy like i don't have time to make your project a success i'd like you to do that so i have these moments sometimes where it feels like saying hey the community will side decide feels like sort of a cop-out answer for like we don't have our own plan in a way that i can find really uncomfortable please let me know if any of you ever feel that way when you hear projects say that like well it's just like up to the community like okay well the community is busy so can you also have a plan please um but again in the case of decentraland or i'm sorry in the case of the sandbox and these like these uh metaverses in general i do not feel that way i do think the community should be leading should be leading the decisions around that so long as these metaverse platforms are giving the community the tools to do that building and in the case of the sandbox they are they have game maker and voxel edit and all these tools for for people to build within the sandbox um so that's that the last thing i want to say i tweeted on twitter i tweeted on twitter that's redundant i suppose i tweeted recently about the fact that i have a plethora of garyvee's latest book it's called 12 and a half i think the tools for emotional success i don't know something along those lines i gary announced several months ago that he was doing something where if you bought 12 of his books you would get airdropped or you'd get to claim an nft he was launching in december of this year i am a big garyvee fan i think he also can is somebody who can be a little eye-rolly to folks especially like og's in this space but i have to say i think he's an incredibly impressive business person who has a very clear track record of success i think he's very smart i think he's very fortunate in the way he's wired to be honest and it serves him the way he's wired serves him very very well in business and so i'm a v friends token holder i minted v friends they have done very well for me so i am long on garyvee projects because i think he's relentless i think he's tenacious i think he's smart and i think he delivers for his community because his reputation matters so so much to him and he to for his reputation to do well he needs to serve the community so i'm long on him so i bought a ton of these books so i can get these nfts that he's airdropping in december i am offering them out for free i will mail them to you if you rate and review this podcast on apple podcasts rating and reviewing is not a feature on spotify so it's really only something on apple it does take a couple days for your review to show up but uh we will link to my little spreadsheet or my google form here if you want a free gary v book go fill out this

sign each of the books not like in a oh i'm a celebrity way because that's super lame and i'm very much not but in like i'll write a little note in there maybe it's a quote i like maybe it's like a fun little rambling or musing that i have whatever right i'm gonna do something along those lines so um yeah fill out the google form if you're interested i'm hoping this sunday so i'm recording this on friday i'm hoping two days from now uh i'm gonna get a bunch of these sort of signed and starting to get them sent out i will get them all sent out before the end of december i just i'm i have a lot i have a lot of them to do and i have a lot of other things going on but i will get them out to y'all if you're interested in that and uh there's a little plug for for gary himself great thank you
