how did SBF get himself in this situation is this kind of a con man from the beginning or do you think he's like a lot of people who go down this path where you know it's a shortcut here to shortcut here and gradually he kind of slips into the position that he's found himself in oh my god the guy I watched the Serranos documentary thing recently and it seems like she's died with good intentions and then things just like slipped away and then at some point she like turned and was like I've got to be evil in order to like keep this like rolling and then she chose the evil path yeah like it's impossible to know I find it easier to suspect it was for a while and then like the tide going out reveals that it was like if it's for a while and you try and like fix it but like make it worse and then the tide goes out and you're just not in control of that maybe that makes sense but who knows dude
