[Music] hey guys happy first week of december david what time is it oh it's a friday weekly roll-up time ryan where we roll up the entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor yet we do it anyways because we have a ton of fun doing it and i hope you do as well so grab your morning coffee because we are about to roll up the week it is fun look crypto is never boring guys so uh you know this how was your thanksgiving by the way was was that uh was that fun did you get any crypto conversations in oh inevitably just like i said with at the uh the last part of last week's episode is like everyone talks about crypto uh because that's like one person in the room is the known crypto person and no one knows what crypto is so they always got to ask about crypto so yes that did indeed happened uh guys we are going to get into the main events of the week first of all budweiser beer company buys beer.eth and now they are prominently displaying on their twitter page it's an nft more to come maybe jack dorsey just stepped down from twitter david what does this mean for crypto we're going to dig into that also all eyes on the eth bitcoin ratio ratio talk give me hot and flustered i know you're excited about that one all right that's why we'll get to it first and also the ethereum roadmap refresh of course there's a ton of other things we're going to cover in the weekly roll up you do not want to miss it try to jam pack this into the next hour or so 90 minutes 90 minutes we'll see if we can do 90 minutes no promises on the hour uh but before we do gotta mention a permissionless conference so you know this conference is coming in may this is happening in florida so if you're in the cold weather climate you want to get down to florida you're thinking of it this is going to be the crypto conference of the year at least the defy conference of the year we're going to be there our friends at block works are putting this on we let you know now because new tickets just went on sale new tranche every two weeks new tranche goes on sale price gets in uh more every it goes up every week it's up only so if you want a bankless discount on that you can become a premium subscriber and go get your permissionless tickets we will see you there in the new year i think david you got probably like four or five conferences and i mean like yeah like now in that one but you know that's going to be a a highlight of next year for sure at some point the yearly subscription to bank list is actually going to pay for itself because of the 30 off that it gets you off this ticket so we might be close yeah right uh so uh like ryan said uh you can sign up for bank let's get a 30 off discount uh but the sooner you get that ticket the cheaper it's going to be uh because like no one wants to be paying they have the the you know april of 2022 fomo where the tickets are over a thousand dollars a piece yeah get them now but before we while they're like 400 something in crypto you never want to delay things right you just uh just ate band guys ape into that conference also we want to mention our friends at metamask they are sponsoring this message i use metamask all the time david i know you are a power user of metamask the most the safest way to use metamask is with a hardware wallet so a ledger wallet is one good option also lattice metamask has recently added support for the lattice wallet which is a hyper secure hardware wallet sits right in your desk beautiful user interface also another wallet called keystone which provides a qr air gapped qr code based hardware wallet so what metamask is doing right now is really doubling down on its wallet support which is a perfect complement because you want to use metamask but you want to use it in a safe and secure way if you've used ledger and metamask before you know there's some like there's some bumps it hasn't always worked perfectly in in some of the browsers like chrome ledger and metamask are partnering to iron out those issues and they've just released a whole bunch of releases so the action item here if you don't have metamask you want to portal into web3 go download metamask there's a link in the show notes if you haven't used metamask with a wallet before then try it it is the uh the most secure safe way to experience web 3 to date you can get into d5 you use it all of the time so check that out there is a link in the show notes to metamask and you can find out more about it alright guys the last piece of housekeeping bitcoin round 12 has officially kicked off uh kicked off on december first uh we all know git coin rounds uh they are the times where we can all donate towards these up-and-coming projects that need that support but the cool thing about git coin is that there is this massive matching pool so when you come and donate to projects and upstarts and different things that need your support client teams different defy apps that are just getting uh up and running uh the the your donations are matched but they are not matched linearly they are matched quadratically uh we've had kevin o'kee on the show before to talk about quadratic matching basically if you are donating to the same uh grants that many many other individuals are also donating to those individuals have outsized matching from this supply uh a matching pool there's also the brand new pool of crypto advocacy all funding efforts to advocate for crypto on capitol hill uh we just had a two-part panel yesterday on bank list came out on the podcast yesterday it's also on the youtube uh where we had some just big heavy hitters jake schravinski jerry britto brian quintens kristen from the blockchain association a number of other people uh to to really kick off this brand new advocacy round so if you want to move the needle in capitol hill go to getcoin.co check out the gatecoin rounds 12 matching round check out the crypto advocacy track and donate to some really cool projects on git coin yeah crypto advocacy is where it's at man didn't you guys like didn't get coin isn't in there like eight hundred thousand dollars not over nine hundred thousand now yeah nine hundred thousand just for the crypto advocacy round there's that still advocacy that's crazy crypto lobbying this is something that we need to do crypto is political whether we like it or not so we have to get involved that way david let's talk about prices though it's market time yeah bitcoin price bitcoin flat on the week a little bit up on the week started starting the week at 54 000. i hit a high 59 000 currently at 57 000 up about three to four percent on the week okay flat week okay how about eth how's heath tracking uh doing great start of the week at forty four hundred dollars hit a low of four thousand dollars right at the bottom of that uh coveted omicron scare which we're going to talk about um but then hit a high of four thousand seven hundred and eighty dollars and is now clocking in at four thousand five hundred dollars right now and currently is up eight percent on the week okay bitcoin flat but eth going up that has some ripple effects that means all eyes continue to be on the eth bitcoin ratio because that is doing things things we haven't seen in a while tell us about the ratio story here yeah so the ratio hit a new high for the first time in over three years uh and so hit that full chart view ryan the ratio started the week at point zero seven five and hit a high of point zero eight three point zero eight three and is currently coming in at point zero eight overall up eight percent on the week uh and again we have not seen these levels of the eth btc ratio since 2017 uh or maybe maybe late 2018 uh and so february it looks like 2018. when the eth btc ratio hits new highs to me this is what i tweeted out uh and i think my tweet is next ryan uh the eat btc ratio is the bull market signal when eth goes up versus bitcoin it's a signal of the bull market is ongoing um not necessarily prescriptive of future returns right like do we can't predict the future but really that when the east goes up versus btc it's a signal of the bull market and making new highs i'm saying that i think this is going to indicate a stronger continuation of the bull market into the future um a lot of the the youth people myself included are talking about my man if the eth btc ratio can just jump uh from from like point zero eight to point one like the flipping becomes real real close there is very little price discovery in bitcoin terms above these levels right now breaking a three-year all-time high is a really big deal and there's not much more left before ether actually breaks the complete and full all-time high which is just like in a flash of a pan claimed in 2017 at like point zero one or point one two i think um but uh it's a long time coming there's two things that jump out at me uh from this chart that we're looking at which is the ether bitcoin ratio um you know the first is uh we haven't been at this point in the ratio for very many days either right because when in 2017 it's kind of the ratio spiked above where it is right now that was relatively brief we're talking days right and then also uh in in the end of 2017 and 2019 uh 2018 when it did as well that was days as well i don't know how many days we've actually been above the ratio uh we are right now but it feels like not very much at all 16 17 18 you know less less than a month in terms of days so the that's pretty remarkable the other remarkable thing about this chart david is look at this look at this trough this trough of disillusionment between the end of 2018 and i guess the uh the end of uh 2020 where it was like bitcoin season it was like bitcoin coiners were everything is down only versus bitcoin that's what they said and that was the narrative and i i think um the thing about narratives is a lot of people sort of get biased by the most recent narrative and and sort of project that extrapolate that forward and so because that was the most popular narrative everything was bleeding against bitcoin the idea was nothing aside from bitcoin would would ever appreciate or ever ever retain value so what's interesting is the the the long i guess uh crawl through this trench this trough of disillusionment and then the like the spike up right like we are well above where we were and it this feels like i guess what i'm saying is it's a strong recovery on the bitcoin ratio so this is primed to do something and possibly continue increasing uh i hate that you're making me look at this chart can you click on click on my tweet so we can have like a real chart to look at there we go so look at that look at that so for the listeners if you grow and just zoom all the way out from 2016 to 2022 where we are now it is a solid upwards trend it went up really real fast from 2016 to 20 uh 17 and 18 because that's when like ether had this very early ico mania that was completely unsustainable and then that that just flash just like you know leveled off for the next like two years but after that in 2020 like it started to climb again and overall has been painting this very up into this right trend versus bitcoin its entire lifespan and this is why people were talking about the flipping before ethereum actually had its first block mind some people like read the ethereum white paper and they were like oh yeah this is going to flip in bitcoin no one will say tell you when because no one actually knows the ethbtc trading pair is extremely hard to trade and predict um but but damn does this chart just look good um ryan i did some ta actually i'm not really much of a ta person but if you want to go on to the tweet that i followed this up at uh you can just exit out of this picture and then scroll down uh i did some ta there it is yeah it's a it's a solid green arrow to the right this is fantastic this is the kind of quality ta that bankless subscribers sign up for here that's exactly right so i actually counted the number of weeks that um ether has been higher in bitcoin terms 12 weeks only 12 weeks of price history out of ethereum's like six years of existence has the ratio ever been higher has the ratio between bitcoin and ether okay so it wasn't days it was weeks it was probably you know three three months or so but how big would this be if like this has never happened in history just like why we're talking about this so much is bitcoin has never been flippant in the history of bitcoin it is the og coin and so if this does happen you can expect not just people like us not just crypto media and people on you know crypto twitter and in these circles we'll be talking about it the entire world will be talking about it the entire world knows bitcoin as crypto but when something else takes the number one spot that will people will reconsider what it means to be crypto absolutely so that will ripple out and i think that's uh that's definitely something to watch david we are preparing some of our uh predictions for 2022 as well i know on bank list we're going to publish this toward the end of the month i'm wondering if one of your predictions is going to be a flipping in 2022. are you gonna call that oh uh i think it's a greater than 50 chance yeah so do i yeah so do i it's really hard to have conviction about the eth btc ratio because like i said it really like if you people that trade the ef btc ratio generally just get absolutely worked it's one of the hardest things to trade in crypto uh yeah and and predicting the flipping is also really really hard but man are we real we're just predicting when it's going to happen right is the hard part right yes it's like okay well if you if you predict it i will say i'm not so sure and i won't predict it and that way one of us is right and that would think this is always right that's how we mean well let's talk about the dpi uh total locked sorry let's talk about d5 pulse and total locked value in d5 that's at 108 billion so we're still above 100 billion that's feeling pretty good that's feeling healthy too uh how about the d5 pulse index here's a seven day view it didn't have the week that ether did no no it's it's uh down down a little bit versus the dollar started at 360 ended at 330. still not defy season i i'm curious about your predictions for for ipvi abstaining any dpi related well just tell me about this let's get that sharp the dpi to eat index okay so this is another ratio that we track on bankless rollups cracking it dpi to eth man we have to look you can't be mad about this i know you're an eighth bull you can't be mad about this why does this why does this ratio uh bring you so much pain david first what is it yeah this is make you say it this is the ratio between the aggregate of defy tokens and ether not all defy tokens kind of the the the og defy tokens okay makers and unit swap sushi swap um and just defy has just not been catching a bid versus ether ether is ultrasound money and d5 tokens are not and people are really just believing in that difference i guess we are clocking in at 0.074 i believe it was .08 last week i guess we did our ultrasound money job too well david yeah that's why this is happening but here's here's a sure way to win is you bet on all three a little bit of bitcoin a little bit of eath a little bit of dpi a third a third a third and that forms the bed index so what are we looking at on bed on the uh on the week here yeah started last week at 177 dollars ended this week at roughly 165 dollars so a little bit down on the week a little bit down on bed that is a secure way to uh to get exposure into the crypto monies and also defy each have their seasons right sometimes as bitcoin season sometimes just heath season sometimes it's a d5 season and the bankless bed index allows you to get exposure to all three of those things uh let's talk a little bit more about uh about thanksgiving though right so this is a chart from blockworks uh actually i think they they um maybecrypto.com is is the source of this and they said show this chart to your crypto skeptical family members this is a chart of 1990s internet adoption david so it's internet versus crypto and there's a green line and a blue line the green line is internet users over time tracking from like 1990 to the year 2000 and the blue line is total crypto users these are both measured in millions and what's interesting is the blue line is tracking the green line right on top of it it's right on top of it so what this is saying is like something that we've said a lot is crypto is the internet of money and it is tracking the adoption of the internet in the way the internet spread in the 1990s i think this is a useful way to help your family understand crypto to be honest because everyone lived through the 90s right at you know maybe not everyone but like lots of people remember the internet transformation and what that looked like and so if you're looking for an analogy you just say look crypto is the internet of money and it is getting adopted like the internet was remember how fast that happened remember how much transformation occurred as a result of that well crypto is going to do that except for scarce things property things money in a different way i think it's a useful analogy to help people understand it and it's interesting that the numbers are tracking but when we were talking about this agenda david you were also a little bit disappointed at this graph right right yeah like i want crypto to be adopted faster than the internet because crypto is on top of the internet and the internet's already been adopted so when i see crypto being adopted at the same rate of the internet i'm like god like why are we so slow like let's pick up the page what's the stake what is taking so long what's why do you think it's taking so i so first of all this makes me hyper bullish i don't like i you know to get to this point in crypto is frankly amazing right it's like we lived through the internet to have a second revolution that was uh on the same order of magnitude as the internet is just incredible like this is beyond my wildest dreams and super excited about this very bullish about this but to your point you know crypto had the internet to propagate itself so why is it not propagating faster what do you think is holding crypto back when you look at this not not only did it have the internet but also had the financial incentive to adopt it like crypto pays you to adopt it so like where is the juice like where's the steroids i thought i kind of always thought the crypto would be the internet just on steroids granted we are not like you know disrupting the internet we're disrupting legacy financial institutions and people seem to be a lot more skeptical about crypto than they were the internet uh and maybe that's because the nature of crypto has the the nature of money in inside of it people generally are skeptical with value um they're like oh buy bitcoin like oh you're just trying to take my money um but do you know what one take here though is like i don't think the um look the internet the institutions adopted the internet almost immediately right it's like the us policy was pro internet you know corporate policy was like we have to get go on the internet we have to do dot coms all of these things i think crypto has been interestingly enough more a bottom up movement in some ways than the internet what i mean is like established institutions haven't seen the value proposition right the banking industry adopted the internet but the banking industry has been super slow to adopt crypto why because they're being disrupted by crypto right even like extrapolate that to governments and central banks maybe they're also worried that they're going to be adopted by crypto so we haven't had the institutional support that a legacy institutional support that the internet has had uh what's your take on that and what what else do you think's holding us back yeah yeah that makes sense uh the fact that it's a bottom-up system i think also lends itself to why it could have been adopted faster because like bottom-up systems are just like organic and nature's really really good at spreading um granted this is in log so this is a log scale and so like deviations are actually really really compressed in this chart but like damn are those lines right on top of each other um at some point i don't really know we'll just have to wait for it to figure to figure itself out the story is not over but basically what i'm saying is like i'm bullish i just wanted to be hyper bullish and i can only be bullish like i wish i was more bullish wow you uh yeah that that's um spoken like someone who's gotten used to a lot of bullishness lately you're spoiled sir you are spoiled uh let's talk about this uh omnicron what is this this is a story of uh okay omicron yeah so this is uh this is a covid variant maybe you should explain that and it did kind of tank the markets a little bit like you know both stock markets and crypto okay so let's talk about that and then also we're seeing like meme tokens right uh number go up as a result which i don't understand what's uh what's the story here yeah so the omicron variant was discovered in south america it's apparently a new variant and south africa right uh yeah south africa uh and you know apparently more transmissible apparently more contagious we don't really know there's not a lot of data out there but the markets just read the headlines new uh coveted variant and just got super super spooked and i was just so dumbfounded by this market reaction because it happened in the legacy markets it also happened in crypto and i'm like guys we've we've seen this story before first off like we're way more prepared like we already know what cove it is we already have vaccines we already have testing centers we already have like have global mask adoption by some people um and so like why are people more scared about another like covered variant like the way the cove is going to get work is just we're going to it's going to just morph into the common cold and we're gonna get a bunch of booster shots over and over and over again like this is how this works so like new variants are totally to be expected and like and then the markets dumped as if like it was gonna be pandemic 2.0 all over again forgetting about the last time that mark is dumped we just printed a bunch of money like the whole market reaction was totally nonsensical to me and some so many people got really really bearish like i just did not get it uh so i was not bearish so i i was not bearish in the slightest you know i tweeted out like if you if you sold the omicron variant news slap yourself we're going to 10k uh and then people followed up it's like david no we're going to 20k i'm like oh yeah you're right um and meanwhile this completely unrelated but also interesting part of the story is there's this random token that i had no idea existed called omicron and it pumps like 200 percent because of the omicron variant is this a token that existed pre-omicron variant it was just like yes through happenstance correct there was just a coincidence of the names and the like and this just started pumping and i think like this is kind of just a small little like microcosm of just the world's the state of the world at large people just like to invest in memes like oh oh the word omicron is in the news let me go to time to coin gecko type in omicron and buy the first token that comes up like fundamentals just don't matter for a like a decent portion of the population anymore and so like welcome welcome to the meme economy like the words that are in the news are going to be turned into tokens that are going to pump like we saw this with doge like this is it's the meme economy welcome to the meme economy so the do you think this is going to happen with other news items and other kind of memes that propagate they're all going to have tokens that will like temporarily pump just like because traders are going to be like oh the word omicron's in the news a bunch i'm going to go buy the omicron token because other people are thinking of the word omicron what is omicron i don't know like what was it it doesn't even matter originally yeah well um good job sorry to the omicron omicron yeah omicron users like you know you just got your your payday there it was a you know lucky event um let's talk about this too cro token has been on an absolute tear this is crypto.com chronos chain token uh it's just locked up 1 billion total locked value token has jumped 350 percent crypto.com has recently i believe got naming rights for a major sports arena too that might be part of yeah yeah part of this but uh this chain seems to be very much like a kind of a it's a it's a proof of proof-of-stake finance type chain from a crypto bank right um kind of eat killer or side chain whatever your perspective is on that and it's very much uh you know sidechain season i guess eath killer season so we're seeing a pump here anything else that uh proof of extraordinary consensus mechanism even of course it's not even they must not be doing any sort of decentralization theater unlike the other ones they're like oh yeah no this is like a consortium blockchain we own this thing i gotta be honest like so i understand cro token as sort of a a loyalty token if you're a crypto.com user right and that does have some value but like the its value as it relates to this side chain i don't really understand it's uh it's just to be in the club in my mind like oh people are building chains and issuing tokens like oh we have the crypto.com url like we can do the same thing in the url the value of the url can sustain the whole entire ecosystem that's what's my in my mind what's happening yeah absolutely in my mind that the entire business is just centered around the url right right well i mean they like they are doing a lot in the space like they have partnerships with visa um i've actually used the crypto.com card like it works it's cool but it's it's kind of an example of sort of a a crypto bank play on this and like it's in my mind it's co-opting crypto yeah it's it's definitely yeah i hear that too um let's talk about eth a little bit so this is a tweet from chris clay says so eth has surpassed every global bank's market cap and you're still not sure if this whole blockchain crypto thing is here to stay this is a chart of eth versus jp morgan versus bank of america versus icbc and wells fargo and cm bank and all the banks that you love to hate ethereum is on top with 550 billion the next closest is jp morgan with 480 billion at this point i feel like calling it two right like guys wake up to ethereum crypto is bigger than all of them you feel like calling it ryan i'm just like no i think you know i felt like this for a while i suppose david but like yeah this is now it's self-evident now it's like maybe maybe i'm at the point of a zen where i don't even feel like i have to explain this exasperation by people who don't get it yeah yeah i'm just like okay well like explain this chart then how about how about rather than me explain crypto how about you explain why ethereum market cap is larger than all the banks start from there explain that right and then we'll have a discussion about it i feel like a bit more like that maybe it's maybe it's vindication that i'm feeling i won't be satisfied until ethereum market cap is bigger than all the banks combined and then we can say that ether is undervalued just not misunderstood like oh people now understand ethereum it's now now it's in the realm of some sort of fair evaluation it's still low but at least people understand it that's that's where i'm at it's just a fad david just a fad let's talk about this uh another cool fad i suppose is ether on exchanges hitting a three-year low so as the the ratio the ether bitcoin ratio hits the three-year high we're seeing a low on the amount of eth on exchanges and that's bullish why is that bullish david because if any institution or any like newcomer wants to buy ether they got to do it on exchanges and so the lower of each supply on exchanges the more dollar in a dollar has on the impact of eth price when it is bought on exchanges um and so this is just going into any sort of just new inflows have has outsized impact upon ethe price uh bullish bullish i'm really bullish also also bullish on going bankless as well it's like more of this more more of this eth becomes non-custodial the better for the bankless journey guys we will be right back with the release of the week we're going to talk about the hot news items and of course get to the takes and the memes but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lido's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started all right guys we are back with the releases of the week the first is this starkware david we're just talking to starkware last week about starknet and now here it is it's launched what is in stark net give us the tldr yeah so think uh optimism just like they they have their optimistic roll up and arbitrarium they have their optimistic optimistic roll up as well uh starknet is a zk roll up and we've seen zk roll-ups before but this one is different in that it is the public permissionless censorship resistant version of what starkware has to offer so this is the one single roll-up where everyone can permissionsly come and deploy on starknet uh zk rollups um they are much more complicated than optimistic roll-ups but also a lot faster and a lot cheaper because of the power of zero knowledge cryptography starcnet alpha the first implementation of that is live on mainnet so this is the first of a number of roll out progressions in this dark net story uh and so zk evm is now here on ethereum which is really really awesome congratulations to the starkware team we had them on the show recently if you missed that episode you gotta go watch it it's another bullish episode absolutely and these are all of course gener this is a general purpose they didn't quite call it a chain but like we call it a chain yeah for short it's and so it can run essentially something like the evm and so you can have multiple applications interacting you preserve that composability and the more apps that join starknet the cheaper the transactions get so how about that for a virtuous cycle yeah the more users and more applications that are on starknet the cheaper the per user transaction gets that is not something that you can ever find on an l1 that's one of the beauties of l2 is that costs are amortized across all the users so the more more users that use it the cheaper the transactions get rather than like the l1s of of crypto where the more people that use it the more expensive the transactions get this is what why we call it inverting the blockchain trilemma another piece of content that you need to watch if you haven't watched it is uh super scaling uh with ultra ultra scalability ethereum is that what we called it yeah the ultra scalable ethereum absolutely yeah this is uh super scaling with starkware was the the the other episode you're thinking of the starkware folks you know what's so funny is when we're talking about hey when are zk ups coming when's this feature functionality they co the co-founders of starkware were like uh guys it's here yeah like we're delivering it like next week it's happening and then over the next six months this is gonna get smoother and smoother and smoother until maybe you don't even know you're on a roll up at all so uh super exciting there um also this argent is maybe launching on starknet before the end of the year i believe yep this is what i saw that hint as well somebody was saying all i want for christmas is argent on starkwear and argent responded in a tweet your wish shall be granted so uh some time before christmas guys santa's coming all right uh let's talk about this too tornado cash moving to arbitram what does this mean yeah tornado cast which is an eath mixer in case you are docs and want to undox yourself for whatever reasons uh you can now do it in a much cheaper fashion on arbitrary tornado cache is generally a gas intensive application on the ethereum l1 but now it's on arbitrary so you can get your privacy on arbitrary privacy solutions coming to ethereum another one to watch is aztec the aztec protocol of course that is whole a zk roll up that is dedicated to privacy but i'm really glad to see some of these privacy solutions continuing to be pursued by by the ethereum network um bancor 3 has just released the third version of bankrupt these are one of the original automated market makers they had a big ico in 2017 and they've continued to plug away at this protocol what's new in the release david uh a bunch of new things they have impermanent loss protection which they already had i think in bancor 2 but maybe that's updated and tweaked um there is l2 support there so there's uh bancor on layer twos and they also have an omni pool that allows for all trades on the network to occur in a single transaction probably some gas efficiencies and some trading efficiencies there as well as a number of other features as well so check out the link in the show notes to get the full digest of bancor 3. this is cool too gnosis making some moves here so they have a token called gno there's also a side chain called x-die that i've used before and i'm sure you've used as well it's the first skytrain i've ever used yeah yeah 2018 or something is it is so it i think it started as a proof of authority sidechain maybe move to sort of a proof-of-stake type of side chain anyway it's kind of been overshadowed i feel like recently by the polygons of the world and and some of the other sidechain type solutions i'm not sure exactly why but uh there is a proposal from one of the the co-founders of of gnosis martin koppelman who is actually proposing a merger between xdi and gno and what i think they are doing david is they're putting together sort of a almost like an eth2 test net so it's like a beacon chain uh type of environment that is going to provide eth2 like functionality with a bit more centralization okay so it won't be nearly as decentralized as ethereum main net but it'll almost operate as kind of a i guess a staking side chain like uh to ethereum and the idea is they're going to propel i guess you know the development track of ethereum clients and and sort of be have a relationship that way anyway this is this is a governance proposal so this has not happened yet but was interesting nonetheless and caught our attention this week what else would you add yeah there i think we're really just gonna have to wait and see really what the what happens with this and what the utility of this uh side chain actually would do um i wouldn't there is some things to be concerned about because since there is a brand new token that's securing this sidechain uh that kind of does like uh you know what sazzle on uh the daily great put it nicely uh splits the communities right so you have the one token validating the side chain and the ether token validating ethereum and there's a difference there uh and that's my what you meant by like a split token right it's like so one is for one chain and it doesn't actually informally link it to ethereum in any particular way yeah there's some disalignment there when you have something like this and but people said this about polygon as well in the early days and they've managed to say it's kind of socially connected to ethereum yeah the difference there is that polygon actually has economic uh economic slashing for any malicious activity between the bridge and that polygon staking is actually occurring on the ethereum l1 not on the polygon side chain uh and i believe that if this by understanding this correctly is that the the x diagnosis side chain will will not have staking on the ethereum main chain it'll be its own independent self-sovereign system uh and also polygon is very very committed to zk roll ups which by definition are hooked right into ethereum itself so there is some differences there yeah it's interesting though because also uh you know martin and the team at gnosis have been very socially plugged into ethereum right very socially connected so we'll have to see what this project evolves but i like the experimentation of it and i think it's cool to kind of resurrect uh xdi in a new way and see where that goes let's talk about some raises david celsius crypto banks are raising they just got a series b 400 million dollars is over subscribed so actually i think maybe they were asking for 400 million they got 750 million wow not sure how that works wow but uh it's a lot of money for crypto banks these days any takes that is a lot of money yeah why is celsius so highly valued like i mean i haven't used it but it's just isn't it just like defy products but in c5 form 3.5 i mean yes sir that's what it is it's 3.25 billion uh and look it's it's kind of a crypto bank right borrowing and lending right your uh your tokens and your bitcoin your eth all right and there's a lot of value in that but i bet you they're gonna buy a stadium they probably should right join the club join crypto how about this fire blocks man i feel like they just raised so we had the founder of fire blocks on i don't know had to be less than six months ago and they had just come off a raise now here's another raise i don't remember what the previous race was but i feel like it was like a two billion dollar valuation it was multiple billions maybe now it's an eight billion dollar evaluation okay and they just raised 400 million dollars fire blocks of course provides kind of institutional friendly defy they provide the custody layer and the apis so institutions can hook into the crypto experience and particularly in d5 so it's a really interesting company from that perspective and uh another crazy race this is a series e david so i don't know how many letters of the alphabet we get until you go public but like we're already on e so on july 27th they raised 310 million dollars for a two billion dollar valuation now they are raising 400 million dollars for uh sorry again eight billion dollar valuation so they yeah yeah 4x they forex their market capital crypto is absolutely tearing right now i don't know does that make you worried are you worried about a lot of money out there remember how much money we printed it was in the trillions god money has become meaningless i suppose it's not crypto that's the bubble it's it's it's money that's meaningless one inch network just closes 175 million dollars in their series b they're moving instant into institutional customers as well that will really change like one inch was kind of like a i guess a kind of a niche defy um project in the beginning it looks like they're really scaling up for institutions really commercializing you know it's like last experience i've had with with one inch i actually couldn't use it because i was based in the us right you had to like turn a vpn on or something like this before you could connect uh but this is a pretty massive valuation as well what do you make of this it's interesting when i see teams raising that also have a token like intuitively you kind of want to say well you only get to pick one like either you raise or you do a token but you oh yeah that's don't you don't get to do both but actually that's just like kind of the gut reaction you can totally do both because nothing's stopping you um but you do have to ask like where is the value being captured because if there's a centralized private entity and then a public traded token where's the value gonna go um but this is are you starting to worry about this right it's kind of like it's kind of like uh cro and crypto.com right yeah it's some equity holders pay attention to i'm not yet concerned about i think it's just going to be an interesting subject matter with tokens where like tokens don't actually have any regulatory commitments like you don't actually have any investor rights as a token owner there's just the token on the blockchain and that does whatever it does and then there's a centralized company that can do whatever it does um so like you know tbd on what the dynamics behind private equity and public tokens are like but again there's no actual limits as to why you can't do both just intuitively it seems kind of weird but again it's just like you know we'll just got to experiment it seems like the higher risk maybe higher return but definitely higher risk asset particularly if there's a centralized company involved so it's a centralized company and it also has a token right like at least if you're buying equity in that company you have some sort of legal right yes if you just have a token what do you actually own you just have a token so maybe that goes up higher you know zooms in the in the bull run but when things turn that's got to be the riskier asset uh we'll have to see how all that plays out david um this is a raise from a former wall street banker who just launched a 1.5 billion dollar crypto venture fund this reminds me of 2 2017 a little bit too where everyone was launching a fund this is someone from a fund called hive mind capital partners a former citigroup executive so former banker matt zhang has launched this fund and he takes here yeah so i think there's two quick takes here this is an example as to why crypto doesn't fix you know wealth distribution uh wealthy people can just take their wealth and buy crypto with it and they are still wealthy and now they're in crypto but the what it does fix is long-term incentives and so getting uh wealthy people into the world of crypto makes them abide by our rules and our values while crypto is not a panacea for fixing wealth distribution wealth inequality in the world it does actually force people onto the same equal playing fields which is something that we can't say about the tradfy world if they adopt crypto they adopt crypto values uh we say this often on bankless speaking of crypto values let's talk about jobs imagine having a job that aligned with your crypto values if you're listening to bank lists which i know you are then you probably have crypto values like us so uh go check out the job board if you want to make the full-time commitment make the leap look look towards 2022 what are you going to be doing in 2022 you'll be sitting at a corporate job are you going to look and see what's available in crypto there's lots you could do here here's a senior back-end engineer from smart d5 product manager as well as an accountant from smart d5 that's pretty diverse senior software engineer at popcorn community ecosystem lead at dydx crypto research analyst you got to be an nft specialist for this also a smart contract research analyst and a governance specialist at bitwise a head of growth at dex guru technical lead at draft league head of ethereum research and immutable head of tokens at immutable as well community manager dexable lead engineer hat stop finance community manager ia granum cto e agronom the senior back end engineer smart d5 guys those are a lot of jobs and we just scratched the surface okay there's a whole list here go check out the bankless job board sign up for that get these jobs posted to you in your email address so you're first to know and get a job in crypto get a goddamn job anyway all right let's talk news david big news item of the week we promised this uh jack dorsey ceo of twitter also ceo of square he's like a co-ceo he just resigned from twitter here's his letter very transparent he posts on twitter as is fitting uh and yeah what do you make of this jack dorsey gone from twitter feels like he is maybe committing full-time to square which now has a new name david that's the new name square has a new name called block because it wants to lean in towards blockchain infrastructure uh and uh square crypto is now called spiral uh so jack is really just like leaving twitter i think to really double down on i mean in jack for jack it's it's bitcoin uh for square crypto is called square crypto but it's with jack leading it it's really about bitcoin um and there's been a bunch of speculation as to well why did jack leave twitter did he really want to actually do this or was he kindly asked to leave because he was uh putting up frictions for twitter putting up web adopting web three things uh jack is a famous bitcoin maximalist he really only cares about bitcoin he has publicly retweeted tweets calling ethereum a scam uh and really only believes in bitcoin and you know all these web two companies twitter especially all kind of see web3 on the horizon and see this wave of adoption happening and so the speculation from the ethereum people who who have the ethereum bias and so they are just biased towards thinking this is that jack dorsey got pushed out because he wasn't adopting web three do you you know the interesting thing though i feel like saying jack you can run but you can't hide do you know why like so you just named square block okay like you didn't name it bitcoin square really can't square it faces the same dilemma that twitter does which is if if jack does take square in the bitcoin maximalist direction which he kind of has so far we'll have to see what happens next he's gonna miss out on all the cool defy stuff right right i mean we had visa on we had anc we had uh anchorage on we were talking about the d5 mullet and fintech and visa and it's all like it's stable coins right where square's a payments company and people don't pay with bitcoin they pay with stable coins that are on ethereum like what like lightning just it's not gonna happen whole fraction of of kind of the blocks so it it's gonna continue chasing him there i think let's talk about the new person who's taking over for jack because that's important look twitter is a a very important um a platform so the new person i think was uh jax number two um uh prague agarwal um he is a champion at twitter so five things about him this is a coindesk story he was the leading force in twitter's decentralization projects i'm not sure how much progress they actually made but there was a project at twitter called bluesky just kind of protocolized twitter uh so maybe he's an advocate there he also led twitter's migration to cloud services he's very concerned about the ethics of tech uh which is sort of interesting because as a website company you have to it's refreshing but also like i mean i'm kind of at the i very much feel like protocols should be as credibly neutral as possible and actually shouldn't be injecting political bias into their platform and it's it's interesting that like twitter has had a i guess a recent run of what some would say uh kind of erosion of free speech and just earlier this week they actually uh banned the ability for uh individuals to pa to post public images without consent so unless you're a public figure if i just you know take a photo of you david and i post on twitter that's like a a bannable offense a sensorable type of fence which is somewhat interesting right so like when you have to kind of make these pictures by the way okay can i get that in writing sir because i don't want to get in trouble yeah he also rose up quickly in twitter's ranks he doesn't use uh twitter very much but i i think part of the the summary from from this new ceo is i think he'll be very friendly web three right so like the nft initiatives the ethereum initiatives that's like full steam ahead and maybe it needed jack to kind of set step aside to your point for for this to really take off so it's you know i think it's bullish for nfts and web 3 from that perspective hopefully hopefully hopefully we're just not reading it into it it's just too much hopefully we will see uh square becoming blocked though like okay facebook becoming meta square becoming block what's next man i don't know what's alphabet going to become uh constitution dial it's gonna it's shut down we've reported on that we talked about that last week they raised 50 million dollars almost to buy the constitution a copy of the constitution now they shut down because something crazy happened okay which is their people token which was a people which was a token associated with this project has been mooning yeah do you know why no can you tell me because i sold right before that happened sir or i redeemed i was like so like going to thanksgiving i was like ah i want to get everything off my plate don't have to worry about this thing and you know i had a little bit of funds in the constitution doubt because that you know that was fun there's a really interesting thing and i was like i just i'll withdraw this biggest mistake i've made this year this month the week of the week okay it's only because the people token started moving for god knows why wha what reason yeah it's memes back to what you're saying with this omnicron yeah right just because it can i don't know what do you think why is it moving i have no clue i have no clue yeah what is this reinforcing you for me it reinforces that like i still know nothing in the short run in crypto as far as what's gonna happen crypto will always surprise you like i had no way to predict this neither anyone else uh let's talk about eip 4488 this is a new eip we talked about this a little bit briefly on the last roll-up but what is this david yeah this is a proto-lambda a very very long-time eth developer now also working on the optimism team and also with the ultrasound money emojis in his header uh and he goes i support eip4488 let's make rollups cheaper let me explain what this is about it goes technical tldr eip4488 reduces the call data gas cost from 16 to 3 gas per byte with a cap on call data per block to meet great security risks end user tldr is that rollups cost overhead decreases thus lowering l2 fees so basically we talked about this last week this was a rebalancing of uh training of gas and we haven't actually really talked about how gas is calculated but there are arbitrary values associated to certain calculations that comes up with it with what a gas cost is and we can tinker with those numbers in order to to balance the economic resources of the network and eip 4488 reduces the cost of call data which is something that roll ups all definitely use very very heavily from 16 to 3. and so really this is ethereum executing on its rollup centric roadmap uh from the gym from the get-go by making uh by really just like uh allowing us to take off the brakes on roll-ups so roll-up transactions just become meaningfully cheaper and also therefore faster and yeah and so that's what eip-4488 is all about you know what i find so endlessly fascinating about this this is this reminds me of just um like like public policy uh changes to incent a specif a certain behavior like the government does this all the time with its tax policy right so if you want more corn right you provide a subsidy for corn you want more dairy provided dairy subsidy right you encourage this behavior you subsidize it economically this is the ethereum protocol encouraging migration to roll-ups encouraging users and usage to get off of layer one and to move over to uh roll-ups in a big way uh so what what's your take on this you like do you support this i mean there are some trade-offs david which is one is um it does kind of increase block size right and um so this could if if without further solutions in the future this could make nodes a bit more difficult to run for individual users which obviously can't go unchecked or you have another problem are you pro eip 448a or no um i mean the pros and cons are definitely like way more technical than i can get into by proto-lambda i think as a proxy for me as a delegate of my beliefs uh i if he supports it then i 100 support it um and we've seen ethereum uh measure have measured increases in block space plenty of times before um and you block the quick trivia fact is that i think the ethereum block space is over like three to four times higher than it was at genesis because our clients got more efficient our network got more efficient things just improved and so ethereum is actually like three to four times more scaled than it started at genesis because we were able to measuredly and responsibly and sustainably increase block space and so sure let's just do it again there you go that's david's sake uh mahalo this is um about uniswap and polygon what's uh what's happening here yeah so last week the polygon uh proposal to onboard uniswap onto polygon had overwhelming support that vote did in fact pass so they are moving on to the second phase of the governance process uh which is a temperature check pull uh and then there's another phase after that there's just a lot of hurdles but we're on to the second one so polygon uh perhaps eventually getting una swap once it goes it's gonna happen right i mean i had overwhelming support so it's it's definitely gonna happen uh do you know yesterday the time people read this would be the beacon chain birthday happy birthday proof of stake on ethereum was born and do you remember that call when we were on as that was launching it was uh it was a lot of fun yeah my roommate chewed me out for waking him up because it was at like four in the morning well he wasn't as excited as you were and now i live alone bye roommate sorry uh well vitalik put together a happy birthday beacon chain post with a handy road map and this is really interesting this is the road map for ethereum in the future this most consolidated road map i think i've seen and it comes complete with timelines and there are really five things going on that are going to happen with ethereum one is the merge i have to okay i'll just read them fast the merge the surge the verge the perch and then the splurge okay and this is like memetic as well because you know it's crypto the merge we've talked about so often that that happens next year proof of stake uh becomes the consensus layer proof of work goes away uh the surge is data sharding yep the verge is perfect merkle trees vertical trees so providing more stateless uh ways to run a node right so it's easier for users to run a node again each of these by the way are like efforts to continue decentralizing the network right the proof of stake and also data availability and the verge too the purge this is eliminating historical data and technical debt i'm a bit more fuzzy on this and then the splurge seems like it's everything that's left over just all the you know cherries on top and the bits of pieces that are going to be important in the future of ethereum uh yeah what what do you make this roadmap uh it's just really really nice to see everything all in one spot vitalik of all people is one of the few people that actually has the ability to kind of have this bird's eye view upon everything uh these progress bars that you're seeing are definitely just completely subjective from the brain of vitalik but vitalik's just known to be good at stuff like this uh and so it's just nice to see like what is all left to do and it's kind of overwhelming how much there is left to do uh and there's and it is nice to see that all these pro progress is happening in so many different directions at once but like ethereum has always had this very very ambitious road map and you know while we get to the merge soon and then data shards after that those are kind of close there's still so much left to do there's there's statelessness there's stateless clients there's meta transactions there's zk snarking the whole entire blockchain my god that sounds hard and complicated i'm glad i'm not the one having to do that but i'll just talk about it along the way but yeah there's a lot left to do and and this is cool the the when we had justin drake on on our first episode with him the moon math cryptography episode he talked about how ethereum is just like this cryptographer's playground uh and so like cryptography finally has a place to actually get meaningfully implemented and put into practice and that's why ethereum has attracted so many deep cryptographers because ethereum needs cryptography and that's also one of the big things that really separates ethereum from every other ecosystem is all the cryptographers are here and our industry is based on cryptography i will remind you it's called cryptocurrency for a reason uh and uh the all like useful bits of cryptography are eventually becoming integrated into ethereum in this roadmap do you know what what what hits me with this roadmap too is um i i feel like um there's roadmap has never been more clear so it's yes it's always been incredibly ambitious but it's never been as solidified and clear as it has been in in 2020 right one i feel i feel like we've gotten that clarity so like i remember back in 2017 2018 i was like pining for a road map like like what's gonna happen and when and how is this all going to work and it just like it wasn't available at the time it's like oh yeah we're going to have proof of sake in the future okay okay how like yeah what are the details yeah what is that like sharding cool sharding like what more details please this is incredible progress and uh that makes me bullish as well um so the ethereum roadmap has never been more clear uh budweiser did it beer.eth in the in their twitter handle they've owned beer.east for a while but now that's right i forgot about that now it's in their twitter handle uh wow what does that mean so can we send budweiser smith give him some money totally yeah they send us some beer probably yeah that's nice advisor i don't want any beer from budweiser personally but that's the right answer well that's cool man it's like a huge brand though budweiser is like the brand of beer uh and one of the major ones uh i wonder if we'll we'll see others following suits pretty cool they're putting in their handle how many how many followers uh wow yeah what weird only 202 230 000 followers yeah yeah you have something like that david oh yeah yeah you close that way more than that way more than that my all has more than that it's what's this uh a month for ens what's happening yeah so this is just a summary of the activity on ens brantley summons it up nicely 90 000 new eth registrations in november all on the ethereum l1 uh 7.6 million in protocol revenue so like when you buy an eth domain from ens it goes to now the ens dow so the ens dow got 7. million dollars in each revenue this last month uh and then 99 of open c volume uh ens trading activity is on open seat uh so that's pretty crazy and now there are 200 000 unique individual owners with an ens name this is the token effect david probably definitely the token effect defining the token effect as funny as like like i feel like uh brantley's gotten a lot more popular too like post token effect right like i'm seeing like i just think uh communities rally around tokens people it's just what happens injects energy into whatever you're doing tokens are the place that communities can deposit energy and attention and alignment into without a token there is no coherence tokens align communities i mean bradley's always been cool he's just got like post token man yeah but now he's token brown he's hitting it token friendly tokenbrantly.e really hope you're listening uh this is a psa watch out for front ends i think front ends can become centralization vectors and this is a tweet from bandag saying anyone know when eunice the uniswap front end has started snitching on users that's some harsh language but uh what the the app is saying is it's actually notifying you this is the uniswap front end app it's saying the app securely connects your wallet address and shares it with trm labs incorporated for risk and compliance reasons okay trm labs it looks like they are some sort of apparatus that collects information for risk and compliance which basically means for the government uh i don't know if this is for the irs if this is for the sec who this is for what compliance what risk this is covering but that is happening on the uniswap front end and i expect teams that are based in various jurisdictions uniswap of course is based in the us to be like arm twisted into doing this sort of thing on their front ends of course this doesn't affect the smart contracts right the underlying smart it's not uniswap this is the uniswap labs the centralized company their website yeah this is that's a huge distinction why don't you get into what that distinction means right so we have the uniswap smart contracts on ethereum which allow anyone to swap tokens through their liquidity through their their factory contracts the front end a very of a very large number of websites allow make it easy for users to use those smart contracts because no one's actually going and writing the code themselves we have these front ends that do it for us uniswap spun up the first one but there's plenty of others there's one on zappers at front end xerion is a front end all the dex aggregators can tap into uniswap so they count as a front end there's infinite front ends for unit swap but the uniswap labs version of the front end collects your wall address for compliance reasons uh and like you know what's interesting ryan is like there used to be there was a time where the unit swap labs front end also like banned a bunch of tokens and also banned a bunch of countries and then the bitcoin maxies were like see we told you una swap was centralized not understanding the difference between the front end and the contracts and now this time maybe maybe this hasn't made it into bitcoin or circles yet or maybe they've just given a tag someone oh yeah tag anthony pompliano uh but like you know usually this would get some sort of attention from bitcoin you're talking about oh like oh i knew ethereum was centralized um this one hasn't i think they're feeling a little defeated on the ratio maybe i think out of their sales i think they have are fully relegated into into gold bugs but anyway so that used to happen all the time for those that are new to crypto uh no longer happening now because people i think are understanding the difference between a centralized website and an application on ethereum yeah that's important and i think this is an important psa and i also think it's it's sort of a reminder that you know centralization aggregation you know centralized websites can become vectors for this sort of thing right and they're going to so we we've we've kind of decentralized the protocol we've decentralized the money robots and that's all good that's all smart contract code we have more work to do in crypto to make sure our front ends remain decentralized as well and of course anyone can spin up a front end this is not stopping anyone but you know having the ability to have like decentralized storage decentralized compute sort of layers is going to be incredibly important and that's kind of where we're journeying because things tend to centralize unless you actively push against that force of gravity uh let's talk about this nft land amc sony they're launching nft rewards for the spider-man movie launch david i'm seeing this in theaters man i'm a big spiderman fan i know look you are seeing my movie and peter parker yeah yeah but like you don't watch the new ones right oh sure you're not new spider-man you do okay i've seen this in theaters apparently there's an nft associated with this uh it's on the wax blockchain it's kind of a an nft side chain but what's interesting to me is like are all movies going to start having nft releases like why not of course they are what do you think i remember when we were talking with uh diogo and kai from our uh visa anchorage podcast where they talked about how like the volatility of crypto actually is really really attractive for a lot of companies because the volatility of crypto makes a lot of their users open up their app and check it out oh yeah that was such a good point yeah and so like nfts nfts are just engagement magnets it boosts engagement it boosts engagement like for for some reason and this is why everyone is like macy's day parade had nfts it boosts engagement yeah it's like it's like we're just talking about token token brantley what about token spider-man right right he's way better than the overdue spider-man he's token spider-man token peter parker yeah that's yeah so like all all big movies are like it's trending towards just like oh and we will issue tokens during the box office office weekends because that's what people want i guess there's token engagement yeah that's interesting and everyone's gonna follow suit we'll have to see how that that progresses i'm gonna see the movie i'm not gonna get this nft because like oh how exhausting too many nfts man uh this is ross ulbrick this is an nft to watch though okay so uh people probably familiar with ross's story maybe not actually give him the short form and then he's starting an nft auction in two days from jail is that what's happening okay yeah so his mom is his liaison between him in jail and his twitter account so this is actually his mom talking through on his behalf through his twitter account ross ulbricht is the famous dread pirate roberts from uh the silk road days uh so the silk road was started by this guy ross ulbricht he is in jail for basically life on ridiculous trumped-up charges in my mind and he should absolutely be freed right now uh but he's not uh and he's been paying he's kept in touch with the world of crypto his mom prints out the front page of reddit and like gives it to him so he can review it uh and also feed some other crypto news and he's launching an nft and so ross albrecht is launching an nft auction so ross ulbrick says in his post with this nft i see a chance to make a difference where it really counts in the lives of kids who did not ask for any of this there is a lot that we can do with the proceeds of the auction but one idea i'm committed to is to help kids travel to visit their moms and dads in prison uh russ albert again in prison for basically life uh very peaceful nice guy mom has to come and visit him in prison all the time and so the proceeds of this nft are going to help uh just help maintain connections between loved ones in prison are people hating on this though uh bitcoiners are yeah because because it's an nft so ross albrecht uh went to jail before ethereum was really a thing uh and so he was always a bitcoiner uh and uh a lot of bitcoiners are very very upset that ross ulbricht their beloved like you know jailed martyr is using non-bitcoin tech to do stuff and so they're bitcoiners following up on this tweet saying god effing damn it ross uh and then another one saying how to ruin your base in one fellow swoop for just touching nfts bitcoiners have absolutely lost the lost the plot that's absolutely lost definitely purity tests have gotten more and more extreme right until you can't even like touch an nft this is this is ooty uh being satirical though right he's kind of joking no no he is this is this is udi being serious no yes a hundred percent are you serious yes this is oody being serious are you sure yes i can never tell yes no he says he says effing disgusting effing cult disgusting right talking about the big coiners reacting to ross ulbricht yeah talking about the bitcoiners he's talking about the bitcoiners yes like he's not being serious no he is he's telling the bitcoiners they're a disgusting effort okay okay okay i thought he was saying effing disgusting like about the nft itself about raw student nfc okay no he's he's the bitcoiners are being called him out man love you most love you most of the time most of the time uh let's talk about this man this is like a reddit post uh i'm gonna full screen this this is some dude unlocking his house with an nft yeah an nft that he has in his ethereum wallet connecting to the internet somehow and then unlocking a door to his house there's also another example of this for the same thing with a car uh and here's a fun piece of ethereum trivia this is why our shows go on so long because we have so many stories to tell um there's this old old organization called slockit that i don't think is around anymore that wanted to do exactly this where you could go and like open up a locker and the locker would have the thing that you would need in it and like drones could come and it would all be based on on ethereum and pro public private key cryptography very ethereum 2016 sci-fi stuff we didn't really know what ethereum would do when we thought yeah just do anything right unlock bikes and unlock houses yeah right like you know communal sharing communal resources stuff like that slockett the three guys behind slockit are they they they wanted this to not be a centralized company so they wanted to start a doubt back in 2017 but then the idea kind of more from there i was like well why'd have this dow just be about socket let's just have a dao of daos and i think you can see where this go is going this was the genesis of the dao slacket the three guys behind the star the socket started to write the codes for the dao which turned into the dao and then created the whole ethereum classic mess uh so yeah that's a fun piece of it here in trivia we are coming full circle to some of the utility and use cases that we were dreaming of in 2016 uh now being uh happening just through the maturation of mobile wallets and also ens and also nfts it's funny you're not wrong you're just early is really the phrase here so many things uh have happened in the history of technology where you know ideas are good it's just not their time and i think slackit was one of them and now here we are starting to unlock various locks with our nfts and it looks somewhat normal i mean this looks like a pretty good user experience i'm not saying this is ready for mainstream but it's a lot closer than it was in 2016. if you want to hear that full story by the way griff green layer zero podcast i listened to that one david i was laughing out loud in some spots so it was just a lot of fun tells the story of the dao and everything that went on with slackhead um i guess this is the internet of things huh the internet of scarce things maybe um very cool let's talk about immutable now immutable x making absolutely crushing it okay so the first thing we want to talk about is they're getting a fiat on-ramp so moonpay is a fiat on-ramp they're getting a fiat on-ramp directly to immutable on and off ramp which is something we need so dearly so that's happening and that means instant credit card purchases of your nfts on top of immutable right this is mainstream ready completely abstracting away like oh nft where can i where can i swipe my credit card like that is that that's what this partnership creates and the the the awesome thing is gas fees on an immutable x are so incredibly low that you just don't actually have zero right uh they're they're not zero but they are zero because they are so low because the immutable team's just paying for them yes yeah right exactly yeah and so they're zero from their perspective of the user i just like i can buy my nft with a credit card and it's all secured by ethereum right that's the difference this is what we've been waiting for yep don't sacrifice uh decentralization these are some immutable stats too oh well first let's talk about their business development yeah so immutable tweets out we're getting 50 plus inbounds a day from the largest companies in the world wanting to use nftes and we need help nfts are eating the world come accelerate it hiring 30-plus business developers and csms i don't know what csm is dms open or reply here uh they are also on our jobs board as well yeah they are some really cool jobs too head of the ethereum research is that one of them yep awesome jobs what a great name word of tokens yeah what's the game of thrones name uh master of coin master of coin yeah tokens that's what i want okay a third tweet that says october was a blockbuster month for community projects on immutablex us 30 million dollars in uh uh us dollar trading fee volume gas free 22 20 new nfc collections dropped and then a link to a blog post with some of the most innovative nfts projects that dropped last month overall immutablex is absolutely killing it congrats guys we're about to find out what happens when you make block space virtually free and you allow fiat on-ramps on top of that as well so you may stream the user experience earlier we were talking about starknet and starkware immutablex is built on starkx which is the the you know the pre-version of starknet again that's a topic to go into the starkware team the show that we talked about with them also disclaimer ryan and i are angel investors into one of the immutable seed rounds absolutely bitcoin bitcoin news same news every week okay el salvador is buying a hundred more bitcoins yes the market falls buy the dip man buy the dip el salvador present doing that uh so is so is michael saylor so that's what happened last week in the week before it's happening this week again el salvador and sailor buying the dip i honestly david i think this is going to pay off for them probably like i don't hate it it's going to pay off for them it's just kind of um funny to me that these are the things we're reporting week after week on it feels like we got paralyzed in time around february of this year and like not much has happened right in bitcoin land since hey but like again according to the bitcoin value prop that's the only thing that needs to happen okay all right it is kind of funny seeing el salvador buying a hundred more bitcoins and michael saylor coming in and buying seven thousand and five more bitcoins there are some difference in numbers there um yeah well he's you know michael saylor has the company and you know can never sell his bitcoin because hey he has way too much of it and if he does start to sell it it's gonna start to signal to the market that this massive bitcoin whale that i i don't know how much bitcoin michael sailor has i think it's over like to sell it though just if you believe in like the monetization of bitcoin right then you can just start using it just lend against it borrow against it it's just collateral in the balance sheet you never have to sell and the thing is like his trade he's getting basically free money because he's borrowing it from like bonds right it's like you know this is sort of a nice little arbitrage as long as bitcoin continues to appreciate in value right funny to me that he hasn't like looked at ether or some other alternatives out there at all he's just laser laser-eyed focused so some quick stats is michael that micro strategy has bought 3.5 million dollars worth of bitcoin that's currently clocking in at 6.8 billion dollars so almost a 2x they've got 121 000 bitcoins which is roughly a little bit over half of the total at one half of one percent of the total supply of bitcoins one day maybe he turns that into wbtc because no one else will give him a loan on his bitcoins and so he's gonna do it it's possible it's possible he might just buy a crypto bank though and do himself we'll see china's crypto censorship reached is now reaching not just mining companies of course which is mass uh moved there was a mass exodus of mining companies previous work mining companies out of china but now it's pouring into news outlets so there's the banning of crypto media companies in china as well as they continue the crackdown what are your thoughts yeah overall china just slowly pushing out everything to do with crypto um to their loss uh i think it's pretty a reasonable claim to say that in the long term 10 15 20 years china will lose its power because of its um pushing out of crypto i think this is going to be this is a catastrophic error on china that's going to come back to bite them in the butt maybe in 15 20 20 years or so something like that i think that's how the game theory works out but if you're this is why it's an acid test of how authoritarian your country is with respect to how it responds to crypto right it's like we're seeing this acid test play out in every in every uh government worldwide and i don't think the us is immune we'll see what the u.s continues to do with crypto but like china which is a bit more authoritarian uh top down um they are going all out banning crypto like get it out of here and i think in the process you're exactly right they're being outplayed by crypto this is a strategic mishap but they have big aspirations for their centralized you know uh money system you know crypto and quotes money system so we'll see how that plays out as well um let's talk about powell he's redefining what he means by transitory inflation do you remember this meme over the summer it's like not inflation it's just transitory inflation all the crypto people were like we know there was that there was the the uh i can't remember where i saw this there's something along the lines of like uh the federal reserve has finally admitted that inflation is finally here and then there was meanwhile crypto twitter a year ago and there was that animation of the money printers going bur and like this anime girl just like dancing it's like we were making memes about inflation a year ago and finally the fed is like yo guys i think inflation might be here he says he's done with the term this is a quote from jerome powell i think it's probably a good time to retire that term transitory and try to explain more clearly what we mean and then he goes on to try to explain that it's not going to be so transitory after all yeah this is a meme i put out david i just thought it was funny it's kind of like an onion style meme this is like breaking news powell clarifies transitory inflation from the perspective of our 13.8 billion uh year old universe humanity itself is transitory yeah what is transitory this is relative everything's relative everything's relative of course uh transitory not so transitory after all um congress is still holding hearings on crypto this one with coinbase ftx paxos some other crypto banks as well what's uh what's happening here centralized cryptobanks being summoned to congress for a centralized hearing from the centralized forms of government but you know what's not anything defy related because can't summon d5 and that's the story there anyways uh the the government is looking at crypto more and more and more so it's going to be interesting to see what is actually discussed at these hearings all right guys we're going to be back with the hot takes of the week but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave dot com that's aave.com gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bankless all right guys we are back with the takes of the week let's start with this is this gonna be the last time we talk about the ethereum pre-mine david damn i hope so no no okay it's not going to be this is a detailed pie chart of each genesis allocations why don't you guide us through this and then maybe we can refer people this clip when they ask the next time yeah so there's a bunch of different colors here uh there's also 45.9 million ether that's been mined since the pre-genesis allocations everything else is the pre-genesis allocations and then the 46 million ether that's also mined has been mined since the the pre-sale so uh starting from the biggest to the smallest a little over 60 million ether was sold 60.1 million was acquired ether was acquired by sending in 2014 by sending btc to a widely publicized ether sale address again no kyc no registration just sending in bitcoin to an address the next largest slice not including the mining is allocation to early contributors and those are people like the ethereum co-founders i believe there was eight of them uh that is 8.4 million of those as well and then 3.4 million ether got sent towards the ef um and that is the next largest slice today the ef only holds 350 000 so the yes ef has reduced their ether holdings by uh 10x like one tenth uh is what they currently own of their initial distributions uh and then the largest single recipient vitalik buterin himself an accidental meme lord received 696 thousand and 900 ether uh from the genesis event i don't know how much he holds but he's definitely distributed a bunch of his tokens as well to me ryan this seems very very fair and this was the intent of the ethereum pre-sale over fifty percent well well over fifty percent it was something like seventy seventy-five percent of all ether at genesis was sold freely and openly to the public without any sort of registration or kyc or private pre-sale or whatever uh and then we got the early contributors like the eight ish prep maybe there's more of the ethereum co-founders and then the ef um the the amount that was given away to the public and it was only raised like they only had like 14 million dollars was like 75 of the total supply yeah and this the allocation early contributors wasn't just like co-founders it was just a whole slew of other workers there were hundreds of different you know developers and people involved uh yeah and what so what's interesting to me is like some of the takeaways are okay like 55 or so something around that that um range went to um the pre-sale of like the total supply now right way more wait wait wait what are you talking about at the time of the sale or now not now okay now and now supply terms right if you're just like zoom out and look at the supply and then you had another like 40 or so like 35 40 or so that were like fairly distributed uh via proof of work mining i got some of those yeah exactly yeah and that's part of the reason you came into crypto right david yeah exactly and a lot of other coins that start with proof of stake do not have this proof of work distribution for like this period of time there's a massive amount those distributed this way um what's interesting to me too is like you talk about like the centralization of the ethereum foundation like like some people do i don't know if anyone does anymore look man they have like point four percent of supply something like this right like less than half a percent of the total supply vitalik himself right you after you dilute through all this proof of work he's got far less than one percent you know it's like never happened yeah yeah in what world does the founder of a thing of anything have that kind like i so if satoshi was smart he was mining bitcoin from inception right i'm sure he was okay like certainly he pro he probably had a far higher percentage i mean it's impossible to know but like if you look at satoshi's addresses that sort of thing things that might be linked to him then uh then vitalik does of ethereum it's like michael saylor owns more freaking bitcoin than vitalik owns of the supply of ether so i don't know i guess this is maybe the last time we talk about this it just seems to me like such a uh the pre-mine thing seems like such a non-issue to me um looks like a pretty fair distribution and for the newer listeners the pre-mine pre-sale thing is really just ticked off a lot of bitcoiners who are able to contrast it with the whole fair launch of bitcoin but fair is just relative it's really just a subjective argument as to what is fair or not so you really have to do your own critical thinking and ask yourself what is fair and then the other side of this is uh the the the whole like vc chains and the way that they got bootstrapped uh the the really the hot ones the ones that we were talking about last week are the avalanche and salon chains where far greater like two-thirds of the supply was uh sold in private pre-sales to financially well capitalized vc firms in that my mind when we talk about public permissionless blockchains with public open money as a public utility that is extremely unfair uh and so there there is uh there is these differences the the first impressions of these chains are really really important and i think that the way that ethereum the ether distribution happened from day one and then what happened with proof-of-work mining over the next six years is as fair as we could have ever hoped for could probably only happen one time too that's right it's like you know once you do ever after icos were kind of diluted here's a take two david uh optimism is aetherium arbitrarium is ethereum stark wears ethereum zika sync is a theorem immutable is ethereum why because ethereum is the chain of chains we were looking at uh you know transactions last week the total transaction throughput of ethereum uh from that website i can't recall at the top of my head but i'd like to you know talk about it maybe next week a little bit in rollups just shows you that the total transaction throughput of ethereum is not just what happens on mainnet it's what happens on maynet plus optimism arbitram starkware zk sync immutable all of these things if they're secured by ethereum are ethereum it's like california texas nevada all of these things they're different states but they're all part of the united states right and so uh when we talk about like the us being a union of states ethereum is like a union of chains it's the ethereum union it's the eu ethereum the chain of chains i think that's important for people to start understanding that more of this activity is going to happen in layer twos and ethereum will be the main at least will be a settlement layer of um all of these chains but the entire collection of these chains will also be ethereum the ethereum union um the website that ryan was talking about is ethtps.info if you want to check that out uh the other cool thing is that like you can actually deploy roll-ups on top of roll-ups and then you can deploy roll-ups on top of those roll-ups so like you can deploy roll-ups all the way down and like think of just like a gigantic fractal like root system or just like branches of a tree where these roll-ups spin off of rolex spin-off of roll-ups because of why not uh and eventually like everything settles down down to the very base protocol the ethereum protocol so no wonder gas fees are so incredibly high the weight of all l2s are pushing pressure on the gas fees on l1 that's why users got to get off the l1 and go to l2s shout out to everyone that played borderlands 2 the lavas rising meme uh that one's a big one in that that that uh community the lava is rising on layer one you gotta get off you gotta get off at some point yep main chain is lava and say it again it's bradley again hey bradley what's he saying uh brantley says things i expect to see with daos dao splits that was firing people hostile takeovers governance attacks crossed out coalitions dao's going bankrupt lawsuits against dalles dao's reorgan to cut people out going centralized like going private dow's merging with acquiring other dows basically the same exact behavior that we have seen throughout all of human just organizational efforts but now we're just doing it in dallas because again dows are nothing new under the sun they're just they're just humans organizing in a different vehicle in a different way this time on ethereum this time with tokens and so these same sort of behaviors that we've seen before are probably going to play out again at least that's what token brantley is saying well then it begs the question are dow is any different than corporations then are you know corporate organizations in some ways they are a complete paradigm shift and in others they are exactly the same yeah i think that's the right take i think that's a good take and um you know i i do hope we can invent some things that are different from a governance perspective as well as as we go on but a lot of what we've seen is less less dow i guess in more digital organization he follows up saying we are currently living in the golden age in an early naive golden age of dallas when none of the above has really happened yet but it will the next decade is going to be fun it's a good take oh and then somebody also responded saying this has actually already happened with steemit which is a different what was once a blockchain and there was this attempted hostile takeover by justin's son and then this demon dao was like going going to his funds by forking themselves there yeah the ability to fork is definitely a new uh governance you know paradigm shift i think it's true let's talk about this squish chaos what's he saying squish chaos l2s or l1s is the entire crypto bet right now you may think you're betting on eth but really you're betting on zk sync starkware arbitrum and optimism or alternatively you may be thinking that you're betting on avalanche or solana but really you're betting on the multi-chain l1 i thought this was really really good take i agree there needs to be many many many many blockchains and as i've said i've said before where i kind of think the whole multi-chain world is going to start to mean multi-chain on aetherium multi multi-l2s uh and like these l2's will be bridged by things like connects and hop and and all these other like cross train liquidity providers or you can bet on the multi multi layer one ecosystem where you have solana and avalanche and ethereum and bitcoin and then maybe something like uh polka dot or cosmos is like the the connecting layer i think listeners know where i've placed my bets i'm betting that it's easier to actually just implement layer twos on one single chain and that allow that one chain to optimize for decentralization and the reason why is because in a multi-l1 world you have multi-sig bridges whereas in a layer two world that's all built on one single l1 you have the world of cryptographically secured roll-ups and remember this industry is about cryptography at the end of the day not multi-sigs uh remember to listen to our roon christensen podcast where we went through the full game theory unpacking the differences between an l2 world and a uh in a multi-side chain world one is just way better way more efficient way more liquid and in that world only one chain needs to focus on decentralization and that one chain can sell its decentralization to every single other layer two via roll-ups and that is ethereum yeah this is um i think it's a really interesting take right so like the the other the other side of this take is like so first of all uh i wonder if people realize that this is actually what they're betting on okay like when they purchase eath or when they purchase avalanche um the second thing i wonder about this is do you think it's a good bet to bet on zk sink and starkware and arbitram and you know optimism because squish is also right when he's saying that a bet on ethereum and eth the asset is you're actually ether is actually outsourcing its execution layer to all of these other chains and so that means these roll-up chains will own the user experience they'll own the fiat onboarding it's like almost in a way giving up a lot of control that it had previously in its monolithic model and is that a safe bet is the question because now ethereum is more dependent on these other chains to carry it forward uh what's your take on that um it's kind of like whack-a-mole where like maybe one l2 doesn't work but you can you you can have many many l2s right not all of them have to work uh for ethereum to be successful um but if you're a betting on avalanche and dc investor follows this this take up saying well squish says if you're betting on avalanche you're actually betting on a multi-chain world and dc investor says well if you're if you're betting on avalanche no you're actually just betting on avalanche there can be a multi-chain future where avalanche doesn't succeed and so yeah many many l2s can come ryan and then not work but ethereum the l1 can still work because only some of the l2s need to work whereas if you're betting on l1s you are making a very specific bet upon a specific l1 whether you bet on ethereum you're not betting on a specific l2 you're embedding on the concept of l2s at large yeah i'm kind of i've been obsessed recently david about this um this analogy between like the united states and like ethereum but it's like with the the idea of like a union of states basically think of every single roll-up as a different state right and like when i say state i'm talking about like a state in the united states right so it has its own set of laws it has kind of its own heavily speeded towards state rights by the way exactly and it has its own jurisdiction and you know where do people move well they just move to a state where good laws decent taxes reasonable taxes good services and lots of jobs right so so the population migrates from state to state and the economic output of the united states is just an amalgamation and aggregation of the economic output of all of its individual 50 states isn't that interesting and like some states have done better than others right uh economically or from a variety of other factors depending on how you measure the the metrics but you got 50 separate experiments that's what's happening with uh with ethereum is basically like all of these roll-ups will have their own experiments but the economic output of all of these roll-ups will actually end up partially in eath the asset eth as the money and the the store of value and the chief utility across all of these states too yeah i'm obsessed with that analogy anyway love it won't be the end of it kyle davies fundamentals are a joke kyle davies from three arrows capital which is the the entity that was kind of the subject of a lot of the ire of the ethereum community last week yeah fundamentals are a joke fundamentals are a joke and granted we just talked about omicron this token that has nothing to do with covid or anything pumping people and and people yeah dogecoin for that matter so like granted there are a lot of things that are pumping that don't have any fundamentals but in my mind you can't just say that fundamentals are a joke that's equivalent in my mind of saying real life is a joke like fundamentals are based in real life and so i followed up and says and i said nothing matters said the nihilist and then kyle davies responds to me long live the memes so he's agreeing nothing matters yeah and then i go without fundamentals memes are just fads memes with fundamentals however can last forever i'm acknowledging the power of memes but what's even more powerful is memes that are backed by fundamentals i totally agree with those takes uh yeah i totally agree there's a reason why we do a podcast together ryan i know man look it also i i think it also depends on your time horizon right so it's like that's another way to say the same thing fundamentals are a joke in the short run but they matter a lot in the long run try to survive a bear uh cycle on just memes alone and narratives alone right like uh no you go back down to the base you boil it all down to the fundamentals and then you rebuild everything without fundamentals i don't think a trader needs to have convictions that's the thing it's just back to the ryan selkis tweets like everyone's arguing and they're just arguing about timelines uh and time horizons rather than actual substantive you know issues uh david this is your take i'm gonna read it out eth is the best way to get exposure to the metaverse nothing else comes close yeah so the metaverse if you guys remember listening to our metaverse defined podcast which you should definitely go back and listen to uh the metaverse isn't one thing the metaverse is not going to be having exposure by facebook stock or uh you know decentraland or sandbox token the meta meta verse is going to be a collection of very many many many different micro metaverses the overall aggregate metaverse is going to be a collection of many many different things the only way that i see possible to actually have direct exposure to the growth of the metaverse is with ether because ether is metaverse money i think in hindsight in like 2030 people will look at ethereum and be and while we see it as a parallel financial system people in 2030 will see ethereum as the metaverse the thing that supports the single shared registry of all known objects in the metaverse and ether will be metaverse money because it will be the liquidity currency for all of these objects i think ether as the asset is going to track the growth of the metaverse far better than any other asset possible and that includes the mva sorry index co-op people that includes the mvi metaverse index fund because the problem with that is that you actually have to put in metaverse assets into the metaverse index but after they're established after some of them have grown and they're not going to be able to capture all of the growth of the metaverse by definition because it is reactive rather than being proactive where ether already exists today and we know that the metaverse will exist tomorrow therefore you can buy ether today on the back of the growth of the metaverse if you want to have exposure to the metaverse buy the money that people are going to use in the metaverse like it's that simple yeah i i think it's that simple as well and look man i'm gonna go back to my us analogy like one more time okay one more time in this podcast right so like if you want economic exposure to the to the united states in the 1900s it would have been a bad play to just buy the dollar and t and t bills or something treasuries right but it would have been a good play to buy some of those things maybe but also the s p like all of the all of the companies that are bit and that's kind of what you're getting with e right right you're getting exposure to the economic output of ethereum and all of its nation-states and the entire metaverse right uh and you're getting that an index level like performance of that and this is an index of everything that's happening on top of ethereum ah pretty much pretty much all right dave it's that time what are you excited about this week man ah man uh yesterday last night i recorded a layer zero with justin aversano justin is the photographer behind the twin flames project and man was that guy's story really really cool i usually slide out 90 minutes for these episodes but we almost went for two hours just because the story wasn't over by the time we hit the end uh justin has this insanely cool story where he's connecting uh his uh i don't want to spoil too much of it his mom died of ovarian cancer right after he uh started getting into photography the reason why one of the reasons why his mom had ovarian cancer is because he lost his twin in the womb and he also made this twin project which he took a hundred pictures of a hundred different twins all over the world and got into the world of nfts by selling this project there's so much more to the story it's a crazy story and this story is one of the reasons why i started doing layer zeros in the first place to get some of these stories out and the cool thing about uh this is that you know layer zeros i started with people like uh vitalik's dad uh dimitri and eric connor who was been with ethereum since day one and danny ryan and tim baiko all the protocol people but i also want to talk to the people that didn't care about ethereum but got pulled into ethereum because something about ethereum changed their life uh and that's what happened on this week's next week's episode of layer zero so do not miss that one it was a great story that's hype man that's great i'm looking forward to that it's like it's you're a cultural a cryptocultural anthropologist is sort of what layers the you know zero is surfacing these stories yeah yeah their zeros are just some of my favorites because like i just pull someone into zoom and they just tell me a story for an hour and a half and i'm like oh yes no prep you just have a conversation right it's nice what are you excited about this week ryan um i was just thankful for like two days of rest like i got off screens had some you know fun in real life just hanging out with my family over thanksgiving and just like sometimes we forget like real life is good do you know like we're digital all the time but real life matters there's always this this counter force in in crypto and i don't know if you're the same way david but it's like it's always like what did you miss like i missed a couple days what did i miss did i miss any alpha did i miss any opportunities and the truth is like if you're away for too long in crypto you will miss out on some opportunities right um but then you have to like reevaluate what's important in your life and i think it was important for me to remind myself this crypto thing is a marathon it's not a sprint like you don't have to be first on every single opportunity you don't have to like get the alpha from day one right it's like don't don't play that game don't exhaust yourself that way there's there's no way to live uh and then like what's really important and wealth is not the most important thing at the end of the day i think kevin owaki said it's like optimize for freedom we're optimizing for freedom here not wealth right it's like if you're a slave to your screen if you're a slave to crypto prices block folio uh that's not freedom right right you know so like reevaluate what wealth actually is and you make sure you're looking at it through the lens of of freedom is sort of another thing i kind of took away from a couple days of rest and the other thing is always important to remember is like comparison is the thief of joy okay we're like just there's always going to be someone who's doing better right every play video game like you know um fortnite or something it's like there's always someone who is just ten times better than you uh they always will be like just enjoy the game though you don't have to be as good as that you don't have to be first in crypto you don't have to get the every 100x upside that you see so it's just a time to reflect and help me stay grounded and realize like maybe this is a message someone needs to hear today like stop chasing all the time just enjoy the ride and have fun that's what this is about and i hope this year has been like that for you um when it's not just zoom out and reevaluate realize what's important because those are the things that that are important at least to me and it helped me realize that yeah the story of the progression of crypto is going to last for our entire lifetimes so you have to sustain yourself so you can watch that story unfold because that's to me like this is just one of the best movies ever that's ever happened which is the story of crypto and the cool thing about this movie is that it's going to last 60 70 80 years how long i do the whole time uh and so again you you got you gotta sustain yourself because like you said it's a marathon not a sprint there you go guys that's the message all right meme of the week give me the week meantime david this is a thanksgiving meme too good timing on this yeah so uh this i i said this is a tweet i said gm

banister of some like deck with dressed in some like royal looking stuff uh just very very superior looking uh and the label is 20 21 so if you were the crypto crazy guy in 2017 and then you also felt
