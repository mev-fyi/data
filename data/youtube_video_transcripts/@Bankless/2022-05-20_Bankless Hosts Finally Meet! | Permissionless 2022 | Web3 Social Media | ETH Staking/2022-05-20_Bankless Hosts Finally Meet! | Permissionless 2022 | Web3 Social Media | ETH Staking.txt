so all the haters all the doubters I am a real person can you confirm that for me David thankless Nation happy third week of May it's not just the third week of May this is the best week of May David what time is it man it's the Friday Bank close weekly roll up Ryan and it feels a little different for some reason this week wow what's going on why is this different well all of the uh rumors of me being a deep fake have dissipated suddenly because we now have proof of existence uh so all the haters all the doubters I am a real person can you confirm that for me David yeah no it actually he does have matter he does have physical matter I can actually feel his face there's no battery in the back of the head I promise guys but look man it's been so much fun this is the first roll-up David and I have ever done in person and uh we met for the first time on Monday there's a lot of Firsts going on this week this is like a crypto story because people are blown away in fact like I think 50 of the people we talk to don't actually believe that this is the first time we met they they thought this was a sort of a PR event because we've done God how many episodes have we done of Bank list before meeting like over three somewhere in the three to four hundred range yeah but uh hours and hours and hours and I feel like I like I feel like I've known you already and uh it was just this this funny thing we didn't meet in covid and now it's an opportunity to meet and we sort of delayed it made a meme out of it but uh it was really cool kept the ball rolling yeah yeah uh guys stay tuned to the end and there's actually I think some footage of us actually meeting for the first time it's just it's just kind of fun and uh this was permissionless David so if people aren't familiar with permissionless what's this conference what are we talking about today yeah this is permissionless week and now permissionless has broken my brain about how a conference can go down it's a very very crypto Frontier uh but also very very conferency uh and so uh the the block Works absolutely killed it with it with the curation and the uh in the back end uh I think we killed it with some of the contents this has been like it's a first year conference and it's insane for a first year conference to go so well so already looking forward to permissionless 2023 let me just tell you like for a first year conference permission list doesn't deserve to be this good like it's like it like shouldn't be allowed and it's uh well look it's the best crypto conference I've ever been to David that's really saying something Ryan um and but we got so much to cover for you and I think part of this episode is to update you on all of the announcements that happened at permissionless because it seems like permissionless has become a shelling point for announcements so number one we got the birth of web 3 social okay the lens protocol release David was on stage with a live demo he created his first lens wallet which is like a decentralized identity protocol social media and I'm calling it man I saw it this week is the first time I've actually gotten super bullish on web3 social so we're talking about that what else are we covering David oh gosh there were so many wallet announcements one out of Robin Hood Robin Hood getting into the self-custodial wallet game we actually had a podcast recording with Vlad the CEO from Robin Hood all about those details that episode came out earlier this week but we'll also talk about some of those details as well coinbase had a secret announcement which they revealed on stage here at permissionless uh glido competition coming for out of coinbase and a partnership with other people in the staking Community uh what else is there you know there's not just the Robin Hood wallet coinbase actually announced a really cool wallet that I want to tell you about someone demoed this to me yesterday and so did Ledger so this is also wallet week in addition to it being the birth of web 3 social media week so guys we are going to take you through this of course David we do the weekly roll-up every Friday so if you want to catch this again you got to make sure you like And subscribe rate and review okay so if you're listening to podcasts give us a review five stars help us jack up to the top of the charts and also if you are looking on YouTube make sure you hit that subscribe button send this to a friend because we're doing this every Friday right uh David tell them about alchemics before we get in some people don't believe that this is a real thing because it sounds too good to be true it sounds like a little like a a doe Quan I'll go stable quite big but it's actually awesome tell them what this is yeah especially when we are trying to avoid getting liquidations but we're still trying to get D5 capital and yield on our capital alchemics is a self-repaying loan system uh so what happens is you go to alchemics you deposit your die you deposit your ether and then up to 50 of your deposited Capital you can borrow against that capital and you get your basically your future yield payments to you up front uh and so you deposit 100 die borrow 50 die while that 100 die goes and yield farms in defy and pays that 50 die loan back automatically uh since it's fully collateralized you can't get liquidated you're not taking leverage it is a self-replaying loan technology uh something that is unique to the world of crypto we can't not we cannot do this in Trad five we can only do this on crypto rails there is a link in the show notes to get started banklist.cc slash alchemix capital A at the start to get started thank you comics for sponsoring this message dude this is some bear Market technology you're gonna hit me right there so uh if you need cash but you don't want to sell your eth this is what you can go do sell for paying loan on alchemics bring that yield forward and actually get some cash without selling because like why would you sell your eth at these prices dude why would you sell pre-merge uh so anyway check that out guys but let's talk Market David what's happening with Bitcoin price uh we actually had a green week Ryan what yeah why yeah uh we started the week at 29 000 we are currently at 29 800 on bitcoin so above uh up almost three percent this week so okay uh bloodbath last week but New Normal this week uh is that here uh this is uh all could also be the dead cat bounce week who knows yeah uh those have been throughout 2018 and we know that it's a bloodbath followed by uh just a long long study of nothing and sometimes another Blood path follows I don't know that's what 2018 was who knows what this has in store for us this year though you know what's funny is a lot of the talks I've heard I've heard the the bear word being mentioned right it's like everyone assumes we're entering the bear Market uh do you believe that because I feel like there's so much bullish building news in this podcast that we're going to cover and yet at the same time prices are down and so there's this bear sentiment yeah the the bear Market is definitely getting memed into existence at this point so I think uh the community is using the bear Market word more and more and more uh I'm doing it as well so I guess that means bear Market um but I would say the bear Market Vibes that permissionless are totally absent uh yes we have a lot of permissionless talk to get to so we'll keep on hinting at it but like no one really feels like we're in a bear Market at least in only in the prices the only thing about the bear Market is the prices and who cares those are numbers on a screen who cares I don't care about pricing right David no we're not here for the money we're not here for the money uh East price tell us about that yeah each price started the week at 19.50 uh we're up like one percent up to uh 1980 kind of flat on the week uh who knows what it'll be by the time this uh podcast comes out though I'll take it I'll take it how about the ratio that's been uh down a little bit down a little bit on the ratio we lost about one to two percent uh not too much there uh but in Bear markets it does go down versus BTC it's been holding up up until last week where it took a nose dive uh but since then we're kind of about at the same more or less okay so it's it's not telling us anything specific we're just we're up or down we're a bit crabbing out and uh total crypto market cap we still above a trillion uh yeah we're still above a trillion uh 1.3 trillion it's basically flat on the week so total crypto value market cap no change there in seven days do you want to zoom out just take a quick look at it's a macro that's what's going on here so uh re read this tweet out for us 35 trillion dollars in global market value erased since the beginning of the year that's 14 of all Global wealth including the 1 billion that we lost in crypto uh for reference 2008 was a 19 decline uh so those are like comparable numbers that's kind of crazy actually 2008 felt so much worse right and we're like within the ballpark and maybe this goes to 19 that's only like five percent more uh and this would be like a 2022 would be like a 2008 level event in market decline it's incredible absolutely crazy uh people that were sitting on cash in 2008 those people did well yeah those people did well um guys we have so much to cover uh so much we're gonna talk about some events at permissionless some things that happen again the birth of web 3 social David what else are we talking about man oh my God there's so much uh an insane number of wallet releases we teased them at the beginning uh like I said a brand new liquid staking competitor and at the end we also have like a little photo gallery for people who are fomoing about permissionless uh we got you yeah sure stick around to the end we got some photos absolutely guys we're gonna get to all of those things but before we do we

bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrum or Boba Networks all right guys we are back and just a reminder you might hear some noise in the background that's because we are recording at the permissionless conference all right and so a lot of the uh news events and important things that are happening in crypto are being announced here on the floor at permissionless and the first is this I just got done this morning from watching David on the main stage with stani from Ave but also the lens protocol and I feel like I was in the audience and I feel like I just saw the birth of web3 social okay and just some history um we're talking about web3 social back in 2017. you know there's this project called peepeth they tried to put Twitter for ethereum Shane like it sounded really cool it's just like we were not ready for that and so I've been somewhat bearish since then on web3 social like no first we got to do the money use cases in D5 and then we'll come after Twitter and Facebook but no longer like I actually see things that are being built could you take us through what you demoed this morning with stani yeah if you are into Twitter crypto Twitter if you're addicted to crypto Twitter like me and Ryan uh this might be for you uh it feels very much like Twitter it feels a lot like a Facebook profile uh and so I was actually given the chance to Mint my own lens profile on stage I now have trustlessstate.lens uh so that's pretty cool uh and if you if you uh you can actually if you are whitelisted you can go and mint to your profile as well this is on polygon uh and blendster is a la app that is built on top of lens so lens being the protocol lens stir being the uh the social media platform on top of the protocol and it looks and feels a little bit like both like Facebook a lot like Twitter uh when you follow someone you actually sign a message you don't have to broadcast a transaction the only thing that you actually make a transaction for is minting your profile uh your profile is an nft on polygon and then when you follow people you sign verifiable message to say I indeed follow this person and that is how we build out social graphs uh and so people are minting their lens profiles if you signed that early message saying hey I should own this tweet this happened a number of months ago you have a whitelist capabilities to go and meet your profile and so I set up my I put my crypto punk as my profile picture I followed Stony I I what is it called to do something on lens tweeting out what do you call tweeting on lens uh tweeting on lens and it's actually on lenster are you talking about specifically yeah we need a verb for that Sony needs to come up with a verb for that but I sent out a tweet TBD for that future word okay it sends out a tweet saying just setting up my lens account as Jack Dorsey did when he set it up his Twitter account way back when uh and yeah so like web3 social is underway yeah what's really cool and here's the distinction that I think if if you're not yet understanding the significance of this because you might shrug it off and be like oh we already have Twitter uh that that's cool but the significance of this is what we're talking about doing is we are building on top of a protocol okay so lens is the protocol it's decentralized it's like self-sovereign identity you own your own profile okay you you guys recall David and I were banned bankless YouTube was banned last week and that's because the social media platforms they control our profile they control our followers they control everyone who subscribed we don't have control over that okay but lens is the base layer where the Creator where the individual has full self-sovereignty and control of their social media profile all right and the app that David is showing right now that you see on screen if you're on YouTube is just one app that was built on top of this thing so we're not talking about a new Twitter platform that has launched we're talking about underneath the Twitter platform an entirely new protocol and multiple different interfaces we could have many different versions of a Twitter or something even better than a Twitter launched on top of this and also astani was talking about like the ability to change up the algorithms right so a user being able to maybe I want to subscribe to something that's not so um like ad Centric maybe I want to subscribe to an algo that that emphasizes public goods I talk about that a little bit because that is a pair time shift as well yeah the idea is that you can have a drop down menu for your preferred algorithm maybe you woke up that some morning in a particular mood and you can select an algorithm to match your mood I'm bullish today is there an algo for bullishness only feed me bullish content uh that is something that could be built and the thing is like that can also be opened up to the developer Community uh and so what the algorithm is is open source and so algorithms are free to create and free to upload to your lens profile that functionality is not yet live uh but like hey maybe you're feeling particularly rageful one day and you just want to be angry I don't know why but the thing is you have that power yeah and you maybe you're your fork I want the Euphoria uh algorithm today you know what you know what's crazy though I do feel like that's the uh the default algorithm of social media is just like rage yeah it's just like um like and that's partially why a Twitter's gotten so toxic and Society has gotten so polarized so I want an optimistic algorithm right that's not feeding me advertising and uh David you and Stony closed with this which I thought was was super powerful where you talked about um we are no longer living on Mark Zuckerberg's property okay this is moving us from the era of feudalism where we had web 2 overlords controlling our property we own no property in the social media world as individuals okay we are in freaking medieval times right now and this completely changes that now we can be Property Owners of our own social media content but seriously Mark do come on the podcast so we could talk more about how you can incorporate this protocol too I did a fantastic panel with uh Christina bellamitri from lens protocol as well as Evan McMullen from disco who is one of disco is feeding data into lens protocol uh so if you want more on this content I did a panel with them at permissionless uh so tap in for that one I can't wait because No One's Gonna notice this during the bear Market season and this is the time amazing things get built uh David let's talk a little bit more about wallet week okay so you teased this the Robin Hood wallet self-custodial again we had a podcast with Vlad tenev who is the CEO co-founder of Robin Hood and they are doing something I didn't expect they would ever do okay this is sort of a fintech company they are they they haven't been all in in crypto we've actually criticized Robin Hood in the past because it was the case prior to like late last year that you could only buy crypto within Robin Hood and then Robin Hood would custody it they didn't even let you withdraw your ether your Bitcoin to your own private key not your keys not your crypto alright so that is not a bankless path and then they added the ability to withdraw and now they are doing something even bigger talk about this David what what is Robinhood launching yeah they release Robinhood 3 uh which is a not a self-custodial crypto wallet multi-chain as well so that you can hold your own keys and it's under the Robin Hood brand so this is separate from the actual Robin Hood app this is a separate app uh and it's gonna they say it's gonna onboard people into layer twos it's gonna have nft functionality uh they have swap features and I asked I asked Vlad like yo how do the swap features happen is that via the the Robin Hood exchange or is that for your defy app and he gave me the uh that's under wraps uh but uh he did leaks it leaks some some tidbits of information uh so that podcast came out earlier this week uh so if you want to stay get into and download it on all things Robin Hood's web 3 app uh watch our podcast look guys this is part of our D5 mullet thesis as you know and the thesis has always been fintech in the front defy in the back and that is what's happening now Robin Hood is is growing out their D5 mullet look at this this line David easy access to D5 protocols to earn yield within Robin Hood's wallet so that's kind of cool beautiful um also did you did you cast catch this uh last week um oh this is a picture about by the way of us us recording at permissionless setting up to record yeah but did you catch this so what's SPF up to yeah SPF bought 7.6 of Robin Hood so he is getting into the game uh FTX also bought block folio and it was a great onboarding mechanism for them because uh like blockfolio was the the app that I checked a bajillion times in 2018 to check crypto prices uh now they're getting into Robin Hood uh the price of hood the equity of behind Robin Hood jumped 28 percent uh that's roughly over 500 million dollars of steak wow and it's right yeah uh and which is absolutely crazy so SBF making moves yeah yeah you know the the mullet is also a good value proposition for pumping your stock price apparently as well it looks good there too um hey let's talk about the second wallet because that is only one of um three wallets that we wanted to talk about and I actually I think this is super cool I saw a demo of this David um have have you have you heard about this no you're gonna have to download me man all right so I think this is kind of cool because it's something I have never seen and uh I want you to I want to try to explain this and ask me questions about it and there's some things I'll probably get wrong not understand yet because this is kind of a new approach but you know how we have obviously custodial wallets certainly and coinbase has a custodial wallet and so if you're someone like my dad I'm like Dad you know it's okay just keep it on coinbase figure out the private key stuff later right like um but that is also not the bankless path obviously so we have custodial and then we have non-custodial okay and that is the bankless path where individuals taking their own private keys and it is their keys and it is their crypto right so we have this sort of this divide and of course on the uh non-case on the on the non-custodial side we have like Hardware wallets yep we have metamask we have Smart contract wallets which we haven't seen the the Renaissance of smart contract wallets yet okay so but there's this Gap in the middle that I didn't notice until now and that is a gap that coinbase is trying to fill a semi-custodial wallet okay so like right in the center custodial non-custodial semi-custodial so what does that mean it means basically this new coinbase MPC wallet it's going to be uh an app right now it's available for Android they're going to release it an iPhone but it splits your keys your private keys so the phone itself you retain one copy Like A Shard of your private Keys is something called MPC technology multi-party compute some cool cryptography behind this and then coinbase gets another part of your keys okay okay so it's both of these Keys together uh are required to sign transactions let me read this out for you the idea is pretty simple the user keeps some key material on their device and coinbase keeps some key material both are needed to use the wallet if one party is hacked funds are still safe okay okay you've fallen so far yeah all right so you might ask like why like what's the use case for this yeah is this not just a2f2 multi-sig it's not it's not quite a multi-sig but it's got some uh similarities but the reason why is there's this space in the middle um coinbase support gets a lot of people on there on their not so they have a non-custodial wallet too based wallet yeah coinbase wallet and the biggest support requests can can you guess what that is David uh can you give me my keys please I lost my keys yeah I lost my keys uh please support help me restore my keys can I have my money back please can I have my money back I forgot my seed phrase all of these things and so this provides a way to um for coinbase to essentially socially kind of recover not socially recover but it uses coinbase's security apparatus that's already that's already trusted so if a user loses their keys then coinbase can also restore that all right and then the benefit is if you are in the the custodial side of things uh completely you don't have access to anything defy right right right so this wallet provides you access there's a literally a browser in the wallet where you can go to Ave you can go to compounds you can connect and do all of the permissionless D5 things but you have a security blanket in that super easy to set up it's abstract the the complexity is abstracted from the from the user and like your dad's not going to you lose his private keys this way and he could still use D5 so it's almost like uh D5 with training wheels right and some people hear that and they're like well that's not maximally bankless right what happens if coinbase goes away that sort of thing and that is the trade-off so if coinbase goes away you know you're still kind of you're still kind of screwed um and so there are some trade-offs as well as like you have to dox yourself right to coinbase right they have your privacy so this is really like you have it anyways they have right so this is kind of like D5 with with training wheels and I think it's an interesting design space uh and uh I didn't even think that it was possible but here it is right okay so this feels like uh so I use a password manager in my browser yeah uh and that is encrypted on their end yes so they host that in a database yes uh but because but it can only be accessed when I type in my very specific password yes it all sounded out loud uh and uh and uh and so that's how I get my password for all my password managers it feels a little bit like that yeah so like my private key is stored in a in a um centralized server right it's encrypted and safe and it can only be accessed by my device yes am I tracking here uh that you you are tracking and the cool thing about this let me go back to what what they said um if one party is hacked funds are still safe funds are safe okay that's that's the way NPC Works cool so that provides an additional layer of safety so this is semi-custodial again it's just not for every we're trying to get more people in a defy and uh you know losing your private Keys the terror of that right like so when people ask me all the time should I withdraw from coinbase I'm like not until you're ready right like not until you're ready and then they have to they have to be ready they have to get private Key Management before they start to use D5 this is a faster path it's like an interim step it's your training wheels and actually I have a uh a social recovery smart contract wallet that uh is very like the most bankless wallet of all time right they don't have your my private Keys private keys don't exist because it's a smart contract wallet yeah and there was a social recovery mechanism if I lost my phone I would lose my wallet and so I would go to my guardian and he would restore my wallet problem is he also lost his wallet oh and so and then I lost my wallet and so if there are are trade-offs going into the opposite side of the spectrum even for a crypto native even for a crypto native where I lost I lost my private Keys Ryan uh you did I hadn't I had an ens in there and it was so hardened and it was so restrictive that like that sometimes the compromise is actually nice like I will even use that as a very bankless person have you tried emailing coinbase support about that issue I did not even trying to support it I kicked myself in the butt it's cool like I think this is cool and again if you want to be maximally self-sovereign actually bankless there's still that option but this is a space in between for some people also last thing on wallet week it feels like at this conference Ledger announced a browser extension I think you want to talk about this uh Ledger connect yeah so this was uh Charles from Ledger uh and they tweeted out today we are taking a further step to announce Ledger connect Ledger connect is a browser extension that makes it easy for you to connect your ledger to web3 directly from your browser it's easy smart and safe he tweets uh it makes me think that they're just routing right around metamask and going straight from ledger to defy app interesting right yeah metamask really gets in competition lately I I'm glad for it I think metamask is a fantastic team they also gave a fantastic presentation at permissionless but it's good to see some more options in the space for sure um David you want to talk about this too actually lead with this for me because I'm not sure I fully understand it this is just uh one of the many many announcements that happened at blockworks but this one's big Ryan uh coinbase if you can stake your eats with coinbase but we all know the drawbacks of that centralized staking we don't really want to put too much eth on a centralized database especially with a centralized company and coinbase knows this so they've partnered up with figment and other people in the staking space to make a brand new liquid staking protocol so this is now coming for Lido Ryan so oh wow this is not only is this like announcement at permission this week not only is this wallet week but this is also healthy competition week going on yeah so coinbase Cloud figment and a few other members have joined a brand new Dao to start up basically what is a Lido competitor a rock pocket pool competitor that is also decentralized so this is using fantastic technology out of a opal Network as well with shared secret validators which has a new name which I'm forgetting at the moment but yeah brand new liquid staking doubt getting spun up by some really big players that's good look there's been some concern I don't know if people tracking it but I I do think it is a concern do you know how a few months ago we were worried about eth2 client diversity if you don't know what that means we don't have time to get into it but it was it was a a kind of a moderate like mild centralization vector and now that problem has been solved so we have all sorts of different youth clients now that the next problem for I think the the ethereum community to solve is lato's been crushing it okay they have attracted a lot of stake inside of their protocol and uh we don't want any one single liquid staking protocol to kind of take over and so this is an answer to that my thought was always like we gotta bring competition into the space uh and actually like you know try to try to diversify this a little little bit so that looks what they it looks like that's what's going on here and this is actually specifically geared towards institution so this the name of the protocol is alluvial I actually didn't know that until just now um but yeah this is going after the institutions of the world uh and so this is uh but like allowing institutions to get into the liquid staking game uh it looks like they are doing AML and kyc checks uh just because that's what institutions need yeah and so I think this is going to bring a lot of tvl a lot more stake into each 2.0 staking it's going to lock up a lot of ethron yeah dude you know what that reminds me there is a panel we need to get to later this afternoon after this and this is moderated by Justin Drake it's the institutional case for ether right I'm super excited about that but this is another on-ramp for institutions to get into space uh dude can you give us a quick Luna update oh God still bad like we don't have to dwell on this it's bad that was last week's news but this week what's happening just a few quick highlights uh gosh a number of things uh feels bad to be dokwan at the moment uh he is formally getting charged uh and so there he has been called in for a parliamentary Hearing in South Korea where do juanissan uh from on USC and Luna uh and so TBD on what comes out of that but uh dokwan is going to have to go to I think their whatever Court I guess going to go to court yeah uh would not want to be in his seat it's uh yes there are some Financial uh South Korean Financial you know Regulators investigators really looking into into this into this as well he was going to be speaking at the conference but of course uh Tara Tara pulled out understandably so and I don't even think they formally pulled out I think everyone just kind of assumed yeah I don't think Del quad's coming yeah but in more exciting news Ryan getting back onto the bullish and exciting side of things uh did you listen to chain smokers oh yeah dude really like I mean especially when they were huge like it's just good music to just chill to relax I don't know why I thought that was surprising I didn't really take you for a Chainsmokers now that you've met me I like that I'm like a pretty cool guy Ryan's actually cooler than I thought guys yeah uh he listens chain smokers chain smokers also cooler than I thought because they're doing nfts surprise surprise uh so with the platform Royal Justin Blau uh his Royal platform we did a show on that if you guys want to dive into that uh it allows you to tokenize your your uh songs and get your streaming royalties out of it on it so Chainsmokers you can buy a chain smoker song Ryan because it's nft on Royal uh so that's that's a really big deal Chainsmokers are like probably top probably in the top 10 bands of uh currently like if the team smokers came on the bankless podcast this would make me like the coolest person alive to like my family to like my kids it's my friends yeah so I think that needs to happen man I think we've got to work on that we're talking with The Chainsmokers manager oh my God oh my God that'd be amazing uh also not just the chain Chainsmokers but music platforms Spotify yeah Spotify also getting into nfts uh so like shout out to Cooper Turley for just meming music nfts into existence because I guess it's working uh so Spotify trialing music nfts on his platform uh I think we're gonna need some more details out of this but the the quick take here is that selected us-based users were able to see some of the nfts of artists on the platform so we already saw Instagram doing an nft uh feature there's literally nft tabs on Instagram now yeah uh and like Spotify uh there there's videos and like lyrics and like uh album artwork and Spotify so they're really getting into the whole multi-media thing now they're doing nfts guys this is the story here okay this is the story of web3 use web 2 platforms for distribution use them to distribute that's what their Algos are good for that's what they're optimized for use web 3 to build community and to own distribution versus ownership so web web 3 is not possible without web 2 the distribution like the memetic energy the ability to spread ideas and Concepts and gather communities but web2 is not where your platform is that's not where you own things uh and so uh yeah this is this is another example of using Spotify as a distribution tool to get music nfts out there and uh are you ready to say Cooper is right about music nfts dude because you were a little skeptical I'm still skeptical I'm so skeptical uh we'll see we'll see what happens uh I mean there's plenty of reasons as to why music nfts need to exist and like this might not even be music nfts it says that they will just link to some external nfts so it's really up to the nft ecosystem to make nfts because whatever nfts are done by the artist go into the artist page right so it's I think it's form factor agnostic yeah uh so either way Spotify wins yeah um but like leaning into like how we need web 2 uh to to do web three things like web 2 is where you flex and then web3 is you where you own what you Flex oh yeah nice take right yeah uh you're gonna steal that one for me no no no no it's yours it's yours okay uh yeah so I I think now we can Flex inside of Spotify too well thank God for that uh gotta Flex on your product Market fit right there uh David you know one of the big questions or like one of the big con the coolest part one of the coolest Parts about this conference has been meeting all of the people who have gotten a job in in crypto as a result of listening to the bankless podcasts and US berating you about how why you haven't quit your job yet no one's angry that we tell you to do this everyone is thankful so we're gonna say it again quit your corporate job it's lame it sucks it's not where you want to be you're listening to bankless because you know this already and you gotta find a way to get into crypto all right I don't know how many success stories I've heard of people who've been able to do this and sometimes it takes time right you have to invest your hobby like you have to feel like figure out what opportunities are a good fit for you but it can be done and it like so many people are so happy happy and excited and um just grateful for the opportunities provided for them on crypto and so yeah what do you want to say about that Dave I've berated enough everyone has their own Journey uh and so whether or not a Webster job is right for you it can only be determined by you but there's a man that we met and he uh it was joked about how like oh yeah every single week I just listened to Ryan and David tell me how I need to quit my job and at some point I was like you know what I should quit my job uh and so he did he didn't even have a job to land into he just started working in the Dow space and he said like the uh he was not prepared for how well it was going to work for him uh so I think there is a big net for you to fall into into the web 3 world uh and so here are some jobs that we're going to talk about I think actually before we talk about some of these jobs that you can fall into uh sometimes like people tell us like oh yeah I quit my job and I joined web3 and then like I think we've actually killed more jobs than we've created oh yeah we've killed a lot of jobs we are a total job killer but then we revive it on the other side right you gotta you gotta cross that castle but the amount of Bankers even I've talked to so many people in tradfy who are like now now in crypto it's amazing all right I should read some of these out I don't know I don't know how to dance but like you know I'll just do this okay David's fist bumping Business Development lead at Goldfinch a marketing manager wanderverse Incorporated VP of engineering zkx head of growth ckx lead Q Community manager crypto skulls Dow senior product designer parcel Incorporated I could go on but I don't need to because they're all for you available for you on the bankless jobs page bankless.pala.xyz slash jobs if none of those appeal to you just submit your resume to the talent Collective and plug in and uh make the jobs fight for you yeah they'll come for you play hard and get a little bit right uh David you ready to get into a few more things to finish out our new section with releases a16z's report yeah so you were actually on a stage with Chris Dixon going through a few of these things but a16c released the 2022 state of crypto report uh a16c actually puts a ton of money into research and so you know they're going to come away with a lot of fantastic data Ryan since you're on the panel what are the big takeaways that we should focus on I think the big takeaway is uh the state of crypto is strong like Dixon said oh thank God he's never seen he's never seen more interest from a talent perspective in the heart of silicon Valley in what's going on right so prices are down but inflows are up product ideas are up talented Founders in the space are up and and don't forget guys price is a leading in it is a trailing indicator of talent okay so what people like Chris Dixon track are the amount the energy the talent the human resources pouring into this space who cares about pricing because pricing will just follow the talent that's building in the space so uh yeah I've got to take on this a little bit later but um we're still strong and the other thing that's in this report is we've been through these Cycles in the past right like this is a fractal we've seen this at least three other times maybe before and this is uh again what we're seeing is Talent inflows while prices are going lower there couldn't be more differences between the 2018 to 2020 bear Market versus the one we're going into right now first off we are flushed with cash yeah like every single team just raised a bajillion dollars yeah so there's a ton of money out there to pay people to work in crypto that like in stark contrast to 2018 where companies actually it's like just close up shop and left yes because we did not have any money yes so there's a huge safety net for what's getting built do you remember like Ico treasury's just dissolved over right totally yeah dumping and dumping and dumping and just like yeah even like layoffs on layoffs and layoffs that's just not happening right now it's actually the inverse people are hiring because everyone just raised at insane valuations uh so like the whole entire industry is short up uh and so we're gonna onboard a ton of people and you know what they're going to do with their brand new web 3 paychecks well they're going to buy it they're going to buy crypto you mean working in the industry is not like yeah that is the ultimate way to be bullish right yeah people that work in the industry they don't go and buy the S P 500 right yeah I uh I haven't bought stocks in a while David that's true although coins looking pretty attractive these days that's true that's the only one yeah you know the last thing I'll say is a polygon just it feels like they're crushing it one thing that's slipped below the radar we haven't talked about because it's not super sexy but uh is Enterprise blockchain stuff Ernst and Young just unveiled a supply chain tracking service on polygon Nightfall which is another polygon chain uh and I think we'll be seeing more more of these Enterprise use cases in the future they're being built on in the background this is like the dream of 2016-2017 starting to be realized yeah there was a lot of like critiques as like Enterprise blockchain and and to me for even for a while uh it's always been confusing to me is what the hell that is but after talking to Paul Brody at the ey who's an absolute genius yeah I will not fade Paul Brody in the slightest he he's a killer and he knows exactly how to get blockchains into the world of uh into a world of Enterprise uh so when I see him doing stuff at ey uh I know their signal there yeah and last thing we'll say on this a16z a 600 million dollar gaming fund okay I thought we were broke right I thought this was a bear Market how you race in 16 uh six thousand six hundred million dollars did I say that right the first time I don't know 600 million dollars and this is after framework to your Vance Spencer and Michael from framework they just raised just on the stage right now yeah yeah a few hundred a billion a million as well so uh David what's coming up next man oh my God we got our favorite new segment questions from the nation there's just one of them uh this time but then also a super hot take from vitalik buterin about taking fees from each staking protocols uh so we'll get to that and coming up next if you have not yet

back leading into questions from the nation this is a weekly thing that we do every single roll up I'm actually really enjoying them uh the Tweet out of bankless HQ goes out every single Wednesday so if you're on Twitter and you want Ryan and I to answer one of your questions you got to go find that tweet uh we try and uh uh find the best question that we think is the most fun to ask uh the number of likes on that question also helps as well uh we only got one this week because we're also super busy we've got to get back to permissionless stuff uh question from tomato.eath I guess I have to ask this to myself uh what was it like to finally meet the Hologram in person hey hey now the Hologram the Hologram fake okay not a hologram uh so I'm gonna I'm gonna uh I don't know what to do how to call this maybe a slight docs but like Ryan uses the filter on Zoom yes and so when I see him in real life I'm like oh my God there's like High Fidelity here yeah it's just like why do you why why do you have so many wrinkles you've got whiskers right you are a dad uh it was pretty funny there's the Finding Nemo meme of just like uh the the when the fish are in the water but they're still in their plastic bags like all right now what yeah it was a little bit of that like uh gave Ryan a hug it's like uh okay do you know it's funny so um I couldn't get in the house at first like I was like I was looking for the key I must have been sitting at the front door for like a minute yeah or something before you guys let me I was on the other side of the door because we were here tonight I thought I was in the wrong location and then we took um quickly after we took this selfie I just looked like my hand placement is super awkward dude I was like I didn't know where to put my hands I don't know what to do you took it so quickly yeah anyway it's it's really cool to meet in person David man it's it's uh it's been a blast and uh now you can testify him no longer hey I don't know man AI technology is getting real good these days we got to put that rumor to rest it's over now uh I'm only 99 sure uh you'll never be 100 sure you'll never be 100 sure uh let's get to some takes this is the spice from vitalik buterin laying it down on the theme of of actually staking and some staking centralization here what's this about yeah this is uh in conversations of Lido getting a ton of liquid stake share so because the St eth pair out of Lido where you put your eats you get SCS back it's dominating the market and there's centralization concerns around lydo and so vitalik says speculative controversial take we should legitimize price Scout price gouging by top stake pool providers like for example if a stake pool controls greater than 15 percent of total e-stake it should be accepted and even expected for the pool to keep increasing its fee rate until it goes back down below 15 which actually just makes sense so if you are something of your staking provider and you're monopolizing all of the e-stake yeah start jacking up the fees because you have the Monopoly and make those fees go up also that will incentivize a wider distribution of eth across the staking ecosystem to balance that thing out so you actually it's bullish for the Dow when Supply goes up but then you get to turn on fees you get to turn on more fees as the centralization goes up to discourage centralization but also you get to capitalize on on your power so it sounds like a nice balance yeah it is it's a good so what's interesting to me and I think we're going to do we should do a lot more content on this like there's there's honestly there's no rush because I don't think think like you describe it as like when withdrawals are enabled post merge and again post merge and then another hard Forks it's going to take some time it's gonna be like a giant snow globe right everything's gonna reset we don't really know what the market share of these uh staking services and you know self-staking um what that breakdown is going to be until we shake that that snow globe but what what vitalik is talking about here is some decentralization on the layer zero on the social layer you're saying let's make it socially a thing right that staking providers do they commit to socially if their market share exceeds say 15 right that they'll start to gradually increase fees and that would be sort of a social good it's unclear whether that's a profit Maxima maximalizing take right like so I would assume the profit maximalist if your staking provider is I want to own the market I want to be the Monopoly in the market but it's not a bad mechanism and it does call like raise the fact that some of our decentralized Protections in crypto will actually always be on the social layer right right like here's another example of this we tell you every week go bankless take custody of your own keys we're doing that we're communicating that on the social layer client diversity client diversity it's it's run your own node if you can if you have those capabilities um that's how we keep that's how we keep the system decentralized too is on the social layer and I think the uh the staking Wars Ryan are definitely coming we have uh the coinbase uh uh release of their staking as a service protocol for institutions right now we got Lido and rocketpool and stakewise live so these are the three we just had the the coinbase announcement go live as well we have opal Network coming we have swell coming uh the East staking Wars are gonna be hot they're going to be hot it's gonna be hot we're gonna be talking about it a lot and of course I think people want Insight in terms of where they should stake right it's still a little bit risky we're pre-merge uh to stick right now I don't know how do you do you stake you stick you know of course yeah I steak bro ice steak David steaks uh what's this next tweet leading into Matt Huang from a paradigm he says the most important long-term fundamental indicator for crypto slash web 3 is the quality of talent inflows we've talked about this a few times so far on this podcast not only are the inflows still strong despite a jittery Market but they appear to be accelerating as many web 2 stock packages are down 50 to 80 percent The Great Migration of 2022 uh just really leaning into this meme of as crypto goes down in prices Talent goes up in Supply it's true that's what you've seen and that's another that was also reflected in the a16z report uh from Chris Dixon let me go back and read our jobs list oh my God no just like skip back if you're listening guys just go back okay here's go go back to the page where you listen to the jobs and then we'll resume here get a job in crypto get a job uh here's a here's some guy uh Ryan Sean Adams tweet build the dip yeah that's a new take yeah I tweeted that out in the audience while you were giving your demo David you were on Twitter while I was on stage no just like you know sometime ideas come to me like you inspired it how about that and I was like look at all these things we're building this is web 3 social like for the first time uh we're actually seeing products that I feel like could achieve product Market fit in transaction and that's the message remember last last cycle 2017 there's this whole meme of buy the dip buy the dip cool buying the dip is cool but you know what we're here to do build the dip okay build through the dip and that's honestly what I'm seeing at this conference what I'm seeing in in the crypto Community right now is this resolve right so people are bearish prices like everyone thinks everyone here thinks we are headed into a bear Market but you know what they're all resolved to build through this absolutely like there is comp there's so much confidence that we're gonna come out on the other side even stronger that this industry is here to stay and that like the things we built during this uh this I don't know year period two-year period two-month period who knows during this brief this period of time brief in the in the whole trajectory of crypto this will be an epic opportunity for Builders and also for buyers but let's build the dead man I think if you zoom out in crypto we're actually not well it's always time frames are always uh an issue but we're really in a 12-year bull market oh yeah and so like the bull market hasn't ended it's just a dip uh and I'll just reiterate this uh because I said it a couple weeks ago but like I'm sure a lot of people probably have exhausted all their money because they aggressively bought the dip maybe too soon I don't know either way you're gonna run out of money to buy the dip yeah and so how do you gain more exposure to crypto yeah uh here's what I did in 2018 is I uh started like built a podcast POV crypto my first podcast turned that into a company with bank lists uh and that turned my social network into a crypto social network just leveraged every form of capital that I had into the crypto world uh and it's best done in bear markets some people might say you're Overexposed David I'm looking under all couch cushions trying to find different ways to leverage myself up on crypto without actually taking this man last Friday was selling his furniture on a bankless live stream and I expected patio furniture in San Diego hit me up I expect those proceeds went into buying Eve okay not sure but I expect it what are you excited about man oh my gosh there's so much to be excited about like all the things that just got launched and announced at permissionless are new toys I want to play with yeah I'm excited for you to become a conferencer I think you got conference pills Ryan it's extremely exhausting I mean I don't know how I have this much energy right now I feel like I could go to bed uh but like there's conferences ahead are absolutely insane we got ECC in France uh we got uh Defcon in Columbia coming up Ryan am I gonna see any of those oh wow no commitments okay because this is recorded no commitments but I I will say uh do you want to ask me what I'm excited about what are you excited about it's crypto conferences look man I'm excited about the crypto Community the energy here is palatable right like you look around here and uh the bear Market is fiction right they're back to what we said it's numbers on a screen all right who cares there is no bear Market here and the community has so much energy uh the bankless community in particular oh my gosh dude showed up to this conference I don't know if it's a third half of it feels like half of the attendees and um like people that I know their Discord handles you meet them in real life uh it's it's funny so what David and I do right obviously uh there's a lot of social media chatter and one thing that I was telling David is what I see often is is kind of the negative comments right like go scan any YouTube comment on Bank list and there's bound to be so many be like these guys are schillers people are people writing nasty comments as we speak talking us right now and like you you just hear that right it's like and but the people in real life these are the people that are building these are the settlers not the tourists right these are not the trolls it's just a tremendous amount of energy and uh it's really cool to see um the impact that the bankless movement has had because I'll just say it again and we've said it before but bankless is not a podcast it's not a newsletter bankless is a social movement and the end goal of that movement is freedom okay wealth is also a path towards freedom and it's all connected here and uh I'm just seeing a lot of a lot of gratitude a lot of grateful people a lot of people excited even the bear Market to be on this journey right the the frogs don't come to the conferences Ryan yeah it's very very refreshing shout out to all of the different parts of like the bankless uh organization The Bangles Community uh the the Dow punks were out in force uh the Dow Punk jokes are so identifiable uh so nice job with that Sinjin and the bankless Dao uh bankless Academy also had their own shirts and their own branding thankless Consulting is getting like the most amount of rep I've seen out of the the whole it was it's absolutely insane yeah uh and just like all the banquet swag apparel is like very easy to identify and very it's I love it when I see those shirts uh so like shout out to the bankless community this has been awesome to meet you I don't know a bankless Academy or bankless Consulting is it's cool because neither did we really it's like the the bank listow is self-organizing and creating all sorts of paths for people to get jobs in web 3 and launch careers it's just incredible and I'm super excited about it man uh David I think we've got some footage at the end of this of us meeting but first we're gonna go all like you know we gotta launch them on you here's this we're gonna show
