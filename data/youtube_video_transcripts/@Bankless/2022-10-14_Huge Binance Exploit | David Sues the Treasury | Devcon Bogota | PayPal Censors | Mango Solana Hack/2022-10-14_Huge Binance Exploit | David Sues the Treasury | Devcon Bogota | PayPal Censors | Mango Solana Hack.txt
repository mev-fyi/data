the BNB chain was halted halted after a billion dollar pack Vegas Nation happy second Friday of October it is roll-up time it's also a special Devcon roll up David you are hanging out in Bogota Colombia at Devcon this week how's it going man really good man uh Bogota is a ton of fun and Defcon is just going absolutely fantastically there's there's so much energy here at Devcon and it does kind of feel like the last like bonfire of energy in this bear Market in the crypto space but everyone is just really excited to be at Defcon the talks and content is just they're very very rich uh just people are stoked man people are really stoked to be here David deficon is an ethereum specific conference or is it wider than that and then like this is the first time it's been in person in a while because of you know covid and everything else right so this is the first time the entire ethereum Community is is there so like give us a sense of the vibe right and to what Defcon actually is yeah yeah Devcon is I would say like the foundation of much of the rest of global ethereum conferences it is the uh well it's not only actually anymore but it is the conference thrown by the ethereum foundation so yes it is ethereum specific in years previous however there has been many other uh exposures to other chains um EOS and ethereum classic famously were had a significant presence and El Grant has significant Presence at um uh when was it Osaka uh which was the last Devcon that happened in 2019 there has not been a 2019 right there's not been a Defcon in three years and that's it's actually made uh this Devcon many many people's first Devcon including myself which many people are surprised like oh David you like you've been in crypto forever this is your first Devcon yeah uh and many other people are I've also like not been able to go to the devcons uh prior I remember Devcon uh 2018 in Prague I had just gotten into crypto and I like I was just like you know I couldn't couldn't convince my company to send this like person that they just hired all the way to fly to go to Defcon uh and then 2019 was Osaka and like kind of kind of the same deal like if so soccer was going to be a four or five thousand dollar trip and ether was like a hundred dollars I was like I really want to go but I'd have to sell some ease have to not buy some meat and so this is my and many others first Devcon uh and it's it's I mean ethereum as an ecosystem is just completely different from last Defcon last step on was 2019 at like one to two hundred dollar ether and there was no D very little defy absolutely no later activities no layer twos uh plasma was our scaling solution at the time uh yeah right uh and so like it's just a fundamentally different Devcon uh and I mean they made this really cool video I'm gonna see if I can get the video from the EF uh and just do something with it but they made this really cool intro video and man I got goosebumps dude of just like the road to Defcon and like what it took to get here going through like oh like you know if Dev connect the merge EIP it was like a speed run of the last like three years of ethereum history in like this really cool animated like promotion video it was really really cool and I I know this is uh ethereum community ethereum ecosystem and it's it's heavily like a Dev the Devon Dev con stands for developers so it's a heavily developer sent Centric kind of conference like how many people are there we're in the thousands right oh in the many many thousands uh I I don't know numbers so I'm going to spitball here I think something like eight to ten thousand people wow maybe don't quote David on that maybe less than that five to ten thousand have fun definitely five thousand five thousand Fields definitely yeah I'm gonna go with like 8 000 ish um but you're and you're totally right and like the it is I was talking to people about this at Defcon it's not even like application layer stuff there's not many like defy apps or nfts conversations at all the conversations are it's the ethereum protocol EIP 4844 uh account abstraction uh post merge stuff uh layer twos uh like it's like staking infrastructure uh it is some we are deep in the protocol deep in the protocol stack like we are not either this is the focus of this conference is like below the application layer so like not even D5 apps have exposure here uh are you seeing any suits any suits and ties no suits no suits as he should be sorry all you suit wearing Dapper uh you know gentlemen and gentle ladies that's just you know it's nice to just kind of chill and be with the developers and kind of wearing whatever's comfortable you know what you know what's also been fun Ryan what I don't think you know this no I much see so it's in Colombia so it's been a little bit of fun I've been practicing wow well done how is it holding up how's your Spanish holding up with the names Argentina so uh I've been like shaking off some Rust but it's been good that sounds impressive actually uh bankless Nation rate David's Spanish right now in the comments tell them tell them how he did uh but you gotta appreciate the effort right that was great David yeah uh well anyway we got a lot of topics to cover this week the first is of course Devcon what's going on there have been a slew of announcements coming out of Devcon that we got to talk about also big announcements big announcements people are super surprised by yeah so we're going to cover that also we have the BNB chain that was halted halted after a billion dollar hack David are chains supposed to halt not not the ethereum chain but we'll talk about whether it's appropriate for other trains and finally we've got uh The Ultimate Showdown I think David Hoffman versus Janet Yellen yes David podcast we're gonna talk about that all right David has been named as a co-plaintiff in a case against treasury but it's not a bad thing it sounds like a bad thing actually but it's actually a really good thing we'll get into that and of course as always make sure you like subscribe and review wherever you're watching this wherever you are listening to it with your morning espresso with zero sugar or milk yeah oh that's amazing I bet the coffee in Columbia is pretty tasty right it's just pretty decent yeah um all right well before we get in I want to talk about our friends and sponsors at Galaxy they want to invite you on a defy crypto Adventure it's adventure time in crypto David what is Galaxy what are these guys up to Galaxy is your digital passport for exploring the metaverse exploring web 3. they have a bunch of quests and tasks and things to go do in the world of crypto and once you go do those things you get to log a little badge a little gym badge a little credential in your web 3 passport given to you by Galaxy so they are producing little things for you to go do go and explore the Frontiers if you will to go and get some tasks done and then you get to show the world that you did those tasks that you are an actual Frontier Explorer and you know surface area for other opportunities if you will and so there is a link in the show notes to go get your web3 passport from Galaxy you can start exploring different parts different optimism Arbitron wherever wherever people want you to go explore you can get paid to explore or at least get a badge sort of like a pull-up to go and explore the metaverse yeah some of these uh some of these campaigns as it were they have rewards on the other side so if you were a gold hunter you can go uh check out those rewards also that passport you're mentioning David that's actually a soul bound token which is pretty neat I love these experiments with identity on chain uh using a sold bound token for this so go check out uh don't trigger Evan McMullen too hard that's a little hard it's fine um that's galaxy.com passport uh to get to that g-a-l-x-e.com is the URL so Galaxy spelled g-a-l-x-e David let's get to markets uh Bitcoin this week how we doing uh it's down it's down a solid nine percent uh so start of the week at 20 200 ending the week at 18 400. down week sad music okay how about eth down as well yeah down a little bit more down ten and a half percent start of the week at 13.70 ending the week where we are now at 12 40 12 20 ish give or take David do you think we're gonna dip on eth below a thousand again [Music] certainly in the cards for sure it's certainly in the car it's not going to say no not going to say yes um I'm veering towards yes on that um I mean if we if we roll back at the last bear Market we hit 80 and then we hit like 92 and then we hit like 95 across like 18 months of time what's our low right now on Eve I think I think it's like 170. yeah and that was a quick and your boy bought 897. so that is the best bottom tick I have ever done all right so uh David time the market really well at that time but maybe we'll follow that for now for now I can't wait to um beat David and buy uh 800 and would you buy Shush get out of here what'd you buy 800 and so I'll do it you're gonna set your limit orders for 8.96 yeah yes eight I'm gonna set my limit orders for 8.95. and on we go and this is how we end up with it no cash this is how you get price Discovery I guess we're laughing about this but um it is a pretty steep bear Market I mean like we're we're like at this these prices we are um below the all-time high of the last cycle which was like 1440 something like that so um we'll talk about why this might be the case it's all screaming macro to me um how about the eat the Bitcoin ratio we down on that too yeah down a little bit 2.5 down to 0.663 and how's the crypto market cap holding up overall no longer being measured in the trillions we are now at 934 billion dollars so well below one trillion dollar market cap we lost our T status we backed it to bees um all right well let's talk about macro okay because this is the cost is all happening yeah why is this happening to us that's why us right now of course crypto crypto goes in Cycles um but I think one of the the catalysts and the things that are like preventing uh some of the crypto markets from from rising again is uncertainty in macro and boy there's a lot of uncertainty these days the big news this week was the CPI number that is the September inflation report just came out and uh David the numbers are higher than expectations um the CPI Consumer Price Index Rose 8.2 percent in the year that is annualized through September I think expectations we're hoping for 8.0 8.1 so a little bit higher on that and we're still in the eight range David uh so not good I guess just to recap um in August we were CPI of 8.3 percent that's annualized of course in July 8.5 percent in June 9.1 percent so from June to September from an annualized perspective we went from 9.1 percent to 8.2 so we're still down um but you know we're not down as much as uh some analysts and I think the market was hoping for and expecting and so do you know what this means David numbers go down and also Powell wants one number to go up which is the um the interest rate and so the next fed meeting is November 2nd uh the Market's anticipating another 0.75 uh basis point hike so that is definitely coming down the uh the pike for us and um yeah I mean this is just simply like uh rate hikes will continue until inflation comes down right so this is like pretty exactly what I'd say the beatings will continue until morale improves yeah and so we've got some more beatings uh to go through from from the FED it's an interesting question I think a question that we we want to bring some macro folks here to answer on Bank lists which is like is this actually effective can you break the back of inflation by raising rates I mean the story The Narrative keeps going back to like Paul like volcker uh the Fed chair the 1980s who allegedly broke the back of inflation uh is that really what did it or conditions different are there other factors at play I would love to get in a conversation with with somebody on the macro side about whether this strategy is actually effective but in the meanwhile David you could see the sell-off the sell-off event when those those are some large Down Candles yeah it was the SC 500 gold Bitcoin and Euro all just tanking in a single candle as soon as this report came out exactly Global correlation yeah this is one of those uh moments where like correlations all go to one when times are bad that's exactly what this looks like yeah that's what's happening but I will tell you one thing which is which is kind of interesting is how crypto is faring relative to uh traditional markets there's kind of one stat so after um the CPI numbers came in the U.S 30-year Bonds were down 2.5 percent as as you might expect so bonds go down um but also eth was down 2.5 percent it was interesting like the uh the risky asset you know you'd expect each to go down by 2.5 or a lot more it was down the same amount as bonds bonds are supposed to be the stable asset and they're not performing as the stable asset in this market so I start to wonder if like um we'll have crypto markets bottoms is our you know our is prices and some of the volatility shifting to more the traditional markets that could be what's happening my take here is that the hot air has already left the crypto industry and so when macro goes down we're we're also going to go down with it but we're not going to go down in an outsized way like we went down in an outsized way from January to May of 2022 and then everyone got liquidated and now we've kind of like found some sort of floor-ish and as that floor lowers because of macro we will follow that floor down but we're not going we're not going to like puncture through that floor in the same way that we did in the first half of this year that's my take I largely agree with that I think crypto already took took its lickings and got beaten down and now traditional markets are taking theirs this is uh people are under appreciating the fact that we do not have another three hours Capital like Leverage event and like maybe maybe we do because you don't really know if you have one of those or not so it's kind of impossible to claim but I I don't know man like if it if it would have happened last time like we already did that yeah I can't imagine there's a second one the things that are still standing are now on much more firm solid foundation um this is a tweet from Zero Hedge the FED finally did it they broke the market the Dow Jones which is of course the 30 largest industrial stocks on the planet is now officially more volatile than crypto this is a volatility index of um uh Dow Jones uh and crypto versus uh US Dollars and so the stock market now performing with more volatility than crypto that that lends a bit more credibility to to what you just said I think David yeah and this is a theme that I have been trying to just get into people's heads because I think it's I think it's the right theme where uh and I've said this in a number of different capacities where uh crypto is becoming more and more suitable for mainstream well the mainstream world is needing crypto more and more and more and this is this is related to like our web 2 versus web 3 apps like Facebook algorithms rage rage algorithms are like pushing us into like oh I kind of understand why we need web3 a little bit better like there's an adoption story here the other time I've articulated this is that like normal the normal world is getting more chaotic as crypto is becoming more stable uh and that and so I'm taking this is me taking a Victory lap Ryan like when the Dow Jones is more volatile than Bitcoin like this is the old world's getting more chaotic and crypto's getting more stable and this is going to be one of the great if it's like the Benjamin Button like me uh like we were like Crossing and yeah yeah yeah I totally agree with that and I think what you're saying is the Victory lap is not that you're happy the Dow Jones is going down but but you're kind of saying like you predicted that um all the naysayers who said look crypto is too volatile for mainstream like we've we've long said people in crypto have long said uh just wait The Whole World's getting more volatile and that volatility is coming to you to you as well and crypto is just a bit more of a an honest market in terms of uh pricing that in early and I think that that is exactly what's happening um this is a another tweet um from Jim Bianco this is the early 20 he says this the early 2020 pre-pandemic peak in the S P 500 was 3393. as I write and he's writing October 13th so this is on a Thursday as I write the S P 500 is 3493 100 points away from erasing the entire post pandemic bull market we just erased that entire pandemic bull market all the money printing that went into stocks it's got on now we're back to where we were in early 2020 that's pretty astounding when you think about it that way yeah that is quite astounding and it's also worth noting that in early 2020 ether was 100 and Bitcoin was like four thousand dollars or five thousand dollars uh and so like crypto has made significant strides in that in the same time that the Legacy markets has just gone full circle yes and despite it of course if we're looking at now a uh the speed of the US interest hikes look at 2022 the fastest speed at which the FED has ever increased interest hikes at least ever in kind of like modern history uh it seems like so they are on a tear to increase interest rates and no signs of stopping yet uh we'll see if something breaks before they do David meanwhile on the crypto monetary policy side of things eth went ultrasound last week talk about that for a minute yeah so uh last week since the merge we had issued 13 000 ether about thirteen and a half thousand ether so last week the new post merge ether issuance was thirteen thousand today seven eight days later the post merge ether issuance is seven thousand one hundred we have burned about six thousand ether in the last seven days and so where we have been previously up to last week we were inflationary the last seven days has been extremely deflationary we've almost cut out fifty percent of all issuance in the last seven days and this goes back to what I was saying last week it's easier to burn ether than it is to issue it and you can recover a significant amount of ether issuance in a short amount of time so we've we've like taken three weeks of issuance and like deleted it inside of one week previously I think the issuance rate of ether the inflation rate the it was point two two percent up until at the very Peak we are now down to point zero eight percent in uh since the merge uh and so this is really cool this is really really cool the less cool thing about it is okay why is this happening why are gas prices like sustaining 30 gray and sometimes getting up to 100 again um it's because of a Ponzi yeah Zen crypto thing yeah I actually haven't looked into it myself but this is the discussion at um Devcon and so I'm kind of regurgitating what I heard is apparently this is like the new Ponzi thing um but this also goes back to my other take that ether is the index of ethereum and you don't have to buy every single token to have exposure to ethereum maybe this Ponzi just comes and goes every single token definitely not yeah maybe this Ponzi comes and goes but it burned it's burnt for almost 5 000 ether along the way uh and so uh yeah cool yeah it is really cool generalized exposure to Ponzi is nice well this is um and other things among them but like um this is an example so ethos ultrasound on the week it's not ultrasound overall since the merge but it could easily like you get another week like this and it basically is and uh what we're talking about of course is again a 94 issuance reduction post merge and uh that has not been priced in uh from the markets at all and the reason is because like during bear markets like these demand simply vanishes for ethers NASA everyone's kind of scared so demand vanishes but in in the backdrop a lot of supply is getting eliminated as well and so once that demand recovers I would expect to see some like rocket ships like back up because we have much less Supply uh to work with and there's much less availability I think I think that's the right take I think ether burned ether removed for the market I don't think does too much when prices go down like I don't think this East burn is going to save ether from setting new lows it's not but once demand comes back like you said it becomes the upside becomes a highly sensitive and so it is easy to recover uh price I think as soon as there's any amount of like meaningful new buyer net new buying of eth I think that's right guys we have a lot more coming up in the roll up David's going to get to all of the Devcon announcements that he saw well in Bogota and also I'm going to talk about the binance smart chain paw us why did it pause what happened did they roll back the chain talk all about that and then Hoffman versus Janet Yellen the fight of the century it's coming to a court near you David can't talk about it but I can and I'm going to how can all of this and more coming after we talk about these fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like civility while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network the brave wallet is your secure multi-train on-ramp into web3

click the wall icon to get started a lot of big announcements coming at Devcon mostly in the protocol layer of things as we were talking about in the intro David you want to take us through a few of these announcements uh yeah 100 because they're the really cool stuff this is the the building uh being expressed here at Devcon so we'll start with this one this is uh Liam on Twitter uh last night and he's from the uh the scroll team last night we officially announced the upgraded version of our ZK evm testnet over at scroll this is a huge milestone for both the scroll team and Incredibly early Community let's break down with this upgrade means for developers and users and there is a tweet thread in the show notes if you want to learn more Scrolls ezek evm test that is debuted and so if that is interesting to you as a developer or a tinkerer that is now something that you can go play with and so congratulations to the scroll team this is definitely the the ZK Roll-Ups are definitely a very hot conversation here here in Bogota and overall in the crypto space and I mean this is scroll between scroll polygon and ZK sync this is like one of the one of the big three of these the ZK evm teams uh and now we got a zke evm on testnet ready to go when you also add starkware maybe as a fourth yeah it's not a ZK evm they have not a ZK evm you know because because uh they don't actually have an evm because you have to kind of write it in cardio is it is correct they are a non-evm compatible uh ZK ZK roll up yes correct this is actually coming faster than I thought so yes big move for scroll and they they are purporting to be the most uh evm equivalent of them all of course that is that is their competitive advantage that is their like angle they are a uh trying to be as evm equivalent as possible beyond evm compatibility um and so there there is a fight for evm equivalents uh our optimism and arbitrum are fighting over evm equivalents scroll and polygon are fighting over evm equivalents ZK sync is specifically a one firm in the evm compatible Camp um that is their competitive Advantage a little bit in the same angle as like why stockware ones wanted Cairo a little bit highly optimized uh language or just some kind of tinkering um but but um ZK sync is like a little bit in the middle like definitely want to maintain evm compatibility but they think that they can make optimizations that um are better than the ZK evm uh or the an evm equivalent roll up uh so that is their that's their territory well speaking of um Arboretum which you just mentioned uh they had a big announcement too what are they uh talking about yeah this is huge they have acquired Prismatic Labs pry Labs uh prism a layer one client we have a layer two optimistic roll-up acquired a layer one client team which is crazy no one really thought that you could really do this uh and so uh this has caused a ton of conversations in this space as to what this actually means but prism is like the most used client in ethereum uh the one of the few people the first teams to come out and build start building an eth2 client which is now now what we call prism and that got acquired by arbitrum so Preston Van Loon Raul all of the prison team I think there's 10 or 15 of them ish are now uh under the arbitrum umbrella and they are of course going to continue working on prism but now prism is just a product of arbitrary this is kind of cool in that in that it kind of means funding secured right like business models secured for um for the team that's building a crucial client um there and obviously this is very you know good for arbitrum and you know I believe arbitrine when they say they're going to continue to support this and continue to maintain its credible neutrality I think there have been some concerns about this though is what happens if a layer 2 Team kind of maybe tries to buy it bias the layer one client in some way or you know is this unfair to other Layer Two so there's been some of that I don't know what to make of that we don't necessarily need to get into the arguments but what I will say is the feedback from that I've heard from Raul and Preston Van Loon and others is they're just excited about this and I know those individuals are here for the right reasons and I don't think they'd be excited unless they had a path to preserve the values of ethereum that they really care about so um I'm pretty optimistic about this overall I actually had the opportunity I was in a cab with Preston for like 20 minutes where we kind of talked about this so I have I can regurgitate some takes here I'm going to see if I can get him into an actual interview after right after this over at Defcon but we are also hosting uh Preston and Steven from arbitrum and and Prismatic on Tuesday uh this next Tuesday for state of the nation to talk all about this um but but Preston like one of the big reasons why he's so excited about this and then the whole team is uh him and Raul were running a company right they were managing like the grants incoming from the EF where they were previously getting funding for and they were doing like HR and like paying salaries and like normal company stuff but they're Builders like they just want to Tinker and so now that they are being like put under the larger arbitrary umbrella like they don't he doesn't have to like do any of the business operation stuff uh which I think he'd like you know if you're a builder you just don't really like to do that yeah also like salary bonus salaries are going up because they're going from Grants to like EF grants to again Under the arbitrum Umbrella uh and I mean they also get they also get to uh just like be financially be compensated for all of their hard work which you know grants grants aren't a business model yeah and so but so like so everyone's like super happy about it over on the prism team that's cool look and if worst case scenario they're not going to go evil but if they ever went evil it's open source code some other team could Fork it take it and run with it so um I think that's a net win for the ecosystem David speaking of net wins uh the makers of ZK sync just launched their layer 3 testnet now Steve from ZK sync was talking all about layer 3 on a state of the nation that we recorded with him a couple of episodes ago and they're already on test net for this what is what is this announcement telling us yeah so ZK syncs mainnet is coming in like 20-ish days we might actually be in the teens on that so ZK sync is actually much further along than the other two zkevm teams um scroll and polygon so their mainnet their ZK evm mainnet is coming very soon and so they have their announcement today is that they're layer 3 test Nets which are their app chains their hyper chains whatever you want to call them uh they're they're test nets for layer threes is now going live uh so they are like uh a decent step ahead of the other layer two teams because they are now working on their layer threes this is the same conversation as to keeping dydx on ethereum dydx had to leave ethereum because they wanted to produce their own app specific chain on Cosmos because layer threes were not ready yet in the inside the ethereum ecosystem and this is this layer 3 test net is that what would have been a solution for uh for dydx and so they're calling it Pathfinder and so this is now uh whatever it means to have a layer three test net I'm not too sure but it is now available for you so another uh big announcement from a polygon as well which we weren't really sure when their public test net for the polygon ZK evm would go live and it looks like it just went live at Devcon so while ZK sync is close to shipping on mainnet it'll be a guarded release by the way it's a main net with without any apps it'll be kind of like uh yeah with for for um yeah developers first so we won't be able to use it uh for a while until they kind of um you know release the floodgates but meanwhile uh from polygon ZK evm their test net just went live as well any uh takes on this announcement no again this is this is why the meta right now is the zkevm and the vitalik at roll up day which was a a roll-up themed uh conference one day conference hosted by scroll vitalik gave a uh his presentation uh and talked about just like yeah the ZK teams have really astounded their ship their shipping hard yeah he was he he was giving this narrative about like uh how the ZK evm the ZK uh ZK Roll-Ups were like going to be here in like 2025 to 2030 like sometime around there but bam no they actually came in 2022 and he said it's the one time that you actually see development a super accelerated Beyond like you know the merge was delayed sharding's not even here yet everything about ethereum has been delayed except for the ZK evm teams and you can see this all happening all at once at Devcon everyone saved their announcements to Devcon uh the ZK EVMS are basically here uh and so while you know we're all frustrated that like ethereum development is slow even though like cool now we have the merge so I'm not really going to complain too much um if the ZK the DK layer twos are are here and they are super exciting it's not just about cheap and fast transaction fees Ryan there's so much new doors that are opened up on a ZK roll up um more content on that and your overall Bank this ecosystem coming soon well we have Bank lists are uh cheering all of these projects on uh way to go everyone quick disclaimer on all of these uh projects that we just mentioned Ryan and I are investors in scroll uh Ryan I believe is an investor in arbitrum uh we are both advisors to Zeke async and Ryan is an advisor to polygon uh so we are very very involved in these layer 2 ecosystem uh and so those are those and also and also David holds some eth he's been known to hold a little bit oh yeah it's also really related to Ether I also hold these yeah disclaimer is out um Kevin owaki he tweets this I'm pleased to announce the launch of super modular XYZ we are Adventure Studio that builds regen web3 projects often on top of adjacent and adjacent to get coins protocols what is this from Kevin owaki what is super modular this was announced to Defcon yeah so Kevin owaki the founder former CEO of gitcoin is in gitcoin is now a Proto call it is now a Dao it is on its own and he's largely stepped back from the Dow kind of kind of in the same way Satoshi steps back from Bitcoin and vitalik set has stepped back from like he's even made time for a podcast hasn't even made time for the Green Hill podcast uh and so gitcoin is up and running and it just chugging along uh and so now Kevin uh the Perma Builder that he is has founded a centralized company that exists on top of the get coin protocol so I think Super modular the way to explain it simply is like the consensus for git coin uh a software Studio that builds on top of the git coin protocol uh and so Kevin nowaki just can't stop building uh a founder and CEO yet again um back back building out something centralized on top of his the decentralized protocol that he helps Steward so just Kevin a walkie it's just like Well Done sir and I also think this is just a great model of something that we see I think we will see and we have seen before and we will see again of Founders building something letting it become decentralized and then building a centralized company on top of that decentralized thing this is what we've seen with Hayden Adams and uniswap uh so Hayden Adams built uniswap release it to the wild now the unisoft Dao is in control of uniswap and now he's the CEO of unisop labs a software company that is building on uniswap and so I think this model is going to be something that we're going to see over and over and over again throughout um into the future I totally agree and I think it's a great model um all right well meanwhile this is everything that's going on on Devcon and I think you've got some more stuff to say about Devcon a little bit later but maybe we should talk about another event that happened this week and that was on the binance Chain so sorry the BNB chain I think they've rebranded this is not the finance chain here's a tweet from BNB chain the Twitter account due to irregular activity we're temporarily pausing BSC we apologize for the inconvenience we'll provide further updates here thank you for your patience and understanding that happened that tweet was cut out on October 6th was that last Friday David yes I believe that's right and then they also follow up that tweet to say to confirm we have suspended binance smart chain uh after having determined a potential exploit all systems are now contained and we are immediately investigating the potential vulnerability we know the community will assist and help freeze any transfers all funds are safe interesting because all funds were definitely not safe Ryan all funds were not safe okay so first of all um we could maybe we'll talk about the um the exploit itself and what that was um but let me just you know Park this because we'll come back to it later how bizarre is it that a Twitter account representing the chain itself can tweet like hey something went wrong we just paused it it sounds an awful lot like it's centralized exchange to me like you'd expect this from coinbase you'd expect this from FTX something happened we're pausing things but on a blockchain a little bit weird like the ethereum foundation we're pausing the ethereum chain because I don't know someone hacked their own inside chain like what the hell you're not supposed to be able to pause a chain but let's talk about what actually happened here's an article from decrypt decrypt reports that 566 million dollars of BNB tokens were stolen from a bridge so this was a bridge exploit a bridge attack um and then they froze the chain uh and so as once the attacker got hands uh their hands on a extremely large sum of money they started to transfer it out as fast as they could and all the different uh other Bridges so they bridged out to arbitrum I think they've also bridged out to optimism they bridge out to ethereum but then they then they froze the chain so the hacker managed to get away with 110 million dollars and then about a 430 million dollars was frozen and now is back in the custody of the binance smart chain operators uh and so the you know the freezing of the chain did say 430 million dollars um but the hacker has like 110 million dollars of various crypto assets across the space uh because they bridged out uh and so oof yeah oof yeah this is a summary of um of the hack so since the BNB chain was suspended the 430 million uh 430 million dollars on it cannot be transferred any further and this tweet goes through kind of all the details we include that in the in the show notes um this is from Sam cz's son who kind of goes over the hack and what actually happened and it appears David that the summary here is something went wrong there was a bug in the bridge the Finance bridge itself so uh there's a bug in the way that the binance bridge verified proofs which could have allowed any attacker to forge arbitrary messages I went through CMZ Sun thread and it was an extremely sophisticated bug uh it was I I mean I generally don't understand hard to find bug it's very hard to find Bug hard to reproduce I think I think this bug has been in binance marching since the beginning which is kind of the crazier now um so yeah this is like uh it's been in the bridge specifically it's been in the bridge it is a it is a 10 out of 10 complexity level bug so wow crazy so chain halted everything Frozen um the good news is if you if you think this kind of thing is is good news is that they were able to um get back a lot of the funds I think um how much of the funds was binance able to kind of like recover or freeze or uh what's the hacker prevented from getting away with about a little over 400 million 430 million dollars yeah so the hacker got away with it 10 million that's a large large amount yeah um so okay so what do you think about this I mean there are some people outside of crypto looking at this and being like well I'm glad the hacker didn't get away are you guys crazy uh the cops were on the beat they froze the chain they stopped the hacker from getting what do you want the hacker to get away with like a half half a million dollars and who knows who the hacker actually is right the last time on the Ronin sidechain uh turned out to be a state apparatus of North Korea do you want these types of events to happen and here you are on bankless saying like oh it's it's um uh it's out of character of crypto values for a chain to be able to layer one chain to be able to freeze things uh well are you sure about that do the ends justify the means in this case what's your take uh with that with that argument yeah I mean this doesn't I don't really think this surprises many people uh we buying a smart chain there's that Meme about like you know the the captcha of like you know select all the fire hydrants and then there's the meme of like select all of the binance smart chain validators and it's just cz's face like nine times like we know that this is the state of binance watching this isn't really surprising to anyone uh that it's centralized that they have the ability to freeze that they will freeze if an event like this happens you're saying no one was really surprised we all knew this yeah and so like I think that has been in these social contract of binance smart chain and so when we say like yeah this is against crypto values well yes in one way that's definitely against Bitcoin and ethereum values I don't think it's necessarily against binance smart chains values there's a certain social contract that Finance smart chain has and I think there's no there's no secret that it is centralized and like possible and the fact that we have ethereum and again binance marching is an evm Fork of ethereum and then it says Juiced up Geth so it goes super fast uh we have the UN irreversible immutable decentralized version of that is called ethereum and so I don't we don't need BNB to be that yeah yeah we have that option so if you would like to express those bankless values you probably transact on ethereum if you prefer the more like a certain kind a different level of settlement assurances in the sense that uh you trust that binance smart chain operators like CZ uh will be benevolent and do things that will prevent hacking and loss of fun and return like if you're an investor and you see like Finance smart chain halted and gave money back to investors that were innocent that might be compelling to you and for some certain set of people and so my take is that because we have ethereum I'm not I don't really care so much about binance doing this I would be much more cautious if I'm much more like reserved if like they were like freezing funds of like the uyghurs because the Chinese government told them to that's a different story well but that could but that could happen it connects right to be fair now you have these these these buttons that um centralized validators uh can press and have the ability to freeze you'd expect that they wouldn't just be used for for hack type situations right but but largely I agree with you I think what this does though is it really reveals that um BNB chain is a separate type of uh platform separate type of application versus something like Bitcoin and ethereum right and so it is it is a bit more like a bank it's a bit more like kind of fintech and I actually don't see a lot of difference between something like BNB chain and an actual like bank with a set of open apis that you can build on top of it's it's it's very similar if you're in that direction it's kind of like fintech where I have a problem is when people mistakenly think that they're getting into like defy when like or like that this thing is built on uh you know a permissionless base layer and really what you're kind of building is on a you know a set of validators kind of like a a bank API that's that's where I have a a little bit of uh the issue and it kind of masquerades or cloaks itself as being decentralized and it's really it's not nearly as decentralized as something like ethereum you could build on top of it maybe it's permissionless maybe it has some open apis but um you can't put it in the same category as a Bitcoin ethereum right and you touched on it just there but just to drive that point home and and I guess I'm defending CZ today uh it's permissionless to access is permissionless to build on uh it's it's like permissionless by default but like on a bank for example you can only do certain things and you can't do anything else on binance marketing you can do whatever you want with the potential that CZ will stop you from doing that later but you can enter that you can enter binance smart chain and do things freely in the same way of you can with ethereum you just know that like hey you might get stopped after the fact where a bank stops you before the fact binance smart chain stops you after the fact and then ethereum doesn't stop you at all so like it's what's the difference between ethereum and a bank well what's interesting to me is like some some you some people will say well David Ryan that's that's what users want I mean they want some level of protection and like I I hear that and I agree with you and I would say if you're a user that wants that go use binance Chan but what I actually think is that the true users of layer one block space aren't individuals like you myself or like bankless listeners right now they're actually other chains and so the true users of layer one block space are going to be the ZK EVMS the optimisms the arbitrums right and the question for these chains is what chain are you going to build on top of are you going to build on top of a chain where a small set of validators can like freeze things well if if you are then you are completely giving up your sovereignty you're not building on incredibly neutral uh censorship resistant base layer right and so that that is more kind of what I think if you're a user go use whatever chain that makes sense to you like recognize these trade-offs but if you're a chain which is where the big block space consumers are going to be in the future you sure as hell aren't going to build on something like BNB versus uh something that is much more immutable and has higher uh security guarantees yeah basically what you're saying is that uh these choices the specific social contract of binance Mark chain puts a limit as to like how much value can this thing actually host like how much what is the total addressable Market the address total addressable Market of pure strong immutability and strong settlement insurances is much larger than weak settlement assurances people can trust ethereum much more um and that's fine and that's that's the same take that I have about Solana and why Solana needs to stop going down because of settlement assurances you need to be able to have assurances that your value is secured and ethereum has that market pretty well cornered I will say like ethereum like if you're using ethereum I would consider you a user if you're using binance smart chain I would consider you a customer I would I would use semantics that's interesting yeah I would semantically Define it like that yeah yeah I um I kind of like that uh that that distinction I think it draws the right um mental models in people's mind um all right speaking of distinctions speaking of mental models actually there's no segue here at all I'm just gonna say it David is suing the treasury guys all right I'm I'm gonna kind of lead this story this is a post from the Block coin Center Sue's treasury over tornado cash sanctions of course you know coin Center they are a crypto friendly Legal Group lobbyist group based in DC we've talked about them often on Bank lists we've had folks like uh Jerry Britto and Peter from coin Center on the podcast to explain what's going on in DC and guess whose name is in this article guess whose name is on the lawsuit my own co-host if I can find it uh David Hoffman where are you there he is uh David Hoffman says and David Hoffman a digital asset manager there you go yeah digital asset manager yeah but let me read what's going on here this is from Jerry uh Brito from coin Center he is the lead at coin center today coin Center filed suit in federal district court against ofac count that is a branch of the treasury challenging its authority to sanction tornado cash immutable smart contracts you guys remember that tornado cash was sanctioned so no U.S citizen can legally use tornado cash a privacy mixer on chain on ethereum Jerry goes on not only are we fighting for privacy rights but if this precedent is allowed to stand ofac could add entire protocols like Bitcoin or ethereum to the sanctions list in the future thus immediately Banning them without any public process whatsoever this can't go unchallenged can you imagine that the slippery slope here we intend to win this challenge even if it's necessary to go to the Supreme Court and we'll keep you posted as the case unfolds you can read more about our suit here a big thank you to our coplaintist Patrick O'Sullivan David Hoffman and another Twitter handle here and this is the actual filing itself this is the first page on it listed as plaintiffs are our coin Center Patrick O'Sullivan John Doe and David Hoffman as plaintiffs versus Janet Yellen in her official capacity as Secretary of Treasury Department of the treasury and it goes on and the entire complaint is listed here I might read some sections on it but David I know you can't say everything about this case is a co-plaintiff but what can you tell us why did you get involved in this and what specifically is your role as a co-plaintiff like what are you filing this complaint against yeah so yeah so I'm suing Janet Yellen and treasury because I received the dusting from tornado cash to David hoffman.eath uh I don't know who sent it to me permissionless ethereum send me send me money that is now ofac uh OPAC uh against ofax sanctions and so as a result of that because somebody has sent it to my public address which I couldn't prevent them from doing that I now have to I I had to file a report with ofac saying hey somebody did this to me and to take time out of my day file this stupid report like do all these stupid things and then every single year Ryan for the rest of my life I have to do it again and so next year I'm gonna have to refile the same report saying hey still have this illegal money uh I still control it uh it's still in my wallet I'm not a criminal and I have to do that next year and I have to do that the year after that and I have to do it after that and the year after that for the rest of my life and the thing is Ryan if somebody sends me eth from 200 cash again I have to do that again every single time and so I'll follow two reports and I'll file three reports and so like the treasury as a result of their uh in my mind illegal uh listing of a smart contract which I can't do in my mind in my opinion uh I have to spend my life my time doing this stupid bureaucracy stuff that I don't think I should have to do and so this is an injury and I'm suing Janet Yellen in the treasury it's not only that as I understand it David it's unclear whether those that were dusted yourself included but also like uh like some celebrities right um Jimmy Fallon I think was Dustin it's it's unjust Shaquille O'Neal it's Shaquille O'Neal it's it's you're fighting for all of them you're fighting for Shaq you're fighting you're fighting for Jimmy Fallon I don't want them to have to waste their time either it's not just wasting your time I know that's a part of it but it's also as I understand it treasury has not said whether they uh could legally like legally it seems like treasury stance is you are breaking the law even by receiving this and so if you file then you are a good citizen thank you very much but they're only committing to de-prioritize uh charging you uh for for this illegal action that you've undertaken what is the illegal action receiving some dust that somebody sent you and these other individuals without their permission from tornado cash so um this is awesome I am so glad that coin Center is stepping up here David uh it's awesome that you're doing this man like I appreciate it we appreciate it the bankless community appreciates it it's bankless AF to take this to the court system uh and uh I'm proud of you dude like this is really cool this is I think this is a cool moment for crypto by the way I I will say this isn't the only lawsuit that we have so we have two irons in the fire as a crypto industry so there's the coinbase lawsuit that's going on in parallel and then there's this one from from coin Center and I think that the hope is we have two irons in the fire two approaches one of these either wins or it gets all the way to the Supreme Court and then something happens and the big macro fight here is the question of whether an American citizen can have on-chain privacy or not all right um and we have these we we have these rights on the internet I I want you to know every time you use encrypted communication protocol like https or something like this or you said encryption with without a social media company spying on you or without the government spying on you every time it's encrypted we have that inner communication protocols right are we going to as a country in the U.S allow citizens to have this in our value transfer digital protocols that's what's at stake here and if we lose this as Jerry Britto was saying we might lose the the larger Battle of having a censorship be making it they could make it illegal to run an ethereum validator in the U.S for instance right that that is kind of the the slippery slope why because unless you're running an ofac uh you know uh you know ofac sanction compliant eth validator you are maybe breaking the law right so we we have to take this to the court system it's a big bold move uh and uh I just want to say on the behalf of the the whole bankless Community everyone equipped crypto we appreciate it man and we're we're cheering you on um I know you can't talk about it very much more uh the good news is I can all right so I'm going to be keeping the bankless nation updated a bit more and in addition guys to cheering David on what you can also do is donate to coin Center because they are funding all of the legal expenses to make this happen David as I understand this is not coming out of your pocket right so they're funding this they are they are representing they're paying all the legal fees uh to take Janet Yellen and treasury to court over this is that right yeah that's correct yeah I could not do this without their support so like it's like David's face in the front but it's entirely coin Center in the back uh yeah the coin Center mullet yeah uh so thank you coin Center for for all the support and help helping spirit head this uh coin center.eth is where you can send money uh for uh if you would like to contribute um at Defcon people this this went out and and so while I was walking around a Devcon and people were going up and hey like congratulations on like the lawsuit I'm like oh I guess congratulations I guess but seriously you know congratulations and I think it's going to take all of us kind of standing up if we're going to be able to protect our digital rights in the 21st century here and a quick quick speed is quick speed run through uh that remember that before Bitcoin episode that we did like we got we cryptography was made available because of a series of lawsuits that individuals sued the government and one in court and that is why we have cryptography and now we're just 1980s early 90s it was on the back of giants that we actually have the rights that we have today and now we're doing it all over again but now with cryptocurrency um so running it back Let's Make History um all right coming up next guys we got a lot going on including a whole bunch of hacks that happened October was hack month in crypto also PayPal getting a little authoritarian also PayPal is going to find you 2 500 if you're Politically Incorrect maybe because you said something on Twitter we'll talk about that story it's partially true um partially they've walked it back and also the SEC is coming after the board Apes of Yuka Labs we'll talk about all of that and more when we get back but first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum

ever for hex 718 million dollars across 11 different hacks this year there's been three a little bit more than three billion dollars across 125 hacks and of course it's always cross chain Bridges which has always been the weakest link in this entire industry uh it's accounting for 64 of this year's losses so congratulations October for breaking the record of hacks and just another quick show of the ethereum layer 2 ecosystem where you eliminate Bridges as much as possible in the layer two Bridges you kill the bridges and so cross chain Bridges layer one to layer one on side chains they're the weak link they're the reason why we have all these hacks optimism superstructure which is uh or super chain which we're going to talk about at some point in the future uh ZK syncs like hyperstructure all of these like single circuit layer twos are the bridged minimized scaling ecosystems and that's why that's why that's how we're going to eliminate all of these hacks so again that's why we're always bullish on these layer twos anyways congratulations to October for breaking records yes and not bullish on uh centralized Bridges not bullish on Bridges uh this was another uh hack that happened this week a D5 trading platform called mango just lost 100 million dollars in a hack that's included in those October numbers and I think the hack here David was an oracle attack yes of some sort what's crazy is uh oh my God it's so crazy yeah okay so why don't you read this out so the hacker stole 100 million dollars in this protocol exploited some kind of like an oracle attack where you pump the price and then you know through that exploit ran away with a bunch of money and then uh he said he was sorry and he posted to the governance form uh Hey guys uh please uh don't prosecute me why don't you read what this tweet is David yeah so the the hacker who stole a bunch of these mango tokens uh posted a governance proposal to re the hacker said hey I'll pay I will pay back the Dow uh the certainly like a significant amount of the money like most of the money 70 or 80 percent uh and if the Dow agrees to not pursue legal action and then because the hacker owns all of The Tokens The Hacker voted yes to the governance proposal his own governance proposal using the funds that he stole I don't check mate mango holders his code law I don't know but oh my God this is I don't think this kind of thing holds up I don't think this holds up in court what's the what's the analog I guess maybe you've got I have no clue dude go to Wells Fargo steal a whole bunch of their money steal a bunch of their shares and then go to their shareholder meeting and they're like hey uh don't prosecute me and I'll give you most of the money back and then you vote Yes yeah like you somehow steal all the certificates and I now own uh Wells Fargo because I own their certificates but you don't own them because you stole them that doesn't work yeah only Warren Buffett could uh has the Wells Fargo um shares to pull this off I guess um I actually think there's a take here and that is uh we got to get really serious about hacks okay so three billion dollars this year in hacks that's a lot New Year's not even over David and uh do you do you notice when things started to turn ugly in the U.S from a regulation perspective we're just talking about tornado cash um it happened after the 625 million dollar Ronin sidechain hack do you remember that and this was when North Korea allegedly uh some attackers from North Korea made off with millions of dollars and they pushed it through tornado cash and this is when the I feel like the US popped its head up and and the uh the defense apparatus of the U.S said uh-uh we don't like this this is like um you know against our national security interests to have these because what's happened is North Korea just got a new business model and that business models is hacking crypto so I I want us like one of my thoughts here one of my messages to crypto uh here the industries we think we're playing with these digital nfts and it's experimental defy games but this has actually moved beyond that I think crypto has taken uh center stage in geopolitics the geopolitical scene that's what we've entered we have nation states that are attacking protocols now not this guy from mango that was just some guys but in other cases the Roman side chain who did the the BNB chain hack we don't know yet and well I think this is inevitable and I think it's progress um hacks really matter I think we no longer get to say ah it's gonna happen hacks are going to happen I think that's true and I understand that's part of the experiment but could you imagine a hack that was like three percent or five percent of all each Supply and it went in the hand hands of uh like a rogue nation state right how is the the U.S national security apparatus going to react to that it's going to increase pressure and suppress uh citizen freedoms as a result of that so I guess my message here is um we as an industry need to get really serious about defense and spend more resources on crypto security and preventing these kind of things moving forward right and again it's one part let's let's write better smart contracts and it's another part is let's create systems that have less surface area for attack yeah less Bridges yes less Bridges bridges bad Bridges brat oh speaking of bridges here's a cross protocol a bridge protocol they just gave an airdrop uh what's going on different though it's an oracle bridge that lets you go from a one secure bridge to another secure bridge and again like it's not a multi-sig bridge it's not a multi-sig bridge and when optimism and ZK sync have their perfect uh fraud proofs and they have their circuits down like the optimism super chain like the many many many trains where there's a thousand layer three chains there's not a bridge there there is a single circuit there is no bridge that is the cool thing about optimism and all these layer threes and app chains on the layer two thesis the bridges are gone and so when you use this across which is this airdrop we're about to talk about and you hop from one bridge to another it's it you're using a bridge but you're only vulnerable in that one moment that you are using it not persistently through all of time and so anyways sorry ACS across has an airdrop so if you've ever used a cross perhaps multiple times there's a different criteria for uh being eligible for the ACX to in but a billion tokens has been minted and 125 million tokens will be distributed through an airdrop for the people who have contributed to across uh I am not uh local to my wallet at the moment so I don't know if I got it but I'm a frequent acrosser Bridge or uh Hopper or whatever you want to call it not Hopper because that's that's hop um uh but I'm probably I think I got this air drop so I'm going to go home and claim it as soon as I'm done with Devcon you guys we'll include a link where you can check that it's a cross.2 airdrop and you can see if you're eligible for that um David there was a a ruckus on Twitter as well that poured out about PayPal censorship and the first tweet I saw about this was from David Marcus formerly Facebook now he's working on a Bitcoin lightning project uh I believe he used to work at PayPal too he's like an executive at PayPal and this is as a result of PayPal issuing new terms of service for PayPal users David Marcus says this it's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to but PayPal's new terms of service goes against everything I believe in a private company now gets to to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with insanity and he links to a post that has now been taken down but the post from PayPal uh explicitly stated that they plan to Target anyone who is sending posting publication of any messages content or materials that quote promote disinformation how would they do this the company PayPal would just deduct two thousand five hundred dollars from your PayPal account if they deemed you were in violation okay so PayPal has since backtracked this has called it um a mistake uh it's not very it's not clear how these terms actually came to be and like why they were published but they're distancing themselves from this and they are backtracking uh from it here's a headline from fortune and PayPal tells users it will find them twenty five hundred dollars for misinformation then backtracks immediately and of course you know there is a take here that maybe PayPal genuinely made a mistake um who knows how this language got in um you know it's hard to it's hard to rationalize an explanation for for how this could be accidental but maybe some internal conversation that they never wanted to get out something like this uh the uh the the I guess the Devil's Advocate take on on that is well maybe they were just like floating this idea and hoping it would go unnoticed and there was such uh a reaction from the entire ecosystem not just crypto but outside of it to this that they decided to withdraw and and detract but the big concern here is obviously imagine a bank a bank account like PayPal digital account you say something on Twitter maybe I don't like the fact that you're suing treasury David and I'm PayPal and it's uh you know against my policy or or maybe it's it's you you tweet something and it's quote unquote misinformation I can then just shut down your account I can more I could take money out of here okay we don't service people who sue the government like could you imagine why not right like you just don't really know where this kind of thing ends what do you think about this is this uh tin foil hat conspiracy or do you think I'm I'm much less gracious than this and I think that it's actually quite obvious that like somebody chose that number that number is specific somebody said you know you know what we should do like we should find people two thousand five hundred dollars we like it doesn't the fact that that number is explicit it's not that like there's this detail of like PayPal reserves the right to deduct funds from your account if you uh say something like bad or something maybe or terrorist I don't know but like somebody had to choose two thousand five hundred dollars so somebody wrote that number down and said this is the amount of money that we are going to deduct from your account if uh under our discretion like doesn't matter misinformation spread whatever yeah and like and the reason why this is so there's that there's that take but also like we know the world of payments is just a huge era of censorship this is what this is what a like Amin solimani has been doing with like payment channels and spank chain so like MasterCard Visa they won't support like sex work for example that is censorship marijuana Industries exactly bankless has been kicked out of a bank accounts right Bank of America we're kicked out of bank Bank of America for for actually transferring money to coinbase right and this happens yeah this is the and so we know the payments industry is ripe with censorship I don't know like why it's so much but it's like you can't run like a sex work company or like a pot company without getting censored uh and so this is part of like the big story of like why we need permissionless Payment Systems because you don't want to get debanked de-platformed yeah and I think they are right now advertising crypto for us and this is why we need to go bankless of course um by the way another reason to go bankless is uh to add insult to injury David you know the Celsius hacks um a lot of people with deposits in Celsius loss a heck of a lot of money myself included rip um it seems like they also exposed all Celsius users to a data leak okay insane this came about in I guess in in the court system some court documents that were leaked that basically um docked the names because of course with Celsius every account is AML kyc so they have the identity and the amount of money individual Celsius holders actually had and there's a way you can kind of back through some of that data and find specific uh crypto addresses public crypto addresses that these individuals held as well nice essentially just doxed the entire Celsius user base as if losing your money isn't enough now you've lost your entire privacy and everyone knows the net worth that you had on Celsius just kicking you in the gut on the way out like absolutely insane man can you believe it that that crypto grifters video I made where I was like Alex machine she's the greatest grifter of all time thank God that's aging so well right now the other crazy thing is I remember last week we talked about the crypto Lark and how uh he got Zach xbt because of you know it's like pumping tokens and then dumping them cryptolarc withdrew 2.5 million dollars right before it froze like not I don't know right before I don't think that's a conspiracy here maybe he was just like luck that he withdrew 2.5 before it got frozen but crypto Lark the scammer got out cheese man uh it doesn't feel right but you still have money inside of Celsius don't you Ryan no it's gone I don't know where it is I had money in Celsius but yes um I actually don't know what the status of my information is but it's not looking good David rip I rip on that too double rip so yeah I'm right there with you bankless Nation if you got sucked into this fortunately for me it was just like I was just kind of testing Celsius and this was um play money sure ish yeah ish still wasn't play money for everyone so that's unfortunate yes and also sorry I got doxed but yeah totally it's brutal um board ape Creator facing SCC probe over unregistered Securities offering so going after you Yugo Labs the SEC may be going after probing first first you probe you know then you kind of drop your kiss so SEC do an old probe and uh Yugo Labs of course the creators of board Apes very prominence number is it number one number two nft project number one it's number one right now okay number one in market cap not culture in my mind but that's just mine what's interesting is um like one of the line items here is the SEC not only investigating yoga Labs or the sale of the digital assets right like they have a token some other things but the SEC is examining whether certain nfts from the company are more akin to stocks and should follow the same disclosure rules the SEC is also examining the distribution of apecoin here's the thing David like I don't know what parts of the ape coin ecosystem and all the various parts like what parts of those might be Securities and what parts might not be um but are they saying that like the jpegs themselves the ape jpegs themselves are securities they like the things they're investigating it yeah they're probing it and let me just say like a probe itself is punishment it's investigation I mean it's legal expenses it's punishment it has a chilling effect on the industry and here's my beef with the SEC and this type of action is we don't actually know because they refuse to clarify are nfts themselves the jpegs are they Securities are baseball cards Securities are antique card Securities are pieces of art security of course not okay do monkey jpegs really need a 10K filing right all right well okay do they need security my SCC is Yoga Labs is building out a metaverse right they took investment from like a16z and many other people to build out like this or yoga Labs board apes metaverse and in that metaverse a financial asset is a board ape and so the metaverse has some sort of value to it and the board ape is correlated or associated with that value so is apecoin uh and so it kind of actually does feel like a Howie test Ryan come and take my side of the SEC but also it just goes to show that we need better laws because it's a goddamn monkey picture it's not a security and we need to have permissionless building or else where this industry is not going to express itself the way it should here's the thing it's just the SEC they want to take a leadership position in crypto but all they're doing is vaguely through um like through these sorts of charges and probes telling us very obscurely what we can't do but they're not telling us what we can do right it's like they're just suing us yeah yes they refuse to give us basic Clarity that's my big charge and I I think that um as a result of this like so so for instance um I mean it's probably no secret we'd like to do more with bankless with uh some sort of membership nft right um what's the status of that thing how do we make sure that that's how do we make sure that that's not like Gary gensler's position is Right versus the SEC that's what happens here board do we need another one yeah you take the treasure I'll take the treasury hey what about this world where Gensler becomes the next Janet Yellen oh God that's a world that could happen too can we can I get a poab pursuing the treasury only if you win you gotta win for us all right uh anyway craziness um again I I'm sure there are things that are clearly Securities probably but like we don't know what the bright lines are and it feels like our Regulators aren't willing to actually talk to the crypto community and uh give us some clarity here I just want some good faith David um on the on the on the releases side LT you know LT because they're showing you uh total value locked for different layer twos now they're also showing you total value locked for Bridges and they're doing risk analysis of bridges which feels very relevant so you can look at the polygon POS Bridge multi-chain Rainbow Bridge Ronin V2 Bridge Avalanche Bridge all of the bridges and you can see how risky they actually are so this feels like a very timely uh release from Layer Two beat you could find that at layer2beat.com pretty badass uh what's this one David yeah this is never mind making an announcement that they have taken uni swap kind of imported it over to starknet so remember when we were going through all of the ZK evm conversations I was like uh ZK sync evm compatible scroll and polygon going after evm equivalents and then there's dark net which is just like we don't care about the evm we're building our own thing it's called Cairo so they have taken uniswap and they have Rewritten it tinkered it a little bit because that's what you have to do and then and applied it to the starknet ecosystem so a uniswap sister thing which is not exactly what unisop is because they had to change it is now on starknet and they are calling it uh what are they calling it uni Stark because they had to rewrite it for us so uni Stark which is a uniswap flavor is now on starknet that's really cool uh obviously get the scalability of starknet um do you see this David blockchain address is now available in Google search so if you just plug in a blockchain address uh Google will display it on etherscan I like this cool I also worry about like Google data surveillance and it's just it's just pulling from from etherscan it's not any more invasive than etherscan it's all published sure sure I guess this is true here's what I worry about David you start plugging in all of your eth addresses for for example in Google Google already has a profile for David Hoffman where it knows your search history it knows like your browser history it knows a lot of data about you yeah but okay where you are in Google Maps you're also complaining about the business model of zapper and xerion I don't I'm I I'm pushing you back on this I'm complaining I'm only complaining because it's Google and like zapper and xerian do not have the scope of a data profile on me that a Google has and so I just worry about these kind of of long-term effects I'm I'm happy that Google added this I just again it's it's kind of like uh how do we get out of this like moloch trap of um constant um surveillance Tech surveillance of us and uh that's the part that always gives me um pause but anyway in the meanwhile good job um David You released a new bankless video here what's this yeah so this is that new bankless YouTube account there's new YouTube uh new YouTube video is like these hyper optimized 15-minute explanation of what ether is it's basically my triple point asset thesis but if you are into these new videos go check it out all right you're gonna swap Labs is announcing 165 million dollar raise in series B funding to bring powerful Simplicity of uniform to even more people so congrats on uniswap labs they are raising and I believe that is the only raise of the week however Ryan I can see on the ground at Defcon that definitely there is some deals being made there are deals being Inked on the floor at Devcon so there are some activity it's definitely the biggest raise of the week I bet there are others that we miss but one thing that's happening we know is is uniswap as a result of this funding unit swap Labs is hiring the reason we know that is

show notes to join over 5 million users who are getting the most out of their crypto guys we're back with takes hit First Take David you watch the coin documentaries called coin a Founder's story uh what's your review how many stars uh five five out of five stars I thought it was super super good uh and there's also so many more movies about ethereum about crypto coming out like documentaries and I think it's going to be a very really actually great onboarding and PR tool for crypto movies it's like yeah let's tell you the story the long-term story of humans yeah and uh Brian and coinbase has always kind of been like a black box it's a little bit hey what's what's going on over there like what you guys up to like not for any particular reason Brian's just kind of an introverted person and every time I learn more about Brian either through his interview with Peter McCormick and then our podcast with him he doesn't do very many public things uh so this documentary was awesome just to see just the story of Brian and coinbase and I I tweeted out every time I learn more about Brian I discover more reasons to respect him and so he's just a guy that saw he he first coinbase was a wallet and he's like struggling to find like a business model because no one had any Bitcoin so he's like oh I'll just put in a buy button in the wallet and I'll let people buy Bitcoin so they can use my wallet and then he turned learn and said like actually that's the business it's selling Bitcoin to people that want to buy it and then the ball starts rolling downhill and coin base just becomes huge and and him and Fred Erickson started building this thing and so like as I've learned about Brian he's gone from like for me just a successful founder to an industry leader to like a straight up personal hero like that guy has like done so much for the industry and I don't think we give him enough credit but uh that's my take of the week uh the coin the coin movie was great and Brian's uh Brian's a great guy that that's awesome I um I I think David in like the the crypto Banks we're gonna have some banks that like stand up and uphold crypto values for us I'm hopeful Brian coinbase is uh among those I think there will be sadly some other crypto banks that kind of uh sell us out to the regulators and politicians and are not going to be fans of D5 and those will emerge too but um I think Brian's always been here for the right reasons and uh yeah we're um like excited about that uh David this is a take from a congressman representative bill huzenga yeah and bill says the fact that Gary Gensler has appeared twice with Jon Stewart before attending an oversight hearing with the financial crimes and enforcement and also the Democrats uh just like you know doing his job is alarming appearing before Congress is part of your job he says to Gary Gensler we look forward to seeing you in 2023 under new leadership so a congressman a House of Representatives congressman is saying Gary Gensler stop going on Jon Stewart and start showing up at your job stop trying to be an influencer stop trying to be an influencer yeah God Ryan Sean Adams here's a take from Ryan saying apparently the era of easy money is over and crypto is just a speculative asset bubble that will never recover and there was never real anything real here to begin with and you should have sold the top you idiot and then he finished his saying hello 2018 good to be back what do you mean good to be back and why did you call me an idiot by the way thanks for the handling the tone of that it was just definitely uh sarcastic yeah it just feels very uh 2018 to me like um at a time where everyone's saying crypto is over it was always speculative of asset there's never anything really go to Reddit and try to say something positive about nfts right now you just get absolutely brigaded and this reminds me so much of um of 2018 honestly where we had kind of the backlash in the back of icos and ethereum was like nothing and there was no such thing as defy and all icos and all of crypto was a scam feels like 2018. now I know there are some differences we've got war in Ukraine we have like massive uh macro economic you know like pressures and things we didn't have in 2018 but that's what everyone says there's always in 2018 people are like no this is this is different than the 2015 bear because like in this bear XYZ right and like everyone always says that anyway to me it's kind of home it's back to 2018 it'll take some time to recover but um I'm super confident we're going to come back stronger it just might take a little bit uh David what are you excited about this week man and why is it Devcon oh my God Defcon has just been so fun man and this was a picture of me at rave last night avey's like you know regular uh party that they always throw and this is a dankrad so dankrad Feist this guy super German always wears a collar in the middle of this uh hey you said there were no suits he's got the sports coat on it's different it's different when it's dank rat dank red doesn't count he's just German uh so I took this this photo with uh dank rat at uh at rave last night uh yeah I mean like it's just it's so great to see all the builders around this is like a big brain researcher behind Proto deck chart yeah by the way guys like knows crazy polynomial math and there's there's like Rave Blazers in the background crypto is great man I love it and it's like the energy here is so awesome and like even though it's the bear market and people are sad about the prices and my metaphor for these these markets is like in the bull market it's like a bonfire but in the bear market like the fire starts to dwindle but the fire at Devcon is really strong uh and like even the boys club event also last night uh was just the the energy at boys club was crazy and it's cool because boys club is like I don't really think like boys club and like core layer one ethereum protocol development like that's kind of like they don't really boys club by the way is a um it's a web three doubt that it's a social organization yeah yeah for primarily like uh representing women and uh you know non non-binary people so when people hear David say Boys Club it's not like it's like it's a joke it's a play on words all right it's not an actual voice yeah yeah but like the the boys club showed up and through like one of the most high like high energy Vitality events and everyone's having a really good time and so like as like energy is going out of the space and it's just a good move by boys club because they throw that's what they do they throw really good events parties and probably really good parties uh and there's not many like other conferences out there that have like enough life in them for for them to throw a good event because like you know no one wants to throw a depressing event so what do they do oh they go to like the the crypto nerds at the developers convention and then they throw a really good event there because that's where all the Vitality is because developers aren't going to throw there like they're gonna buy boxes of pizza okay yeah and uh and like the cool thing about Devcon and why I'm so excited about Devcon is it's a Tech conference but it goes to very specific cities it goes and it's not San Francisco it doesn't go to New York it goes off the beaten path it goes to Osaka it goes to Prague and it's not just a Tech conference it's also a cultural conference and that's because ethereum is not just a technology it's a social organizational technology it's a movement and so it's so and this is why the Devcon execution team is like so shout out to uh Skyler at the end they got a lot of pressure by the way uh for going to Colombia because you know people are saying hey it's too dangerous like right you can't throw confidence there it's yeah people do have like bodyguards and stuff but like it's also like if you just live with common sense like you you don't get yourself into trouble I haven't heard anyone getting into trouble but like leaning into the culture side of things for every city that we go to and it's just like the right branding for ethereum what's what's the next uh City David uh next year people are like this is where people like start to Lobby the EFS like I want to come to my city so there's like a movement to get people uh to get the uh Defcon in uh turkey uh in uh Istanbul I I think it's going to be somewhere you you don't suspect right and definitely definitely yeah Istanbul would be one of the top places I would not suspect actually yeah right um anyway lots of lots of places that's what I'm bullish on it the fact that Devcon is not just a Tech conference it's also a cultural conference and I mean it's important this is where we come together as a community and hang out and make sure that we're not just like face down buried in code all the time or in our world podcasts that's awesome what do you bullish on Ryan um I asked a question this week on Twitter um sometimes you get good answers questions on Twitter sometimes you get bad I got a lot of good ones um I said this from the 2015 to 2016 bear Market we got ethereum from the 2018 to 2019 bear Market we got D5 nfts what's going to be the big thing coming out of this bear Market the bear Market of 2022 that we're in and I was just really excited about the range of different answers to the question because it wasn't just a consistent like there wasn't like a group thing of it it's all going to be this or it's all going to be that um impact Dallas defy science refi web 2 integrating web 3 game Phi broadening of the nfts to research IP and nfts like music video and other verticals more Noob friendly defy social crypto all of these answers the question my answer to this question is probably the layup uh answer which is like layers twos it seems so obvious that coming out of this bear Market layer twos are going to be like the absolute Vanguard of crypto like they're going to be stronger they're going to be in higher use I don't know David uh if you saw the um the ethereum quarterly report you know state of ethereum report um like earnings report we released on Bank list last week Ben put this together for our team ethereum's down in just about every category right like revenue is down 86 percent you know uh D5 total locked values down 60 stable coin Supply down 21 like it's very clear that we are weathering a major contraction but the bright spot was layer twos are up up 97 about a hundred percent we're doing that in a bear market so this to me is like these these are kind of the the early saplings uh they're like kind of on the tree of um you know future future life and future progress so um that's what I'm excited about that no one actually knows what the next big thing is going to be tells me that it could be almost anything and it'll be unexpected and that we're pursuing so many different use cases at the same time uh and then I just see obvious things like layer twos which are going to be a big deal 100 100 also bullish all right man I know you got to get somewhere uh real soon for Devcon but uh let's get to the meme of the week what are we looking at here yeah this is a I can't remember what kind of flavor of comic this is but uh it's like the guy who's interviewing for a job and the job interviewer is asking can you stop inflation without causing a recession and the interview he asked says no I can't and then the guy says okay you're hired and then it turns out that this is the Federal Reserve all right guys uh David's got to get to Devcon I know he's gonna be on stage presenting a few things actually talking I think doing a panel yeah I am a moderating a panel that uh is definitely stretching my technical ability is account extraction so I'm I have to finish up doing my research but it is also the only panel that vitalik buterin is on on the main stage so your boy's hosting that panel in a second he chose to do account abstraction as this thing that he wants to talk about huh yeah that's just how important he thinks it is um well cool we'll leave it at this then risks and disclaimers as always gotta tell you that crypto is risky we're definitely on the frontier eth is risky D5 is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but
