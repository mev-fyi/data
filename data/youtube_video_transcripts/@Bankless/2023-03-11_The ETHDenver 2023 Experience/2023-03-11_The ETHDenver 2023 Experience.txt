[Music] thank you Bagels Nation we are at shelling point which is a part of East Denver and I got this other microphone so we're gonna go around and talk to all the people who are at this amazing conference you know the deal I've been talking about East Denver ever since banquet started it's a really important conference it is the biggest of the East City conferences that are out there last year at in February of uh 20 which what was it 2022 East Denver attracted something like 13 000 15 000 people and we were totally over subscribed for the sports Castle so we are in a brand new venue and even though we're in a bear market and all of our token prices are down bad uh the energy and excitement at East Denver is up only 8th Denver has always been up only I think I haven't gotten any official quote but we are somewhere between 15 and 20 000 people here in Denver Colorado for what is what has become much more than just East Denver uh East Denver has always been a two to three day conference but this has been an entire week and he's never has got so big that so many one day off events have happened so really the week started on Monday and today is Thursday and it is the start of the canonical East Denver conference but really it's been going on all week we were at the axelr interoperability conference on Tuesday we were at wallet con yesterday but now East Denver has officially started here in the Denver Convention Center so like I said I got the second microphone let's go see who we can talk to foreign [Music] what's up Hudson hello how's it going good uh we are at how are you I am David Hoffman who are you I am Hudson Jameson what are you up to today Hudson well um speaking later at shelling point and uh I'm also just kind of meeting people giving a lot of hugs uh and so this is your how many selling points have you gone to these days oh all of them all of them uh and this is uh the first one that's at this new East Denver yes new East Denver how's this new East Denver for you it's been really good this one is like so big it's like almost overwhelming because I've been to all the other ones except last year so like it's much smaller the previous years but no no it's still really good feelings around here so yeah what you're talking to me about my talk is about burnout it's me with a few other people who have burned out and uh what we did about it I took a year off I'm coming back yeah I think everyone who's been in crypto long enough kind of knows the gist for people who are sadly going to miss your talk do you want to give them a quick TL DR sure so our talk is about burnout basically how to tell the signs how to kind of find support come in yourself to like take breaks have a healthy lifestyle and uh maybe even talk about what workplaces should do to support that I think it's pretty ironic that we just started recording and the first person to talk to is talking about bird out uh maybe we'll save this one for the end how do you feel about that one maybe that's a good idea yeah yeah well so what are you looking forward to and any other talks that you're going to attend or anyway speakers Shapiro I think has a talk now and they might be now I have to go check but like uh yeah he's a wild card I want to see that yeah and then there's also um some other stuff on defy uh from some people I really respect from like Euler and uh other things and so you've been to I think every single east Denver and we're counted the number of conferences I've been to so I've been every Denver uh except for last year and I've been to over 32 ethereum conferences uh that's quite a large number I've been to a large number of ethereum conferences and I'm nowhere near 32. maybe it makes sense that your talk is about burnout yeah for sure for sure yeah no it was it was rough the coolest thing though was Devcon six was in Bogota I was walking around five floors four thousand people there and suddenly I was like oh this isn't Devcon one with 300 people I don't have to like go 100 miles per hour anymore and it really helped yeah yeah definitely one thing I've noticed at all of these one day off events which is really new for eat Denver is all of these like solo days yeah yeah so many people I don't recognize yeah absolutely there's like a lot of um like young young devs that are just getting into this and I try to find more you know access to them to get with the ogs and like you know make sure that they're getting the right values about being here yeah certainly uh for for people that weren't able to make it to East Denver what's the vibe can you give them a presence the largest collection of different like companies that are blockchain focused but also like adjacent and like anything from you know gaming to defy D side just everything you can think of the gaming one surprised me a lot because it looks really professional so I'm gonna I've been walking around and I just found you and handed you the microphone and started talking who should be my next Target I thought I saw Victor Boone I did see Victor Boone and if I saw Victor Boone right now I'd be absolutely going after him I think I see him right over there actually so I'm gonna go take this microphone and run thank you so much cheers we're gonna go get him [Music] hi Victor can I borrow you yeah absolutely this is my good friend Victor how's it going Victor hey good good how are you good this is uh you or what number of East Denver have you been to uh 2019 20 21 22 23 5. how is this one different uh let me name all the ways well one I'm not organizing so that's very nice I get to walk around and enjoy um I think everything's the venue's new obviously so it fits a ton more people uh the bathrooms all work so far very nice so far big blow up yeah um I think one of the things that I love is that like you have room to breathe and walk around like talk to people the thing that I don't love is that I'm not used to the layout of it yet yeah we're gonna know where the stages are so I'm just kind of like Meandering but I feel like Saturday and Sunday will get a lot better yeah are you giving a talk or what's going on with you no I am here uh I'm not maternity leave yeah I'm on Daddy Duty and so I'm your baby super cute yeah yeah so I'm just I'm just hanging out it's kind of like I haven't committed to any events having moved to any panels is there any subject matter that you think is really standing out here at East Denver uh here it is Denver I haven't gone to any of the talks I haven't uh but I think there's anything that I would that I would love for people to talk about it's like one I'd love for people talk about liquid shaking yeah and I think that's part of that is just talking about the regulatory climate but also how do you make intelligent choices as a project in order to set yourself up for Success so when it comes to dealing with regulators and so it's like what do you name things right and so like recently people stopped using LSD and now everybody's using LST right right that's an essential choice and like that's project stuff for Success why is that so important why is that UST versus USD choice so important so LSD uh the d stands yeah so uh the d stands for derivative right and derivative has a very specific connotation a security space around exactly what it is and so it's actually not descriptive of what's happening and so you're taking tourists so one you're not describing the thing as it actually is and two you're like calling your derivative when it's clearly not and it's you know derivatives file under regulatory framework that clearly do not apply here and so switching over to LST is more descriptive liquid singing token is always descriptive to what you actually have and what's happening and it makes it clear that this is not a derivative and that shouldn't fall under that regulatory framework right okay so people should start instead of using the words LSD which sadly is like really fun it's like use LSD not LSD you know what I mean yes yes okay but you're we're saying use LST because it doesn't trigger the ire of regulators and we can perhaps push them at Bay keep them at Bay a little bit more yeah yeah and I think that like people have a little bit of a naive view sometimes where they don't realize that words matter right but if you actually look at like the reason a lot of projects get into trouble it's like how do you Market things how do you like talk to community how do you like position stuff and it's just like a lot of it is just your shot as your own comps yeah so the Shanghai upgrade coming pretty soon uh and I know you're you're you're working with coinbase Cloud coinbase staking so this is very very relevant to you how is coinbase thinking about Shanghai what does it need to do what are you guys planning for is there what's the conversation like yeah I mean you know a big part of it just making sure that we're ready from the technical perspective uh and so you know withdrawals going live we have an e staking API which is how our partners integrated with our saving product on ethereum and so just make sure that we have the records upgrades there that all the withdrawal accusers set correctly everything's good to go other than that I think it's gonna be kind of a non-event to be perfectly honest I think there's a lot of like Midwood takes on Twitter of like there's all this eat something yeah so pressure I'm like you guys are dummies and I'm not gonna respond to anything because I I don't have time for it um but I'm excited I think it's just the latest step and then uh you know eth road map and to me this feels like the culmination of the efforts for um so many different teams and core devs and contributors and this is kind of like the merge was done this is the last step and then you're like okay it's done everything's done and now it's like let's look to the future I know this wasn't your project but bass is you know capturing the Mind Chair by storm and I know CBE the the liquid staking token from coinbase yeah is another decentralized uh you know crypto project offered by coinbase how are these things gonna get married how are they what's the overlap between these two things um well I think the first thing is that um you know there are parts of the coinbase ecosystems that are centralized and like you're part of the carbon stack right it's like if you're using usdc if you're using CBE if you're using bass these are like Central those things that are run by coinbase and then you know coinbase is responsible for you know making sure that they're integrating to defy and have like all that stuff and so you can have that like first party ecosystem but on the other hand you can also have like the more decentralized aspects and so you know for CPE there's also LLC right which part of alluvial in the liquid Collective that's gonna be launching soon TM and then on the base side as well like you know it's on the road towards Progressive decentralization and so you have a choice about do I want to use it now when it is it's centralized off or you don't want to wait until it becomes more decentralized uh Victor uh who should be my next victim that should put a microphone in front of uh having a walkie walking very fast away from me which makes me very sad yeah yeah I mean you you can chase them down uh do you want to do Lisa she gets flustered easy yeah this is the perfect time yes yes right there I'm just gonna give her the mic and be like Lisa you're on camera yeah let's do it let's do it hey Lisa hey you're on camera now how's it going good to see you uh tell me a little bit about who you are hi I'm Lisa I am Victor's better half I'm uh the mom to Alexander Boone um I'm also the CEO at Aztec which actually this is our booth right here and my team um and Aztec is building an encrypted ethereum yeah right okay so that is a very hot topic these days yes uh with all of this like regulatory pressure about other things that aren't adjacent to privacy but I'm sure you guys are like I have to have been thinking about this how is that climate impacting what you guys are doing at essec so we're actually really excited about the interest in ZK that developers have right now there's a lot of people that are building ZK applications and Aztec built a product called Noir which is a universal ZK language that people can use to like build all kinds of applications where they can do things like you know compliance checks for example which can feed into things like okay how are we responding to like you know regulatory um requests or like enforcement across all different jurisdictions so I think the point is that it's going to be very flexible and up to the developer to kind of like adhere to the jurisdictions that they're operating in okay so give us a description of a world where nor is like maximally adopted all the developers know how to build on it what does that look like for ethereum yeah okay so today Noir can actually be used across different proving systems and around different ecosystems so Aztec is going to be one of them but Noir can also be used across like starkware and across polygon and all the other kind of ethereum ecosystems just like a development kit um it's a language a language so it's basically like providing the syntax for people to real build like uh ZK proofs really easily and the goal is to get web 2 developers building with these EK proofs and ultimately deploying across all these different uh ethereum systems whether it's darkwear or Aztec or polygon or any of the other ZK ecosystems that actually have the Integrations with Noir does it do we need it to be a ZK roll up for that to work or how what are the limitations on who can build using Noir um I think in terms of the limitations it's like there's technical limitations today so we're building things like recursion to make it faster right um but I think the limitation is really like is that integration built with Noir and that proving system and so we actually have a grants program with Aztec right now where people are building out those Integrations so people that are in like the starboard community that want to use Noir are like building the integration so it can be compatible with software okay so if we if there's a bar is it zero to 100 and zero is there's zero privacy on ethereum 100 is everything on ethereum is private yeah where are we and where will we find equilibrium So today we're probably at like I don't know less than 10 okay um we have a product live it's called azteconnect and it allows people to interact with layer one D5 using Aztec so users deposit their funds into Aztec and then they can interact with protocols like Lido compound Ave element Etc and what they benefit from is gas savings because they're participating in our roll-up but also privacy because all all users see on maina is that you're interacting with Aztec is interacting with the protocol but you don't see the individuals that are interacting with it so that's kind of where we are today the future state is being able to build any private smart contract so you can have private variables private functions private State and so that's like the hundred and like the idea would be basically enabling this new use case or lots of new use cases that require privacy and do you think we'll ever get to 100 or you'll find we'll find an equilibrium before that point um yeah I mean I think there's probably always going to be like examples of things that should be completely public but we're just seeing so much interest in people that are doing things in a public way right now that want to have privacy so an example of that is nouns Dao has a request out there right now with um ZK projects to build private voting for their Dao so that they can allow their their participants to like vote privately without being concerned about like their identity being revealed or being persuaded because of their identity and so this is like the way democracy works right you go into a voting booth and no one is like oh what's your what's your vote known over there that's like how it should work right right exactly so like I think there's a lot of things that people are doing publicly today that ideally they would do privately and that's a good example of one sure uh what okay what's gonna be first is an example of things that uh governance is going to go private first or what other like utilities you think are going to go private uh identity identity ones like people being able to like share aspects of their Identity or information with a ZK proof rather than sharing the underlying information like super excited about that we have a team building with Noir right now out in order to do that for student Anonymous contributors um we also are seeing people that are you have to kind of like rethink a little bit how D5 applications are built with privacy because obviously like the way that uniswap is built today probably doesn't work as well with privacy and so I think future D5 protocols that have privacy are going to have like you know private order books and stuff like that so I think there's going to be like new mental models and new um kind of ways that developers will be building with privacy so if we just Peak to the interests of bankless listeners and they want to go down this Rabbit Hole how should they find the top of the rabbit hole aztec.network or go to Twitter and follow us at Aztec Network cool awesome Lisa uh who should be my next victim because Victor told you and then here you are who should be next let's see who's around whether you can or cannot see them oh Victor's got an idea oh we're gonna go far we're gonna go follow Victor we're gonna go follow Victor finally so thank you hey I'm kind of hungry for a green pill let's go see if we can find one hey do you have a green pill oh yes I have um I'll take one yeah yeah here we go oh I'm gonna get green pill oh there's Simona hi Simona all right I'm chewing on a green pill which means I need you to talk uh if you're the one organizing the shelling Point how is it going I mean you know chaotic as usual but it's a probably good so that's good uh how crazy is it that this is a conference about public goods and people actually are here and care about that um it's honestly the reason why we do it um and it's been growing steadily with uh every single trailing point I feel it's gotten more and more interesting buzzier and buzzier and people are genuinely excited to be part of the conversations have the conversations and also have the space that enables them to chat come up with your ideas make things happen I think there's a lot of people out there in the world that understand at the very least conceptually what a public good is and they also yeah I like public goods but they've never really had perhaps a shelling point to meet up and discuss that right and that's what showing boys really here to provide right 100 and I think it's such an important space to hold for people and to enable that freedom of expression that ability to collaborate cooperate communicate and come together in this really really authentic really really again I said Buzzy before but you can feel the energy when you walk in here and I think every single selling point that we've done and you've been to kind of all of them now I have yeah well how many have they done three I mean it's I feel they have organically grown very uh biomimicry style you know like a Seedling that has grown into something really quite special and I think the interest that we saw this time around I think we sold out within a month um the the desire to speak the desire to create engagements the desire to be in our own conference area in our D size space in the DSi workshops has been incredible so I am so so grateful that I get to not only you know work to provide the space for people but actually like check out some very very cool ideas happening right what is separating this particular shelling point from all the other shelling points that we've had it's grown into its own thing um and it's being so organic and so with so much excitement from people that um the type of talks that we're seeing now and the type of different areas that we're doing now and the interest that we get from the community about those conversations has just blown up so um it's been beautiful to see because at the end of the day we've been uh banging on about this public good stuff for a good while and some of us are a little bit tired um and you know speaking from experience wait what no never um but yes it's it's really good to see and it makes it all worthwhile so if uh bankless listeners are out there watching this at home at YouTube they sadly weren't able to make it out to shelling Point describe some adjectives or some emotions that you are feeling that they might need to feel in order to be present here you're asking me about feelings that's what I just told you about being tired um optimistic um definitely the regenerative and at this point really really looking towards the future and being able to recognize how many of us there are thinking about these things working towards these things and I think being able to recognize and again be together whilst talking about this stuff whilst working on the same stuff together is really pulling us together together together you know it's really um motivating us all to keep you know public goods good uh I think the the thing I like you about you the most is not not the most there's plenty of things to like about Simona first off your eyes are as green as the actual green green of the green pill your initials SP are shelling point which is just so fantastic I mean come on I should just mic drop right now absolutely I've been I've just been hounding people at selling point giving them the microphone who should be my next victim being why should it be Kevin owaki over there I mean because he's right there because he's right there proximity always be efficient about that but then you know there's so many new people coming up into the space and so many interesting ideas that we should definitely give them uh a pass of the microphone as well I think that's absolutely right and we'll get to them right after I get to Kevin owaki thank you again so much for doing everything you are doing making public goods good my pleasure thank you see you later cheers hello with me yeah I would love to chat with you David Uh Kevin how's it going I'm good I heard you're a VC now are you a podcast host or a VC now uh I'm a little bit of both because I'm here to do one thing which is to promote going bankless and that includes financing the explorers of the frontier who are exploring that Frontier yeah wait am I being interviewed I don't know we're both podcast hosts so maybe like we both assert our hostness um I feel like we're two AI it's just like bouncing back questions at each other yeah well I think you're projecting a little bit of you and Ryan on me and you but okay Uh Kevin did you ever think that something like today shelling Point number four would happen when you started get coin in the first selling point and the green pill movement just reflect on how far things have come yeah well in 2017 I started Bitcoin in my basement with no funding and just a little bit of money that I made off of the bull market in 2017 and it's it was so lonely to get something off the ground and the fact that there's hundreds or even thousands of people here at shelling Point uh and also people who have been impacted by Bitcoin in the work that it's done is really incredible so it feels like we're in a regen movement and uh it's so much less lonely now uh did you ever think it was possible to get so many people to care about public goods uh well I think that people care about public goods they care about clean air and open source software but they sort of take them for granted once those are withdrawn from you and you don't have clean air uh and you don't have herd immunity and you don't have those public goods then that's when you truly notice and the regen movement is all about building a movement where we don't take them for granted where we fund them and by the way with web3 we can fund public goods way more efficiently than the state can so when you want to talk about going bankless uh one of the primary functions of the state is to fund public goods and if we can do it efficiently more better on web3 not only does that legitimize web 3 but it helps more people fund public goods in a bankless way so it's an incredible movement and I'm really just thankful to vitalik for really making public goods of value in his community because it's really trickled down to the rest of us here at shelling point and in the get coin community I think uh something that you and I definitely share is that we're never going to get crypto fully adopted until we get it legitimized and the only real way to get it fully legitimized is by providing public goods better than any other system that can come before can you reflect on that as a path towards adoption yeah so I mean I think the web 3 is the internet of money um the internet of information changed everything in our society because now you can send information across the computer network that revolutionized education entertainment media if you have social media before web one so now we can send value across a computer network so anything that parallel there is anything with value transfer is going to be revolutionized in society by web3 and like I know that we're all hot on D5 and financial infrastructure funding art with nfts but up and coming uses of public of of web 3 I think is going to be uh the internet of jobs revolutionizing how we work for each other and also funding public goods so I'm just placing my bets for that cycle for that market cycle and eventually the market will catch up to that thesis I think so certainly the biggest selling point that we've had thus far and that's largely because new people are coming into this base the regenerative Finance space uh the public good space What are some of the newer projects that I should try and talk to while I'm here yeah um well I mean I think that I'm really excited about projects that are that are creating impact so impact Dallas uh proof of humanity is creating Ubi and there's thousands of people in the global South who are being funded by uh by Ubi people who are in some cases are living off of Ubi and uh you know crypto we think that 10 inflation in the United States is high but when you have 80 inflation in Argentina holy [ __ ] crypto is a game changer to be you know be paid in a stable currency Colectivo I think is really good using um carbon-backed currencies in order to regenerate local communities I think is an Incredible use of this technology but uh if you wander around selling point I'm sure you'll find plenty of projects that are using web3 for good which one any of those that I should go after first who should be my next victim um I I think that I should introduce you to Colectivo and proof of humanity and there's a project called git coin you should talk to yeah where might I find them do you see them around uh well I'm disaffiliated from Bitcoin because bitcoin's now a dow but they're they're everywhere they're wearing these purple uh hoodies uh the hoodies say quadratic lands on them quadratic lens is a world in which we Rewritten the laws of economics in order to fund public goods and to share uh the creation of the commons and so uh if you see someone in a in a purple quadratic Lance hoodie it's a good chance there with Bitcoin all right well I'm gonna tell them that you specifically threw them under the bus when I give them the microphone yeah I think they'll enjoy the attention thanks for everything you do with bankless man I think you're creating a real movement and I'm happy to be creating a little regenerative fractal on top of that movement so keep up the great work hey we're all going to the same future which is the quadratic Lance Frontier yeah there you go cheers come on down brother oh we're already recording how's it going Angela hey hey man how you going how you doing this isn't your first uh shelling point now uh no uh no no Amsterdam was my first one yeah Amsterdam yeah but and also not your first East Denver it's really great to see you here man how long did it take you to get here uh to get here from Australia yeah yeah like 18 hours of flying yeah yeah and this is probably why you've only gone to three Denver's huh yeah yeah yeah I mean the last one was 20 20. right yeah and this one's like 15 times as big which is crazy I mean it's actually so big now this venue is 10 times bigger than the sports castle at least right yeah absolutely yeah so like somebody like you skipped I think one or two eat numbers we had covet in the middle of the last last time we saw each other yeah you haven't seen this guy since covid except I talked to him on the internet all the time uh reflect on how how different this is like you keep on going down that road it's not even the same kind of Realm uh just I've been here for a few hours now and just checking out like how it's just evolved from 2020 like three years ago it was a tight in it kind of small community where you kind of knew everyone right and now I don't know like most of the people and they know they you know some of them come to me and and kind of say hey but it's just incredible how big the community has gotten and how it's so diverse now as well so much more diverse it feels like everyone from from different backgrounds everyone's from different backgrounds different places around the world uh I I can't even describe it man it's just crazy so like back here the last December we had was at the Sports Castle it was one single place and this is completely different there was wallet con which I saw you at yesterday yeah the day before that there was DK day yeah there was the interoperability Summit which was a two-day conference and those are the only ones that I that I went to there was like 10 other things that I've gone to you were at ZK day for a very long time talk about your experience there uh there's a lot of hype around ZK right now uh a lot of hype um and there were it was packed like it was uh it was a decent sized venue but there were so many people there that you got to kind of like push your way through to get through um I think that everyone's excited about ZK because it's a buzzword right now right but there's a lot of genuine building happening in the space not just a buzzword for good reason for good reason exactly and and it's not just about scalability or and privacy there's so many more applications that people are working on so I I do kind of like have a little bit of concern that it's going to turn into another one of those everyone at crypto thinks that ZK is the coolest thing everyone they're going to speculate on it but that's what we do in crypto right we speculate we see what's good what's not and we filter it out as the years go on but it's just the amount of brain power in that room was was insane yeah I think I remember in East number of 2020 the last one last time we were hanging out there was like two or three talks about uzike and I was like oh yeah that's UK thing that's kind of like cool attack but like I can't comprehend it exactly now there is a whole entire conference which I think you said was as big as Heath Denver 2020 was yeah in and of itself yep how nice is that yeah yeah it was as big the venue was was pretty similar in size and the people attending I mean I'm pretty sure it was more than was that eight demo 2020 but you're right like the term ZK used to be just some oh okay that's kind of cool you know maybe that'll be something right and they're relevant later exactly and now it's like at the Forefront of what we're actually building here and as I said there's going to be a lot of noise but there's a lot of signal still as well yeah so as the other big media person in the ethereum space what's it like to like walk around all these events and you I go to way more conferences than you because you're like so far away yeah so was it like people people are sazzle starved so what's it like to actually be here yeah it's amazing to meet all the people that kind of consume my content and see me on Bank list when I fill in for for Ryan on the roll-up and things like that right it's just amazing to see people getting uh and telling me how much value they get out of my my work and my show and my content uh and it's just like a it's an experience to reinvigorate the energy right you get amongst the people that you see and talk to on Discord on Twitter and you have like a different energy when you kind of leave the conference or you decompress and you think about it so just just meeting everyone has been phenomenal everyone's so friendly right no one has anything bad to say right it's always just like hey we think ethereum's cool you think ethereum's cool let's let's chat right so it's just great yeah yeah and like there's a pretty cool I call like daily Grant Bank list like a binary star system because like what's it like to be an independent Creator because like Bank was very much a for-profit team we gotta we got employees to pay for that's Luca that we gotta we have to pay this man to hold the camera but you make all of this content you're like no sponsors no funding talk about that philosophy because like we're at Greenville which is all about public goods so like the product Market fit here talk about that a little bit I mean it's definitely inherited from the ethereum philosophy from the get coin Philosophy from you know obviously shouting Point Greenfield all that sort of stuff it's just my way of kind of giving back to a community that has given me so much and understanding that if we all give a little bit to public goods uh and we can create such an amazing ecosystem of public goods funding not just funding with money but funding with kind of like ideas and and putting the uh the social energy into it and and keep ethereum's mission of I guess like its value admissions of like decentralization uh openness permissionlessness all of that keep that going for decades to come because I will you know for years now and I think for years to come I'll still worry that ethereum will some maybe at some point forget about those values and people like me and people like you and other people I think we need to remind people and keep their mission going and that's what keeps me going yeah certainly uh is there any particular subjects matter or talk that you are interested in watching today or tomorrow or what are other things about the future of eat Denver that you're excited about yeah I guess nothing in particular I'm generally a generalist so I love being amongst all of them yeah and I like seeing what's happening at a orchard all the Bruce I went through all the booths downstairs before and I've just come up to showing point now so I just love seeing like what everyone's doing what they're focusing on and maybe things that I'm missing and not paying enough attention to I've already had a few of those uh kind of pop up so yeah that's that's kind of my vibe um but yeah I think if people want to focus on specific things and not just be a generalist that's that's super important as well so who should be my next victim that I put a microphone in front of oh man I don't know who you've interviewed so far there's quite a lot of people I got Kevin a walkie and Simona just now uh Victor and Lisa from Aztec yeah uh but still we're at the very beginning of this so we got a lot of ethumber left to explore yeah there's too many people I can't even pick one man you're gonna find so many cool people to interview here it's just it's gonna be great yeah uh I know you definitely enjoy coming out to conferences but you have a hard time doing it and I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who are in that that camp uh talk to people about the choice to come out to a conference when to do it when not to do it how you know to skip one and how you know to make it to one yeah yeah so for me it's really just the travel I think like because I live in Australia uh it took me 18 hours to fly here 18-hour time difference um but a lot of people it's also Financial as well right but there are a lot of actual kind of groups and and opportunities within these kind of events where you can get sponsored to come here and they'll pay for your trip and everything and attending most of these things is actually free it's paid for by sponsors basically so uh if you're kind of on the fence about coming maybe for travel time or maybe you can't afford it look into the the sponsored kind of things but also travel time it's so worth it like I don't regret it at all yeah okay I had to put up with some some crappy jet lag but just being here amongst the community it's a very very different vibe to online just putting places to names that you may interact with and and talking to people in real life and getting that energy like just absorbing all the energy there's nothing like it it's Indescribable you have to be here to know and to experience it yourself to know what I'm talking about I think yeah well Anthony thank you so much for your time and thank you for everything that you do at the daily Quay because it is really the only podcast that I listen to after my own yeah yeah thank you sir I appreciate it cheers Anthony cheers foreign [Music] group of crypto natives helping uh project teams launch uh tokens and governance systems uh what's the logo from fries right here maybe fire underscore fire just explaining to people how to find you if you're low if you're no no we don't want people to find us uh so uh what do you guys do again sorry one more time uh so we help project teams launch uh governance systems and tokens and uh how many times have you done that uh yeah so we've helped work with get coin super rare ens optimism most recently collablin and a few others I think that's not quite the resume what'd you do what you do for optimism so optimism so like the way the Firearms Works goes from very very high touch to very very low touch and optimism was like actually pretty chill in the last like three months before the launch we sort of helped on like some of the airdrop mechanisms and some of the sort of like communication stuff yeah and then hope you guys looking to talk to you now what's the new frontier requirements oh we can't tell you that David I know I think like a lot of like these two restaking stuff eigenlayer is obviously like very hot maybe even like too hot for a fire eyes right now um but I wallet connect has also got some interesting [ __ ] going on so maybe them um but like cruising it doesn't it's not about us having five clients constantly we can have one that's fine why do people need fire rest I think I can explain that a little bit more but um teams are usually focused on the product right and not thinking about tokens um and they've never really gone through that tokenization event and there's a lot of nuances and things that people want to learn about that I know about that and need that like hand-holding experience so we've done multiple token launches launched billions of dollars worth of tokens at this point per leading projects so having that advice in that uh Insight while you're going through that process is super helpful uh Lucas what is what's a podcast nft podcast nft is our collectible podcast uh and you can collect the bankless one right now collectibles.bankments.com uh I think it's a new way for Content creators to monetize uh their content uh that's not sponsors so if you are an avid listener to the bankless podcast you probably skip through all those sponsors uh that David says and Luke is uh the editor helping helping me but that's no fun for uh viewers and it's really not the best thing for Content creators you know we've had some issues with sponsors in the past us and uh content nfts enable this new monetization strategy for Content creators to monetize their work directly and for their audiences to own that work as well so the ownership model the ownership economy that we've talked about with Legion which is also a collectible podcast the ears of many bankless listeners out there who actually might already know all about podcast nfcs but perhaps they're all the ones that don't well where's the top of the funnel where should they go to learn more yeah I think right now collectibles.banklist.com is probably uh where you can learn the most about podcast nfts but there's more in the works coming in the next few weeks and months here so uh can we speak more about that or is that going to stay on the radar yeah so there's a currently a stealth project that is I'm working on that will help content creators tokenize all of their work um starting with podcasts it's a stealth product that has to do with podcast nfts that's made by the guy who helped do Bank list two podcasts I think I know where this goes yeah beautiful we're gonna go on the run all right thank you guys ladies and gentlemen I found my next Target here we go excuse me sir do you mind what's up what's your name uh frog monkey that's what they call it it is frog monkey frog monkey why did you leave bankless why did I oh man you're going [ __ ] straight hard hits um well I want to go uh work at uh one of the leading companies in defy it okay acceptable uh what company what company is that uh you can swap laps oh nice uh um I am a writer uh so like I do a bit of content strategy which I used to do for bang plus as well uh and a bit of the writing too what's the last thing you wrote about um the last thing that I wrote about was the our pay with any token um launch nft feature launch which I thought was pretty cool this is like you can buy entities with any token whatever you have in your wallet doesn't have to be right because uh unit swap recently acquired that uh nft aggregator right yep Genie Genie yeah is it still called Genie or is the name Genie gone no it's just uh the uniswap nft aggregator at this point love it love it uh what else is going on in your swap oh man um there is a lot going on at uh Eunice lab it's interesting because we've wrote a lot as a company in the past year or so and like we've been able to focus on different like products right because like when you think Unison if you think the amm which for good reason but now we've we've you know moved into um we've like moved into like this web interface that we use that we're expanding on uh we've moved into nft stuff we have like some exciting product launches coming up as well um so it's like a fully fleshed out you know the the way I like think about is like use swap is sort of like decentralized way to getting into D5 right like you don't you don't you shouldn't have to go through C5 to access all the cool [ __ ] um that's happening in defying so like even swap is one of the places to get started there right um that's kind of how I think about it I woke up this morning and I saw a promo tweet from uniswap we have a very awesome gif animated gifts and nothing happened at the end of it uh which is just like an announcement of an announcement frog what is that announcement I don't know uh wasn't there also a recent Announcement by this cool company building out uh base it's very similar like uh approach we have something big coming we're teasing it um we're at you know we're at East Denver uh in in presence so maybe this is a coincidence maybe not but unusual as a layer too um well the best way to find out is to go to uh our talk tomorrow at 9am on the main stage Cal's given that I don't know well frog that's just great because this interview is not going to come out until the day after so you can go ahead and tell me right now I see I see well um no I'm gonna get in trouble for doing that I want you man I want to [Music] [Music] [Music] yo so I'm a huge Dark Souls fan and this looks a lot like Dark Souls yo did you build this uh yeah I've been building this for the past three years uh what's it called it's called the fabled uh it looks like Dark Souls yeah that's the point pretty much it's like I love Dark Souls yeah awesome uh it's beautiful uh but you're here at East Denver why is it why is it game East ever yeah so all of the characters weapons and items that you have in our game are uh nfts that you can earn and have the ability to Mint uh and then you go through these levels you defeat really challenging bosses out of Dark Souls or Alden ring yeah and uh earn rewards God this game is absolutely beautiful okay you said uh mint because you can earn them so this is a is what survive of this game like talk a little bit more about with the crypto aspects the game itself is free to play completely free to get into okay and then you have a choice if you want to Mint your characters uh weapons and items to get access to the marketplace to get access to the on-chain Token that's used for all Marketplace transactions and um we also have a multiplayer functionality coming in down the line where people can stake their nfts and um and their tokens in high stakes tournaments uh to face each other okay so this seems like really sophisticated because there's all these like web3 games and they're all seemingly like kind of cute easy Flash animation style games this looks like a triple A game I was well honestly I was done recording and I saw this game and I was like Luke can't record uh how when did you know that you wanted to put assets into your game how did you make that decision yeah so I I saw what was happening in the web 3 uh kind of landscape and I had already built out quite a lot of the games Foundation at that point as well yeah and so I figured there was a market opportunity and I was also ahead of things in terms of development um so it kind of made sense and then I also had known some people uh in the past who had helped uh develop other blockchain functionality within their own game and so it just kind of made sense to connect with them integrate these these blockchain features that I was thinking about into my own game and now we're here at East Denver showcasing it uh have you been a crypto person before you were a game person or like how'd that happen no I I was a game person first um and then I got into crypto um after I still you know I became fascinated with the technology behind it I saw the potential there was um in a whole bunch of different domains um gaming in particular so how do the Assets in the game do they help the company make money yeah so all of we make money through all of the transactions that players make um they've mint their nfts from us at first uh same with the weapons and items and things like that um as well as the token itself part of all on-chain transactions any any anything that anybody buys a portion of that goes back into the total very cool okay so there's an erc20 token correct a bunch of nfts that you get well you earn like if you are there is it like a loop-based system yes okay so kind of like Diablo and Borderlands yep so like Rarity yep and like an item you kill a boss an item lands on the ground uh RNG and then like maybe that item is a legendary and that item is an nft exactly is that a taxable event um good question you're not a tax lawyer and you don't have to answer that that was mainly for the humor that was that one's for you Gary all right what's this okay once again what's this game called and how do people sign up to play it yeah so the game is called the fabled and uh you can go on our website uh the Fable dot XYZ and you can also find us on Steam um at the fabled or on at Twitter um at the fabled so I'm gonna go home and play this game as soon as I get home from East Denver uh what was your name Luke Luke thank you so much uh I've always wanted something like this I hope it is it plays as good as it looks because it looks pretty damn good thank you thank you here [Music] a really sick uh ZK sync era yeah brand new uh naming for for ZK sync how'd the era come about uh well it's I know a new era for ethereum so that's basically it and then we have this our symbol our logo you can see it over there we just leave for the community to learn what what it is about okay so uh ZK thinks got a brand new era brand new branding yeah uh it's also uh for coming very soon to mainnet mainnet is up and running with uh whitelisted onboarding is that the current state of things that's yeah that it is it's it's a proof project so basically any project that deployed on the test net uh and submitted a form with just a few information about the project and the smart contact address and testnet okay will be allowed to bridge fans on mainnet and deploy the projects so that's where we are right now amazing uh so I mean you guys already have like a ton of people it looks like asking a bunch of questions what are people curious about what what about ZK sync is Peak the Curiosity of who developers community members like what's the vibe oh well they want they want to know what CK is about what is zero knowledge proofs a lot of people are asking us about privacy uh in general a lot of people asking us about which projects are CK sync already which comments will be available on how much which projects will be available right you can go to ecosystem.tk sing.io uh I can name a few like uh Ave unit swap curve compound uh we have remark for entities uh we have I mean anything you can think of we have wallets uh like Argent uh they will probably kill me because I'm missing a lot of important ones but yeah ecosystem.k sing.io you'll find it sure and there's a big ecosystem fund right for for the new era of fck yes it is so part of the funding that we had we will go to the to projects um yeah still in progress and so if developers are interested in building in ZK sync or they just want to learn more where's the top of the funnel so first of all come to our docs uh it's in our website sequencing.io and yeah our docs is the top funnel we have a lot of examples uh migration guys if you have a project already running on ethereum or the IBM we have uh guides to migrate your project with everything you need to know sticky sync is compatible with solidity Viper hard hat metamask all the existing tools works so it's super easy for developers to migrate projects so yeah that's beautiful I know that there's a big race to be first the memes going around we were the first ZK evm was ZK sync the first CK evm uh there are people deploying it and they are people there are people using it as we speak so I would say that's yeah we are first oh man that's it thanks so much Antonio yeah thank you we're gonna go Target metamask yo what's up yo what's going on man it's good to be here man where are we oh we're at the Mad Max Booth yeah Booth man yeah there's a there's a lot of cool things that metamask is doing uh what are they yeah yeah I mean I can I can talk about a lot of things man but uh snaps Snaps are cool yeah people if they know what made my Snaps are extension on on top of your wallet any developer out there can build snaps today with Bachelor Bounty man ethereum if Denver Vibe is always the same it's really cool we're a bunch of bounty on snaps on SDK mobile sbk really like recommend everybody to check this out what's a snap man this is an extension yeah this is nappy a snappy snap literally you can extend the functionality on on your wallet today think about no evm compatible snap BTC snap notification Communications snap Layer Two snaps so anybody in the community can build cool snaps today is it making metamask Turing complete is that the deal yeah yeah I wish I wish to answer that but uh man anybody can uh whatever feature they want to build they can think about the snaps today I think this is whatever I like really power back to the community and I'm excited about that we launched this heavy Denver and today we have a bunch of snaps already pre-built what's your favorite snap and what does it do man uh noriam compatible snap I love like the the starkness nap a lot of the BTC snaps so people can interact actually with other companies ipfs snap you can literally store stuff on on top of your metamask using ipfs okay so Stark net isn't an evm chain which means that metamask isn't functional out of the box so there is a stark net snap that makes metamask work on Stark net is that the deal exactly who wrote who built that snap who snapped that I wasn't after that so this is our team before actually like two weeks ago when we saw each other in the southwest session but a bunch of like hackathon winners build new snaps I'm super excited also about these MPC snaps so account recovery snaps so people can actually use uh direct different accounts to recover in your account I think this is amazing and the built by the community for the community and I'm excited about when we ship to stable you know so I saw this morning that we talked about this on the weekly roll-up this morning erc4337 is now a smart contract on ethereum how does that change metamask what does that what does that mean for metamask man I'm excited about any account destruction I've been like during the Denver hearing like I don't know 10 panels on that you always amazing panel and I'm excited on those use case like NPC recovery think about also like notification batch transactions apps I think this is something that uh that will be will be fun to see and there are tons of applications on the AE section and I'm excited about this and the other big news that I believe was announced specifically here at East Denver was metamaska has an SDK for um what Unity the game engine exactly why is that such a big deal yeah I mean think about like any any game developer out there web 2 or web3 can actually integrate natively metamask so we launched this SDK they're available also on the the unity Marketplace and this is super exciting also in couple of weeks we're at GDC where we're actually showing and build with game developers out there but uh and by the way SDK is a big part of our bounties and I'm excited because today if you want to execute batch transaction or like doing specific game use case you need to go through like a metamask externally and today you can actually like drive that directly from a mobile mobile SDK right okay uh you so you're talking about the word this bounty this bounty word a lot we all know what bounties are you get money how much money is there to get man man bounties are just the start right we have like a 40K bounties or snaps uh snaps is a big chunk in fewer are a big chunk we have also SDK but I'm excited also about what's coming after the hackathon people can just you know be part of those developer commit called Twitter spaces uh be part of our metamask grants now that you probably know all this about but and Sanford pause I'll get get into an ecosystem have more community members be excited I think like this is what's all about like passion building and sharing within and for the community uh if people just got peaked and they want some of that Bounty or they want to learn more about the SDK or they want to build a snap or they want to do something else in Madame ask where should they go where's the top of the rabbit Hall top resources uh I think we are here at the booth all those 10 days we're back back in the back in those past five days in in the hackathon uh Discord uh I mean we are a little bit everywhere like shoot us a message DMS really make sure you are speaking uh with us and we want to be involved also in building the snap with you right and and anything like Community is important amazing thank you so much David what's up Ash hey how's it going it's good how are you uh what what Booth are we at we are at risk zero westrick zero risk zero is a ZK scaling solution for blockchain I love the word ZK yeah what does that mean I think it's everybody's favorite word this week everyone is on it's on the tip of everybody's tongue um yeah so it's zero knowledge it's a basically a special kind of Moon Mass uh that makes it really easy and cheap to scale blockchains like in a way that we haven't really had accessible to us before what does risk zero mean is there zero risk well so it's actually so we're built on the risk five instruction set so it's like really nerdy computer parlance um so it's like what does that mean can you explain that like on five yeah so the risk five instruction set basically well maybe not like your five computers need instructions to figure out how to do things um Intel usually makes these computer chips and they have really complicated sets of instructions risk five is a set of really simple instructions that are modular so you can sort of build computers that are um a little more customized and they can run much faster so basically what risk zero has built is a z okay virtual machine so much in the way that you have like the ethereum virtual machine it's just a computer that can run in ZK okay so ZK at the evm level is like ZK at the very big like basement all the way down at the bottom what do you get when you do that um well basically you get the ability to have verifiably correct compute um which means that you can make a lot more security assumptions about the things that you're trying to compute um it also means you know when you have the the when you have the virtual machine happening off chain like off of the evm it means that you're actually able to do really really big computations uh much much faster and cheaper than you would be able to do them on chain so like what is this a faster blockchain yeah it's basically but it's not it's not just like one faster blockchain so what we're trying to do is actually bring ZK functionality and the ability to do much larger computations than you can do on chain to every in any chain so we we're we're talking about it like horizontal ZK availability to sort of the whole blockchain Space whereas mostly like ZK projects right now are trying to get you to move platforms so they want you to like move to a new layer one ooh we don't like that we don't even want to move off of ethereum obviously it's Denver um so we're kind of we're trying to go to developers wherever they are okay so is this a technology that blockchains can implement yes so any blockchain can Implement and what you you know one and one another way to think about what we're doing is we're sort of like separating compute and data availability so what it allows you to do is just supercharge your ability to compute things okay on your blockchain and do it way way faster and way way cheaper you do it off the chain and then it all like basically mercolizes to your chain you can have verifiably correct compute and then any of your applications can access that compute and know that it was done correctly okay so how would a user perhaps a power user but non-technical when will they run into risk zero first like what was the first time they're going to be interfacing with it they that's like the that's kind of the beauty of it it's a it's really a developer tool set um they will experience the joy of it because their applications will be much faster and much much cheaper and you know things will actually work in a way that sometimes on ethereum they currently don't um you know we want to we want to make the gas prices of everything you do from you know trading on uniswap to buying a crypto dick Bud on openc like much much cheaper so who which developers is this relevant for this is for blockchain layer one or Layer Two protocols for layer ones it's for um layer twos okay it's for application developers that are interested in making their applications much faster or or in using any of the like native privacy tools that kind of come with zero knowledge of uh tooling so basically you know it's dapps it's it's it's also Chains It's layer twos especially anything optimistic so with optimistic you have this like seven day dispute like fraud proof window with risk zero you're able to you're able to take that dispute time because of the verifiably correct Computing that's happening off the chain and in the background you're able to take that actually down to like 10 seconds okay so it's taking the optimistic out of optimistic yeah exactly you don't need optimistic if you can verifiably correctly prove something right right and just to really explain that because not everyone knows why an optimistic roll-up is called an optimistic roll-up it's because you settle down to the the ethereum layer one optimistically and you need fraud proofs to really have security about that but with risk zero it sounds like you could really just accelerate that whole fraud proof process exactly it happens like you know in the moment of the computation is needed uh okay so like but what's the upside for viscero is this is this a token is this a chain uh is this an open source software tool set how does this team have upside yeah I mean that we're kind of like still figuring out whether whether or not we're gonna do a token or what that's going to look like but ultimately it will be a chain um so it's going to be permissionless which means that anyone can start providing proving services so you can provide compute into the network and you know there will be some type of token as far as like I don't know personally I'm kind of into not doing a free mine but we'll stop to see what our investors say about that I like I like the I like the token word at the very least so that gets me up and going uh if people are peaked by probably I think the more brainy subject that we've ever recorded today uh where's the top of this top of this Rabbit Hole how do people learn more yeah you can go to our site um it's just risk0.com it's r-i-s-c-z-e-r-o and then we also have a Discord channel so if you want to kind of get into the weeds ask more questions you can find our team on the Discord Channel which is also um linked on our website Ash are you the person who is on the frontier of the combination of being the most technically minded and most swaggy in all of crypto I would say there are definitely some competitors in the running for most swaggy but I have to be up there yeah I definitely think so yeah Ash thank you so much thank you cheers thank you I found this pool it's all orange we're now figured out what's up Darren oh hello how's it going my man I'm very well yeah uh where are we uh we are at the rocket pool stand uh at East Denver uh and what you guys do what's going on here uh so over here we have a bicycle um that is powering a an ethereum node he's taking ethereum right now he's taking ethereum if he stops bikes and spicling is he gonna get slashed uh no no there's a battery attached so it's a it keeps powering it up but uh no so the node that he's powering it's a runs on about five watts and that's ample for a bike so yeah so he's powering ethereum right now he is he's processing transactions that's why we have come so far haven't we this is important this is a technology I've always even excited about that's amazing I mean this is an example of decentralization right yeah like this is a fun gimmick but it's only possible because we can like this is a decentralized technology that's right so the cost of one of those little boxes is something like 600 bucks yeah so it's it's really really minimal well also I mean like if that guy was doing a bicycle to process uh shock 256 A6 he wouldn't be making any Bitcoins we'd have to have the whole room yeah and we would still be at like one one quarter of the power that's pretty cool uh okay what's what's coming up and exciting in the world of rocketball uh so we have our Atlas release coming out soon uh gone around April uh that will um support withdrawals so the whole Shanghai hard Fork thing um but it will also lower the collateral requirement for node operators from 16 to 80. and uh what does that do for stickers uh that means there's gonna be a lot more space for Ari so Ari is there's a lot of demand for art at the moment uh and our decentralized network is kind of keeping up with the supply but we need to be able to scale a lot faster uh and so that would by reducing this collateral limit it means that we can scale up much much faster there's been a frequent question in the bank is the answer the answer I've been giving and hopefully it's correct the answer is to remember that I've been giving is that orange has a premium because rocketball is capital constrained which is a function of decentralization is that the correct answer that's a that's a perfect answer yeah yeah okay and then the res mini pools which are going to go down to an eighth collateral requirement double the capacity of our eth right oh actually it uh on day one at three X's okay because it's 20 40. so um so actually on day one at three X's uh but because we've lowered the collateral limit it means that we are then uh able to access a whole so there's essentially there's a lot more people with 80s than there is with 16. and so we're actually kind of seeing about maybe a 5x is is close to where we want to be and you also get more yield right this is correct so uh so you get about 16 more uh yield from going from a 16 to an eight uh which and also about 40 more than being a solo Saker 40 more so you make forty percent more yields taking with rocket pool than you do as a solo sticker yep that's right and but that's only if you run a node not by simply owning re no that's right uh if you run a node and in fact uh Atlas which is our next release uh we'll include a migration for solo stickers so solo stickers uh who are using the BLS credential can migrate to to rocketball and yeah how much of uh the trading channel is here a lot yeah yeah that's a lot of energy like or do are they all around with us right now we've done hardly any of this yeah they're all of this that you see here is is basically the rockable community uh so this is the bike there are trading I did nothing no they just showed up with that yeah so you guys bought the booth and they were like all right I'm bringing my bike they brought the they brought the Tic Tacs I think we've got about 2 000 uh packs of tic tacs uh they put stickers on the Tic Tacs and yeah so it's been absolutely amazing they're a great great Community yeah what's it like so you've been in you've been making rocket pool 2017 I don't know if that's when the Discord was made but the trading chat which is like the center of the rocket pool Community that's why we're calling it it's the heart yeah when did that really start to arise [Music] um I think it must have been around well actually Dave started in 2016. we moved to Discord quite early on uh but probably around around like 2018 when I when I started with rocket pool yeah the trading channel was already established it was already kind of flowing and everything but now it's off the charts I can't keep up with the chat right how has like the the culture of hashtag trading uh and it's like they're not they're they're focused on their RPL price but like it's really just like the Town Square of rocketpool how has that culture developed uh it's it's developed a lot I mean there's a lot of OG kind of Rocket poor people in there so there's a brains trust actually within the within the kind of trading um channel uh they've also got like it's got a whole culture in itself in the sense that you know poapps we use there are probably about 10 pipes a week that get issued uh on all sorts they will make a pull-up over absolutely everything pretty much yeah yeah if you turn up one day they might make them pull out for this yeah speaking of Isabella behind us how's it going on good uh how was your eat Denver uh going marvelously so this is Isabella from from poapp who I'm now realizing is perfectly suited as is the nature of uh Patricio was this your Vibe or like how did that believe it or not I actually had this suit before I joined football yeah uh so uh it was kind of meant to be nice I will the The Branding is perfect uh it's worked out well how many pull-ups have you issued uh how many follow-ups have I issued uh I think just within the last couple of days uh probably over 200. is that draining you know what like no actually I found uh I kind of enjoy socializing with uh people in the pull-up Community it's a good excuse to meet people a good excuse to tell people what we do uh so I don't know I think at first I used to find it draining but after a little while you build some muscle around it do you have a favorite poet do I have a favorite actually yes uh so I'm gonna have it no oh I know so I'll show you my favorite poll though okay uh so there was a favorite pull-up uh that I made when we did something for the ethereum merge uh so let me see if I find it that's a lot of poapps she's growling quite a lot it's this one yeah the merge at 7am thought that we issued for a party that we had to celebrate the merge in Berlin with our entire team in a hotel room watching the painting party uh and uh there's a bunch of pictures attached to it of all of us in the hotel room at 7am uh we were working hard the night before so I has a lot of good memories attached do you have it in Isabella that I can collect right now I do can we do this right now we absolutely can I'm gonna I'm gonna get Isabelle's poet let's see there you go works like a charm every single time uh the process has become a lot smoother sorry oh yeah yeah so I would like to say I got my card I loaded up my PO apps I'm so excited to bring it here so everyone could say I met David Denver and you know where that card is where at my desk at home amazing I had to have a pop here oh there absolutely needs to be a pull-up for meeting people from bank close so we actually had our first ever bankless Meetup yesterday and was there a pull-up and Christina brought a poem yes Christina you're a hero thanks Christina Christina come say hi David how was your uh Denver going oh my God I love being on the other side of the microphone it's going so great yeah I had a talk up at shelling point this morning okay uh all about how permissionless protocols make us responsible humans uh and then after that me and Luke have just been running around with the camera microphones uh kind of like attacking people with them as I've just done to you uh you know what I'm happy for it yeah yeah I've been having a fun time I've gone to every single east Denver and I wouldn't dare miss him what is the uh Defcon just got announced in 2024 okay that is a very long time away uh the next event that I know about is ECC okay uh Buenos Aires also just got announced or eth Argentina in September Tina I think is coming uh I know there's East Tokyo in April yeah I don't know if I can make that one it's very far away yes it's very very far away maybe alone I hope but probably not yeah I think it's between that and permissionless and uh realistically speaking going from Tokyo to Austin is going to be probably too much I went from Paris here and it was a lot from Tokyo to Austin it's going to be more certainly yeah you did say permissionless I probably should say provincial is the conference that I'm helping organize is definitely the one I'm very very excited about I was trying to open up the table for you to talk about permissionless so Isabella what's going on at poab what are you guys working on like what's the new frontier of development we're working on a lot of incredibly exciting things and David I wish I could drop Alpha for you here but I'm afraid I'm not gonna do that usually people reserve the alpha for me but I'll have to let you go without it this time around Isabella thank you so much so much cheers uh how many of these do you have Patricia that's secret information so for those that don't know this is Patricia warthaler aka the king of poapps do you have official nickname I call myself the inventor of power inventory because King comes with lots of responsibility and I don't want more of that in my life I have a lot yeah protocols not people not protocols not people protot Kings this is what we say don't we uh pretty sure how many pubs do you have not only we say so I mean it because in this ecosystem there are a lot that say a lot about decentralization and only a harmful minute um how many of us I have um it's likely over a thousand but because I only mean Pops that I care a lot so if you give me a power an item pretty I don't feel compelled for it it's like I don't want this crap thing between my precious Collectibles pretty sure what's going on in the world of Pro app what are you guys building that's behind the scenes tell me give me the alpha things are going so well we are willing so much that it hurts um that's what Isabella said I mean it maybe it is true no seriously um this better Market is being a blessing without Lobby we wish our bucks were pumping we have many bugs that are really depressed um but at the same time it feels nice to finally be appreciated for what we do not so much for our ability to pump some other collection or something and it is happening and fundamentally speaking on the things we care about which is how happy people are getting the digital Collectibles how what how how valuable the connections they make up things never been better by far this is the greatest time in the four years of follow-up I I can imagine because I think every time I've gone to a different Booth everyone's got a PO after issue and and this is the beginning we have really exciting plans the augmented Dynamics to unseen levels Patricia thank you for everything you've done uh people love poapps I think more than anything in this space so you know what people love more Bangles that's it I'm not actually too sure about that one well I love it a lot well thank you Patricia Everybody cheers all right we need to go find uh Jesse from base and I've been told that Jesse from base is in the basement is what I've been told so we're gonna go find him it's really dark down here [Music] so Jesse I was told that I would find you in the basement yes we are here in the basement at home base I was just I tweeted I said me and Stony had a little Fireside down here I said stop me and stani are getting based talking about base in the basement at home base at East Denver did you know what you were doing when you guys named the name base we we knew we were doing it was uh you know how quickly after you named it based was the first based joke made immediately I mean immediately it was a moment I mean literally we were going through naming and this was actually before we we're building an L2 we were iterating through a bunch of different products and we landed on the name base um uh on one of the earlier products and it was me and Max brandsburg who runs the consumer like all the consumer products at coinbase and we were just kind of going through names and he was like What if we said bass and both of us were just like oh my God okay we should pack unpack like how many layers this goes deep so we have coinbase so it's already in base yes uh but coin is the equity yeah and now base is the change so that's one layer yep uh home base as in like it's coinbase's home base so that's another layer and how many more layers does this go after this I mean bass like it's the you know a foundational layer of the crypto economy that's another one um I mean based in that we have base.org which is just an incredible domain it's a one one uh syllable word that has such meaning you know I there's so many reasons bass is is a good name but to the point of like you come up with a name and you're like well now now we need to make a chain I mean really the journey to the chain was a journey of knowing that we needed to figure out how to bring coinbase on chain and not knowing how to do it but like knowing it in our hearts that that was the process we were trying to do and I think we landed on the name base pretty early and it felt aligned to that mission and then it took us a few tries to be like oh what's the right way to do that and out the other side came to L2 and we named it base and it all fit because we've been thinking with that mission for almost two years certainly and so I think people if you ask them the question hey what's coinbase they would say oh it's coinbase.com it's an exchange it does some other things but what is coinbase is really answered as in that centralized coinbase.com thing now there's base.org and you've talked a lot about you know on change the next online what is the future of base is is the future of coinbase as a thing to say like oh what is coinbase will that eventually be oh coinbase is base.org it is the space chain like what how integral is it is this a side project or is this the full thing where are we on that Spectrum I I definitely don't think it's a side project but I think it's also not that coinbase is based.org you know I think coinbase is Mission has been very clear for the last seven years since Brian wrote this like coinbase secret master plan where it is we're building the crypto economy and we think that's going to come in four phases first the protocols then the exchange that's coinbase exchange then the consumer interfaces that's coinbase wallet that's coinbase that wall That's coinbase and then we're gonna have millions of applications that enable billions of users to use crypto and we think about bases phase 3.5 it's like the platform that enables those millions of applications to bring in the billions of people and we think that that's incredibly complementary to all of the coinbase products because it's going to mean more really useful things for users to actually do and internally at coinbase and this this kind of gets lost on the broader world but internally we've been thinking about our consumer products as the gateway to web 3 for the last two and a half years three years that's like been the drum beat that we've all been running to it's like we are building the gateway to web3 and I think we're starting to see that come through like if you look at coinbase wallet a year and a half ago it was almost unusable and today it's like Far and Away the most usable crypto wall in the world and that is reflective of us saying this is a gateway to M3 we're not just an exchange we want people to use crypto what was pretty exciting for me to see after the base announcement uh was all of the applications that seemed ready to go yeah so some announced like Hey we're building on base not like hours after the base announcement some the next day some a couple days later and we're still seeing them now what's that pipeline been like like were some applications uh made privy to base ahead of time some applications have already made their announcements post like talk about that process yeah so when we got to the point where we had line of sight on a test net launch we went out and talked with a number of different folks in the broader ecosystem and one of our values for base has been based for everyone like that's been this drum beat that we've we've hit on internally for our team and what that's meant is in every sector you know defy lending uh D5 social gaming um and then even in the sub sectors like Trading lending borrowing uh you know whatever we didn't want to go to just one person and say this is an exclusive and so we did is we went and talked to a few people and across each of those sectors we had I think three people at a minimum who were announcing on day one that they were Building on Base and so that was this incredible group of I think like 70 different teams Building on Base announced on day one since we actually went public and we told the world about this I mean we've had so much demand like you guys just walked through the basement yeah it's packed we're putting people's photos up on the wall whenever they commit to building on base and that's all indicative of this value which is bases for everyone like it's not just an exclusive you know Carter of people who are you know have as special access to coinbase or special access to some part of the team it's like we're gonna invest in making it so everyone everywhere in the world can build on base because that's what's going to be required to bring a million builders on chain and then a billion users on chain and then I actually have a the bank List family is gonna love this I'm all right uh the phrase is a million Builders so we can have a billion Bank lists can we put that into official official base terminology say it again for the people in the back a million Builders so we can have one billion Bank lists so uh a lot something that we've noticed in acrossly various ecosystems the layer two ecosystems is like polygon has an insane BT BD team like they're always like known for that uh building on on starkware and Stark net is like their BD teams are very very strong uh is there like a similar effort for a base chain is there like a coinbase putting BD behind this or like what's the how does this world work yeah I mean we gotta walk out there and introduce you to our BD team I I mean I've been so blown away at the work that polygon and and uh others have done in bringing people into the crypto economy and I think our Jesus is like there's so much growth ahead of us we are literally at Day Zero there are like a few million people in crypto we need to get to billions of people in crypto there are a few hundred businesses in crypto we need to get to millions of businesses in crypto and so I'm so grateful for all of the people who have been running incredible BD efforts to bring people into crypto I think I'm excited that coinbase is about to join The Fray You know we have an incredible BD team we have an incredible sales team we have this entire ecosystem of users of institutions of developers who know and trust and have relationships with coinbase already and we're gonna activate those people that come on Jade because our thesis if we can bring the 110 million users the 80 billion dollars of assets coinbase like that's the starting point but then because of our brand because of the trust that we have because of the the track record we have of making crypto easy and secure we're going to be able to bring in billions of people and that's every day I wake up one million Builders 1 billion band classes that's it you say that in the mirror every single morning every good morning oh my God but but you they're like Jesse you you I I'm like one million builders in 2023 one million Bank lists in 2024. they're like too crazy Jesse and you know I'm not crazy enough not crazy enough I mean this is something that we've been saying a bank list from the get-go is like we want one billion people to go bankless and the way that we do that is with technology that scales yes yes yes and it you know we haven't been ready for it for the last while but really just in the last few few days I mean a few days a few years we've crossed we've crossed over the infrastructures there layer twos are getting cheap enough wallets are getting good enough we are at the inflection point where on chain is going to become the next online we are going to have a million Builders and then we will have a billion Bank lists in quick succession okay here's the line that I've got for you yes okay base makes coinbase bankless base makes coinbase Bank list base makes coinbase better base makes coinbase uh on chain native company I mean this is why we're here we're so fired up and when I want to tie the bow on the BD conversation because I think what I really want listeners to be impressed with is that it's one thing when something like arbitrum or polygon or optimism does there be the effort for some non-crypto thing yeah who are these people a lot of outside of people outside they don't know who these teams are but coinbase does have that brand and so coinbase BD effort hits different and so this is really about growing the pie to do BD for the whole entire industry leveraging the legitimacy of coinbase yeah I don't think people are ready for the work we're gonna do to bring people on chain this is our mission we're going to bring a billion people Unchained so that they can transact and live in the crypto economy and so they can have increased economic freedom that just makes their lives better makes the world a better place it's pretty crazy and Immaculate to see Jesse that uh I was like I found somebody said like oh yeah there's the bass boost I'm like where's the bass booth and like well that's when I learned oh it's in the basement I'm like so okay first off that's great uh but then I come down here and it's an entire floor and so base is only just like a few weeks old an announcement not even like a week and a half or so and already like there's a there's talks about Building on Base there are people what looks like an Apple Studio like learning about how to build on base and it's already full yeah so like the excitement out of the gate I've never seen before in crypto so congratulations for all the work that you've done we're so lucky to have such a great team building on base uh building base and they were such so great to have so many incredible people building on base so I'm I'm it's been one week exactly today's wow and I am just so grateful to get to be a part of this and get to be a part of making crypto you know happen it's a it's a really really just humbling to see all the great work that you guys been doing so thank you for helping scale the world and helping the world go bankless awesome thank you Jesse appreciate it damn [Music] a million Builders so we can have a billion Bank lists [Music] come on down brother
