do you see the dollar diminishing worldwide and the Juan taking a stronger role gold Reserve currencies going up or is there any position for crypto monetary systems here the gold trend is probably going to continue the one is starting from a very small base but I think it's generally going to increase somewhat it has been for the past few years I don't think it'll be anywhere near the dollar anytime soon as far as digital gold Bitcoin for example and the issue is it's still too small in terms of global oil trade is over two trillion dollars a year and we're talking about an asset that's hundreds of billions of dollars as it gets bigger that does become more interesting but I think that people expecting that to happen in a year or two or three it's premature what timeline we look out at depends on one the evolution of Technology over time and then two political decisions of whether or not they want to promote certain things or whether they want to pull back
