e another story all-time high week for eve a few all-time highs were hit this week i feel like celebrating every single one of them where are we right now and what was all-time high david yeah e started at four thousand two hundred dollars the new all-time high of four thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars was hit a little bit more uh more than 24 hours ago but roughly 36 hours ago the time of recording we are currently clocking in at 4 485 dollars next milestone is 5k i feel like uh you know that that's coming right up but are we up how much are we up on the week we are up uh 15 on the week it looks like we dipped a little bit before i wrote that number down so maybe about like 13 or 14 why do you think this is like the facebook meta news not to front run that we're going to talk about that in news a little bit but do you think there's a metaverse story connected here or do you think this is just the market kind of catching up to what eath should be there are so many stories about what you should be there's nfts there's the metaburst metaverse there's there's defy there's scaling there's the merge ultra scalable ethereum like people are getting that wrap their their heads wrapped around that and there's so many stories to tell to tell why this number is going up uh and uh you know a lot of stories means a lot of reasons for a number to go up i still think it's low to be honest i still think the price of is undervalued even at these prices um but you guys know that if you've been hanging out with bank lists for any time soon we are ultra bullish on this asset the listeners are like we know guys it's like shut up already okay we know we already have our bags back all right uh eat bitcoin ratio what that what is that looking like david yeah again uh three green weeks in a row for the east bitcoin ratio clocking in at point zero seven three four uh and so ever since the bitcoin etf the bitcoin ether ratio has done really really well uh and again that has has not spent very very little time higher than this especially in the last six months but also definitely ever wow david are we getting close to we're getting close to like the two year three year maybe yeah all-time high for the ratio exactly yeah so that's a lot a lot of people i know i know anthony suzano pays attention to this ratio a lot and like i know he's like he's like waiting for that to break through he's frothing at the mouth yeah he's like he's like just don't tweet don't yeah this is one to uh continue watching but like this is also an indicator i would say of the um continued crypto bull run right if this ratio is gaining steam then it means bull run in full effect but let's talk about the best of all worlds which is the bed index bankless bed index that is bitcoin eth and the dpi all inside one token that's a third a third a third what are we looking at on the week yeah bed had a good week because it is the best index in all of d5 start of the week at 172 hit a new high of 192 dollars currently clocking in at 181 overall up uh how much percent on the week uh i don't know five percent five percent call that five percent so guys of course you know you can get into bed get with this index it's a simple purchase go to the index co-op dot com website your bed and uh purchase that it's actually up 60 over the 90 days in terms of close to 60 uh in terms of um you know the 90 day increase in this index so it's starting to get closer to being sort of a staple type index of the crypto markets which is awesome to see also ultrasound money eth is becoming ultrasound money and just passed a big milestone what is that david three quarters of one million ether has been burned as of this week 761 ether that's more ether than i have closing in on the one million ether mark a little bit more huh just a little bit just past just past uh david's bags here um this is cool too i wanted to actually correct this because i think i said that last week i think i said that um eth had 10x the transaction fees over the past seven days with bitcoin and i was actually wrong and someone reminded me of this ethereum actually had 100x the transaction fee revenue of bitcoin over a seven day period of time so i was like you know 10x off on that number i knew it was a lot bigger but over the last seven days look man ethereum had 50 almost 50 million dollars worth of transaction fee revenue and back to what we said last week what do blockchains do blockchain sell blocks this is their transaction fee revenue and uh i guess a year ago two years ago um it was like a fight between bitcoin and eth like every day it's like who's kind of going to have more transaction fee revenue here's bitcoin a very distant um number on this chart uh not even not even a million dollars in transaction fee revenue over the past uh seven days so it's super interesting to see right the thesis for ethereum has always been you make black block space more valuable then the asset becomes more valuable and of course eip1559 kick that into into high gears so that there's this immediate feedback loop but it's it seems to be the case that this is happening um revenue numbers going up for ethereum block space any other takes on this david yeah there is a direct connection between the amount of fees your blockchain collects and the soundness of the money and if you have not yet learned how to articulate that association there's a ton of stuff to go and read on the bankless newsletter letter uh ultra scalable ethereum ultrasound money with justin drake tons of things so make sure you understand the relationship between block space demand and soundness of the money it's really important concept the only one that's closest is finance smart chain and like i don't even know what they do with their numbers okay um let's talk about this too last week was actually the first week that ethereum actually had negative issuance david we've seen some milestones on this ultrasound money thing in the past in fact like the first day i remember a an individual block it was the first day of the first two days after eip1559 an individual block that had negative issuance i remember being really excited to see that like it's happening but now we're hitting all of these milestones uh talk about this for a minute yeah yeah i think it was like just a couple hours after eip159 everyone was scraping the block ether scan trying to find the first ultrasound block yeah that's right it took people a couple hours and then i think just a couple weeks later we had our first ultrasound day where the full oh no we had uh just a couple yeah a couple weeks later we had our first ultrasound hour where every uh all the blocks over the hour had were ultrasound they were burning collectively more ether than was being issued a couple weeks after that we had our first ultrasound day 24 hours of uh more ether being burned than was being issued we have now hit our first week of total issuance going down rather than up due to ether burn and so at some point we're going to be repeating this but it's going to be a month and then at some point it'll just be every month moving forward into the future uh ryan are we seeing the current limit of the ether supply right now like that could that could be happening as of this week yeah ether capped out that is a possibility that's true i mean uh justin drake when he put some numbers on this predicted this in april he's he he thought that ether supply would never get above 120 million and i don't know what the total supply looks like but but you're right at it right now the total supply is a hundred and eighteen point two million oh so over under do we ever hit 120 million what do you think oh under uh yeah i definitely uh under for sure because this isn't even getting started yet okay once the merge happens so like we're maybe six months away from that it's over it's done it's gone right so a reduction of four percent this is an immediate reduction of four percent annualized issuance so we're going to be ultrasound month every single month every year i wouldn't be surprised if we start to get ultrasound decades david under our belts with this i mean we'll see what this is as soon as we hit the merge it's just ultrasound now and for forever yeah so it's just it's just a race to get to the merge unless you think block space ethereum block space is going to drastically decrease in demand is there any world where that happens i i don't think so and there's a there's a take that we have later to talk about what happens when you increase the block space available people just use more of it yeah uh and so like even with charting we're going to increase the amount of blocks available people are just going to use more they're going to transact more and that's the thing it's not even going to be humans it's going to be other chains that are actually using this block space and being secured by it absolutely there's uh there's no coincidence that we are breaking all-time highs this week and this is all-time high week and then also ethburn uh ultrasound week as well like that is not as a coincidence like bull markets bring in fees yeah and so like really this is a game of are like are we in all-time high season right like are we in bull market season are we out of the crab season and we're just going to keep on eating into new all-time highs if that's true then we might actually be in ultrasound territory now and for it forever but if that bull market can carry us into the merge like that's that's a possibility heating into all-time highs eating into the bulb markets what we're doing right now i love it yeah top assets by market cap this is all top assets by market it doesn't have things like gold but it has things that you can like just generally trade on exchanges so number one of course actually not of course i'm surprised to see this the top asset in the world worth 2.5 trillion dollars with the t is microsoft now no longer apple it's microsoft actually then after that it's apple and google and uh then some like oil and gas companies amazon etc uh all the way down to number seven is bitcoin bitcoin is the seventh largest asset in the world that you can buy on an exchange of this type right behind tesla yeah right behind tesla well that's interesting and then right ahead of facebook and then if you keep scrolling past berkshire pass nevita uh nvidia uh you get to ethereum at number 13 almost breaching into the top 10 assets in the world that's pretty cool to see yeah ether is within striking distance i think it's just like something like 12 or 15 more percent which is just like hey that's just like one good week away from becoming a top 10 global asset so you got to love this you think jamie dimon's looking at this and being like oh i'm number 14 and ethereum just passed me now it's it's over for uh for jp morgan it's like i was wrong about i was wrong about crypto i don't think he's saying that probably not but maybe he should be and along with the rest of the banks even visas behind ethereum at this point which all makes sense because ethereum is a network of networks it is a global settlement layer it is a monetary system it is a money it is not like all of these other things aside maybe a little bit like bitcoin uh i think they'll continue rising in the charts here's a scary thought i was thinking about this earlier this week as bullish as i am steven you know i'm bullish right and you know i don't think the the bear market is coming anytime soon i think we've still got a run in us but it is a scary thought to me sometimes when i see all of these token thoughts probably close to 50 percent of people right now have never seen a bear market okay they don't even know what that looks like they're they their only experience with crypto is oh i buy the thing and the number goes up oh and it doesn't really matter what i buy because anything i buy the number goes up right and like oh jpegs go up okay everything goes up all right and some things just go up faster than other things and so what do i want to do i want to get in the the um assets and tokens that go up the fastest right these are like little babies in crypto like and i don't mean that in a condescending way i'm just they're so new they're like newborn babies and they've never seen the real okay they haven't really like until you've been through a bear market and like everything gets tested your conviction gets tested all of your theses get tested and you've seen kind of the recovery of that the other side you don't really know what you own so many people like your friends and family people you like go to thanksgiving with they pro many of them will probably own some crypto but very few of them probably know what they own or why they own it right so this is actually a little scary to me a little concerning because um you know bear markets can come and then what happens when people don't have conviction in the things that they bought and they start to see a twenty percent thirty percent decline they're going to head for the exits so and then it's gonna make it worse right it's gonna make it worse loop yeah i mean that that just struck me i guess like at some point in time you get a certain amount of people who buy in and they don't really know why they bought in and then it kind of like there's a tipping point reached where like something bad could happen right i guess that's what speculative bubbles are at the end of the day absolutely any thoughts yeah one of the guts that i that i try and listen to is like the um euphoria pain spectrum like sometimes i'm like oh it's been a while since i felt any pain i've been feeling a lot of euphoria lately like that usually means that pain's like around the corner yeah like you don't get to be in markets and don't feel like both like you you get equal amounts of pain in equal amounts of euphoria uh and there's been a lot of euphoria lately and as you can definitely tell that in like how many strangers there are at this nfc nyc event like a lot of these people are just here for the first time and like they've come they've been coming in when the times are good not they're very few people that have felt pain and so so does this worry sir are you worried right now are we getting a little long in the tooth in this run the thing is like i'm i always leave room for a new paradigm and so like i think like all of the pain that the collective crypto uh community felt during 2018 2019 like it's it's that the meme of the army man protecting the sleeping child from the from the knives and the swords and the grenades and stuff like i think we maybe there's a world where we took that pain and like you know shielded the 2020 the 2021 ears from having to worry about that because we built all the infrastructure in the bear market i think the other thing is once you go through a bear market right like you're not worried about that you don't you don't worry about the next one anymore it's like what's the worst that could happen right oh i was making so many jokes this week as well like oh yeah all all the crypto people that i met in 2019 2018 like a lot of us are like gosh the bear market was nice like it was quiet back then like it was quiet good time to make friends good time to start things good time to build right and like if you didn't leave in 2018 2019 are you gonna leave in the great bear market of 2024 no it'll still be a bull market to us exactly anyway i just you know it's something i'm thinking about and um again i don't think this is imminent personally but uh but you never know and uh markets can certainly turn in a hurry um at least in the short run hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to bankless hq right now to develop your crypto investing skills and learn how
