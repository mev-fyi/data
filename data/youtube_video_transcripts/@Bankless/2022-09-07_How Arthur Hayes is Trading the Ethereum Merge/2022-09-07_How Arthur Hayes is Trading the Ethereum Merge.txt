this thing is interesting we have the number two currency that's going from proof of work to proof of stake now whether or not that's a good thing it's irrelevant but the structural fact is there's less issuance of it it's the only currency that's of this size that's doing this switch so it's not like we care about what solana is doing or cardano is doing or near any of these other you know l1 competitors ethan doesn't matter this isn't about whether or not each process is more tps than the other competitor it's here's a emission schedule an inflation schedule and a value we know what it's going to be afterwards you know it's almost impossible for you to pre-trade this situation the flows are just going to be the flows similar to the bitcoin having so i love this trade welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan shaw adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a special guest a long sought after guest here with us today on bankless arthur hayes he's a crypto trader of traders now he's particularly bullish on the eth trade he's going to tell us why a few things to look out for during this episode number one why is arthur a traitor anyway how does he approach the market the crypto market we get inside his head we ask these questions number two why arthur thinks fiat inflation is a near certainty we talk energy we talk debt we talk demographics finally we get to the east trade that's number three arthur says it's the most obvious trade he's ever seen in krypto and he's been here a lot of years is the merge priced in that's the question we ask him we also ask what's more powerful the merge or macro markets he answers that question too finally we get to why arthur is still alive in crypto when so many other traders have gotten lost along the way arthur has survived what are the secrets to surviving in crypto as a traitor david really fun episode arthur's just uh he's great to talk to you uh he has a you know incredible clarity of thought as well and i you know i love the way traders think they they just to me they always seem like professional athletes at some level where a lot of this is is uh obviously data and science but you know some of this is just art and raw skill the ability to navigate uh to navigate marcus kind of like a surfer catching waves right yeah he uh he's not a traitor that looks at like lines on a chart right i don't think i've ever seen arthur hayes draw a line on the chart he is strictly looking at more macro more zoomed out influences he's looking at the words of the central bank he's looking at the fundamentals behind the ethereum merge and he's cross-referencing all of these data points which as a non-trader yet somebody who makes like content about these same subjects i can actually like really understand rather than be like oh that little like charity chart thing points this way like no that's not how how mr hayes thinks it's funny i know we just set him up as a trader right and he definitely is a trader right but like also i find much more in common with him maybe this is because he's trading on kind of a month to years-long cycle than a lot of the ta traders or even the narrative traders that i know in the space did you feel that too yeah no i i definitely felt that for sure thesis driven trading right thesis driven trading which is like something i can really get behind of all of all kind of trading out there uh arthur of course has um he was the uh ceo and co-founder of bit max uh which was a derivatives exchange that was extremely popular back in back in the early days of my early days of crypto and even before i got in uh 26 2017 to 20 like 19 it had the vast majority 90 of like all volume uh on like bitcoin derivatives uh there's a story there that uh where bitmex got into trouble for not uh doing kyc uh that's not the story that we cover here on the podcast we are strictly focused on ether the merge macro market markets and just some other crypto stuff as well so this is what we focus on here on the show guys if you want uh some of david and myself our thoughts after this episode i got a lot of thoughts to talk about david with you always do you got to stick around for the debrief premium subs you can get that now you can access that now and of course that is where dave and i unpack the episode that was it's our raw unfiltered thoughts for the bankless nation there'll be a link where you can go uh premium in the the show notes all right let's get right to our conversation with arthur but before we do we want to tell you about the fantastic bankless sponsors who made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there arbitrarium is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have

bankless arthur hayes is a crypto og he's a trader through and through discovered bitcoin in the early days 2013 or so co-founded bitmex in 2014 became crypto's dominant derivative exchange more recently both david and myself have been binging on arthur's content because he's become one of our favorite writers he's got a lot to say about macro a lot to say about crypto and even more recently the ethereum merge the eth trade that's what we're going to be talking about on bank list today arthur how you doing excellent thanks for having me can i just like kick things off and and ask you uh so why are you writing so much you seem you seem to have a lot to say and i'm wondering because i know you're a traitor right so there's got to be some sort of you know uh we we could say it's altruism if there's a piece of it that's education altruism but are there some other incentives at play here is this about kind of building a brand is this about you're just excited about a specific trade you want to get the word out um i think somewhere you talked about how writing helped you clarify your thoughts too why are you writing so much so i think that that latter thing you said about clarifying my thoughts is probably the most important thing for me right because i manage my own money i really enjoy doing it i think it's an intellectually stimulating exercise especially when you get to have opposing views to other people so you're discussing them obviously it's me versus many from my blog because it's not actually a two-way conversation but obviously people post comments on twitter and other social media platforms so you hear what people think about what i've written but at the end of the day if while you're trying to put together a coaching argument that's going to be read by you know a few hundred thousand people across the world you don't want to sound stupid you want to make sure that your facts are correct you want to make sure that your logic is correct you want to make sure that you're evaluating all the different ways in which you could be wrong such that you have confidence in what you think should happen in the future if you're right and i think if you approach it in that respect your trading decisions will become a lot better because it's not just okay let me just go put this trade on and i'll find out you know in a minute a half an hour a year a month whatever their time for it is if i'm right or wrong i'm gonna put this trade on and i'm gonna write about it and then the whole world can see me for what i what i've done and critique it and i think that is in it's scary in some respects right because you don't want to have like miss some fundamental thing somebody points it out to you in the first five seconds of reading your your your your piece you're like [ __ ] i didn't think of that that like just completely invalidates everything i've been saying i shouldn't have put that trade on let me go you know log back into my trading account and like reverse everything i just did so that's exactly what you don't want to happen and i think by spending the time to write and to open yourself up to criticism by anyone with an internet connection you become a lot better thinker and and i think a lot better investor by the way have you ever written something like something where where you did that where you got some feedback and you're like oh rewind undo maybe it's more internal right so i had an idea about you know maybe it's a particular subset of coins that i was bullish about and i had a position already and i was like okay let me write about this this is why i like them and i start writing and i'm like it doesn't really sound so good and then you start thinking about that doesn't really fit with my overarching thesis i think i got this wrong and then i'll go back over just straight out of the whole thing i remove it from my my uh my essay and i'll be thankful that i actually went through that exercise because no maybe you could be right in a particular time frame but if you don't believe in your position and at least for me i'm not trading on a very short time frame so i tend to hold things for you know months years because i can and have that luxury of doing so you have to be able to suffer you know like you know this weekend once ether down like 30 or something like that something you know pretty substantial right you you actually have to have conviction in your idea a conviction in your future prognosis and if you haven't spent hours writing at least in my my respect then how can you look at the market and say okay my mark-to-market is down 30-40 whatever it is doesn't really matter but i not only believe in the trade but maybe i'm going to consider adding more to the trade because um i think this is a good buying opportunity and so i think if you approach it in that respect it's a very useful exercise as an investor some people in the twitter sphere have speculated that you actually have a ghostwriter but i'm guessing a ghostwriter just because of the absolute just like torrent of content coming out of your your medium blog but i'm guessing if you had a ghostwriter that would invalidate almost everything that you just said huh so there's no ghostwriter behind the scenes i have a research analyst who really helps me um fact check certain things uh he'll go and do a deep dive on a particular subject if you're writing an article about something he'll go get me a bunch of facts that i want instead of me i'm going to go on the internet and do that myself and make some graphs for me and so he saves me a lot of time in that respect and if i want to like talk about certain facts and figures he'll be able to go and get them from me so i do have a research analyst he's extremely uh valuable and saves me a lot of time and helps me write more the reason i've never subscribed to the arthur as a ghostwriter thesis because i feel like um you have a particular voice that's really hard to mimic like it's pretty it's pretty unique and pretty like honestly entertainment entertaining i like i i don't feel like i'm working when i'm reading uh one of your pieces which is uh which is kind of fun i'm learning but i'm not working but um uh you mentioned you mentioned before that uh that you're a traitor and that's why i said in in kind of your bio like i i think of arthur hayes like part of your legacy as as as a traitor uh through and through but you also mentioned that like your your holding period is you know uh months uh sometimes years as well can i just ask the questions like why are you a trader why not so like why not just buy and hold i mean you were here from from the early days right a lot of people have had a lot of success obviously in crypto and you know some would argue that some of the most successful people in crypto and from a returns perspective have just bought and hold why do you trade instead so that's just my mentality i think buy and hold works in a for a certain mentality especially crypto i'd have to say you probably have to be a little insane and that's not a dig at certain people if you look at some of the longest term holders of bitcoin they've held it when it went from a you know a few cents to imagine you bought bitcoin and it was worth a penny and it was worth a dollar you're 100 x you're like [ __ ] i killed this trade and then you know 10 years later it was 60 000 right how how much conviction does it take for somebody to hold an asset i don't care what it is you're up a hundred percent you have a hundred times yeah you believe it's gonna go harder higher that's not me i don't have that sort of that mindset uh i approached crypto when i first you know discovered bitcoin i was like wow i'm an arbitrage guy i sit at work where i used to all day long and i try to make a few basis points selling features contracts and buying stocks i did that for five years and i'd be you know it'd be a knockout trade if i made even a percent uh on a trade and yet i come into crypto i log onto something that's changed and i was like whoa my p l is 200 annualized for training by just doing the simplest trade selling of futures and buying cash and that's what i started doing and i you know i obviously over time i came to believe more in bitcoin and the whole ecosystem or not but when i approached it it's okay this isn't i understand this trade i understand derivatives this isn't new you know ecosystem but [ __ ] me this is an amazing trade and i take the risk of believing in bitcoin or not out of it and so that's probably where i come uh at it from and obviously now you know i have you know much more capital to play with i can become a long-term investor it doesn't really matter to me if the price goes down 50 or what not because i've segmented that particular part of my portfolio i know what it should be doing i'm perfectly happy with the volatility and i don't want to sit at the computer screen all day doing trades i'd rather write read a book do other things so you know to be a you know trader in a short time frame is extremely difficult takes a lot of dedication and it takes a lot of time [Music] arthur what did you see as a trader what did you see in crypto that struck the light bulb as in like oh i want to trade here now like what what about the crypto industry or crypto thesis investment thesis or be attracted you so much uh the fact that you know you it takes an internet connection you log on you start trading so you have a whole this whole spectrum of humanity and because it's you know money right money is completely fictitious it's a mental construct of socialized humans there is no intrinsic value so it's very religious so you either have people who hate it or people who love it and those are the best kinds of markets because you get extreme volatility as you move from the greed and the fear um emotions and you don't have anything intrinsically to to base it off it's not like you're buying and selling property or like something you can hold in your hand there's nothing it's literally somebody or some organization posted a paper on the internet and said here is a piece of software let's mine this made up currency and look at where we are now you know trillion three trillion whatever you want to call the total market cap and you have everybody who thinks this is a complete scam to you know this is the way that we should be organizing human affairs i'm using code as law and whatnot right so these two spectrums that's what you want to trade you want intense volatility intense beliefs because you're going to catch people on both sides who are wrong people who believe too much in the upside we should believe too much in the downside and um as a trader you want you know a highly volatile asset to trade because i think that's extremely interesting at least for me i think it's interesting that your answer begins with well crypto is super religious but i don't really see you as having picked a crypto tribe right like you're not a bitcoiner you're not really etherean you're a traitor has have you ever been compelled by a particular tribe in crypto or like how have you navigated these waters i think everything in life is nuanced it's like thinking that you know in markets right nothing goes up or down in a straight line it's a wave and so while there might be a camp that's particularly right in the long term you know i think bitcoin is obviously the shining light benchmark asset the purest form of money in our ecosystem probably one of the best designed um currencies in our ecosystem but it'll go through ups and downs some of the coins all perform at some other times bitcoin will outperform but other times and so if you're in this you know okay just buy another bitcoin and that that could be your life and that's completely fine uh and that you know to me that's not that interesting um i'd like to try to you know trade around see what else is interesting out there you know ethereum obviously has captured my interest and there's a lot of other new things that people can develop using bitcoin ethereum and some of the other early projects of the substrate to just bring their creativity to it and see what they can create yeah what's really interesting i think arthur is um you know well you may not have a kind of like um a specific tribe like you know bitcoin maximalist or something or uh either either maximalist or something like this i i do think you have a very uh pro crypto thesis like your thesis is that crypto is going to appreciate relative to almost every other asset and certainly relative to like fiat based assets maybe that's where we want to kind of pick up the story if we're sort of unpacking arthur's brain here um you wrote an article recently i really enjoyed called a samurai night in the yankee and the samurai of course is uh this is uh japan and so the central bank of japan we've got the knight which is the eu and the us which is kind of the fed uh jerome powell and company and they all beginning of this article they all meet at an inn and they discuss what they're going to do what each of their kingdoms are going to do about this this great bear which is i think the analogy is russia that's kind of attacking the kingdom and wreaking havoc uh and um the scourge of the bear which is inflation how are the samurai in the night and the yankee going to quell inflation for their respective kingdoms what tools do they have to bear and so the article begins with this discussion um can we talk about that for a minute because i feel like if we're gonna dive into macro we gotta hit the subject of inflation from your perspective what is the cause of inflation right now there's i think there's two causes there's one cause of okay you know maybe we'll back up a bit right so world war ii ended united states didn't really have any um apart from pearl harbor the contiguous in the united states was not damaged um europe destroyed russia destroyed china destroyed japan destroyed so you think about the major industrial powers pre-world war ii most of them were in shambles and then then writes the the us to the rescue and says hey europe here's this marshall plan here's a bunch of might even loan you some money rebuild yourself didn't really do so much for russia and china japan was essentially you know a pseudo-american colony for a few years they exited that and they were on their way to industrializing as well and america said hey guys build yourselves back up and guess what we'll open our markets and you can sell your excess stuff to us and we'll buy it and that worked really really well um for you know 30 40 years and as a consequence of being their global reserve currency you know america had to open up its capital markets and you know post the 70s when america went off the gold standard had to become more financialized and i think you have two big trends that sort of made the uh anyone call it labor or the right of the workers or their percentage of income that they earned secularly in decline and that was women in the workforce and china so you have all these new people who want a job who can have a job and obviously the wages go down so corporate profits go up great for corporations and so you know and then you have technology the internet computing and so stuff just gets cheaper for most people energy we get better at extracting oil and natural gas other hydrocarbons over the ground that gets cheaper as well we get more efficient in our economies and so that lasts from you know 1980s until probably you know early 2000s 2010s and then we get to the covet era where you know we think that okay we've conquered this energy thing we're going to become green and we're done with fossil fuels and we're going to go wind and solar and whatnot and then we have a pandemic which we do about once every hundred years all right spanish flu now we have this one debatable you know severity or whatnot and obviously a lot of people died which is very sad and what they will respond with we're gonna print a bunch of money and hand it out to people now u.s did the biggest you know m2 in the us was at 40 from like 19 from 2019 until current and everybody else did you know something similar and so we have this monetary aspect and so we said hey people here's a bunch of cash we're going to hand it to you go buy stuff and so people bought stuff they bought a lot of stuff especially in america you know stimi's right and maybe they went to the robin hood account and they bought a gamestop or they went down to their auto dealership and they bought a new you know pickup truck or whatever so we have inflation because people have a lot of money and then for whatever reason um you know west u.s and nato and uh eu such nato and and russia have a little you know falling out over this whole ukraine issue it's irrelevant whose fault it is or right or wrong it doesn't really matter and the response was hey we're going to kick the biggest energy exporter in the world and that's what russia is whether that and that's you know crude natural gas fertilizers and some food stuff so we're saying what [ __ ] you we're going to take your money we'll freeze it we don't want to trade with you anymore okay cool and so now you have real inflation of energy and food because when you remove the biggest exporter out of the global equation you make things more expensive so not only do we give people a bunch of money to buy stuff we also have we let's take not we the a particular block of countries said we're not going to trade with the biggest energy exporter and so you have that those costs going up and so i think you have two forces in places there's the monetary aspect of printing too much money and then there is we're going to upend global supply chains so it's just more expensive to get energy from where it's produced to where it's consumed and unlike you know bitcoin when you build a gas pipeline or you drill oil wells you you have a destination in mind of where you're gonna where it's gonna go and so to reroute oil and natural gas from europe to pop you know buyers in asia india and china it's not the easiest thing to do and i think you know zoltan paz posnar how do you pronounce his last name that credit suisse has written very extensively about it's not that easy to reroute these commodity flows and that is structural inflation and there's nothing you can raise interest rates to 30 if you want to as a fed that's not going to build an oil pipeline that's going to get the oil from where it's produced to where it's consumed and that's the problem so i think we have two pillars of this you know inflationary problem now yes you can solve the my trade one by you know raising interest rates cutting off the quantity of money but unless the west wants to re-engage with russia and say you know what sorry we'll buy your stuff again and then that other structural part of inflation is is still there and it's not as if we have another china or another half of the population that we're going to add to the workforce to make things cheaper to produce and so uh you said this later in your article the kind of the conundrum or the predicament for the samurai the night and the yankee is like is this um they have a whole bunch of debt that they eventually have to inflate away you said this i will argue that the only solution left for any governments of countries that are not productive which includes these countries is to pay back their debt loads by inflating them away uh and so that you think is the eventual outcome for all of these countries there and maybe that's what inflation actually is it's the process of these uh governments inflating away all of all of their debt can you talk about can you talk about kind of that end game scenario for the central bankers and why you think that is the only solution left well it's not the only solution there is another solution it's just one so my opinion in my view was that the role of the central bank is to protect debt backed asset deflation and if you're a bank that is game over because what you do as a bank and it's pro cyclical is that housing is the easiest example banks lend against houses because a house is so expensive the majority of people can't afford a house without financing therefore the value of the house is entirely dependent on how much financing is available and that's great if the prices are going up because the bank lends money against the house you can get financing therefore the asset grows up the bank's loan looks healthy you make your payments everything's happened everything's great but what happens when the asset price goes down well it makes it oh no i don't want to lend against this asset anymore and so by restricting lending actually cause it to go down even further and it's pro cyclical on the downside as well and this negative feedback loop and you know anyone who owned ust and tara understands these a little bit better now uh is something that the central bank is there to protect and in the 1930s and the great depression the lesson a lot of these bankers learned was that the federal reserve and other global central banks were they took the austerity path they didn't step up and give the fiat money to protect the banking system from cleansing all these loans and that is the cause of the depression and we never want to do that again and let the banking system essentially fail so every time there's a little hiccup where the banks overextended themselves we're going to say you know what don't worry we'll back you up here's some more fiat credit cash and we can print it don't let the loans go down don't extinguish the credit and get back to a healthier uh standpoint so we've been doing this since the end of the great depression and so we've gotten to this to this point in in human civilization and the arc of human civilization where we don't unless someone's going to discover a new form of energy that's going to be extremely productive it's not like we have another 100x improvement in the use of energy in our economy so then how are we going to pay back all this debt and it's not as if the most productive developed economies their populations are growing they're actually falling because as people get richer they have less they have fewer kids so there's now that there's there's this population in the future to pay back all this debt so yes they could shrink the economy to the level of which the future projections and energy uses demands that be pretty painful and you know their constituents the banks would all go bankrupt or they can inflate it away and the global population or citizens can pay for it so you have two options um and so my view is that because central banks are there to protect the bank's asset books from falling they won't choose the option of deflating the world economy to a more sustainable level which would be extremely painful they will inflate it away which is what most governments do when they have when they face us this conundrum and this is not a new problem every major civilization faces the same issues you run out of cheap plentiful energy whether that's slaves oil or wood or coal or whatever it is and you resort to inflation this phrase structural inflation is the first time i was the first time i've heard that and like my understanding just to check it is that we used to have this global economy that was all plugged into each other and then we had this like war in europe that decoupled the fiat currencies of the west of europe and and the united states from the energy supplies of russia and i think america is kind of hooked into europe because there are our political allies and so their desires are our desires to a decent extent but then when europe gets unplugged from russia because they're stopped they stopped buying russia's energy because russia invaded ukraine something that pissed off politically europe all of a sudden we like decouple the energy backing to our fiat dollars and now like there's a systemic like demand for energy that can't be supplied by the market because that that market is broken and that creates structural inflation which is aligned with all of the banking system with what you just said which is that we can't allow for too much deflation because then it'll [ __ ] the whole the whole thing so your your natural conclusion is like well we have the separation of fiat currency and energy in russia versus europe plus this systemically financialized economy that can't go down or else it goes to zero too quickly and so therefore your conclusion is that like everything inflates is it was that a fair summary yeah i give it a bit more nuance and the u.s is in a better position than europe because the us has is a net energy exporter i think right yeah someone can check me on that uh has a lot of land feeds itself uh europe maybe can feed itself cannot function at the industrial level and let's forget about everything europe except for germany and france they're the only ones that matter they cannot function without cheap energy germany especially cannot function without russian gas and we're seeing that play out in real time was the german producer prices are up i don't know 40 year on year in the last print or something ridiculous um trade balance is negative some of the biggest industrial giants in the world are contemplating shutting down these facilities and these are not and no i am not a chemist or you know i've never built anything at this scale but for my understanding of these very complex systems it's not as if you flip the off switch you know three months later everyone goes okay sorry russia we'll take your oil again and we'll take your gas and you flip the switch back on and the next day it turns back on it's not one of those things so if it goes off it's going off for a while and so that is i think the problem of of europe now us's i think us will have instructional inflation will it be you know crippling probably not because you know geopolitically it actually has enough stuff to you know feed itself it has enough energy europe is in a different situation the question that i posed in that article was okay what's america's resolve to help all their ally are they willing to print money to hand it to europe so that europe can hand it to its citizens to smooth over the cost of energy that's the question similar with japan japan's a net energy importer they're only starting to now think about restarting the nuclear reactors and so if japan is going to be the us's staunch ally which essentially is facing you know uh facing china to contain china from a naval perspective could can us let japan go its own way or are they going to come and support japan because i think kuru decided his recent i think he was at jackson hole he said i'm going to continue the policy of real cure control and cheap interest rates way below the rest of my peers at other central banks because i believe inflation in japan is transitory that's what he said in so many words he's going to continue running this play where the yen is going to get weaker and weaker and weaker energy costs are going to go up and up and up unless politically japan is allowed to buy russian energy i don't know so the u.s has a decision to make how much they want to support their allies and this decision has to come by this winter uh i was seeing a chart like just last week for uh like a german megawatt hour and like the price chart for that it's up like 3x in the last like six months or something and so like there's already very expensive energy in europe some of my european uh friends were talking about like yo even in the summer energy prices and energy contracts are already like super elevated and so if it seems to be like we're not going to be able to get past the winter here because this is when uh europe gets really really cold and that's when energy goes from a nice to have to like i need this to survive and so like are you kind of focused on like this winter as like a big this moment when a lot of these decisions must be made it don't have to be made it's just the the outlet will be anger from the populace and so if if you if u.s is going to come to the rescue and save the political construction of europe where you have you know brussels making all these decisions based on their ideology which is at odds with the average person who's going to have a lot harder time feeding and heating themselves this winter you know either they'll express it in elections the elect italian elections are september 25th we'll see how those goes or they're gonna express those in a more probably you know peaceful protest violent protest what have you and so when it's hard to eat and when it's hard to heat your home you go out in the streets and we'll see what happens so europe japan increasing inflation of course there's uh inflation in the u.s too but uh you uh introduced kind of this prospect of the us helping right the yankee riding and kind of saving the day what form would that take is that sort of like the fed purchasing uh japanese and euro bonds is that what that looks like and yeah it could be one that could be one uh wave you know the treasury is authorized to do this they've done it in the past they can go out and they can purchase the the bonds of uh ecb well the euro members issue and the boj issues in japan not the pha the ministry of finance and japan or the fed can stop raising rates it can go back to easy money the dollar is i don't know 20 percent 15 something something meaningful and over the last you know 12 to 18 months that's very bad for europe and japan because energy is priced in dollars therefore their import bills go sky high so by you know powell continuing to bang on the thing i'm going to be paul volcker i'm going to raise rates and break inflation while your colleagues across the pond whether it's the atlantic or the pacific they don't have those options if ecb stops buying the bonds of italy spain greece portugal then those countries won't be able to be on the euro but on the other hand they need to raise interest rates to combat inflation they can't do both they're they're kind of [ __ ] either way unless somebody with the global the global printing press can come and save them that's what's that require that that's a political that's a political decision i don't know which way it'll go but you know if these are the allies of the us and essentially do what they're told by the us political establishment then the reciprocal action would be well you got to help us survive politically because politically the euro project will not be able to survive if the ecb goes it alone without being held from america so so okay so so the the setup that you've described just described as this so the u.s doesn't want europe or japan buying uh energy from from russia right they don't want that for geopolitical reasons war in ukraine etc right so we've got that uh and and yet um if they stop buying which they have energy from russia then they're faced with this rampant inflation which causes domestic issues domestic turmoil um citizens re revolt kind of thing and so the way to alleviate that is for the the fed to ride in right in or the u.s to ride in uh and to start purchasing bonds or decrease its inflation rate but in doing that then you maybe cause more of an issue in the us with inflation that we already have and then the us gets its own political instability um you know population revolt sort of issues and we all know the u.s is not exactly a stable place or at least certainly not as stable as it has been in the 1990s and in the the early 2000s and the 2000s era so it's like we've got all of these counteracting forces uh some of which are i guess just raw physical like energy and the price of energy and that sort of thing many of which are geopolitical and it almost feels like the central bank is kind of taking a back seat to like the secretary of state and like geopolitical issues so that that is the landscape we find ourselves in right now oh yeah i would agree and again there's there's a decision tree what and what are the politics dictate for those in charge and there is no easy solution here can we talk about uh another difference i guess a subtle difference between um you know japan and eu and the us and that is demographics and you just hinted on it but there's like this tantalizing uh you know two liner in your article when you live on a farm children are free labor when you live in an apartment children are expensive conversation pieces um i thought that was funny uh cleveland i got it from peter i've heard him say that before too but it's this point that um as as countries mature uh and become economically more advanced um they start to have less children and the eu and japan are in a far worse place than the us but even the u.s is is starting to have you know far fewer children and um you know not repopulating your population that is deflationary uh from a um from an economic output perspective and so that's a problem too can you reflect on that a little bit yeah sure so i think at the end of the day we're all a product of the baby boom this is global across most of the developed world post world war ii everyone had a bunch of kids and the promise at least in the us you know stay in the us contract it was hey kids go out work really hard and spend all your money because the us government's got you back when you get old and you know when you get old we got medicare medicaid social security and we're going to take care of you so don't worry about it go out buy the new car get the starter home then move up to the next home get the ski house in tahoe get the beach pet on the hamptons get the boat do all that stuff don't save your money because the government's got you and so the third rail of u.s politics is health care spending i don't care for a republican or democrat there is no chance you will be reelected if you vote against old people and their health care because it was a promise an implicit promise made to the boomers this is how it's going to go when you work really hard and do what you're supposed to do now unfortunately they didn't have enough kids to support them and their kids aren't making enough assets right the boomers have all the assets they have what 35 40 trillion dollars of financial assets the millennials you know are probably one of the worst off generations and i don't know what the gen z situation is gen x is just not that big so it doesn't really matter and so like who's going to take care of all these old people who's got the money to take here we're all the nurses we're all you know we're sitting here on on zoom or was i forgot what the name of this app is we're all computer desk jockeys we don't we're not doctors we're not nurses we're not janitors we're not you know cleaning people's you know feces and urine as they die in a hospital bed that's what we need because we have the oldest the biggest generation and the wealthiest who are going to die in the next over the next you know 20 years and there's not enough stuff and people to support that happening in in a way that's going to be affordable and so that's the real problem and so as the workforce has aged the central bank has responded by printing money to keep the asset prices high everyone feels rich stock market's still you know doing well obviously it's down a bit still you know it's doing better than it should if you if you think about the fundamentals and i think that's that's a real issue and and i think i pointed aside in my article and very crude chart of of a very very long period of time it looks like the central banks are just printing money to cover the fact that the labor force is declining and they don't have any other way you just can't create people you can't create 18 you know 18 to 55 year old workers just because it's reelection time you need more people to pay taxes to support the old people it just doesn't work like that you know a baby takes nine months it takes 18 years and come 18 years old [Laughter] the math does check out on that one um i did it myself arthur like it feels like any place that we inject ourselves in this conversation is like we end up everything gets funneled down to like well some central bank is from printing money like what do we want to talk about we want to talk about war in russia well at some at the end of that we're printing money you want to talk about like our aging demographics well at the end of that we're printing money so like not only is like the same conclusion no matter like what part of this conversation we want to start always the same it also just feels like really messy and for like a whole entire like industry of crypto people i think a decent number of them were are these cohorts of people that were like you know what i don't want in my life politics and mess you know what i want something really simple and really objective something like code is law or something like this and so i'm wondering if like th this is a little bit of to like why you are somebody who's a trader but uh specifically a crypto trader like is it is this why crypto for you is like well every single point of like conflict in the real world ends up with a federal bank or a central bank printing money and it's also just like politically messy every step of the way uh and it seems to be like cryptos is this really elegant antagonist to both of that where we have these monetary policies that are codified by code and you know it's not messy it's actually quite interesting there is much less political surface area on all of these things and that makes this thing like a much more just intellectually curious of a industry to be in is this like the juxtaposition between these two industries is that is that why you're here i think it's it's just it's one of the first times well okay if we think about transitions in monetary technology if you want to call it that right double entry bookkeeping that was what i don't know 16th century italy somewhere around there medici's yeah yeah that's right something around there uh you have the printing press major technologies in advance printing money right paper money big thing you have the telegraph communications you know being able to communicate value across the world that's kind of like bitcoin do you have these big you know any other obviously the computer right and so you know we're moving forward in the way that my money is uh and technology interfaces and we don't consider these things technological advancements but they are and they were back in the day if you had a telegraph and the other bank didn't or the other trader didn't you were you had better information and you made better decisions and so i think crypto is part of politics it is monetary um if you try to deny that you think it's just okay i'm just gonna put some code on a piece of paper then you're kind of missing the point we're reorganizing how we interface with each other socially with this money thing and we have a new piece of technology the computer and the internet cryptography and we're expressing it in a different way and we're expressing it in then bitcoin ethereum and you know all this these other these new things that people's minds have been able to create because the physical constraint of okay i need to you know build this massive building i need to have a bunch of people with guns to guard this fictitious thing we call money because that's how we you know engender uh trade amongst each other well i can just code up some lines put things up on the internet and if enough people like what i would have done then i've just created value it's the first time in history that you know anyone who wants to learn a little bit of code can literally create their own currency never before in the world could you ever do that and so it's extremely powerful i think we're unleashing human creativity i'm like okay this is how we've done things you know for the last hundreds of thousands of years in terms of social finance there's another way to do it is it gonna be more successful not more successful i don't know it's up to the quality of the stuff um the people involved and how we react to different stimuli and so i think that's what's super supremely interesting and you want in my as a trader you want to be at the forefront of new technology because you want to have the better tools versus the other your competitors because that's how you become you know a better trader and you have better results yeah yeah so your answer really just boils down to just it's it's the new frontier of digital technology and financial technology and so you know the frontier means i could uh i get to front run the opportunity of course we say this line every single bankless podcast uh but i'm wondering if like this mess that we're getting into with this war in ukraine uh and like our conflict with china and just overall the politically chaotic state that we seem to find ourselves in do you think that that once we're done with all this whatever that means whatever whenever there's like a new normal on the other side of the ukraine war on the other side of just like the winter here when we do find ourselves in a new normal do you think that crypto as an industry will kind of be elevated in that in the sense that people will kind of see its merits for what it was like oh every single central bank's printing money like well like there's this bitcoin thing it's got the 21 million units and maybe it's not so crazy after all like how do you think the political landscape changes once we're through all of this mess in terms of crypto does crypto have like a main center stage role to play here or is it still just kind of like well it's like the frontier of technology and so it'll survive under its own merits like how do you think how do you think about this i think it's a very idiosyncratic personal thing right everyone around the world lives in a different system uh listen different country has different rules those countries are going to react in different ways to you know this new global conflict that's going on in this new world order that's being worked out and this whole messy process hopefully we're not all you know ashes and some nuclear conflagration that's that's what i hope and saying you know depending on how how a particular country handles it or what's the adversity that they're facing crypto may be something that's used or maybe not something that's used it may completely demonstrate its value or be completely useless like imagine if you're in a country that decided the best course of action would be to just shut off the internet and shut down the electricity grid you know we're just going back to burning wood go back in your hut right is crypto really going to be useful for you how are you going to charge your cell phone right so i it's i don't think you can make a blinking statement and saying like crypto is going to demonstrate its value it might demonstrate its value for a particular set of countries under a particular set of circumstances but it also might be completely useless depending on how things turn out but for you so for you as a trader if there's like what do you denominate your value in is it is it the dollar is it the yen is it the euro is it bitcoin is it eath is it something else um i you know i probably need to create a screen for this but it gets my thesis is it's oil at the end of the day everything i do is predicated on a you know oil let's call the hydrocarbons right my whole existence is predicated on the hydrocarbons sitting inside of an air-conditioned apartment hydrocarbons i'm talking to you on a computer powered by electricity hydrocarbons bitcoin is mined using you know electricity hydrocarbons i go to the supermarket to buy my food that's flown all around the world so that i can consume whatever veggie or piece of meat that i want to have hydrocarbons the fertilizer used to get the yields that we need you know ammonia you know potash all these different things hydrocarbons my car hydrocarbons so everything i want to go travel when i get on the plane jet fuel hydrocarbons right everything our whole life and so your ability to maintain a certain standard of living depending on your use of hydrocarbons is the gold standard it doesn't really matter if you have bitcoin dollars gold yen euros if i can't buy enough hydrocarbons to have the lifestyle that i want to live then i don't have the right mix of investment investible assets and that's all that matters to me and so your denominator is energy as in and we had this uh podcast with uh joel monegro from placeholder and it was he really defined capital in capital is this thing that can influence and change the state of the world but i think if you really just like boil down to it that's kind of what energy is and so your denominator is just like the things that can change the physical atoms of the world and that just gets really really meta really it's like the cost of moving atoms yeah yeah i mean the entire our entire human civilization is just we take the potential energy of the earth which took the potential energy of the sun and we converted into action and that action is our economy and through those actions we build things and so that's all we do and the money money the best forms of money is just a representation of pure energy because energy is not money because energy is useful we want to store energy destroying oil is hard why store natural gas is hard storing bitcoin is easy if i if i can't if i can't go in and you know in my basement and go store some oil that i need to use next year but i can store bitcoin because bitcoin is basically pure energy that's meant to solve math problems okay i'll i'll take the bitcoin or you know the the dollar is you know the us military's ability to go get oil from around the world and deliver it to holders of dollars so that they can buy things okay then maybe i'll hold some dollars i'm gonna hold some euros or maybe they'll hold the rule because the ruble has vast doors of energy and they're and they're willing to sell it to the world for the ruble so at the end of the day i just want to own claims on energy and i don't want those claims to depreciate over time i don't want there to be a billion dollars for a billion barrels of oil and then 10 years from now it's 10 trillion dollars for the same billion barrels of oil right unless my wealth has gone up by that much then i've actually lost energy purchasing power and that's how i like to think about things so you want your store value to be the thing that preserves um the value relative to hydrocarbons basically and that could be a portfolio of assets but it's not necessarily just bitcoin and eth uh you know it could be a whole portfolio of things correct interesting that's the first time i've ever had that perspective is that a sudden arthur hayes original or is that borrowed from uh somebody i think it's just reading about different things and like trying to like go into the real like what is this this piece of paper or this you know big credit that i have what does it actually represent well it allows me to go and request something of value from somebody else and they're going to give me their time they're going to give me something that they own and they're going to take this piece of paper that's fictitious or they're going to take this bitcoin that's made up or they're going to take this shiny rock and they're going to give me something of value then give me their time they're going to give me essentially their energy output that's what money is and because i can't store oil as an individual or even if you know it's very hard to do at a major scale as well that's why we have money because money makes things easier because we all had to like carry around a little barrel of oil like hey hey guys you want to give me an hour work here's a little barrel of oil okay cool i mean what's so interesting to me about all those different like things that you select for your your store of value relative to like um you know it's its ability to retain value against hydrocarbons is it really depends like on kind of the settlement guarantees of various things based on how the world pans out like if we go full dystopia like post some world war three event right like ain't none of those things gonna matter because we might not even have electricity we might be back to like fire you know what i mean and like we're way back in time and like but if maybe uh uh an individual uh country breaks down their global banking system uh breaks down then maybe ious that you held in that fiat currency or in that you know kind of that that um the banks in that country then those are no longer good so it it feels like you have to keep on shifting your portfolio relative to events that are happening around the world and to plan for different possible scenarios from like bad cases all the way to kind of like best cases where uh there's no new world order and the the the world continues to function as normal absolutely anyone who says that they have the solution and never changes is selling you dog [ __ ]

started now i can't help to uh put on my eath cap and notice that like eth we call this gas and actually when you make a transaction on ethereum somebody's cpu actually heats up and expends energy to run that computation in arthur you're all of your uh not all of your articles but all of your crypto focus articles lately have all been focused on eth so can you give us after we've gone through like macro and and what you denominated in can you give us like why are you so focused hyper focused on ether right now so i think you know i i obviously made this call about the fed pivoting and maybe it happens maybe it doesn't um and i've got a recent essay that i posted i've cobbled together this liquidity index and shown how it's very well fit in terms of um bitcoin goes how the dollar liquidity goes and you know it's very very difficult to forecast the politics behind what the central bank is going to do in a short period of time like over the next you know year i mean i have a very strong view about what they're going to do over the next five to 10 years inflation inflation inflation you know default by any other mean called the fault but that doesn't help you today however this thing is interesting we have the number two currency that's going from proof of work to proof of stake now whether or not that's a good thing it's irrelevant we but the structural fact is there's less issuance of it and it's the only currency that's of this size that's doing this switch so it's not like we care about what solana is doing or cardano is doing or near any of these other you know l1 competitors it doesn't matter this isn't about whether or not each process is more tps than the other competitor it's here's a admission schedule and inflation schedule and the value we know what it's going to be afterwards you know it's almost impossible for you to pre-trade this situation the flows are just going to be the flows similar to the bitcoin having we know how bitcoin havings have panned out over time so i love this trade because i can be wrong on the fed and still make money in my opinion on ethereum because the structural flows are dramatically changing in such a way that it gives i think the price enough upside to overcome possibly a negative macro environment and that's the only trade that i see right now with that sort of setup and it's a one-time thing and you know assuming that it actually happens and whether it's september 13th or 15th whenever the date is and it's successful then the flows start and we see you know are we going to be in over the next few months okay issuance red reduces let's see the impact on the price there is an economy you can say that the you know transactions are have gone down a lot since you know the boom and d5 from you know last last um summer or last fall whatever but the it still has the most tvl it still has the most activity there are still people using these applications they're going to be using these applications today we're going to be using these applications in october after the merge and so we can sort of come to an agree an idea of like what that's going to look like and this is the only you know we have some stakes in the ground of things that aren't a political decision by a bunch of people that we have no influence over that's why i love this trade because i can be wrong and everything else and still be right so you love this trade because you can be wrong on the fed you can be wrong on ethereum even winning like another competitor could blow past it in the future you could be wrong on just about every other point in like the thesis but it doesn't matter because this is a structural change it's a one-time event and the flows are fundamentally fundamentally changing and that's kind of like guaranteed as long as the merge is successful and so this trade is like a no-brainer in your mind yes okay well so if it's a no-brainer why is it priced in or is it priced in already i don't think people believe the merge is going to happen still and i also like really absolutely i don't even i mean i can't sit here and tell you that i think for you know 100 that okay they're going to switch you know switch the proof of stake and think they're going to blow up i don't know what do i know it's a trader i i'm not in the trenches like you know been developers since 2014 and built this thing right and if you've been around long enough you've heard the talk talk about proof of stake i don't know five six years five seven year whatever however long he's been talking about it six months has it happened yet no right and so your your default response is okay show me show me proof of stake show me that it works show me that all the different applications function just as they did before show me that there's not going to be some bug that you didn't think of it's an edge case that's going to blow up in your face and you're going to require a heart for it to go right back to proof of work show me you can't there's no there's nothing that's going to prove to me that's going to happen until it actually happens and so i think that and i think a lot of people are of that opinion and i think that's the rational way to to believe that especially as someone who was a former tech ceo nothing's ever shipped on time nothing ever works as it's supposed to and i know that 100 certainty the uh i recently wrote an article uh rebutting a bear case for the merge where emerge was over hyped uh argument and one thing i've been thinking about is like how how much does this like the state of the etherium merge actually permeate to the rest of the crypto markets now me and ryan like some of our friends are working on client teams uh for the ethereum emerge so we're very tapped in right this is the thing that we almost like know the most about and uh me me ryan anthony cesano a few other of the ethereum like uh second layer around the core devs are all pricing in like a 95 chance that the merge goes perfectly fine um and then as and i've realized as you get further away from these people like the the odds of the merge going well in their opinion goes down and down and down but i can't really find like a cohort of the crypto industry that is waiting with like cash on hand and saying as soon as the merge goes through and it's successful i'll buy like either you're a bitcoiner you don't need wait they don't need that if there is so much usage if there's 100 units of uses today that needs to pay gas right and now they're not selling as much of the thing of the gas token but there's still 100 units of demand to use the apps it doesn't you don't need any new buyers you just need okay so the whole like the whole idea of like a sell the news event is like traders going to trade people to speculate around the merger you're saying that that's just like irrelevant because of the actual fundamentals of the mercy yeah okay sure there could be you have to sell the news and maybe the price goes on 20 okay but unless you're telling me that the number one repository of d5 applications is going to stop and even from today's levels which are depressed it's going to go down 95 or 90 95 percent then what you're telling me is there's a certain demand to pay gas the supply goes from 100 to 10 99 something where's the 90 down whatever that the amount is right here ago demand is greater than supply the price has to rise that's unless you're telling me that d5 usage and dap usage go falls off a cliff with the issuance amount as well if you're not saying that then you're saying that the price the demand is at the margin is greater than the supply therefore the price has to rise uh in my opinion so arthur if the merge isn't priced in then like what it what should the price of eighth be like what's what's like what's your target price for eth right like a range is like i've i've bought calls um and i think i've said this in my my uh essays like 3 000 straight calls um i think that's i think that's the largest strike in terms of open interest on dare but right now so i'd say i think that's if you if you want to talk about where the market's really expecting everybody's trading that strike no that's that's called three thousand by the end of the year wow and that's that's almost like in your mind that's almost regardless of what happens to the fed what happens in you know kind of crypto markets what happens of course the fed can influence influence that lower but i i for each to stand still the you know well maybe the fred's gonna raise rates to 20 overnight i don't think that's going to happen um but at the end of the if there's a certain amount of demand and the supply isn't there to meet it the price goes up and it doesn't matter if the cost of dollars is four percent or two or 25 percent that's and that's why i like the trade because there's nothing to do about the liquidity constraint of the dollar which a lot of crypto is a liquidity play on on the global reserve currency because that's the system that we're rebelling against we're saying this is a bad way to do things we have a better way of doing things but everybody's assets are in dollars so if the cost of dollars goes up then it you know kind of makes it more difficult to put into this new thing this isn't about liquidity you bet you've been crypto for like 10 years now right so um you've seen a few happenings you've seen more than your fair share of like different trade type opportunities um is this kind of different like what's different about this what's the magnitude of this i mean i think you've called this like uh uh i don't not a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity but like kind of akin to that i'm paraphrasing your language here but like it's i think this is the only what maybe you guys are probably deeper deeper into this than i am like tell me another coin that's moved from proof of work to proof of stake especially one that has existed what's it called like 200 billion dollars of market cap or whatever it is right right so that is it's a one-of-one sample size all right yeah that's my big argument as to like why there if you can't really like trader's gonna trade but you can't like price this thing in ahead of time it's never been done before and it's so like systemically about the value of the asset about like reducing this issuance of ether that like people that think that traders are going to trade this and sell the news event like it's just too big it's too big for that especially in a bear market you'd have to forecast you'd have to be able to forecast the amount of transactions on the network to a very very specific degree and then you have to pre-trade that right you have to trade those flows and be able to trade them post pre-op post emerge that's if you'd be trading and that's a very hard thing to handicap right what's interesting is this entire argument is like all based around flows it's not based around narrative but do you think there's a narrative element so like finally after five years proof of stake finally ships and the merge goes well they actually did actually yeah and you rather on reflexivity does that you know come into play here i think the reflexivity is more on the on the the price to flows to developer activity to users using the app that's you know but obviously there's gonna be a proud of narrative like okay they pulled this very very difficult technical thing off um i think we'd be in a much different sort of narrative construction if it if this merge event didn't follow on the heels of the entire credit part of the crypto ecosystem blowing up right so imagine imagine the bullishness of just the average trader if they hadn't just lost all their money to cara and three arrows and it's not just the retail punter it's you know the biggest hedge funds the biggest lending nest they all got they'll get smoked right and so yeah are you really going to be like oh yeah i need to go like cap in hand in my investors and raise a bunch for our money when i guess proof they have no risk management policies and go buy this ether thing when they when the dude's been talking about proof of stake for the last six years or hasn't done it please give me some more money investors i'm like get the [ __ ] out of here wow yeah so you're just saying like the appetite for the merge like even for like the newer people that got into this base and bought the top of the nft market in 2021 they just don't want to hear it like oh do you guys the merge is so bullish you got to buy ether and all these people are like yeah they're like i don't know just like he told me like it's tech it's hard everyone knows tech is hard tech ship's late they have this date does anyone really believe what's gonna happen i know you guys are close to it but even me right i've been writing about this but i can't go out there and def definitively say yes september 13th or whatever the date is that's the date i have all this cop i have no confidence i have no idea i think it'll be around that time but again i'm not a very technical person and i've been around this and i'm too jaded how uh what are the mechanics behind trading this i think one of your posts uh went through a few different approaches like obviously you could go spot um you like and purchase just go long eath um you mentioned you know some derivatives plays maybe there's some option plays here uh what are you seeing yeah i mean it's really you have to as soon as you move away from spot and you start adding leverage and optionality possibility of liquidation financing because everything trades at a premium discount to the underlying value you add a concept of timing and so you need to be you have to have a view on the timing and have a very good confidence in the timing so unless you have a very good view on the timing and have confidence in the timing whether that's the 13th of september or it's going to get delayed if you have in october or whatever it is right you're going to pay for that timing more time more time buffer you want to have the more money you're going to pay um the more exact you want to get about the timing the less you pay and the more upside you have and so it's a dial and it really depends on your confidence in the team's ability you know assuming that it happens when does it happen right okay and then how long is the positive reflexive loop are you giving yourself enough time for that really to kick in or are you saying because it happened then traders are going to front run the reflexivity and push the price up well before the flows come in so you have to make all these all these decisions but it's not that straightforward so the easiest is obviously spot but then again you don't get you're not gonna have leverage and you're not gonna get the big the big juice but if you're willing to take those bets then you have the really good um timing to it yeah you've touched on a debate that we've had on the show before it's like how long does this thing actually take to price in and some people are in the months not years camp as in like one two three months after the merge you actually start to see those structural flows that favor ether actually show up in the price and others are like it's gonna take years for this really to like first the miners still have all their supply that they need to sell uh and you know there's just a bunch of noise that the structural flows has to cut through do you have a take on on the timing of like how long it takes for the improvement of the economics of ether to take to actually show up in the price not really i haven't really done enough work on it i mean i think you have to have a very apart from the miners now they're going to dump their ether or not it's okay you have to forecast the level of usage of the network i have a very good uh very good idea of what that's going to be because that's going to say okay how much how much what's the gas fees are going to be that are going to be not offset by inflation therefore the price goes up that's your that's what you're trading what if i told you that the current gas prices which like it's been averaging 10 to 12 for the last like month or so was like the bottom of gas prices would that that would make you more bullish or is that kind of like what you've already priced in i mean that will make me more bullish but again there's so many conflicting factors my my reason why i chose a december strike you know it's obviously liquid so that that's end of year being you know fourth quarter people usually things either go up up a lot or down a lot in the fourth quarter just human nature right and cycles and then at the end of the day they will have proven that they could get a very difficult technical thing done and that speaks volumes to the quality of the team it doesn't matter what that technical thing is the fact that they were able to do it is very bullish and that this is a narrative construction in the fame and so you know just you know finger in the air took the number out of my ass and you know just you know go for it that's my favorite kind of analysis uh all right one last question on this train uh earlier you said uh it's your favorite trade just because you'll make money in your opinion uh regardless of what macro does like even if macro shits the bed like the merge is still bullish enough to get you in the green why why do you think that the merge is more powerful than macro or or is that what you're saying no i am saying the merge is more powerful than macro if you're reducing this inflation's applied by ninety percent of the supply that's being emitted by 90 you guys correct me that number is right or wrong it's about right yeah then are you and the price of ethan's already down ninety percent whatever it is from five thousand ish to 800. we had the macro crash we had we had the we had credit collapse because we increase dollar liquidity this is just classic you know emerging market i could this could be 1998 in asia this could be russia this could be you know ldc crisis this could be tequila crisis this could be pick your crisis over the last two or three hundred years of finance where you had too much money chasing too few good opportunities from a credit perspective crypto is 100 rhymes with that ethos we had the flush of all the leverage from the system in my in my view so we've we've taken we've done the hard thing in the macro so okay maybe the price could go down another 50 to 800 or whatever to the lows that we had during the the credit collapse if you know powell gets his new epiphany because he's gonna go take rates immediately above inflation that's not what he said he said i'm you know we're gonna continue with the pace that we're rolling which is you know maybe it's 75 basis points in september maybe on the 15th of november another 15 december that's still not nine percent volcker took rates up to 22 he said he doesn't want to be arthur burns fed chair during this before the 70s arthur burns took short-term rates in the u.s above inflation he's no third he's neither arthur burns nor are you paul voker he's jerome powell at the rate he's at which is below inflation and he's not telling the markets that he's going immediately to you know eight and a half on the short term rate just like that so i think yes the pessimism is warranted but i do think that reducing the supply of ether emitted to the market by 90 on a discrete date while still having the demand to use a network even at these depressed levels exceed that to me outweighs the the macro impact especially since i believe that a lot of the pain has already been taken on the macro side two things that are really uh kind of interesting about this bull case for the eth merge that we've just said like you know that you've just given one is that we just gave the bulk case for ethan we haven't mentioned d5 nfts like as a as a positive catalyst once and i'm curious your thoughts on those like those sectors define nfts uh and secondly i'm curious about this uh kind of this um you know transformation maybe like a conversion process uh for you personally on eth the asset because i remember back in uh 20 2018 was it these were dark times in the crypto market one of many dark times that we've all been through together in crypto but um double digit [ __ ] coin was i don't know if that was a post title arthur but you definitely got credit for calling for calling to double digits at a time when like that was inconceivable i think for eth bulls that we would drop down to double ditches and sure enough we did also extremely yeah it was painful for my bags arthur uh and yet that's exactly what happened and this was you know happened in march of uh 2020 during kind of the covet drop we went down below 80 on some charts definitely into the double digits for ether but from double digit [ __ ] coin to now arthur is five ducking digits bullish on ether the asset so tell me about that but the transformation for you arthur hayes becoming bull and then also tell me about d5 nfts is this does this feed into your things i mean when i made that call on an ether it was already going down it peaked at what 1400 and it was it was on its way down to you know its first real cycle right going down 95 or whatever similar to bitcoin uh and there wasn't defy in the way in which we know it today right there wasn't a unit swap dominant there wasn't ave there wasn't compound there wasn't a whole ecosystem of people building these new financial primitives to disintermediate the cartel of trust would like to call it of the traditional financial ecosystem that wasn't around in 2018 we had the promise of maybe something something like that someday somewhere right and we just had this e thing and people were like yeah smart contracts and we had the ico fallout um and you know no more chinese market to sell these things into so yeah it was a completely different environment to to make that call versus you know when i went along um ethan you know right after uh the crash in march which was i forgot who has sent the chart around and it had the market cap on eth was less than all of the applications that it supported so either you believe that ethan's complete dog [ __ ] and has zero value and therefore these apps are going to go out and go like that you know even when they're already down 99 most of them from you know a lot of them when they issued in 2017 or hey this e thing is really really undervalued based on what it can do so i took the undervalued you know side of things and did very well on on that call and i think subsequent to that we had the d5 summer explosion you know tvl went up to about 200 billion at its peak now it's about like 80 or 90 or 60 or whatever it is doesn't really matter but it's well way higher than it was in 2018 which was basically zero so i think we're in a completely different environment and again this is not a the the trade underneath that i'm bullish about has nothing to do about the stuff on top of it unless you're telling unless you're going to tell me all the stuff on top of it's going to stop working today no one's no one else is going to use it then okay i'll i'll admit then who cares about the merge there's no one to spend money on gas arthur we were just talking earlier about um kind of retail getting absolutely massacred over the last few months uh certainly retail and institutionalization let's say that like these people know anything bit more than the dude sitting in the basement dude a woman sitting in their basement they know absolutely the same you believe that's true that that there's no such thing as smart money at least it smart money doesn't wear a tie maybe we'll say that i mean there there are smart money managers and there's probably only a handful of them right you know the the soros is the druckenmillers the paul tierra jones these types you know they're you know geniuses and what they do you know very methodical but most everyone else is a muppet who manages money they sit there you know they went to the right school they wear the right clothes they talk the right way and they get allocated money and that's the game and it's perfectly fine nothing wrong with that um but to call them money managers and stewards of capital is doing that sort of concept of disservice in my opinion and so a lot of people who got massacred didn't think what they think through what they were training to make the same mistake that everyone else made and then i'll use tara as an example everyone's like [ __ ] on do quan for you know being this evil person possibly as an outsider looking in i don't know anything about the guy i never only met at once um and as an outside observer how tara was written about in the white paper they told you exactly what's going to happen in this scenario the death spiral it's there it's the math is there no lie people didn't read the white paper and then they're surprised they lost all their money and that's the retail person and that's the institutional money manager went out there until people can give them a 20 yield with infinite sharp ratio because there's no drawdowns ever right it's the same trade and so again i i don't and then crypto at least i don't really see much of a difference in in terms of institutional yes there's some very talented traders very few of them um who can make money in all different circumstances and have very good risk management um but again i i don't see i wouldn't uh denigrate retail as saying that they don't know anything and there's all these smart people who are institutional who manage money who's you know better i guess that's a fallacy i gotta say what's interesting is like probably six months ago if someone were to publish a list of the top 10 well-known crypto traders right um i know i don't know entirely who would be on that list uh i do know that your name would probably appear on that list um but i also think at the time three hours capital would definitely appear appear on that list suzu and and kyle is probably as number one you're still here many of them are not here how how do you last throughout multiple cycles as somebody playing the crypto trading game like for me it's like i i don't dabble much in crypto trading so i'm kind of buy and hold right like invest in things go long that sort of thing very low margin if any margin uh so i've got that survivability it's not that hard as long as i'm willing to like not sell which does require some amount of skill but as a trader you can get completely like wiped out on some of these cycles yeah the other day it's all about position sizing i mean again i don't know anything more than what's been published in the press about through arrows but to me they're they made the wrong trade they didn't size their positions correctly you know i've been wrong on a lot of things i don't have to be right but as long as i write on a few things but my positions my sizing is is the way it needs to be on things that i've done right on then net out net net i'll i'll be okay um and so again it's all down to position sizing and i don't really manage other people's money and i'm not trying to be a hedge fund and you know trying to make a business out of this and all that sort of stuff so um i wouldn't say if it's apples or apples apples in that in that respect arthur as we uh look beyond the merge and uh this trade kind of plays out right ether goes up we're all super happy we have more money than we did before hooray uh what's next after the merge or do you actually plan on keeping ether as like your store of value at least for for the foreseeable future i guess we'll see we'll see how how that pans out right because let's say if the zooms ahead right again nothing goes up or down in a straight line and so at the end of the day do you harvest some of those profits back into bitcoin which is again my true money in the crypto since ether is a commodity it's not money in my opinion that's in my tax on technology bitcoin is money the only money in crypto and so do i harvest profits if they exist back into bitcoin and wait for whatever the next new thing is um because at some point the the the trend or the pricing ether will be over will overshoot the intrinsic value whatever that intrinsic value is or how you define it and at that point then it's time to move on to you go back to your monetary base asset and you look at the landscape and you make a decision and where to go next arthur bankless listeners will know that i'm like pretty bad at math so i'm hoping you can help me with this one can you remind me what one d equals 1b [Laughter] this is some kind of energy nft insider game i think you guys are just playing right there uh arthur it's
