foreign [Music] back to the Devcon 6 experience I hope you've been enjoying these interviews thus far I Hope they've been making you feel like you're on the ground at Devcon uh it was a treat in this interview we're talking with bartek bartek is the leader the founder co-founder of layer 2 beat he's previously maker Dao and he is at the middle of the lair two Wars uh layer 2B is this place where all of these layer twos are like indexed and documented about what holes they have what they need to work on and it's been like the sparring ground for all of these layer twos so I get bartex perspective as what it's like to be in the middle of the layer two Wars and how he thinks the layer two Wars are progressing from here and overall are we as an ethereum ecosystem uh ethereum community members not critical enough about our own layer twos are we Hypocrites for for critiquing cross layer one Bridges other alt layer ones while also not looking at our own layer twos and seeing the holes and flaws in them as well I asked them that question and more all about the layer 2 Wars the very very very spicy player two Wars so I hope you enjoyed this conversation with bartek from layer 2B right after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or fished and I owe a large part of that credit to my ledger Hardware wallet or really my ledgers like all of them all five of them because ledgers hold like 99 of my crypto assets and it makes me feel good about self-custody private Key Management you know what else makes me feel good using the brave browser the user first browser for the web3h the brave browser keeps your digital footprint small keeping you in the driver's seat while also being a powerful battle station for web 3 letting you access your crypto through its native wallet or view your nfts or just keep up to date with the web 3 communities and of course you've heard of arbitrum and the arbitrum ecosystem is really heating up with their recent launch of arbitrum Nova arbitrum has entered the world of multi-chain layer twos and with her recent acquisition of Prismatic Labs arbitrum Firepower is bigger than ever arbitrim Nitro shipped last month it has made Arbitron faster and cheaper than ever so make sure that you experience what arbitrum has to offer before it's too late but maybe you're a developer who who hates the constraints of the evm so check out the fuel VM from the fuel Network which has opened up the world of parallel transaction execution breaking the fuel Network free from the evm baggage with fuel you can leverage the rust tooling ecosystem to build stronger apps all while keeping ethereum level security and maybe you're on arbitrum but you want to get to fuel you might use something like across the layer 2 Bridge from Uma a cross is a safe and secure Bridge making it easier to transfer your assets from one layer two to another or back to ethereum it's super fast super cheap and all secured by uma's optimistic Oracle and our last sponsor nexo which has like five different products and you're probably going to be interested in at least one of them first you can buy crypto instantly with credit debit or bank transfer it's also got an advanced trading platform called nexo Pro you can also earn interest on your crypto your Bitcoin your ether or whatever asset you like it's also got an instant crypto line of credit with as low as zero percent APR and a crypto backed MasterCard one of those things is probably what you want so go check out nexo the financial hub for the digital age and let's go ahead and get right into the interview right thanks this nation I'm here with bartek founder of layer 2B and also a contributor at maker Dao and bartek has found himself I think at the center of these layer 2 Wars I wish there have been a ton of announcements uh here at Devcon Bogota bartek thank you for so much for coming on and joining me here it's my pleasure how have you ever been drawing Colombia um well so far so good yeah um yeah I I like the country and it's the first time that I'm in Colombia like probably most people at Defcon and Defcon is always a great opportunity to see uh other places and cultures and I really appreciate you know the uh the approach of the human Foundation uh where I feel like we're trying to include everybody right it's not like just Europe and us and Europe and U.S like most southern conferences but we actually have been to Japan you know we are here now I'm truly wondering you know what's next well certainly what's next with uh there's so many things that snacks in ethereum and Layer Two is definitely is one of those things uh you're like I said you are the co-founder of layer 2B which is this website that we go to to look at how many holes there are in the layer 2 ecosystem and uh vitalik uh recently at the roll-up day on Monday uh was giving a presentation as to all these different ways that we need to fix layer twos um how do you think that progress is going and are there any announcements and announcements that you've seen here at Defcon Bogota that is working in that direction so um well frankly uh for so many people that I talked to that you know I don't like attend a lot of sessions I haven't seen a lot of announcements uh having said that I think that most teams they have presented uh roadmaps which are fully decentralized you know they promise all of us to shut the training wheels um and and I think if we were to listen uh to a list on l2p it's just pure Roll-Ups we probably wouldn't list literally anyone right and it would be a very boring website so um right now you know as it stands every single project is very much centralized and is very much controlled by by the team that actually created uh the Roll-Ups but to my knowledge with almost no exception each one of them has a roadmap like a decentralized uh decentralization roadmap and and I think right now you know we're trying to uh to kind of track the progress if you like right and made them transparent and made them honest and I think we're we're getting there for sure and one of the critiques that we've seen outside of the ethereum space and sometimes also inside of the ethereum space is that we're promoting these layer twos as if they're the magical secure solution to scale a chain uh but then we're also kind of hiding and pushing under the rug the fact that these have multi-sig Bridge contracts and we're missing fraud proofs do you think that the ethereum community or the ethereum promoters maybe me and Ryan are guilty of this are are like hypocritical of of the way that we kind of pitch layer twos or do you think there's a more Nuance here oh well this is a very loaded question here so um I'd say that you know every single team they've got their own agenda and some of them are more let's say transparent than the others some of them are hiding behind the marketing and whatnot everyone it seems to be extremely Keen at building the community and so well we cannot hide the fact that it is a race right I wouldn't call it the war and we don't know exactly how the future of Layer Two like a system on ethereum will uh look like are we going to see many different grow up so maybe one will take take it all so that's still an open question in my mind but if one team sees the other team like launching something which may have a lot of training wheels you know they might actually be pressed to do the same and the general Community I think they don't see all these nuances because they may not be published widely right sometimes we're not publish at all and this is why you know we essentially created this website so that we disclose some of these things and we uh we just want uh to make all these teams honest and we want to make sure that the users actually understand all the security assumptions behind all these systems you've talked about the roadmap that many of these layer two teams have presented to solve and fix some of these holes how credible are these are these road maps are they legit road maps There's real Tech here or is it more just hand waving so that would probably differ every single team has a little bit different approach um so if we look at the optimistic rollups for example uh we see two major teams putting a lot of work into actually making sure that all these fraud proof technology is working and evm equivalent systems will eventually be deployed so I'm talking about the arbitrary and optimism and we've got some other teams that are forking mainly Optimus code and they're kind of way waiting for optimism to deliver the fraudible system so we can see that you know some teams are innovating and some teams are trying to to sort of you know Fork the code and maybe try to innovate on the edges um I'm mainly thinking about the Boba and Mattis uh so that's optimistic for the ZK um most of the teams are innovating like crazy I mean this is like amazing really to see the progress uh I think we've all been surprised about all these teams and uh and well Stark net zika think Aztec right scroll I mean it's just just unbelievable polygon as well um everyone is like pushing code really hard and every single conference that I go to versus like new announcements right right and from either one of them so um my understanding is that the ZK sync will launch very soon uh starknet is uh just upgrading to uh version one uh of Cairo which is like the major major upgrade uh the first version was very much centralized and wasn't particularly censorship resistant um we've pushed them really really hard you know to work on this problem and I believe that you know they listen to the community uh and the new version which is like way more complicated uh will actually allow people to uh to to force transactions you know to their system right so they cannot be censored I remember when I was reporting on HCC back in April of earlier this year whenever that was I can't remember how many months ago yeah maybe June something yeah whatever July actually I think it was July I would keep moving you know right right it was July the people are joking at the theme of the ECC was uh the zkevm because so many people announced their ZK evm so it was a test net or launch date or something that also seems to be the theme of the rollout this week as well here at devcom Bogota where polygon released their zke evm testnet scroll release their ZK evm testnet CK Sync release their layer 3 test net and they have their main net in just like 10 20 days here uh and uh also something that vitalik said in his presentation at roll up day was the ZK teams seem to be like the one part of like crypto building that has been massively accelerated Beyond expectations uh going you know ethereum the merge was slow uh sharding has been slow but the zke EVMS are here uh when all of these main Nets do come like how how big of it first off how big of a deal is that and like are they going to come and is it is it going to be as big of a thing that people are excited for or is it still going to be like okay mainnet but users are going to have to wait another like I don't know six months to be able to do something like overall what's your take on the trajectory of the ZK ecosystem [Music] um well I'm right now um we have to be able to sort of differentiate between systems that are CK equivalent and let's say ZK or evm equivalent or and evm compatible so uh zika sync uh is a good example of you know ZK rollup that is compatible with vvm but this is not like equivalent system right and I think we're gonna see a very interesting competition uh between systems that try to emulate CBM as close as possible and systems that will prefer to uh to make sure that the proving is like optimized for the particular VM right and in this category I would put definitely think and start that so the competition between these two approaches uh would be very interesting to watch um having said that I think ant uses probably for them you know it wouldn't really matter it might make a small difference for developers but my thinking about this is that it doesn't matter so much you know how friendly this is for developers um I mean it's important that you know it's easy to Port your code it might be important to make sure that the your card is secure but for end users it's much more important that the system is fast it's cheap right it's got the big ecosystem uh there's a good wallet support and I think from to that end you know the account abstraction is like super important and they won't see much of a difference frankly right even today when you're using you know starknet or optimism or arbitrum I mean you won't notice much of a difference so we like debating the the the details that most end users won't even notice right and you know it will come to uh to the edges I think uh if something goes really wrong like if one of these systems will start to censor then end users will learn that there is a difference right and then they will see that there are some systems that you know have working Escape hatches right uh whilst some other systems don't have that facility and suddenly your funds are stuck right uh because the uh you know roll-up operators decided to be I don't know off like compliant or whatever right pressed pressed by the regulator so um so you know like for the daily usage uh I don't think the users will actually notice much but I think it's our responsibility to educate them uh what are those security assumptions right do you have your own personal opinion on the debate between ZK uh or evm equivalence versus evm compatibility or are you saying both sides have strong arguments let's let the best roll up win uh I think both sides presented very strong arguments you know I uh had the pleasure of moderator panel or on the roll-up day on that very topic you know and and I can see passionate you know statements from both sides so it will be extremely interesting to watch uh and long term um maybe going the qm equivalent you know makes sense but you know short term uh I think of our certain advantages right now to have a VM that's like ZK friendly because it will allow you to do things faster and cheaper and and time to Market is likely to be uh to be quicker right one of the things that has been living rent free in my brain my brain and the thing I've been trying to learn about the most here at Dev Devcon Devcon that one not Dev connect uh is optimism's bedrock uh and it's it's it's interesting to see the modularity of ethereum uh find its way also into the layer two so that's really what optimism Bedrock is is a modular Layer Two so in the same way that we have a modular layer one ethereum my mind here is that like what optimism's Bedrock is doing in the op stack is that they're reducing the barrier to forking and producing a new Layer Two And as somebody who has to manage a website that is a a registry of all the properties of all these layer twos I'm slightly worried for you bartek because what happens if you see a Cambrian explosion of optimistic Roll-Ups uh layer threes do you see the same future as well or how do you think about managing all these proliferation of layer twos I mean most definitely and even right now the website is hardly manageable and I'm sure that there are certain inner currencies and mistakes and um in future months you know the most of the engineering efforts will go into automation I mean at the end of the day everything ends up on the chain and so we uh with our monitoring infrastructure uh once you know it will be developed we will actually get all the information automatically from chain right there must be some registry of all these Roll-Ups there will be a way to to sort of read their configuration directly from blockchain so hopefully if they follow the same cookie cutter approach and like fog and create their own rope it will be just a matter of you know having our Bots to read the data and fill in the website and then it will be uh a question of how to actually present it to user in a manageable way right which is I guess you know a question for the UI designers so so I'd say that today it used to be 80 of the effort for the research and 20 of the effort for you know like presenting all the information but now it's going to be reverse almost right the automation infrastructure behind L2 beats is going to be actually quite complex and tracking all the changes uh will be possible because you know finally we've got some uh fantastic tooling like the token flow Insight this is the uh the analytical database that tracks every single state on ethereum in all ethereum history right so we can just watch particular slots and it will inform us you know what exactly happened and when it happened and it will trigger um warnings essentially right so that's how I kind of think about it I mean it has to be managed by essentially automation sure and of course Layer Two is under the hood are extremely complicated I don't even know how to code so when something goes down I wouldn't know what to do and so bartek what you're doing at layer 2B in my mind is just producing user sovereignty and tools that the individuals can use uh that are non-technical and very very helpful so thank you for everything you're doing at layer 2B and I hope you have a fantastic rest of your Defcon okay thank you very much cheers bam [Music]
