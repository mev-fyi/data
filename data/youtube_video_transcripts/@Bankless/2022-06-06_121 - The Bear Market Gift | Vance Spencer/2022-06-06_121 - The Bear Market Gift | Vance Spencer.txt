really all of the best ideas really happen in the bear and so for me you know i'm as positive as ever um i have a very long-term perspective and i understand that this is where you know the progress is made and we're just excited to be here welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams and i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys this is a gift of an episode today with vance spencer because what if i told you you've just been handed a tremendous gift maybe the biggest gift the biggest opportunity of your life what is it it's the crypto bear market of 2022. it's the bear market that we're in we talk about how to maximize that opportunity crypto in the bear market how should we think about it that's the number one thing to take away from this episode number two we go through which alternative layer ones will survive and which layer twos will thrive and explode coming out of the spare market we actually go through them one by one solana avalanche polygon optimism arbitrim all of them we get lance's takes number three how to find the hidden gem in the bear market vance is an expert at this in fact number four he actually thinks game fi is the biggest opportunity of the bear market he explains why and then of course number five we talk about the bull case for eth and david this was a finding for me apparently vance is now a member certified member of the ethos money cult and he wasn't i think the last time we talked to him so we talked about that change what were your thoughts in this episode david yeah we first brought vance on the podcast very very early episode like in the 20s i think uh and it was because of frameworks just outside success coming out of the 2018 to 2020 bear making bets on things that everyone thought was never going to come back tokens uh back in 2018 to 2020 everyone got burned by tokens and so no one wanted to touch tokens except for framework and they made high conviction bets on things that uh just did outside huge outsized gains going into the next bull run things like link ave and synthetics and so he has been through the ringer and of what it means to be an investor in a bull market an investor in a in a bear market and also a public versus private investor as well and overall vance has just such a strong finger on the pulse of everything about this industry and so that's why this conversation touches on almost everything that is relevant these days in the world of crypto of course defy ether alt layer ones layer twos game phi uh and probably public and private markets a little bit of everything so it felt like a candy conversation all the way through and through and vance is just someone that uh no matter what phase of the market we're in he's always he always is a very sober he always can see things very clearly uh and just such a treat talking to vance every single time yeah this is like uh the bible for the bear market it's the it's the hitchhiker's guide for for the bear market because we covered just about everything you need to know about how to position yourself uh during times like this because we've certainly been there before guys we're going to get right to the episode with vance but first we want to talk about these awesome tools to help you go bankless from these sponsors rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only syncing provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 heat to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish each staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of the cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitrary or boba networks arbitrary is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrary and d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrary as their home all the while d fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrary through all the exchanges including binance ftx hobie and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum dot io developer to start building your dap on arbitrary if you're a d-gen many of your favorite dapps on ethereum are already on arbitrary with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrom.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free bankless nation super excited to introduce you to our next guest actually he's been on the show before so he probably needs no introduction to the long time bankless listener this is vance spencer he's the co-founder of framework ventures vance and framework both of them rose to fame out of the 2018 bear market how making high conviction bets in d5 at a time when no one else was everyone else was afraid everyone else was fleeing the market doing all of this before defy was even a thing in fact i don't even think we were calling it d5 back then uh so he's been on bank list twice before updating us in the state of d5 bullish catalysts is the things that are going on behind the scenes we wanted to bring him back because we are in another bee market all right it is bear market territory and so at some level having you on the show vance it feels like we're back home in the bear market how are things going things are going great thanks for having me back it certainly feels like we're we're in familiar territory once again but um it feels like we kind of have have them right where we want them in terms of you know we're making progress and things are a little bit more calm um and it feels like you know fundamentally the space is progressing faster than ever even though the prices are down well let's let's talk about this so we want to talk about i think the theme this episode is crypto in the bear market right and so what how does it change what does it look like in the bear market how are things different where are the opportunities we want to talk about all that with you kind of like sector by sector so maybe defy and then ethereum and alternative layer ones and what people should do hopefully leave with some advice near the end but i want to start here you uh tweeted this out recently and we actually uh i think we covered something like this on the bank list podcast uh before in one of our weekly roll ups you said this crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now very much not dead very much alive washing out the excesses very much building things people want to use coiled spring on a path to hyper growth i love that i love that optimism vance what do you mean by crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now yeah so i mean i think one of the bigger opportunities right now is is frankly to reflect on what happened over the past you know two or three years as we're in kind of this the secular bull cycle for for crypto um and i think you know one of the the learnings that i have at least is you know you could probably separate the bull run into two component parts and the first one was the high conviction rally that was built around defy um and you know people were using the products for the first time we had you know found this addressable market that we hadn't even discovered before it was very high conviction reality people were using the software it felt like it was very fundamental and then the second half of kind of the bull run it felt like a lower conviction rally and i would kind of define this as like the period after summer 2021 where people were excited about the futures etf launch of bitcoin people were excited about the metaverse and nfts and that kind of felt like an apathetic run where interest rates were an all-time low and you know we just didn't have the requisite product progress and so that time actually made me feel um you know quite nervous about the space just in terms of there was probably going to be some sort of coming downturn um and then today you know interest rates are at you know very high levels crypto has been you know largely crushed uh but what we have is a lot more rationality a lot more people focusing on you know things that have real product market fit um and we have a calling of the herd of entrepreneurs who probably weren't you know built for the long term in this space versus ones who you know have been in a you know a market for three five years that are just finally figuring out how they get to product market fit and how they scale their businesses and so you know when you're when you're down you know 70 80 as a project and you're starting to kind of really get into shared sacrifice territory where you figure out your business that's where the most positive and constructive things happen um it's just so hard for these entrepreneurs to build in bull markets that really all of the best ideas really happen in the bear and so for me you know i'm as positive as ever i have a very long-term perspective and i understand that this is where you know the progress is made and we're just excited to be here i want to go and identify that high versus low conviction rally because i think what you're implying is that uh another high conviction rally is formed in the bear market and so that's kind of what like perhaps we are at the very very beginning stages of a high conviction rally that will happen much later because of what's being built now but i want to go back and parse apart what you mean by high conviction and low conviction rallies to classify how the 2021 bull market works where you're saying that there was real utility everyone just had real excitement about d5 yield farming at the end of 2020 and going into 2021 uh but then that got replaced i'm gonna go ahead and guess around like after that may crash the may 2021 crash uh and then the second half of the of the uh bull market was like the alt layer 1 movements it was the nft movement the metaverse movement which was largely undefined can you can you talk about just how you interpret high conviction and low conviction because it you made it seem like it's a gut take or like an emotional interpretation but i'm wondering if like you could put more parameters or definitions around what you mean by a high conviction and low conviction rally yeah i mean high conviction rallies are usually based off of you know things that have fundamental use that most market participants respect and know and then there's also kind of this combination of fundamentals that are being embraced by institutions and and that is generally a very high conviction rally and people can get behind it because they understand it and from first principles they can use it and you know those things are usually products of stuff that's happened in the bear market in terms of product progress but it's also you know largely a product of things that happen in in low conviction rallies as well and what i mean by this is you know some of the best ideas that you have coming out of bull markets are usually kind of like the last you know dying breaths of bull markets so you know last the last low conviction rally i would put in that category you know the nft kind of rally you know that that felt to me like low conviction but there's a lot of promise there the gaming rally you know that was only really axi and so it was kind of a low conviction rally but it feels like there's a lot of promise there and then you take that stuff that you find in the tail end of a low conviction rally which is usually the end of these bull markets and you kind of put everything under the microscope during the bear market and then by the time you know you kind of develop product market fit and you develop conviction in these ideas that's what leads to these higher conviction rallies and for me you know i i can see the setup for another high conviction rally and i can see the ideas from the low conviction rally and how you can really you know push them forward and find product market fit and not all of those products or ideas will and so yeah that's kind of how i separate the two it is largely an emotional feeling though um but i also feel like you can tie it towards just the amount of people that are using these things and in what nature is it purely speculative or is it for some higher level of utility and the d5 versus kind of the metaverse and and the you know nft rallies this felt very very different to me as a result would you say that you take the low conviction rally and you add time research thought and effort onto the good ideas of the low conviction rally maybe also you add a bear market and then at the other end of those things the ideas that do make it through those filters turn into the high conviction rallies of the future right you're just kind of squeezing out all of the excess you're developing the idea and the thought process a little bit more and you're putting real work behind it um and so i i'm you know very bullish obviously on the future of game fi and the future of nfts but you know it's just worth being honest with uh with everyone about you know what level of belief there really was in those rallies um just based on the level of product market fit that they had is this a basically something we see repeat in in every market maybe has repeated in crypto before too right so like the uh i guess maybe the the low conviction rally of 2018 would you say or 2017 would you say then part of 2017 was sort of all of these uh icos which led to kind of these like like futility tokens uh and it wasn't the case that uh tokens were a bad idea that seemed to be after after the big ico crash the token crash there was this counter uh like the this counter movement of all tokens are a bad idea and only bitcoin is the thing and ethereum got even lumped in there as kind of an ico platform that would never recover all of these things uh and it wasn't that tokens were a bad idea or even some of the d5 early d5 protocols were a bad idea it's that the market just went out too far on its skis right the market like overpriced the success before actually seeing the evidence uh and i think we've also seen this in the early internet as well we had like the dot-com uh boom of course uh and then followed by a bust it wasn't that the ideas of the dot-com boom were wrong it was just that the market was far out pricing like what the current capabilities with these things are is that is that kind of what you're seeing it's just echoes of maybe 2017 it's it's echoes of uh you know the dot-com boom we see this play out in every sort of innovation uh cycle yeah i i think that's exactly the case right now what i'm doing is just a lot of like looking back over the tape and seeing exactly what happened and how certain entrepreneurs did and then how certain markets fared and i think like separating these stages you know between each other it can really help you frame you know what's working what's likely to work you know what are the trends that are important to take out of this last kind of dying grasp of the bull market but it also helps you just conceptualize how the market works and how it values narratives and how those can eventually unwind but then become you know real again and icos were basically the precursor to d5 people weren't using financial applications other than capital formation in 2017 but that laid a lot of the groundwork for not only infrastructure but also the d5 products themselves and i think we're going to see that as well you know in the markets that were very hot and low conviction side of the rally uh the things that i look for on on you know like these developing trends are you know if you think about you know game fi and defy and a lot of our intuition that led us to d5 is leading us to game phi now you know with with d5 right when it started to really pop off with with compound in their token launch you know you know people had a mental model they had an understanding of like okay we can do tokens we can incentivize usage um an axi at the tail end of the last bull market really kind of was the same thing for gaming you know people understood that okay i can play this game i can make money using it might not be the best game but like there's value there from a gaming perspective and so a lot of the kind of mental models from the low conviction rallies you know help you kind of form theses around you know like what the future looks like and so for us you know that's just it's a good hallmark of where the space could go so let's talk about what the future does look like then so if we take the lessons of 2021 and and the end of 2022 what are the big takeaways from this particular bull market as somebody that also took away lessons from 2017 and 2018 and turned that into wins going into the 2020 bull market what are the lessons that you are looking at out of the 2021 bull market and how your that is uh change your attitude or perception or investment thesis moving forward to whenever the next bull market comes i have to go category by category for these answers to really be specific or be helpful but um the first one i would just think about is just base layers and i think what we learned about base layers and specifically you know all tell ones or ethereum killers or whatever you want to call them is you know how easy it is to build something that looks like you know a competitor to ethereum but how hard it is to actually bootstrap it in the long term and keep it going and build economic security and build just a monetary premium and i think that's really the first thing that i learned about with alt ethereum chains you know in this bull run and a lot of these chains said that they had you know all of the answers and the scaling was fixed and there was no trilemma um but that just didn't turn out to be true at the end of the day and so i think you know with that lesson what that tells me about the future is that you know whenever things really start to pop off in the next bull run um it's not going to be people building alt l1s anymore it's people going to be building l2s it's easier to build it's you can build economic security faster and cheaper all the developer tooling is there and so that's kind of like the first thing that i learned just by these people being able to get kind of to some sort of like seeming feature parody with ethereum but not ever really able to achieve escape velocity so that's probably the first thing that i learned in d5 i think you know what i learned was really you know we have dominant players in most existing categories today and one of the memes of d5 was that these projects are the victims of their own success you know venus swap happens and then sushi swap copies them and then compound happens the nave copies them and you know all of these things which would suggest that you know d5 is just a race to the bottom um and unlikely to accrue any value i just don't think that actually played out um the way that the market expected it to and i think it's fundamentally positive just to show the pathway how winners can emerge from d5 so for uniswap you know they just keep gaining market share and the second they turn on that fee switch it's going to be just an enormously valuable token ave and compound you know they're they're dominating the borrow lens space like and there's a reason that you don't see new amms or new borrowed protocols funded you know very frequently anymore it's just like acknowledge that the that's too far gone from a competitive perspective and so i think the thing that i learned from you know defy is is that you know it's largely the same things that dominate you know the web two you know or or determine the web 2 kind of competitive spectrum it's just how good is your team how willing are they to you know stick around stick it out build products that have real demand um and i think with d5 you're gonna see a very different market in six months twelve months where the winners start to really pull themselves out of the bear market without this entire like you know bullish d5 narrative emerging i think you know things like unit swap things like ave things like um you know synthetics like they're going to be absolutely gigantic just because they have the management and the team that will stick it out um and so for me the learning on the defy side is that the market is very large but really what you want to bet on is longevity and there's not a lot of projects that have longevity because most of them have been funded in the past year and i think those are likely to die so that's kind of d5 game fi i mean i just think it's going to be the world's biggest market honestly you know of really any type of software and you know we've seen early indications of this with axi but we've kind of only seen like the tip of the iceberg with what this could become and you know these things take multiple years to to ship it's not like three guys in a smart contract building a d5 platform and so for us you know we understand that's gonna probably take another six or nine months for these things to leave their gestation period but this is the next mega trend that's happening and so you know all of these things uh you know learnings about tokens learning about community building you know there's just such a rich amount of information over the past two years that like we're really focused on taking stock and and actually trying to apply what we learned versus just repeating the same lessons over and over again all right so there's three categories three rabbit holes that i think you just opened up for us uh all layer ones and the the horizon for layer ones versus layer twos uh also defy i have a question about what i think crypto twitter has deemed the fat application thesis which i think uh is what you alluded to also and of course game five what you just finished with and my brain goes there it's like well what about the current landscape of trad gaming informs your game fight thesis so i think we'll go down each one of those rabbit holes but let's go back to the layer one conversation and my and you you kind of alluded to how you think that the layer twos are the new layer ones but i'm wondering if there is in your in your brain like a place for a contrarian bet on alt layer ones uh and where like alt layer ones there there were so many of them that rose to fame in the second half of 2022 or 2021 we can't not all of them are going to work uh most of them are going to die but is there a place to place a contra concentrated bet on an alt layer one and do you think perhaps that as people rotate into like the layer two narrative that actually there might be one big successful alt layer one to actually make it through the bear market i'm just wondering how you're placing bets and and how you kind of think about a contrarian bet on the alt layer one space you know we don't actually hold any l1s so uh probably not the best person to ask about this but um really i think that the market breaks down between ethereum uh probably solana probably some newer age kind of data availability plays um and then you know frankly the other one that i see that's having you know a bunch of usage even though it's probably low quality usage is bnb um but like these are most of these are kind of evm chains and really the thing that differentiates them is not their technical uh you know prowess the best tech is probably not going to win in the base layer smart contract wars anyways but the things that are more regional or ideological about these chains you know you have sbf and ftx behind solana you have cz and the binance crew behind bnb um and then you kind of have ethereum which is this kind of you know switzerland style open internet you know ethereum is the base metaverse money play that looks very different from really any of them and i think there's enough room for each of them to succeed but it's going to be a power law distribution and you know there's a future where most of the transaction volume doesn't live on ethereum but it is the most valuable smart contract chain a good example of this is apple you know apple only has 14 of all smartphone uh market share and yet it has 73 of the total smartphone market cap and that is really kind of what i'm aiming towards as a technology investor that's the clearest and most interesting opportunity for me i think a interesting question though is van since you don't have any bets on alternative layer ones uh the question of why so like why don't you because of course you know you venture capitalists you operate a fund you're in the business of making money many vcs many funds have made a lot of money on alternative layer ones uh both betting on them early but also maybe you know like trading them um you know selling them at certain points in the market why have you guys decided to just sort of opt out of the alternative layer one hype fest because if you ask i think 910 vcs right now or or fund managers they will tell you that the world is absolutely going to be multi-chain and by multi-chain by the way they don't mean many layer twos they mean many alternative layer ones of which ethereum is like kind of one among this this whole slew and there may not be as clear case for a power law winner so why have you made this decision i i think for me a lot of the investing style that we do on the liquid side where you know potentially we would be buying you know all ones but we haven't is just the simplest version of our highest conviction best idea and and for us you know that is ethereum and i think the reason it is ethereum because it has so much usage it has a fee base that you know we can rely on it's probably one of the only you know like you can build a smart contract chain that's competitive ethereum there's a very small chance that you can accrue a monetary premium that's similar to eth as it's used as money and so for us you know ethereum is always the place that you know frankly we've been around and the community that we grew up in um and that's not to say that we didn't regret betting on any of these l1 as they were absolutely mooning but we could kind of tell that this was going to happen there were just so many supply overhang dynamics that you know the prices of these things were likely to crash 90 to 95 and sure enough a lot of them have and so for us you know we can uh bet on these things and you know they can run up and they'll run down or we can be focused on our the highest conviction simplest version of our best idea and also on the application layer and on the application layer that's where things get a lot easier you know you can forecast out cash flows you can understand the relationship between customers and the product and that's frankly spiritually where i see more framework is playing it's just closer to the metal with founders that are building products not as much on the platform level i think most of the you know best smart contract players those are really funded before framework is even really a thing um and so for us you know we're focused on the things that we think can accrue value and right now it feels like the application layer is the most undervalued with the highest potential to have more users and there's a future where the pricing power of blockchains goes down but application layer remains the same and so for us that's just a definite hedge on you know what if the fee landscape turns out to be less robust than we had thought earlier you talked about how layer twos it's they're easier to spin up you don't have to have worry about uh consensus security because that's taken care of by by ethereum and so there's this idea that uh because layer twos are easier to spin up and establish and and as soon as there's any amount of blocks based demand for layer twos it turns the ecosystem into a revenue positive ecosystem because they don't have to pay for security uh and so this this has lent itself to a thesis shared by some in the ethereum circles as they're just like there was this alt layer one mania there will also be a layer two mania as well uh just because if they're easier to spin up and especially when optimism comes and air drops their token and it just lands you know still in price discovery at the moment but we're talking about a six billion dollar valuation uh that turns investors heads uh and then there's many other like layer twos to also show that they can do similar things like arbitrage hasn't released their token yet everyone is assuming that they will do one uh and there's other layer twos that we could talk about as well where like well as soon as a uh i mean optimism is one data point perhaps arbitrarily is another and then all of a sudden that we have like maybe two or three data points that these layer twos can establish multi-billion dollar valuations paired with the ease of setting up a layer two the thesis is that it's this turns into a layer two summer layer two mania now we've had this layer two like summer thesis on bankless for a while now for like over a year uh but i'm wondering if you like subscribe to this idea and if you have any sort of uh trajectory for us totally green i think you hit the nail right on the head a good uh proxy for where froth is gonna go in the market is what is the lowest effort way to create the highest amount of market cap and you know with the optimism launch you now have like a five billion dollar potential honey pot for anyone who's willing to you know fork it and throw their hat in the ring and you have things like metis and bobo which are forks but you know really the the ease of forking these l2s right now is is extremely hard um and so i think there's gonna be kind of like some developments there that allow people to fork things probably cleaner easier quickly um and that'll lead to just this explosion and l2 activity i mean at some point in the next year i do expect the l2s to be one of the larger consumers of block space and i think that's when the narrative will really shift where people say like okay um not only are these things scaling solutions for ethereum but they're actually adding to the economic security of it as well in a meaningful way and you'll have people just spin up a ton of l2s because you know if you're a d5 project right now just this is just a general example you know and you don't have product market fit there's there's kind of a couple things that you can do you can continue to build more applications you can continue to try things and throw spaghetti or you can start an l2 and kind of create this ecosystem play and you know unfortunately i think a lot of people will take the the road that's a little bit easier which is just like forking this l2 and so in a lot of ways the incentives are just geared towards this happening and you know all we need to do is just wait for it to play out the good news is that it's just constructive for ethereum writ large um and so you know kind of no matter what you do ethereum is is a beneficiary of this how can we take the lessons of d5 that you were referring to earlier where uniswap grabs a ton of market share and then sushi schwab forks it right and then oh you know there's a bunch of like uh borrowing and lending protocols that have forked off compound and ave but leaning into the whole idea well there's kind of just one or a very few winners in each category how would you apply that same lesson to the outlayer two movement if that indeed does happen i mean the the d5 learnings are just uh i think there's a few the first one is like the first mover advantage is huge um you know like uniswap being the first and the most dominant amm is not something that you see very often in technology but in crypto it just happens to be the case same with compound and ave um you know you can make the argument for things like dydx or synthetics on the derivative sides but like really the things that matter are you know did you launch early uh how good's your team are you willing to stick it out to the bear market and really just surviving a lot of your competitors and if you look at you know runes uh rune keck the uh or sorry from roon christensen from from maker dow uh his end game post you know one of the things that that he lays out very early on is that maker dao is no longer profitable it cost him about 10 million dollars a year to run this business and you know now not just maker but a lot of these defy companies are up against a shot clock and a lot of them will simply fold and so i think outlasting your competitors and having a strong product direction and just getting integrated is are really the things that matter on the d5 side in terms of how that manifests into the l1 space or the l2 space i think it's going to be a very different set of participants like i don't think it's going to be uniswap launching their own l2 they're probably going to stick on optimism and you know be true to the ethereum narrative you know in its most purest sense but i think a lot of the uh the people who are you know in the desert searching for product market fit or people who are probably not as just you know motivated by you know direct product market fit success those are going to be the folks who launched the l2s and so you know think about kind of like the frog nations of last cycle think about like those types of characters like that's what's coming for them and it's coming pretty quickly um and so i think that is you know probably a pessimistic take on where the alt l2 space goes it's probably going to be rife with a lot of you know also rans and people who are not ideologically you know pure but that's okay as long as you're burning ethereum you know like your name so let's get into this uh a bit more than while we're camping on kind of um the these block uh chain ecosystems right because they are going to be a very important uh building block right and of course we as we said so many times on bank list what do blockchain sell blockchain sell blocks all right and so i'm wondering if we could do like a an ecosystem uh you know uh ranking or just tell us for each of these ecosystems what are the things they have going for them and what are the things they have going against them and we'll start with some of the alternative layer ones give us give us that sort of summary then we'll go to some of the layer twos like you know stark net and optimism and arbitram and then maybe we'll end with ethereum and give us kind of your your case for ethereum through the bear market but starting with the alternative layer ones what do they have going for them and against them let's uh take solana uh avalanche and bnb as the ones that are primarily left standing here i think you know tara is is now they would be among those four but is now by the wayside of course uh what do you think solana avalanche bnb what do they have going for them and against them solana is is very clear they have you know sbf they have ftx they have you know the people who write code in rust uh mostly these people are traditional finance folks um and so they have kind of like a differentiated developer pipeline um they have kind of institutional support and i i think at the end of the day they have a bid like people aren't going to let this die and a lot of chains just have a lot of people that will let them die uh solana does not have that and i think that's a fundamentally positive thing on the negative side i mean the chain just like has problems staying live you know they need to implement a fee market there is no l2 model um and i think a lot of the architecture decisions that they made are really going to be put under the microsoft under the next year and you know salon is probably going to look a lot different a year or two from now than it does today and you know a lot of the uh the value proposition of solano was like you know the uh the monolithic chain gives you a very linear scaling model that everyone can rely on and and you can build on solana today because it'll look the same in two years i actually don't think that's the case i think they're gonna have to pivot pretty dramatically and so you know i think that's what they have working against them is like all the decisions that were made almost four years ago to scale ethereum all of the work on zk stuff all of the work on optimistic rollups like you're now playing catch up with that time horizon so that's not that great um but you know we we like salon we backs a lot of projects like we're not um you know ideologically just opposed to it um we're just we acknowledge the reality of where it is today and it's far behind ethereum um so it's going to survive solana's going to survive is going to make it this is going to make it they're going to make it okay how about avalanche avalanche i mean avalanche is an interesting one where uh i've seen very smart people disagree on the concept of subnets and you know i think it's okay to take either side of that bet um and you know subnet usage is pretty small right now there's about two subnets one is for d5 kingdoms and uh i think it does you know pretty well but really the model in which they scale that up uh and you know their unwillingness to kind of uh recognize the importance of data availability and you know continuing to double down on consensus as the bottleneck it's kind of concerning to me just to someone who likes to think that they know about blockchains and how they work so it's tbd maybe i'm totally wrong uh but you know it doesn't seem like it uh and so i think that they'll survive i think they have a really strong pa and passionate community the red triangle army um and they have kind of this weird differentiated pipeline of developers from cornell um and so i think that's enough for them to really kind of survive i don't know if it's enough for them to thrive one aspect about um avalanche that i think has stood out to me is that they actually have produced a meaningful fee market like they actually do show up on the layer one fees uh from david mihal's website uh and that was one of the big critiques of all layer ones that ryan and i had in early 2021 is like well fees are our proxy for actual usage and so until and like and none of them in the first half of 2021 actually had a fee market but avalanche's fee market has actually emerged in the last six months so i'm wondering and we're definitely going to talk about ethereum's fee market and and what that means for ethan's money later in the show um but as a small microcosm of that what do you make of avalanche and its adoption proven out by its fee market yeah i think really the you know the adoptions proved up by its feed market is largely on the gaming side so it's karbada and its defy kingdoms and you know when developers ask us right now where should you build games or where should i build games um the real answer is that there's really not a good place to build a game right now like there's no one that's really cheap enough and ready enough to to support like a large game today but the answers that we hear most frequently are you know polygon super nets uh immutable x uh subnets um and then building your own l2 which right now is just like too technically complex for most game developers to do and so i think subnets are getting a lot of play and a lot of kind of exposure just because they're one of a few viable options to really scale and they have a proof case of d5 kingdoms and so i think that's kind of the bold case for avalanche is that subnets are perfect for the gaming model because you have your own little ecosystem that you can control and monetize um and it lives separate from the core avalanche chain so you know that's why i would be bullish and that's frankly where the usage has come from so far vance you mentioned this uh earlier you referenced this earlier but there were smart people on both sides of the avalanche subnet debate what is the debate what are both sides of the the debate are some that's like a layer two for people say that or are they something different are they more like a just a side chain subnets are are kind of the lyric two equivalent on avalanche and you know i think it we still need to see whether they work i think the bottleneck right now is just like subnet creation it's extraordinarily hard to spin up your own subnet and there's a lot of assumptions and contingencies that you really kind of have to think of as you build it um it's certainly not as straightforward as something like an l2 on ethereum where you could probably easily fork it and you can just use the optimism one if you don't really want to um and so for us like you know try not to comment too much on like the ongoing twitter debates of like the avalanche community versus the ethereum community but it feels like there's a fundamental disagreement between either data availability or consensus being the real bottleneck um and amin and the avalanche team are extraordinarily smart and you know maybe you know the ethereum community is actually wrong about this but i think most points in that argument would probably be scored for the ethereum community and just their style of scaling of blockchain by the way um david we got to bookmark that for uh having a conversation or a debate on subnets uh scaling as a strategy versus layer two so i wanna dig oh i have that telegram group already uh spun up all right thanks man it's always thinking ahead all right so we got solana avalanche both are going to make it maybe they'll suffer through the bear market uh remains to be seen but they'll make it out on the other side how about binance chain good old bnb and our friend cz i mean you know cz one of the wealthiest people on the planet you know finance the second largest i always forget that fact yeah no people forget it's real um you know finance it's one of the largest if not the largest chains um or sorry exchanges and so they have a lot of leverage and they have an ability to have a differentiated user base from from asia you know doing things that probably aren't as you know culturally normative as they would be on ethereum and so i think you know if you look at bnb that's one of the few chains that actually has structural demand for their token in terms of just people paying gas fees in it every single day fairly consistently um i think there's a lot of issues with the chain like there's a ton of mev spam just because it's like a penny slot machine where you can have transactions for free and so everyone tries to just like okay can i fur on this person can i sandwich this person can i do something crazy um and so like there's a lot of shenanigans going on over there but that's just another chain that you know do i want the future of the internet to be bnb i i don't um am i realistic in assessing that it will not die i am like it's not going to go anywhere if anything it's only going to grow but again you know think about apple 14 of smartphone sales 73 of market cap of smartphone makers you can see where the nokia where the android comparison comes in i got it and that's just we think it'll play out what about the last one here on the alternative layer ones is cosmos and i realize that's not just a chain but it's a whole kind of you know philosophy of building all of these interconnected uh proof of stake chains how do you think cosmos fares um you know i'm not smart enough on cosmos really to really be you know to say anything unique so i'll probably hold my my opinion on that one okay let's get to some of the layer twos then um so that's an interesting ecosystem and one that sort of sits in between the the separate side chain or layer twos the first one is uh polygon of course they're they're doing layer two strategy as well as they have the polygon proof of steak chain which is somewhat of a modified uh side chain what do you think of polygon uh talk about their prospects what's going for them or against them so before i talk about polygon i will say like we're rapidly getting to the point where there's probably 10 different approaches to scale a blockchain to you know 100 million a billion plus monthly active users and as we get closer to that you know all of these approaches coming true it becomes less likely that the best tech driven approach will win you know i'm sure we're going to find the best absolute model to scale blockchain at some point it probably won't matter because the existing blockchains will already be cheap enough they'll have a large enough lead where they can just continue to dominate the market and i think that's kind of like roughly the area that we're going into right now and so the things that i like about polygon are just a direct reflection of that like do i think their poa chain is like particularly robust or safe to transact on like probably not i wouldn't store a ton of my money there but they have an incredible bd team they have an incredible team that has a focus on gaming they have an incredible team that's focused on grants and bringing new teams on chain and you know collecting teams from tara that fell off and they're integrating them now like those are the things that they do very well where it looks a little bit more kind of like the solana pd strategy but they're able to just bootstrap and get attention and get interest and they're building a lot of different chains they're building a data availability solution they're building a zk roll up they're building an optimistic roll up like they're going to hit on one of the scaling models and and they'll just be able to kind of sub out their developers and their users for the chain that ends up working and so i'm a big fan of their approach and i like the fact that they've always been ethereum first and like willing to buy into this larger narrative i don't think i think you know polygon will be a successful chain i think one of the bigger things that will come into the valuation of tokens is like are you money are you able to acquire a monetary premium and i don't think matic will quite get there ethereum will kind of always be that that dominant kind of you know metaverse based money and and that's something that i've come around on in frankly the past like year year and a half i remember david you know you you were like you know is heath money and i was just like i don't even really know what that means at the time but like really i think that's something that i've changed my mind on quite quite dramatically especially kind of in the context of high inflation and and just fiat money not being that great as a store of value um i really do think you know the power law distribution of value will be because of the monetary premium and i got into this space because of the technology and it's kind of ironic that i'm now kind of like basing a lot of my highest assumptions for what ethereum could be based or be worth based on its monetary premium but i really do think that's what's happening here and so bullish on polygon you know i think it'll be a great scaling solution i don't think it'll require a huge monetary premium um but yeah i'm pretty bullish on them a narrative that has come out uh around this dark net ecosystem in the last six months are these like whole l2 plus l3 uh dynamics where like the stark net as an l2 to ethereum uh can offer layer twos to stark net making them layer threes to ethereum i'm wondering if how well informed you are about this whole like strategy of i guess it's a scaling strategy for an l2 which is like kind of interesting to have that as cause like l2s are themselves scaling strategies for ethereum so i'm wondering your familiarity with this like stark net strategy of l2 cell threes and if you have a bullish or bearish opinion on it i'm i'm not extremely familiar with it what i will say is like this is something that we're seeing a lot like we're seeing super nets with polygon we're seeing um i think it's like nitro or turbo for for arbors from like everyone's you know kind of doing this as like an optimistic roll-up within an optimistic roll-up which you know at least in the uh the arbitrary context um that's what it feels like i think it's i think it's bullish for ethereum like my base case is that fees are going to collapse dramatically and then people are going to be like oh my god you know is it over and then fees are going to ramp way back up once people realize that you can do everything on chain you can build an application you can store data and that's kind of fundamentally what blockchains are eventually used for and so you know for us i think the focus that we have and the thesis we have for ethereum is that it's used as the date availability later and it becomes a form of money and the more scaling solutions the better but you know everyone paying attacks to ethereum i would rather own a much smaller percentage of a much larger market you know on the path to hyper growth than i would just kind of like occupying all the fees that exist on l1 and collecting those so we're pretty open-minded in that regard vance what do you think of this though like stark net as a whole uh because there's this intensifying war of not just um alternative layer ones versus ethereum but but layer two is against each other so we've got polygon stark net taking a different approach what do you think about their their head winds or tailwinds and that ecosystem yeah i mean this comes back to the point of like you know the best tech is not going to win um and i think what what is going to win is just like the ecosystems that are able to bootstrap themselves the most effectively and i think the thing that stark net is doing a really good job at is getting like all of these very endearingly you know strange builders that would be building applications even if there was never going to be a user ever they just love the tech they want to build and they've done a great job with their grants program you know basically just incentivizing for people to come and stay on starknet and you know the people that i would categorize in stark net are you know very hardcore cryptography maxis a lot of israelis a lot of people that were in the security industry before the cyber security industry before and then a lot of gaming you know companies and people um and so like you have kind of like this weird like crypto is always a reflection of like who's in it or your chain is always a reflection of like who's in it and so stark net is is the same way and it's got like this this weird amalgamation of people but it's great when you put them all together with a grants program that's cohesive and so i think they're doing you know a great job of building out you know what they need to build out um i think it's probably further along than people think but you know their traction with the gaming specific people you know that's a that's a fundamentally bullish indicator that's kind of what you really want to be indexing for is the next largest market um and they're certainly occupying a good degree of the mind share for for the gaming developers people forget that immutable is built on the stark net as well and you know star wars technology yep so to tie this uh this conversation off i want to go into the the red versus blue conversation the optimism versus arbitrary conversation these are both optimistic roll ups they're both going for evm equivalents uh and they they seem to just be kind of like leapfrogging each other over and over and over again i'm wondering uh if your perspective on this particular part of like the l2 wars where uh the they're very much operating in the same space uh very collaborative but also very competitive at the same time what's what's your take on optimism versus arbitrary we're fans of both you know full disclosure we've invested in in optimism but like i know and like the arbitrary team and know that they're you know legitimately good for the space and taking a good approach and so we're not you know uh maxies of one versus the other i do think the optimism approach is frankly just more reflective of the ethereum ethos and ethereum community which you know at the end of the day if you have the thesis of the best tech is not going to win it's probably something else and on the community side like i see them as kind of matching the ethos of ethereum most purely and i think there's a lot of you know addressable market in that at the end of the day these things are going to come down to you know who has the better team which can bring developers on chain and either that's kind of like this amorphous brand halo that slowly you know people recognize it and come to you even without asking or it's you have some aggressive bd people that are just out there pounding the pavement getting people on giving people grants and i think arbitram probably has the more kind of aggressive bd side i think optimism has kind of the larger brand halo the scoreboard would tell you right now that the bt side is probably more powerful than just the the overall brand halo based on their tvl and usage um but like these things are such early days like you're fighting between like you know thousands if not tens of thousands of user differences between these two chains and those things can flip instantly if one app if one game hits and so you know i've seen so many people call apps dead or call you know the competition over between two things it's never that way you know people love to anoint winners early and i just don't think it's a time to do so so we're just gonna have to wait and see but overall we're bullish on both and we're bullish on ethereum yeah speaking of ethereum last but not least there are a bunch of things of variables to discuss about ethereum so we want to get your overall take on where ethereum lies in this current market because many many people in the in the deep ethereum circle are getting very very bullish about the merge but also the merge keeps on getting pushed back over and over again uh and meanwhile like uh while the merge keeps on getting pushed back macro markets keep on hammering ethereum so how would you illustrate ethereum's current place in the world what's it got going for it uh what's holding it what's holding it back and when it comes to just the variables around ethereum what captures your attention the most yeah so um i think just in terms of where ethereum is right now you know the fee bases are always kind of like our north star what are people paying to use this every single day and uh hal brest did an amazing job uh on on on a bankless pod about this so if you haven't listened to it please please go listen to it i think you know right now where ethereum is they're probably around 6000 each that are used in transactions per day about 85 percent of that is burned you know at a 2 000 ethereum price eath is making about 12 million dollars a day and just in terms of fee demand and that's just like fundamentally very very healthy and if you look at it on on a on a price to earnings basis you know basically saying you know what would you pay for one dollars of of you know earnings which is how most you know public software companies are valued you can make the case that it's pretty undervalued it trades at around probably like a 13 to 14 price to earnings and when you look at uh you know and tech companies there are really good kind of analogies because um you know they trade it probably roughly like a 20 priced earnings and so ethereum on that context is is pretty undervalued and when you look at price to dividends like what you would pay for one dollar of dividends and you compare it to companies that do pay dividends the first thing to note is that none of these software companies pay dividends uh they don't basically make any money um you know and it ranges from you know salesforce.com that has a 167 billion dollar valuation that actually makes zero dollars a profit per year to to google which actually is profitable but doesn't pay any dividends and so like the best companies to look at when you're comparing just like the dividend yield of ethereum are things that are a little bit strange kind of like exxon and you know phillips altria people who sell like oil and cigarettes like those are kind of like consumer staples that pay high dividends and what you can see is that people are paying far more for dividends in these companies than you would assuming that the merge goes through and so for me how i think about it is i think the dividends are going to be the thing that you know really kind of gets ethereum you know bit up and people excited about it and you're just going to have a larger price earnings you know ratio as a result and it reflects just the higher growth of ethereum and so that's kind of like what we're most excited about is just when you compare this to public software companies in terms of just their growth rates ethereum is growing faster it's more profitable at higher gross margins and when you compare it to the people who pay dividends you know the philips altrias the exxons of the world they're just paying dividends at a cheaper rate to people that you know have a higher claim on the overall dividend pool and so for us those are the things that are exciting why do i think people are are fading the merge the merge was supposed to happen in 2017 i remember i remember wide deck yeah i remember slidek from vitalik which you know 2016 the merge is nine months away like people have very good reason to doubt that this is gonna happen um and the ethereum core foundation uh is an amazing spot that does just uh you know not a great job of communicating to people you know how these things work and there's like 50 people on these ethereum core devs calls there's basically nobody there um and so how would anybody really do their own primary research there's just kind of like this apathy around you know we don't think it's going to happen we're not getting communicated the right information and so people are are kind of right to fade it in a way frankly for us like we just are on these calls we are in the eth r d discord you know we talk to various members of the eth core dev team it's gonna happen you know in the next six months in our opinion and our hope is that you know at first the structural supply dynamics and the reduction will drive the price which will eventually drive the narrative which will drive the price and you'll get into this kind of reflexive basket of just ethereum becoming metaverse based money with high yields um and get bid up relative to software companies so that's kind of how we think about the merge going back to the uh the dividends conversation uh i mean i think where everyone here is bullish or that one day the actual value of the ethereum fees and the dividends that it pays through eip1559 will become fairly reflected in the market but that is not the current state of things today for some reason uh the market discounts the value of of ethereum's fees and the way that it injects the the value back into into ether the asset and so i'm wondering where do you think the source of that dislocation comes from is it come from uh the fact that people just aren't comfortable with a crypto asset and and don't understand that these things kind of do actually act like dividends even though they don't act like the dividends that they're familiar with uh but there's also the conversation of like well like uh since these are our very unfamiliar form of dividends maybe like we have a regulation conversation where like this kind of feels like something just unfamiliar on a regulatory standpoint just where do you think the discount comes from when we see ethereum which has it's a network and so it has an insane amount of growth potential far greater growth potential than something like salesforce but it's the value of its dividends is discounted so heavily so where do you think the source of that discount on the ethereum dividends comes from i think it's from you know people don't doubt ethereum the platform i think they doubt the applications because they just view them as being not valid and so they're like nfts aren't valid games are not valid you know d5 like you know you know those fees are going to compress as scaling solutions come out and they just generally don't believe kind of this idea of certain block spaces more valuable than others and it's not just going to be erased to zero as these technological paradigms shift and and they also kind of believe that all of these applications probably go to zero as well you know once the real bear market kicks in and and people are no longer willing to just part with discretionary income for speculative reasons i mean the reality is that it's the opposite um you know as ethereum has kind of you know gone down in price we've seen relatively stable levels of fees you know on on chain you know most days we're seeing four to five to six thousand you know each that's being used as fees and you know it was certainly higher when it was four or five thousand dollars you know per eth but you know even then the relative stability has been impressive for me i would have expected it to actually go down much further um and i think a lot of this is also just like the time horizon you know the ethereum fee market and i might be wrong on this it's only been really really big for the past 18 months so this is relatively new phenomenon and people are expecting this to kind of trickle down as the market also you know goes down um but i think what we're seeing are early positive indications that that is not the case and that you know come you know hell or high water there is a lot of demand for block space on ethereum and it's differentiated from other blockchains

asset because it's a productive asset particularly in a post a proof-of-stake world an economy uh post-merge but i want to get back to you uh the other thing that you mentioned because it sounds like you were almost like converted to the uh etha's money um cult if you will and uh i'm curious about that conversion process like like why do you think ethan's money why do you think it will accrue monetary premium what was the path like to to getting you there and what what are its prospects as a portion of the value is it going to be primarily valued as a money or is it going to be primarily a productive asset is there a combination of both just give us your entire thesis on this i i think in the future you'll be able to model ethereum based on purely its fundamentals and then you'll have kind of this delta between you know what it's fundamental say it's worth and what it you know is actually worth in the in the open market and that's roughly going to be construed as its monetary premium and really kind of my conversion to you know the ethos money cult was just as a result of me just comping ethereum to public software companies and ethereum is such a different asset when you compare it to public software companies where you know every single year it's paying 100 of its revenue as dividends to the people that hold it and the people more specifically that stake it when you think about equities you know let's take let's take um you know let's take exxon for an example there's there's 400 billion dollars in market cap there's 10 billion dollars of dividends and you know everyone that owns a share of exxon gets a dividend there is no staking behavior there is no behavior where you say i want to go off and stake this equity and you know there is also no behavior where the people who are not staking the equity or using it as some form of money is some form of transaction fees or some form of medium exchange like there's just very different behaviors between the two assets and so when you comp them to each other it just becomes a lot clearer that ethereum is an asset that really the world has not really seen before in the sense that it's high growth it's high margin it pays stakeholders in its native asset for using and staking the asset but also you have this entirely other use case of the asset where it's used as money it's used to buy nfts it's used in defy and it accrues yield and you know i think that it's just going to be very different when you know ethereum yields are 10 15 and people are just holding it and using it as a base form of money and that's really the only time that we'll really get to see this to me it's shocking that ethereum trades at as high value as it does today because there are no fundamentals all of the fundamentals of the network go to the miners but when the switches i think it's just going to be a massive paradigm shift where people see an asset like they haven't really ever seen before and and they might not ever really see again like it strikes me that you know the race for you know base money is is a you know probably winner takes most market um and so i think there's just a lot of really different nuance when you compare this to public software companies and just companies who pay dividends and you can see why ethereum is money as a result and you don't think vance that um some of these alternative layer ones have a high potential of achieving that that eighth level of monetary premium is that the case and if so why why why can't they why can't seoul do it why can't avax token do it i mean i think the first thing is you need a ton of fees on the network um you need a lot of app you know use cases you need a large brand halo you need liquidity on exchanges you need you know all the vcs to sell out their bags and you know go through price discovery multiple times so that you know people aren't arbitrarily you know controlling 5 10 15 of these networks like those feel like preconditions to be coming money and ethereum in many ways has just gotten very lucky in the sense that it launched first there really was no venture capital participation um you know the fee market and the you know the developer market has developed relatively organically it has a little developer tooling it has all the infrastructure so it feels like this is kind of like a once in a generation opportunity to create something that could become money and there's so many different contingencies that relies on and ethereum has just managed to hit all of them and i think the chances that another l1 does it as well is pretty small um getting people to use things as money is extraordinarily difficult like seeing nft's price in eth at first i thought it was extraordinarily silly but now like i realized that it's it's like it really did reinforce the network effects of ethereum in a way that i had not anticipated before and it's going to be very hard to build that consumer behavior elsewhere fans there's a tweet that you tweeted out on may 31st that i'd like for you to explain to me and the listeners you say east's inverse price sensitivity when used for fees as a form of money is something markets haven't seen before in december with ether above 4k we average 10 to 15 eth burned in fees per day in may with ether at 2k we see three to four uh k eath burned per day huge potential for earnings reflexivity dynamic uh actually don't know this word dynamic poke pokel epicol dynastic dynastic apocal and then you you follow that up with another tweet saying eath is a veblen money good can you explain what all this means and what a money uh veblen moneygood is yeah so the first part of the tweet is basically like let's roll back the clock and look at like all the consumer behavior that happened on chain and see like how people and and why people were spending money and you know at the very highest price of ethereum probably about 40 900 just call it 5000. people were spending about 10 to 15 000 eat a day just buying stuff transacting on chain and that's you know anywhere from 50 to 75 million dollars of revenue and you know logically you would expect that the higher the price would go with ethereum probably the less of it you would use there's always like the gas abstraction and that matches you know the supply and demand of each to the network's you know usage but you know really this is kind of the opposite of what you would see um where the higher the price goes the more people spent it and the lower the price go you know like and now it's you know at two thousand people are spending four or five thousand dollars of ethereum per day the less they're spending um and so it's kind of the inverse of the behavior that you would expect to see and what i mean by earnings reflectivity is let's say that this continues let's say that you know the fee base on ethereum hits an all-time high um of fifteen thousand each used per day uh you know again and now let's say the price of ethereum is is ten thousand dollars you know that's 150 million of revenue and you'd actually expect based on that trend the usage of youth to increase you would probably be burning or using you know maybe thirty thousand maybe forty thousand to three per day maybe fifty thousand like we don't know there is the chance that like these earnings could be so reflexive where you have days like other side where there's like a few hundred million of fees you know being used you have you know like all of these kind of micro events where the changes to crew such dramatic fees and shows such reflexivity to the price and the usage of ethereum that the earnings will be far far higher in the future than we can expect and i think that's like the mega mega bull case and kind of what i mean by the eth veblen money good is um you know a veblen good is something that the more expensive it gets the more attractive it gets to have or to use and i think that is kind of the case with ethereum or at least this data would suggest is that the higher the price of ethereum the more people see it as valuable the more they want to spend it they want to use it they want to transact it with it and the fact that they don't just hold it and put under their mattress is fundamentally positive for it being construed as money and you know like you've talked about the conversion of me to like the ethereum ultrasound money camp i think i'm there and i think mostly what got me there is just like looking at data like this and seeing people really not only you know choose to hold ethereum as it goes higher but choose to spend it as it goes higher as they feel some sort of like you know wealth effect from just their base money um it feels very strong in terms of just an argument for eth being money are you sure it wasn't the justin drake podcast though vance that was also a big one speaking of uh spending eth as it goes higher i think the listeners are like yeah i kind of wish i hadn't spent all that eth when it was all that high though uh because many many listeners and myself included like you know are kind of all tapped out i got uh i don't have any cash left to buy eth because i'm so bullish eth and i feel like a lot of listeners are probably in that camp as well which means that in a post-merge world who is going to actually be buying the eth who becomes the new marginal buyer of eth in this ether's ultrasound money form because like going into bear market unless you magically sold the top like you're kind of already already allocated at least i think that's probably the consensus for the majority of the market uh and so who who's going to come by these bags in a post-merge world so i mean i think the first folks are going to be btc folks that um you know frankly like you know you look at the i don't think this is particularly controversial but if you look at the btc ratio like obviously people are kind of like fading this idea that ethereum will be you know the merge will happen it'll be productive fees will reach the all-time high again but once the merge happens um and it just starts to trade lighter as a result of no minor supply and bitcoin or see the fees that are occurring to people that stake like it feels like that's probably going to be the moment where a lot of them jump ship and you know people forget that we really haven't had any yield or really fundamentals to buy in this industry for almost 10 years and this is the first time that that's changing and so i think initially a lot of the flows will come from people who are holding bitcoin who realize that you know ethereum is the only other asset that you know kind of has this like grandfathered regulatory status that has you know the platform play with all the developers and that has just like a bunch of yield and so i think like initially the first moves that you look for in the bear market are from capital moving from one ecosystem to the other that's usually like a very good trend of like where things are gonna go and people think that because we're in this bear market that you know ethereum is gonna go from you know 0.16 where it was at or 0.12 where it was at in the last bull market you know back right down to like 0.025 and that's just like people's instinct but the next move is going to be very constructive as to like how ethereum trades over the next few years and i think that that's going to be dominated by bitcoin flows but then you know the next question is like all right you know price drives narrative because there's a lack of supply uh and ethereum will trade lighter than bitcoin and so it'll probably start to get a little bit of a bid but then the narrative will drive the price and and the narrative driving the price looks like institutions buying it looks like bitcoin holders capitulating and buying eth and that's kind of when you get that potential for the reflexivity that i've talked about where you know if ethereum is the thing that leads out of this bear market that's when things really start to you know you could kind of like squint to see the future with that example i said where you know if eath is it you know ten thousand dollars and people are spending 10 to 15 000 eats per day like you have the reflexivity that's where i think that kicks in and you know the narrative really starts to drive the price uh and then you know all bets are off and so that's kind of how i think of this playing out but see do you have any idea or conviction on how long this will take to to play out being a multi-bare cycle veteran i mean like are we talking about like that's the other thing about this bear markets is some people i don't i don't know if anyone said v-shape recovery but i think i feel like some people think that it might be a a sharp but uh fast blip down and then back up whereas others are anticipating hey welcome back it's 2018. see you in two to three years and goblins yeah we're going it's the goblin memes or they get like no accident that they are at all-time highs as well what do you think what's your gut take for this bear mark advance how long is it going to be how sharp is the pain going to feel i mean the last time we didn't have anything to come back to yeah we didn't have any games we didn't have any d5 we didn't have any nfts like we had no natural retail funnels that would ever bring anyone back um and so like you know we were cold starting back then right now we have like the warm start maybe like the lukewarm start but you know we have fundamentally things that will bring people back on chain and we don't have to you know rely on any hail mary's to create entirely new categories that we can depend on and so i think that's one thing that you know we have going for us that we that would make me believe that it would be a shorter bear market not like you know two years maybe like a year um the other thing i'll say is the crypto kind of trades in the future where if you look at it like it's pricing in a lot of the moves that are coming to equity markets just if you've kind of seen correlations or if you've seen equity or if you've seen crypto lead equities before um and so i think really kind of the moves that crypto is making lead me to believe that it will probably bottom before equities and then the last part that i would say is just like crypto and markets in america are just like addicted to drama you know we don't want to see the the 18-month rounded bottom we want to see the wick down to 1100 ethereum everyone pukes and you know has an awful time and then you know we kind of get back on with our lives and the resumption of you know crypto just becoming ubiquitous and so that's more of my feeling about how the bear market plays out is that there's going to be some sort of you know violent capitulation where everyone kind of pukes up you know whatever they ate last night in terms of financial assets and then the party keeps going but it'll need to be something that's based on high conviction and it won't be able to be something that's just kind of like this apathetic low conviction rally um and so i think there's significant preconditions but that's roughly how i see this kind of shaking so let's talk about the sharpness of the pain so a debate david and i have going back and forth is to you know that p puking moment is how severe that will be um i very much think that it could i'm not saying it will but i think we could get to triple digits i don't want to put words in your mouth david but i think you're you thinking that triple digits is much less likely is that is that the case i think ryan is in the fan in the camp of people will puke and i'm in the in the uh camp of queasy at best what do you think vance settle the debate i i think people are addicted to drama and they want to see other people puke and so you know like that is uh i think the most likely candidate um i just don't think there's like that big of an appetite for like this long rounded bottom where everyone feels like kind of bad um and i think that's more based on just like the psychology of markets more than anything else but that's generally how i see things um there's a reason that you know you look back on the bottoms and you see for sellers and there's already been evidence of that like lfg puking 80 000 bitcoin that's crazy um like i don't think i've ever really seen that before and you know maybe there isn't something like that quite on the east side uh but it feels like you know we're still midway through the process of cleansing i think there's that's kind of how i would there's other like camps within ethereum that it sort of say like i mean last time let's remember 95 percent from top to bottom last last bear market for uh etherius and asset there's other people i talked to in ethereum maybe this is the uh the opium kicking in that are like hey you got to remember some of that puking has already happened vance if you were the terra ecosystem my god i didn't even know what that was it's like worse than puking like you're in the hospital like it's it's kind of over right and so um their their point would be some of these other chains have already felt the level of pain that you're talking about and maybe maybe the ethereums of the world and to some extent bitcoins might be a bit more insulated from that so maybe maybe we're close to the bottom or maybe we've seen it what do you think of that argument i i think the the you know the comparison is in the last cycle the four sellers were all the icos that had the eth um and you could just see them like shelling the market you know day after day and when it dropped to 85 like i thought like were under attack basically or something i thought like the chain was halting like that's how bad it seemed um and and you know we haven't gotten there to this point and you know i don't think there's as many for sellers and so i think there's like a lot of credence that's lent to the idea that you know maybe the worst of it is over um but that's also when you know people start to get complacent and then you know you go into kind of like a low liquidity summer and you know the merge you know who knows what happens maybe it gets moved up a month maybe it gets delayed like people are just going to try stuff chop is a specifically designed mechanism to transfer coins from people who you know want to have it to people who like are trying to get it from them and so you know i think this is just going to be a market that's intentionally designed for that but i do think it's going to be something that resolves sooner rather than later um and i think i just am on the side of just like maybe we have seen enough drama um and maybe ethereum is just kind of like this this thing that is resilient to it now given that it's been up so much and down so much um but yeah it's just hard to tell i want to resume a conversation that i don't think we completely finished off earlier in the show where uh during the 2018 cleansing where ether went all the way down to 85 dollars and ether went down 95 percent uh many many many other tokens went down more than that and the difference between going down 95 and going down like 99 is a difference of uh 80 percent uh and so like so like if you're if you're holding a token like the average ico that went down 99 you lost 80 percent more than something that went down 95 and so it turned into this culture of like i'll never touch tokens again like all my tokens went to zero uh never again i'm only eth only bitcoin uh and and then all of a sudden we see things like link and ave and snx just rock it off the bottom and make generational wealth and i remember looking at these charts every single month being like wow it's higher wow it's higher wow it's higher for months while i sat on eth and i mean not to not to claim that like link ave and synthetics were anything remotely close to what the average ico looks like but in the moment you had no idea like it was just another ico that somehow wasn't dead but then it was somehow not dying turned into somehow it's doubling versus e somehow it's tripling versus eth uh and so like the lesson here is while some people are swearing off tokens and say i'll never touch another token again there are some tokens that like had their their moment at the moment to claim and really actually kind of led the 2020 bull market uh and so if we followed that pattern going into the 2022 bear and perhaps i don't know the 20 late 2023 2024 for bull how are you thinking about this the same sort of pattern like are you on the hunt because like one of the reasons why we had you on vance for the first ever d5 bull case podcast which actually is the for uh here's a fun piece of bankless trivia is the podcast that held the number one most downloaded podcast on bankless for the longest amount of time uh and it was because uh framework made these uh high conviction concentrated bets in link ave and synthetics i think all three if my memory serves me correctly so how are you trying to play the same pattern going into the next bull run like uh how are you thinking about these opportunities not that they're necessarily will be in d5 but perhaps some of them are but just going forward with this pattern of well while everyone else swears off tokens while everyone else is going one way perhaps it's the smartest thing to do just go go to the other way yeah because this time i'm going to listen to you not like 2019 so i forgot to so the there's there's kind of a difference between the public liquid world and the private you know startup world and you know our investment uh kind of process and strategy is is you know mostly the same across both scenarios but when things start to go into a bear market really the first things that crash are the liquid markets and you know you're at a point where tokens are down 90 95 percent that are all you know ethereum is down probably like 60 65 percent you're starting to get to the territory where you know the cash flows that are produced by these things you know they would indicate deep value and when you're trying to buy you know capitulation bottoms when you're trying to get into these things you know you usually size the bets smaller than you would like um but that's because when you're buying them they're usually so far down that there's some degree of like career risk to even being there even bidding and you know i think that's something that we've gotten comfortable with over the past cycle um and that we're going to do again um and so we feel confident about that but really the preconditions to us bidding on anything are like it has to have real cash flows it has to have a team that you know we know that unfortunately you know for some people it is docs and that we can interact with and that we can give feedback to and so for us we're on a hunt for a lot of those assets right now we're also continuing doing the private startup investing you know a lot of the intuitions that led us from defy are now leading us towards game phi and and that is an area where i generally do think it'll be the largest software market in existence and people have a really bad taste in their mouth from axi infinity from all the nft kind of like moon boy um and they just say that you know the games really can't ever be made they will never be interesting i just don't think that's true and i think we're gonna prove that wrong pretty soon um but overall you know the other thing that we're doing is just having conversations with founders and saying like you know how do we get you through this bear market how do we get you to product market fit and those are conversations that we haven't had to have in probably two and a half years and those make us better as investors those make the companies better what they do um but generally now is you know we've heard of of people being like thank god the bear market's here we're going to go on vacation and it's like man like the bull market for me is kind of where i have the most trouble thinking uh and the most trouble just like reading things and getting my head clear right now i feel like i am so clear and so i have so much clarity on where i think the space is going to go and i have the balance sheet to really go off and and you know fight the battles that i think are worth fighting and so a lot of what i'm doing right now is just figuring out uh you know how and when and what to build what to bid okay okay well we want to get into that and i also want to talk about game five but before we do let's stick with d5 for just a minute here okay because um i feel like d5 is um kind of at that moment where people think oh you know d5 at least from a token perspective will not recover uh it will never again appreciate relative to eth no like the complete opposite to what we were hearing uh you know a year ago or so or at the end of at the end of d5 summer where it was all about d5 tokens can you how you're thinking about d5 right now it's like how do you divide the d5 world i know you've talked before about horizontal versus vertical primitives interested to know what that means if that's how you divide the d5 world but what's going to survive and then what's going to resurrect on the other side of this what we want to know is like what's the synthetics link ave play like for this cycle without naming specific tokens but you can vance i like tell us what kind of categories you're looking at how you're shaping this up so broadly like i think the vertical categories of d5 can roughly be described as like the b2c categories of d5 and so things like amms things like derivatives exchanges things like barlene desks like those are the vertical primitives that came out right as d5 was starting and they got this huge head start and then what happened was they had all these competitors launched because it was relatively easy to fork and you had like you know the third largest barlene desk on the fifth most popular chain and it was like you know there was kind of like death by a thousand cuts and oftentimes these teams that launched after the defy you know ogs would get you know paid more in tokens they would you know kind of do things that were a little bit more self-serving and it really kind of like not only clouded the atmosphere of competition but it like kind of like demotivated these d5 1.0 teams what's happened since then in the d5 vertical land is that you know the incumbents the winners have kept winning the teams that have really not been in it for the right reasons have faded and now you have this environment in the d5 vertical primitives where a lot of the blue chips have the potential to just like pull themselves out of the spare market like you know ave like maker like synthetics like uh maple like you know there's going to be a lot of these categories where you have the right team they're generating cash flows and unfortunately like we're not all going to make it you know we're all going to make it probably like a 10th of the d5 protocols that exist today are going to make it but they're going to be huge as a result and i think what we've seen is that the rough probably order of magnitude that we're looking for in tvl for d5 is probably like 1 to 10 trillion we hit 100 billion this cycle it feels like we can get to a trillion probably the next one and if these people can take one percent of the fees of their tvl you know these are going to be decacorns and so that feels relatively obvious for me you see some something like the growth of a maple finance when compared to genesis they've done like a billion and a half of loan originations they're growing like 50 quarter of a quarter like they can get to that scale of genesis which has you know 130 billion loan originations a year fairly quickly um but it's not gonna be obvious you're gonna have to do a lot of research and frankly you're just gonna have to bet on the teams with the most longevity and so that's kind of like how i would think of d5 for the vertical you just give the case for d5 blue chips though vance i want to be clear i d in a way in a way yes and like you know d gen spartan called for an 18 month or sorry a 36 month bear market for d5 almost like a year and a half ago and when he started doing this meme i was just kind of like like man like you're going to do us like that but you know he was he was he was right you know and he was right for a couple reasons the first one is just like we needed to weed out all of the competitors and and this and the second reason is just like we need to figure out which teams have longevity which teams have product market fit and it feels like we're reaching the point where that is true and so i'm not going to say it's going to be another 18 months but it feels like we're going to have the winners at least sorted out in the next you know six months and so that's kind of how i think of the d5 vertical primitives but what about on d5 verticals still what about this multi-chain world like will we have another question in my mind will we have geographic winners like because if you're gonna bet on the the obvious and the compounds of the world or even the maples of the world um you know expanding beyond ethereum to all of these other layer twos maybe alternative layer ones uh is that going to be are they going to be able to scale in that way or do you think you'll have regional competitors right yeah on avalanche you have trader joe rather than uniswap for example how do you think that shakes out yeah i mean obviously not not financial advice all of all this podcast but uh like i think to the extent that these you know teams can go off and find new asset markets on these new chains they will and to the extent that there's like captive you know consumers on these chains i think they will go there but my sense is that you know people are going to be more drawn towards these d5 primitives because of their brand and also because of what i think is coming next for a lot of them which is like building up their own wallets building out their own front ends building out their own attract to consumer brands like it won't be about which chain you're on it'll just be about like what your brand is and what your connection to the end user is and so going forward i see moving on to new chains is less of a catalyst than just like executing really well and building out your top of funnel interesting um so that's kind of at least what i think all right so that's the vertical piece what's the horizontal piece then yeah so the horizontal piece is more of like the b2b side and so like these are things that transcend blockchains that transcend use cases that transcend you know customers even like and i think about it kind of like as an order book at the very top of the order book i think of things like payment for order flow and these are protocols that really haven't been launched in crypto yet things that like can plug into wallets give them out of the box monetization give their users cheaper fees and that can kind of like live across all wallets all uis as an abstraction layer for dexes so i think that's relatively interesting at the very bottom of the order book i think of things like mev and you know protocols like flashbots or protocols like gito onslana like those are the things which are more about like who has the rights the flow of the most complex transactions that are probably the most profitable um and so i think those are very interesting and then somewhere in the middle of those i think you know you have staking protocols decentralized derivatives like lido um decentralized derivatives like swell and rocket pool those are things which are just kind of like going to ride the trend of staking to you know what we think is a very large outcome um and you look at lido and they're probably making you know a mill you know a mill and a half every few days like these are real revenue producing protocols and i think they're just riding the transaction p wave that's currently happening on ethereum and other chains and they'll be successful as a result and that's where like we haven't had as much experimentation all the d5 vertical primitives have had a ton of competitors a ton of competition a ton of just like shaking out of the market the horizontal ones like we haven't seen a ton of competition we haven't seen how these markets shake out and so that's kind of where i think you know the the d5 1.0 vertical primitives are gonna have to really pull themselves out i think the horizontal primitives are still in a little bit of a horse race between themselves as to like how the eventual market actually shakes so you think that there might be a second class of competitors in the staking and mev world specifically uh coming is that the case yeah i think i think we'll see you know coinbase institutional launch and take you know a lot of the market i think we'll see you know natural demands for you know diversity of staking derivatives result in it not being a winner take all market um and i think we're going to see the same thing on the mev side um and so like it feels like they're entering the space where like you know where d5 was in like 2020 summer where like all the competitors just came out of the woodwork i think that's what we're gonna see on that side one last question to round out the this d5 conversation uh if we take dj spartan's timeline uh he said 36 months 18 months ago that gives us about a year left uh and the there's just this and i do subscribe to the idea that some very dominant winners are going to emerge and they are probably in that case in that world extremely underpriced at this moment but also at the same time you know what else is underpriced is eth and so within one year we will certainly be in a post-merge world uh and so this is uh the inevitable question of like d5 tokens are bullish dollars and ether is also bullish dollars but our defied token still bullish ether so fans when you make when you allocate capital into tokens how do you consider the contrary which is ether and how how do you like weight do these things and do you do you focus on price performance versus dollars or versus ether and how do you balance out these two by the way this is another debate david and i have been having so please settle this one for us too yeah um i think there's certain things that are levered to ethereum if you think about like the growth of the underlying fee market for an application and so like a good example of this is like a staking derivative you know that's like perfectly levered one-to-one with ethereum where you know something like lido which has a third of the market share you know if eth gets to ten thousand dollars you know lido might be making like high nine figures of revenue per year and that could mean and imply just like a more explosive growth opportunity than ether itself um so that's like one that's like obviously directly correlated to to ether and and like most of the horizontal primitives like staking derivatives like mev i would expect those things to be you know highly levered to ethereum and you know have the potential to outperform the vertical primitives or more based on just like is the management team executing like you know it doesn't matter you know that like maple and eth like they aren't really related in many ways other than you know is maple able to get more borrowers more lenders on chain are they able to execute and move faster and how big is the market opportunity and you know you kind of need to answer that for each one of the vertical primitives but the answers are more surprising than you might think just because look at something like maple it's at about four or 500 million look at something like ethereum it's at around 230 billion the amount of capital that's required to move each of these outcomes is much much different um and so that's where you get the basis of outperformance from if this starts to move in the right direction and so i've i've seen the charts i've seen the default charts like i have my eyes open um you know i've seen those going down for the past 18 months um impossible to tell if there's a bottom or when it'll happen but if you just look at the individual projects you know for us and this is what we do all day the research is pretty compelling and that you know there are sources about performance that you can find um it just might not be in the most obvious places and it might be in the private markets and it might be in the public markets and things that are beaten down um but that's the great thing about crypto it's like you know you always have a chance to to kind of do your diligence and do your research and and find something that maybe not everyone else does switching gears here to a new conversation uh vance uh from following your tweets and chatting with you at permissionless it seems to be you're going down the game five rabbit hole uh but listeners might get that okay like an axe infinity type game fi or just like a eluvium type game five but from what i've gathered what you're up to is you've done some like deep research about the actual structure of trad gaming and that whole ecosystem and you're seeing a lot of potential for trad gaming to be disrupted by crypto in ways that are different than just like an economic game like axi or like whatever the listener might uh imagine when i say the word game fi so when you hear when you hear the word game fi what do you think and how how does the how is game fight going to disrupt and what is the path for game fight to disrupt the current gaming status quo sure so you know in you know we all lived a a time where we were putting discs into consoles and paying 60 for them and that seemed like a pretty fair deal and you know that was what was known as like proper games and then we had free to play games and you know when those came out the candy crushes people said that these aren't real games and you know how could you how could you put these out as something that really isn't even in this paradigm but you know today the free to play games industry is generating probably 80 or 90 of the revenue in the entire game industry so if you look at something like activision blizzard you know what they're doing is they're taking all the profits from these free-to-play games and investing them in these awful console titles that they think have like a brand halo and the games industry is is largely broken over the past 20 years all the indies have pretty much died all you know basically it's just been a story of consolidation um all of the free to play games now rely on you know basically in-app advertising for any monetization and with the cutoff of idfa really what you have is the breaking of their business models and idfa is basically the unique identifier that game developers use to track users across multiple different applications and sessions and so really you know the ops the the opportunities for game developers right now are sell your title to a major studio and some really kind of shitty earn out deal or try to chase down this monetization opportunity of ads which is increasingly deteriorating and so all roads for these developers kind of lead to crypto where people are excited there's lots of funding you know you can actually build things that are relatively interesting and outside of the scope of just like the traditional games that you're supposed to build and so we see a lot of kind of like bottoms up people just coming into the industry and from the top down the metrics are fairly clear there's three billion people who play games a year there's 1.5 billion people who make less than five dollars a day and these people are gonna be the first users to play during games and you know obviously the traditional gaming establishment has been pushing back and will continue to push back because these are not deemed as real games and the financialization of games is largely a taboo but you know for us there's global distribution of wallets tokens is a new design space for growth you know dows that own the assets and the community which can take part in the upside of the game these are things that if you build a good game these should work and so i feel like it's kind of like the bell curve meme where like people in the middle of the bell curve say like the games are too complicated you can never build them they'll never be valuable but on both sides of the bell curve you know the really smart guy and the really dumb guy are kind of like you know games on crypto is just like fun and i think that's going to be the base case for where we're going is like it's not going to be play to earn it's going to be play and earn and even if you're able to increase the economics of an industry that's you know hundreds of billions you know 20 30 40 percent you know that's just like such a fundamentally constructive thing that you're going to see a lot of activity as a result and so we've been investing in a ton of single titles we've been investing in a ton of gaming infrastructure and just like last time you know everyone thought tokens were bad and d5 would never happen like just because you saw that at the very tail end of the bull mark of 2017 when the ico froth get out of control we're seeing it same thing here but axi is now the poster child for like the malfeasance and how this could never work you know it's just a cat game um but betting against that stuff is always good and when you've hit a taboo that people feel very sensitive about that's usually a good sign that you're on on the right path to something that might be successful yeah that that's exactly where where my head went where in 2017 all the icos that went to xero in hindsight it makes total sense and then when we look at like the tokens that came out of that bear market uh synthetics of a link they weren't like the tokens that went to zero they were fundamentally different they were an order of magnitude improvement upon the previous systems and if you could just look at the previous ico tokens and then use your imagination about how these might be improved you might get something like link ave and synthetics and i think we can take that same example with uh with axi and say like okay actually it had this blowout success and it succeeded for some of the metrics that you illustrated there's uh billions of people out there living on less than five dollars a day who have access to a smartphone or or a way to play a game and like you don't really have to get too creative after that to assume like well there's a lot of latent potential here uh and so i'm i'm wondering what what were the lessons that we learned uh in 2021 game five with like act why axe he succeeded why game five succeeded that are illustrative of why as soon as we figure out what is the next upgrade to game phi uh how like with the dynamics that will actually turn game vi into a real sustainable thing in the same way that d5 became sustainable post the ico mania so like what are the fundamentals in the world of both gaming and crypto that is ultimately going to drive game fi moving forward in the next year or so i think the first thing and and this isn't necessarily learning from 2021 this is just like learning just from thinking about it and talking to game developers about how they might use these crypto economic primitives it's just like true free to play is is really possible for the first time ever with crypto and what that means is like you play candy crush you get a couple levels in they'll make you buy more you know gems or diamonds or castles or whatever um it's not really a free-to-play game it's like a freemium game where once you get certain past a certain point like then you have to pay with true free to play games what i kind of mean by this is you can give someone a short a shield nft and you don't need to charge them the only thing that you need to charge for is every single time that changes hands you know the money goes into a communal treasury and that makes for the first time true free to play gameplay actually possible and and so that like is is one that kind of runs counter to the learnings of axi where like you know people were paying for the cats and they had to like you know go through the game and pay more like i think that that's going to go away and what crypto gives you is actually an ability to charge people less rather than more in a communal economic setting and so that's kind of the first thing that i think you know i'm taking away from this the second one is just like the business model for game developers is probably going to be somewhere between you know earning money on the velocity of secondary market transactions and just owning the vertical stack of you know your own your own l2 which has its own token which creates value from the game like those are going to be the new business models of these games rather than anything advertising based um and that's kind of i think another fundamental learning the last one i would say is just like these games need to be fun you know the reason axie didn't go anywhere is just because the entire economy was based on kind of like defy esque and like bad d5s like ponzi economics where you know there really wasn't a path where this didn't unwind uh you know not gracefully and so for us like the things that we see now and it's always a little bit strange when you're out of your your comfort zone like we're talking to indie developers that are building first-person shooters you know real-time strategy games mobas like things that really have nothing to do with crypto and we're helping them weave the crypto elements into it and what we're learning is there's some things that we should you know take and there's probably some things that we should leave and maybe this idea of like this open reflexive economy is powerful but you really need to leg into it and be you know cognizant of when you really put that into the game's economics and design um and so for us it's like these things are going to take a long time to really find their footing but that's not to say that they'll never get there it just might take nine months and we're just being patient with it overall you know we're not expecting these things to launch overnight and become smash hits um there's a long road for games and you know it's just gonna take a while vince do you think the opportunities are in the like the private primarily in the private space right like all kind of uh accredited investors sort of you gotta fund the game and you know retail doesn't necessarily have access to that or uh do you think some of these are are closer to public that there will actually be tokens that um you know people can invest in i mean quite famously the last bear market you know 2018 uh was a fantastic time to buy some some link or snx or or you know lend um but i'm wondering if the game fi market is structured differently the game bar market's structured differently right now because there's no there's no you know it's only axi you know if you want to go buy axi down a lot you know you can certainly do that you know i'm not as strongly convicted that that's where the future this is going to be it's more so right now on the private side with gaming because all these things are literally just getting started um probably in a year you're going to have 100 200 games that exist and you'll be able to kind of you know categorize them you'll be able to separate them in terms of which management team is good or not you'll be able to see what the cash flows are for each and that feels like probably the optimal time to be you know in a position where you're actually making an investment decision around you know what do i believe the most in right now there's just not a bevy of choices and i think that's more reflective of just where the industry is i think you know if you look at the landscape of of opportunities right now and you look at defy that's where there's the most dispersion there's the biggest difference between the best and the worst team there's the biggest difference between the fees that one's generating versus the other and there's a difference between their future trajectory and so i think like right now you know again not financial advice but you know that's where frankly most of the opportunities should be just because d5 is a more mature category than anything else with the most competitors that are the most public uh with the most tokens that are down the most from their all-time highs it doesn't defy just become game 5's like banking system essentially i mean aren't these markets tied together at the end of the day i mean if you want to trade your skin or your token your game fight token you're gonna do that on uniswap right yeah i mean you just want like this is like you know this is kind of the uh the tension right you know d5 is gonna be this huge top of funnel retail you know magnet and d5 is going to have to kind of like shuffle and get closer to that you know if you're uniswap you're trying to get integrated with the gaming wallets that are coming out you're trying to get you know on immutable x so you can get the the flow from you know alluvium you're trying to kind of position yourself closer to these opportunities because i think we're moving to a point where d5 has historically been both the means and the ends but now it's probably just going to be the means to an end of participating in things that retail would do anyways um and in a lot of ways defy like every use case on a blockchain is defy and d5 will need to kind of just move closer to these topic funnel retail use cases to to become as large as it possibly could be it's just an interesting concept to me that like maybe for some people out there the best way to get exposure to game fight is actually by way of defy or even like more concretely by way of uh ether or buying some other layer two block space uh to bet on the future it's it's sort of like you don't necessarily have to go and do the due diligence to figure out the specific game that's gonna you know do do 100x and onboard millions of users uh you can just buy into the crypto use case i i think that's you know the uh that's what makes it so interesting and also so hard you have to figure out what layer of abstraction to play at um because like you can you can buy the token of the game and you can be 100 in on that fee base and it turns out to be zero or you can take more of a platform approach where you're hedged across multiple games multiple outcomes and you're just holding eth but maybe you don't have access to all the upside but you know when when everything is down as far as it is right now that's when you can really actually make an informed decision about what's powerful versus what is not in an atmosphere that's relatively calm and so i do think this is kind of a gift in many ways i would be very concerned if we went straight to 10k and you know the board yacht club people were like all billionaires and like i don't think that we're ready for that timeline necessarily um i think we're in a much stronger position to kind of get to these areas at a time when the technology and the product progress is requisite with the hype and the you know price points so yeah something that has uh fascinated me as a result of the 2021 bull market is especially with nfts is this like relationship between the growth of crypto and nfts and also human like culture right all of a sudden like we are funding and spawning new forms of art that we were never really able to do before uh and this very much is relevant to the gaming industry which has really just like consolidated and really made the indie gaming the true uh game artists of the world rather than like the game profiteers of the world like ea for example there's like this massive part of the gaming world that are they're here to make cool games and they are not willing to compromise on that at all they want to make cool games with cool art with cool gameplay and they will sacrifice profitability in the name of the art but being in that cohort of the gaming world in the last like 10 years has not uh been awesome for you it's been very very hard to be an indie gamer and i'm wondering if there's a if there's something here where if nfts can like recreate like a renaissance level of human creativity and human flourishing if we can apply that same sort of mental model uh towards the gaming industry and you have any thoughts on that yeah i think like one of the uh like when i first started going very deep on gaming i just like flew to europe and and uh there's certain countries in europe which are very hot gaming hot spots and i just like talked to a lot of the indie studios there and it was kind of funny like you walk into these gaming studios and there's like 200 people working there and you know and and you know they're not getting paid very much uh they're doing it mostly out of the love of of games that they have and you know they have a love for game they're not getting really paid that much because the outcomes aren't that large and really kind of they're just hyper sensitive around you know things that would make the game unpure or you know like corrupt its values just to be on crypto and you know that was frankly the first couple months of just like explaining these people that you don't have to you know kind of like prostitute your values um to make something interesting in crypto you can do it from first principles you can build the game that you want to build and you can make it even more interesting as a result just by incorporating these primitives and so for us like you know that is the ground truth of most of these indie game studios is that most of them hate crypto um and you know pulling them forward to kind of understand and see the light and understand why that crypto is not just purely evil was kind of like the first order of business that we did with most of the studios that we invested in um and so for us like that is like the ground truth of what's happening right now and we're just starting to convert these people into true believers and have them accept that you know you can build the game you want you just have global wall distribution you have nfts the players own and you have a fungible token that you can integrate if you want to really bootstrap the game but we're not asking you to do anything that would really compromise your values it's just an extension of that and so you know that is like the ground truth of what these game studios are right now um yeah this has been so much fun vance um you know the theme of this episode i think we carried it forward to the end has been uh you know crypto in the bear market you said a line that i think is really important is um this really is a gift look at every bear market as a gift this is the gift of the bear market and we talked about so many opportunities that are available for for those who persist to those who build who those who who settle for those who are long-term oriented uh for those who have maybe some cash available or some time to spend during the bear market these things are very important this is the time uh and it's a gift uh to each and every one of you who are listening uh vance i want to maybe end with this uh tweet because i think it was you know some wisdom you were dropping as well some you know bear market wisdom that we all need to hear i'm going to read it out and you said this a very wise man once told me that you don't measure net worth peak to peak across cycles you measure it trough to trough this has stuck with me not peak to peak trough to trough tell us what that means yeah so in in the first framework fund there were three investors and michael and i were two of them and and the guy who told me this this line was actually the only other outside investor and this is someone who you know we've like is one of our mentors and and you know is one of our close friends um and he's a very uh legendary hedge fund guy kind of leave it at that um and he's someone who's seen multiple cycles where he's been up 100 x and then he's been down 95 percent and and really you know the idea that you know it's not about kind of like you know looking back at your net worth from like you know the absolute you know bottom of the of the of the barrel and you can't even really see it it's about kind of like every single time the market turns you're gonna lose money the only thing that matters is that you're making incremental progress off of your last base you have a better understanding of the space and you have a better playbook for how to you know move going forward and for us as long as that's been the case i haven't really ever felt nervous the only times i really feel nervous are when things are super frothy and we aren't making requisite tech progress um and so generally i think that you know if your net worth is only visible with binoculars your peak net worth um that's okay um the bear market is going to last as long as it kind of needs to but the only thing is that losing money is bad losing your conviction or getting wrong-footed about how you feel about the space is worse and as long as that the case you know the troughs will keep getting higher and you'll be okay so that's kind of how i think about it and you know everyone's gotten hit us included but you know conviction is not wavered and we're ready to make the most of this period of time a great way to end it uh vance spencer thank you so much a reminder to bankless listeners the the last trough for eth was about 80 so we're still a ways from that and we'll see where this uh bear market trough ends up uh vince spencer's thank you so much for joining us it's always a pleasure great thanks a lot guys guys no big action items for you except for listen that episode again all right i think there are a lot of opportunities hidden in that episode once again vance spencer and this hema framework were some of the main folks who identified these opportunities back in 2019 back when i didn't even believe them i was very bullish on uh ether and ethereum as an ecosystem but i didn't know the potential of tokens and vance saw it then so i think he's probably seeing some things now but of course as always there's a there's a reason why vance is basically a reoccurring segment on the basis that's right this being as always to be clear none of this has been financial advice you'll never hear that sort of talk on bank list crypto is risky eth is risky so are all the defy assets in game fi you could lose what you put in but
