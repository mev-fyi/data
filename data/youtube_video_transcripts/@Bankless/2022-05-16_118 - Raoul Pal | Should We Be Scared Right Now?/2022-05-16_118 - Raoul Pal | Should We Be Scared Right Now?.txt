I mean everybody I think in every position is about to lose money welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Chad Adams here and I'm with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys the big question on our minds it's Raul Paul the macro guy the crypto investor is this should we be scared right now Raul that was our question for him this is the uh Hold Me I'm Scared episode it is and uh you know he didn't pull any punches we talked about a few things to look for number one all of the scary things going on in the world right now inflation recession China covid stock market crypto prices even UST and what's happening in the tarot ecosystem we talked about the way we're actually going to get out of this if there is a light at the end of the tunnel I don't know if I should have used that phraseology that's like when you die right but is there some hopeful uh Blue Skies Ahead that was our question for our for Raul and then finally because he is a macro investor what is he how is he playing this Market has he changed his crypto portfolio at all has he traded various assets for others what that looks like so is a great conversation with Raul we're glad we had him I think the timing of this was just perfect we thought we might be going into this episode talking a bit about the upcoming eth merge but since the market has turned uh so dark lately in crypto and in the world this turned into a should we be scared episode what were some of your thoughts David yeah it was actually pretty surreal having this conversation with Raul as I was watching UST Depot it was like trying to watch a train wreck while I was doing a podcast I was trying to keep my eyes keep my attention on the podcast with Raul while I'm watching the UST price just completely fall off of a dollar so we had we had to talk about that so that timing was pretty crazy um but overall just like Raul paints a really dark picture not necessarily for assets but just for this state of um find like the economy uh he's actually calling for uh the re like bringing back stimmy checks not because we have this covet thing but because we have a recession coming uh and just the nature of the uh the tight spot that the FED finds itself in he thinks that the the people need to put get money in their bank accounts in order to just live and so this is not and this is not paying people to stay home because there's a disease out there there is people need to receive money because they have bills to pay and they don't have the cash to do it uh so that was that was a surprise to me but um Raul says that the Europe is already doing this and so he thinks that Europe is foreshadowing things to come from America things come from America so he plays a really dark picture Ryan whether or not that that translates into assets going up or down it's a different story I guess that was a dark picture but that was actually part of his like um way we get out of this picture because he he said that the FED has not abandoned us the the safety net has not been taken it's still there it's just maybe a a little bit lower than it than it used to be and so the FED will return in the way central banks get out of this is is more printing of money this time in the form of of stimulus checks so it's dark at first but he's not painting a picture of uh the fed and the central banks completely abandoning this Market because he makes a pretty compelling case for why they actually can't you have to listen to the episode and hear more of that David I think during the debrief today I want to talk to you a bit more about this Terra UST thing and where you think markets are going have a conversation about that so that'll be fun yeah and uh also Brian and I are in uh debate as to we have some some cash on the bank list reserves and so we're in debate as to whether we buy now or buy later so I think we'll finish that conversation in the debrief yeah and so that's that's a good question I think that's on everyone's Minds is if you have some cash and that's really where Raul ends the podcast is do you buy now where do you buy later if you're a premium subscriber of course you can unlock the debrief where David and I are about to get into that heated debate how much more this is where we buy David so guys uh stay tuned for that and of course we're gonna get right into the episode with Raul but before we do we want to tell you about these

this is just we're starting the big liquidation phase in pretty much everything um I'm looking at stuff like like galaxies down 25 today oof I mean Nova can't be very happy about that he probably has to send the keys back on his yacht or something but um it's a mess you've seen what's going on with the Terra ecosystem as well I mean they're actively selling Bitcoin you know I hear yo jump in that whole equation is selling ethereum we've got that's just liquidation of everything and it's interesting because it's spilling out into the macro world as well obviously it's like stuff like oil which was like the last thing that was holding up the inflation narrative is starting to get properly clocked I think I mean everybody I think in every position is about to lose money oh my God this is this is a red red day guys we we're just hitting the record on this button Raul Paul is joining us for a bankless podcast of course we don't have to introduce Raul he's been on the podcast many times uh he's the founder of real Vision one of our favorite voices in the space of macro uh and it's been about nine months since we had you on last time Raul and it was not a [ __ ] show I think like it was different then things were feeling a little bullish at that time so I think we want to unpack all of this and I think look the theme of the today's episode is uh fear is like there's some scary stuff going on so I think we want to start there with some of the scary stuff but then also want to pick your brain on like how do we possibly get out of it and also find out how you're playing this uh whether you saw it coming what's uh yeah what's in the back of your mind but can we start there with some of the scary stuff you're starting to get into it in the crypto ecosystem um but what about like the big macro scare that I feel like is on everyone's mind which is this inflation thing so so inflation we've had this really complicated macro situation where we had supply chain shocks which was people can get factories and ships sorted out because people were still in lockdown with covid there was a massive backlog of orders and this filtered through and that raised prices because everyone you know if there's a shortage of goods if you pay more you get the goods right so that rise that puts prices up then we start to see issues in the commodity sector that have under invested so everybody comes online again everybody wants oil gas everything else so commodity prices start exploding then we add on a Russia Ukraine war and the penalties on Russia and that takes a bunch of Commodities out of the market so now we're in this perfect storm of prices rising but people have also scrambling like all of us probably you guys as well to try and hire people so we're all bidding up wages but wages outside of some jobs aren't Rising as much as prices so what we've got is the situation where wages have gone up let's say four and a half percent and prices have risen eight and a half percent so everyone's taking a four and a half percent of four percent haircut in their net worth now that hit crypto it started as soon as inflation happened because if you think of crypto as a Groundswell movement basically the dollar cost averaging by average people are in the space had started drying up we saw all the on-chain activity basically flatten out and we've been in this sideways sloppy range because we've seen no network growth across the entire ecosystem within crypto we talk about that later but so that slowed down there but we still had the kind of after effects of stimulus people coming online so economies were growing but it now looks like all the forward-looking indicators are starting to roll over and start to show recession because you've basically given everybody a income haircut so discretionary spending is going down the toilet we're seeing in things like restaurant spend we've seen Consumer Credit going up so people are desperately trying to borrow money to maintain their expenditure plans we've seen mortgages go up by the most in history as a percentage um I mean they've absolutely exploded higher we've seen two-year interest rates with the largest one-year rate of change in all recorded history we've seen so what we've got if you add all of these things and we're seeing the US dollar going up fast when you put these things together what you've got is the fastest tightening of monetary conditions in history and we've seen it the big tech companies all start to lay off staff they're all like holy [ __ ] even Amazon said we're over staffed so we've completely turned the economy from oh great we're coming out of recession from the pandemic to oh my God we're going straight back into recession the Market's tightened before the FED even got around to doing it the market did its job and it stopped economic growth dead in its tracks Europe's already in recession China looks like it's in recession and is in lockdown again to complicate the picture we don't know what that means for Supply chains so we might have these I think inflation Falls and I think the FED pivot soon it's like 2018 but 2018 the s p was down 22 it's only down about 15 16 now so I think there's more pain to come before the FED suddenly realized that growth's gone and the bond market will tell us that first it always does it will yields will start falling and that'll be probably the signal as we had in 2018 crypto stabilizes uh the growth end of equity starts stabilizing because they realize that some stimulus is coming and so there's a little sorry there's a lot a bit of a monologue but there's a lot to get through now if inflation is still high ish because it's going to take a while to come down but I think it comes down pretty fast but let's say it's still at five percent and the economy is now headed directly into a recession what do the FED do well they're unlikely to purely stimulate it because optically that doesn't look right so my guess is they'll do what Europe's starting to do and Japan's starting to do which is direct transfer payments that I've been talking about for a while which is basically mmt so I you give money to the people who need it to cover the costs of their bills going up um and you basically Finance it by buying bonds so I think we're going to see stimulus coming faster than people expect in certain parts of the economy in Europe they're doing it for corporations who've got high energy prices and they're doing it to households Japan's doing it to households as well so it's coming so there's a lot there's this transition from inflation to demand destruction to stimulus that cycle is in play so how much of this is really just the equal and opposite response to the The Roaring 20s that were the meme in the early 2020s where stimmy checks were getting put out people had more cash on hand than they've ever had ever uh like the and crypto that's when the crypto markets when uh absolutely gangbusters that's where ether went from like 400 up to four thousand Bitcoin reach all-time Highs are are we just on the equal and opposite side of that we're like now tech stocks Amazon like the NASDAQ we are back down to where we were before we started doing all of these things so are is this just a natural consequence of just like what we committed to when we handed out stimuli checks and and stimulus plans way back when or is this something more complicated than that um it part that and part the other issues but I guess you know the equal and opposite was Supply chains there were you know we shut down everything and then everything comes back on stream the best example I've got of this a lot of people go back to the 1970s and say that it's this all over again but the 1970s was very different because it was driven by demographics as well you know you had all of the Baby Boomers coming into the workforce all at the same time and they bid up prices this is actually more similar to coming out of World War II so World War II economic activity had shut down except for the war effort it comes on World War II finishes we start the great rebuilding what happens is that prices exploded economic growth plunged and then prices went negative economic growth events ends up stabilizing bond yields stayed stable between one and three percent for the next decade and a half economic growth was very strong because of technology and stimulus and that feels like a similar situation yeah we've got this massive rebuild of infrastructure Supply chains need to come back to the to locally so they have to build factories in the United States okay they're robots they're going to hire people but it's it's good for the economy we've got this massive Tech Revolution going on so we've got economic growth to come I think with relatively low inflation but you're right this is the equal and opposite effects of what we've just seen which was the sharpest fastest slowdown in history we've now got the sharpest fastest rise in history and that will probably get Unwound as well so it's like dropping a rubber ball off the top of a building each one of these will get less but I think we've got a few more of these Cycles to get through hey I'm just struck by how fast this is happening and and like how quickly the Whiplash has been and I'm wondering if we we've seen that at any time in history if this is a historic moment so it used to be so we've just come through what's known as the great moderation so the great moderation basically started in about 1990 and that's when we start using interest rates as the main tool to manage the economy and so what happened is we dampened the business cycle so as soon as the economy got too weak we would cut rates and then when it got too strong um we would raise rates but generally the rate of interest was going down over time because of demographics and debt but it drew out the business cycle the Cycles were longer and they were less violent then we started the first After Shock which was 2008. but we still managed to moderate why because we started the central use of the central bank balance sheet that was the next thing then the covered shock came and I think it broke all of this now so we've now really don't have any interest rates I don't know what the FED are going to get to maybe they get to two and a half percent I don't know but they're not going to get anywhere back to where they would like to have got to what's perceived normal so we don't really have interest rates to use and we've got the balance sheet but we know the downside of the balance sheet so if we go back to previous periods before the great moderation the economic cycle used to be a three-year whiplash and actually it was better because you added market clearing event more often so we didn't build up the imbalances as much as we did from the great moderation the great moderation basically meant that you could use assets as collateral for debt because they were generally all low volatile so that the less volatile it is the more you can borrow this is kind of breaking some of that so you know do we see a great deleveraging who knows I don't think we can afford to because it's gone too far because that's the end of the entire system so it's a it's a really complicated picture um but I think we end up with negative real interest rates ongoing um onward use of stimulus maybe in a more targeted approach um because we can't allow the debt bust which is why the federal pivot soon they'll have to what do you mean by the debt bus travel well so the world is the most indebted it's ever been as a percentage of world GDP the US is the most indebted country as a potential world GDP of any country in all economic history all of that is against the collateral so you borrow money against something so you borrow money against your shareholdings you borrow money against bonds you borrow money against your house so if you allow the price of those assets to fall too far your debt gets liquidated and we can't allow that because it's too big I mean these are hundreds of percent of GDP so you basically could destroy everything so that's why we need to be super careful that's why the central banks panic and buy things like if you look at the uh in the pandemic they started buying mortgage bonds and they bought corporate debt it's because if you allow that stuff to go bust the whole system's blown up that's nearly what happened in 2008 so they can't allow it which is why we're in this weird mess where they keep debasing the currency because that's the only answer they've got which is one of the reasons that we all own crypto so I want to pick your brain as to what you think this Market actually hinges on I I think the the most people think that the FED is trying to thread the needle on uh reducing inflation while not triggering a recession uh and so they're trying to find that Gap to shoot is that window even open like is that even a thing that they can do and if it's not like what is the consequence of that I think the markets have done it for them so the FED have raised virtually nothing and meanwhile bond yields have absolutely exploded so they've done all the tightening so we'll borrow in the real world we don't borrow off the fed you know so your mortgage or any debt you take out it's gonna be based on the actual market so that tightening's happened and the Slowdown is coming and the FED really weren't involved in any of this which is kind of the free market working its own way um so it kind of did work and there's no way of stopping it it's just going to play out in the way that it has to play out which is demand destruction needs to stop the price of Commodities Rising which brings down inflation which brings down interest rates that allows us to get back to normality last weekend the uh the weekly roll-up we presented this graphic that Illustrated the personal disposable income uh of the average person in like during during covet it spiked to all-time highs never seen before uh and right now it's at all time lows never ever seen before uh and so like I think that goes to what you're saying where like demand has largely been destroyed like everyone's broke uh we've lost all like the the stock markets down like there's no cash uh and so like demand is probably going going to zero which is what the FED wants uh and so if if in order to get out of this in order to get out of this like bear Market cycle this this cycle of pain does the FED just need to realize that they achieved their goals and then perhaps like we could hopefully see like the CPI AI not get any worse to give the FED some sort of assurances that their goals have been achieved that's exactly it and I think the phasing of this is I think the oil Market needs to break because that's the headline inflation thing that real rates have been following and it feels like it's starting to happen now but it needs to break a bit lower and then you know if the oil Market comes down to 70 or so that's going to ease a lot of people's fears because this Russian fear is in everybody's Minds here the oil market so if that happens I think that happens first the dollar is helping bring down inflation the next part is the bond market will tell us it always does the bond market much like 2018 there was that final panic in 2018 in December 2018 where the equity Market puked we had higher inflation the dollar was going up then the oil Market broke and then finally yield started rallying and that was the signal that the FED were going to Pivot because the bond market does the job for them so if the bond market raised the rates the bond market is going to ease them too but it's just not got there yet so it's very close and I think we'll see so far we've been seeing yields going up and equities going down and soon we'll see equities going down and yields going down then we've got to the signal that we've probably that the Market's going to start pricing in the other side of the cycle which is the stimulus side so Raul you you think basically so you know maybe we need to see the oil markets break uh a bit more uh but you think kind of the last the last sign that we really need to see is a bond market rally correct and then when we see that then the fed's going to go power's going to go oh cool mission accomplished we were successful I am you know Paul volcker and now we're going to kind of reverse course and start easing things again they won't start easing they will just say we're just going to watch the economic situation right that's the the pause right first time for the pause and we're ready to raise rates if we see any sign you know so they stay hawkish but on pause but the bond market will just say we don't believe you because we know the economic demand Destruction has happened and what do you think the inflation rate will be do you think they will be able to actually break the back of inflation or were they so it's probably broken already we just don't already because inflation is a lagging indicator right so the year on year rate of change in oil has come down half what it was in the past of all Commodities has come down significantly so that's happening already so it's already baked into the numbers mathematically that the rate of inflation Falls it depends how fast it falls and some of the forward-looking indicators that I look at suggests it comes down really pretty sharply back down to you know three percent or so well when we go back to 2008 we had inflation at six and a half percent and the FED were cutting because economic growth had collapsed so we've got to get through these phases but usually what happens for risk assets particularly things that are influenced by inflation and interest rates which would be crypto and growth Tech they tend to start to stabilize and outperform at this point once the bond market turns because that's why they've been hit because of the future inflation expectations because they're long duration assets I think we want to talk about like tech stocks in in just a minute but I feel like I have there's still a few like fundamental kind of questions about the current state of of macro in the market right now just one question that's just been lingering my mind for for quite some time we had Dan more ahead from Pentair capital in the podcast and he talks a lot about the uh the bond market bubble from your perspective why is anyone buying bonds these days is something I haven't been able to wrap my head around like why who's buying bonds and why are people or institutions maybe let's say buying bonds so I think people get really confused around all of these topics people confuse inflation and debasement for starters so inflation is the rate of increasing prices and debasement is the devaluation of the purchasing power of a currency what most people are observing is debasement generally we've been observing that doesn't affect the bond market does the US go into default no does it increase the headline rate of inflation no the rate of inflation goes up because of what's just happened with Supply chains or in the 2000s it was because of China coming on the market as a demand shock that's what really changed inflation because structurally we got this aging population and high debt so you tend to get lower inflation over time so I don't think it's a bond market bubble it is a financialization bubble I.E a debt bubble but I think that drives interest rates lower not higher because what happens is you lower the trend rate of growth of the economy because of debt so each dollar of debt you take out the less increase in GDP you get for it so that's an over leveraged economy with a bunch of old people you can't generate that kind of thing you can't generate that kind of growth so I don't think that we're in a bond market bubble I think we're in a debt bubble that's a different thing you know is the US going to default on its debts well they're going to do it not by not paying them they're going to do it by debasing the currency which is a whole different issue um and so yeah so I don't agree with Dan um I don't think that the bond market becomes unhinged because the Central Bank just buys it and they just lower the value of their own currency so Japan has been doing that Japan has been buying its bond market to stop yields going too high and what happens is the end collapses what about another piece of the puzzle here is why is the dollar so strong these days can you fill us in on that so the dollar is a game of musical chairs it is a world massively in debt in dollar terms most trade is done in dollars so most borrowings are done in dollars in fact most of the world's lending is done by the euro dollar market which is the offshore dollar lending markets generally driven by the European Banks the Japanese Banks and some of the Asian Banks it's a game of musical chairs because the moments that growth slows down or growth is too fast generates when growth slows down when growth slows down people need dollar financing and there's less dollars in the system If the Fed are withdrawing liquidity right now there's less dollars so you take a few chairs away first one was Sri Lanka they're like where's my chair gone right and you'll see one country after another we're now seeing China starting to devalue its currency it's because part of their chair has been taken or what you know one of the chairs has been taken out of the room so that's what happens is there's too much dollar borrowings and in a Slowdown people need more debt and there's not enough debt being given out because the FED are taking Supply out of the market in the other side the dollar goes up it's the Dollar's got a smile so if the world is growing generally the US has been the kind of leading World economy in terms of where you want to put your Capital so in a growing world the dollar tends to do pretty well the dollar does very well in a slow world the dollar does terribly in a kind of muddle through reasonable growth world does is that that is true of course because you know it's so much the worldwide debt is denominated in dollars because the dollar has the world's Reserve currency status um when these Cycles play out does that tend to connect can that erode the position of the dollar over the kind of the longer term time horizon or how do you see that playing out does this this sort of you know it's shock to the system um diminish the dollars long term it's actually rebalances the system decently right it's the shock absorber because if the dollar goes up it stops other nations excess borrowings of dollars so it reduces the liabilities in dollars now you might have defaults to deal with but but it does that it also slows down inflation because the dollar itself is the denominator of all commodity prices so if the the nominator is going up then the price of the commodity goes down so it actually works as a balancing effect in many respects the flip side is people like China and Europe get pissed off with it because they are everybody's a function of the U.S liquidity and the dollar is used as a therefore economic weapon that's not in anybody's control which is why both China uh Europe and others have started to try and push back on the dominance of the dollar the Dominus the dollar is so incredibly dominant it's like 80 of world traders in dollars and they want it back to a more reasonable level that better represents the size of the US economy in the global picture so the U.S economy is what 25 of the global economy down from about 40 percent due to the rise of China and India and others so the the dollar should be 25 of global trade now it's the reserve currency so maybe 50 would be the right number but it's too much and people just don't like that Reliance on the dollar because it breaks other people's economies when something's going on in the US I mean macro's fascinating stuff right there's a lot that goes on yeah I mean it's uh yeah it's definitely tricky but can we go back to equities for a minute because um you know tech stocks were absolutely flying like during covid uh of course and now Amazon is back to April 2020. Netflix is back to 2017 prices tech stocks have have absolutely taken a beat down but I think the NASDAQ is back down to where the coveted dumps happened in March so the whole entire Market is at the bottom of the March dump just gave it right back yeah there you go we're giving it back to you but but you you seem to indicate that there might be some hopeful future of stocks for for stocks after we get through some of these next steps with uh with Powell and with the economy so it's technology specifically that I'm looking at we're in a period of the you know we know it from crypto but it applies to a lot of technologies that I Bunch together as the exponential age and you know a lot of what Kathy Wood looks at or a whole bunch of other people these are these Technologies like AI electric vehicles green energy space um robotics genetic Sciences you don't put the genie back in the bottle just because you raised interest rates the technology keeps moving forwards so what happens is they actually get cheaper over time if they're trading even sideways so much the same as crypto you need to put them into a nice logarithmic Channel and things like Amazon have been in a perfect logged Channel since it launched and it sometimes gets two standard deviations oversold and maybe three standard deviations oversold and that's usually the sign that you've had a capitulation unless the network is failing so Netflix right now we're questioning doesn't is Netflix a network or is it just a broadcaster where it's on demand broadcasting now if network if if Netflix developed a community and had a two-way relationship with these customers and maybe a Marketplace it will be valued differently so maybe this is an s-curve moment where we everybody questions is this going to survive or not and then it changes its business model or it fails but is Amazon going to fail here literally zero chance so what you're say what we're saying is the because of inflation these stocks are going to get cheap because of the interest rate backlog they're getting cheap but the ongoing adoption of technology is Relentless so therefore they're getting cheaper every day so we should be looking at entries exactly the same we did with crypto we look at these markets and if you've got spare money um then you want to be buying this kind of stuff and not selling this stuff because it's the same adoption model this network adoption model is everywhere and if you stack all of these things on top of each other all of these Technologies and there's there's a whole bunch of these things including crypto what you've got is a whole bunch of metcalf's laws piled on top of each other which is what's called Reed's law and it it's the fastest pace of change the human race I think will ever go to go through I mean it's an extraordinary period of time and you don't want to get knocked off that game because of what's the volatility in markets you know these things are inherently volatile um these logarithmic channels and network adoption models are volatile but you can't get knocked off your game for this because you're missing the big picture which is why it's so important not to use leverage in these Network adoption models because you don't want to get washed out at the wrong time so with the the state of the equities market right now like I said the NASDAQ being basically where it was in the depth of the worst part of March in 2020. now now we're back there but the difference is I don't we're not going to get the same sort of like Boost from the Federal Reserve we're not going to get the same level of like support uh from stimulus checks because like well now now covet is largely over where like in back then in March people couldn't go to work now people can actually go to work now right we actually have like a path forward to repairing the economy uh and now the equities markets is back to kind of where it was and so we had like these Roaring 20s where tech stocks and and non-debt assets really did really really well um but now we're kind of back into that place where we hoped we would have been had there not been a pandemic as in like we can actually move forward people can go back to work and and now like now that prices are back to the the bottom of the uh the the 20 the 2020 deaths like we can actually start to move forward now so this kind of seems like the markets actually resume and like life kind of resumes at this new level now that we've suffered all this pain is that is that right yeah but we're going to lay a bunch of people off as well so you say they go back to jobs I'm not entirely sure sure yes but at least at least like the economy can operate as normal right there's not a pandemic in the mix and so like the markets can finally clear just all of all a fair take yeah I think so and I think the point you raised right at the beginning about we're just gonna unwind everything that happened after the pandemic and then kind of reassess from there and that should be you know we are going to have a recession it's pretty clear that that's going to happen how much has that has been priced in well I just did you know the year-on-year rate of change of the s p i just put it up on Twitter um basically is a predictor for the ism which is the predictor for GDP and the s p is already pricing in a recession pretty much as are many things so it's kind of happening so therefore has the damage been done in the stock market already possibly and so therefore the next side of this is the easing cycle as I keep saying now it's not going to happen instantaneously we're going to walk in the FED are like oh we're just going to print another five trillion dollars but over time they're gonna have to stimulate again because the the economies brought back to where it was but as you said the whole thing has been Unwound and that's the same thing as the prices and Equity markets there was a uh yeah investor that I followed Eric Peters uh whom you probably know but I I read um his newsletter uh this this over the weekend and what he said was uh what we're seeing is the market pricing out the fed put we're all on our own now without a safety net it's a sobering reality a little bit like trading crypto do you think this is just the market sort of feeling like the FED doesn't have our back anymore the FED puts gone there's no safety net at least for some period of time until Powell and the FED sort of reverses course and adds that safety net everyone had this exact conversation in 2018. and guess what the FED putt came back really quick um so you know it we don't know what level of pain but we're getting close to the level of pain where the FED go well I'm not sure about this any longer the thing so you believe there's always a safety net there's never not been because of the point that I raised before you cannot allow the collateral to get destroyed because then the whole [ __ ] thing goes under so you can't so which is why I've pivoted my way of thinking about the world from I was always looking for the rally to sell the bear Market to trade and I actually think of the bull market to buy you know the bear Market to buy into because of the structure of how this is which is they can't let it go fall apart because that's the end of the banking system the pension system everything so it can't happen so they have to panic at some point if it goes far enough uh usually it's the credit Market that freaks them out the most so you know keep your eye on things like hyg um you know those kind of things that's what worries the fed the equity markets doable you know you can go down 40 percent and and not blow up all of the Leverage but the credit Market that's where it all lies so yeah I think the fed put has to be there because if not it's the end of the world well you've got four if debt is 400 of GDP I mean that's just gigantic how do you pay can you explain like I'm five that like why with obviously like debt to GDP ratio is relatively simple so I'll just explain it it's just like how much money does the economy make versus how much debt does it owe but can you explain why like if the fed put isn't there how that would blow up everything well it's again it's about if you think it in simple terms is you go and buy a house and you get a mortgage the mortgage is against the house the house is the collateral and you put some cash down now if you default on your if the house price goes down enough in the US you could just walk away from your mortgage right you hand the keys back and it becomes the bank's problem in Europe it's actually your problem the debt follows you so if you can't afford to pay your debts then you've got a huge problem and if your collateral Falls too much somebody comes to you and says you need more collateral to cover your debt so suddenly you're you borrowed a million dollars against a house and your house was worth a million dollars and suddenly it's worth five hundred thousand dollars the bank's gonna tap you on the shoulder and say we don't have enough money against this collateral against this loan that's the issue with collateral so if it falls too much then there's a mass liquidation now if you think of the collateral of the system the the biggest collateral of all is the US Treasury Market well that blew up then it's the the the credit markets and they're kind of starting to move and then the equity Market less because it's more volatile it's hard to borrow a lot of money against volatile assets as you guys know from crypto you can't borrow as much leverage as you can against a treasury bond where you can get kind of almost infinite leverage so you just don't want these things to blow up because then everybody has to ask for their money back and there's no money to pay for it and who who comes collecting like is it all of the other central banks basically collecting the market you know don't forget it's the bank that lent you money their risk manager is saying well we had this against it and now we need some more collateral you need to liquidate it's much like you know leverage in the stock market you know at some point or in the Futures Market at some point if your collateral is not enough they liquidate the position it's the same in crypto so it's not liquidated by some masterful Force scratching his beard saying I'm today I'm going to liquidate everybody it's just the it's just the cumulative effect of everybody who's lending money to the system does that now the FED is kind of doing it themselves right by by reducing the balance sheet they're saying we want to take liquidity out of the market so they're they're reducing the liquidity that's causing all of these ramifications and it's because the system is so levered that you can barely raise interest rates without everything falling apart so outside of the the fed and I guess the US economy when we look to kind of the the globe how about events like you mentioned um covered lockdowns in China there you know move towards a zero covid policy even still which is you know somewhat perplexing to people who are uh looking in the market but that seems to be going on also we have the Russian uh Ukraine conflict and that continues to rage on how much do these things impact uh World Markets right now in the macro picture a lot so obviously the Russia Ukraine had ramifications because a Ukraine is a large producer of grains and other foods and the economy is basically shut down right now and Russia got penalized and they are the world's largest they have more Commodities than any other Nation on Earth so you take some of those Commodities out of the system so that is what was driving prices higher which is causing demand destruction so that's you know this cycle of raising prices and then falling economy that goes with it the China situation is more complex so China is obviously the second biggest economy on Earth you've now shut it down again so that's destroyed demand from the global situation but they're also the largest supplier on Earth so now we've got a lack of Supply so could this feed into more inflation again this is the thing I'm scared of is what happens if this causes another rise in inflation inflation doesn't come down we're kind of really screwed then and this is when I don't think the governments have any choice but to start giving handouts to people who are worse off you know they'll kind of sacrifice the rich but they're going to have to save the poor and we're going into a U.S election the Europeans are already doing this as are the Japanese is they're going to have to say if you earn less than a hundred thousand dollars a year we're gonna give you a grand a month to help you pay your bills that's a stimulus check but unlike the covered stimulus check you're not at home with nothing to spend it on so you punt it on Robin Hood you're actually going to do it to pay your bills your electricity I mean uh you definitely want to talk about the way out here and it sounds like you're you're talking about the way out that many of these governments will take is is going to be more more stimulus direct to individual stimulus want to talk about that but while we're on the subject of uh I guess scary things that are going on I feel like we've we've covered macro sufficiently we've covered you know China we've covered equities we've covered the fed and the economy uh can we talk about scary things in crypto right now oh God the era of proof of stake is upon us

crypto right now oh God actually I think I think we want to start with uh with this because as we're recording um you know David has been monitoring this this all morning but yeah Ryan if you're I'm gonna I'll take over here yeah it's UST which we talked about I just interviewed doe this morning by the way my goodness well let's talk about that because he didn't he didn't give a lot away what's happening with UST price and Raul I don't know if you want to pull up a chart too yeah when you hopped into this uh recording room UST price was at 98 cents being defended uh do you know what it is right now no it's in 92 cents yeah so that's a billion dollars of stable coloring market cap that's gotten a race in the last uh 30 minutes uh and uh as a monitoring Twitter right now and uh the Luna guard the Luna Foundation that has the BTC has just sent their BTC outbound so they are probably in the process of liquidating Bitcoin 500 million yesterday I don't know but yeah you're the one that talked to do Quan more recently yeah so they liquidated 500 million yesterday um jump trading who is the market maker I think we're liquidating eth um and look I don't know how much lfg have but I think it's what three billion dollars of of um Bitcoin well what's happened is that never made it onto the Curve uh because they weren't set up with a four pool that were putting on curbs so they're just having to liquidate the position in the meantime so the Market's always going to test this stuff right this is what the markets do is you want to test the fragilities and this is an s-curve moment for the entire um algorithmic stable coin idea I mean all of them have failed so far um so let's see whether they survive it or not I mean I hope they do because it would be nice but it's not sure right yeah do you have any opinions on just like the systemic nature of Tara in this whole ecosystem because they're using non-terror assets like Bitcoin and avalanches also in their portfolio to defend the peg uh so like the the concerns that people are having is that they are going to dump the rest of the market before they have to dump their own assets well this is the Margin Call what I talked about right it's exactly the same thing um and so what's happened is the um they're now getting asked for their collateral bag I mean it's exactly what I talked about and it's going on this is what you expect to see at this phase you know this is a liquidation phase and that's when somebody Taps you on the shoulder and say I want your collateral back and you have to sell it so in this case it's the Bitcoin so can we is it buy time is that is the message here as in like the if we're interested in being the the counter trade on here is this just a buy indicator or is that too simple well depends who else has got to get liquidated somebody asked me this question it's like okay so this is the the known one what are the liquidations I mean obviously the market says do we need to go and test um micro strategies I don't know but that's a long way down I'd rather that didn't happen but you know who knows um you know because the markets seek these pain points you know they always take the path of pain and it's when everybody's Max bearish and fearful of everything as the market screams higher and nobody believes it you know this is just how psychology works so I don't know whether we're there yet but we're in the end phases you know I kind of feel like eth probably gets back down to 2000 um but yeah all well and done you know if we stand back from the drama of the markets Ethan Bitcoin putting their low well Bitcoin might make a new low but eth putting its low um when was it June July last year and we've thrown eight and a half percent inflation an oncoming recession we've thrown all sorts of stuff in the market didn't make a new low so it's this sloppy sideways range the internal Heath economy has been pretty good as we know from nfts and other stuff d5's been a bit quiet but um but nfts have you know been active so the youth economy itself's been good but the eth economy has not been growing I know new participants have come in but I think we're close to the final Liquidation in the technical indicators I've lot got I think we've got another month to go however and it can get ugly so it's interesting because this has been much of the talk of uh the previous weekend is uh what would happen if you know Tara had and UST had kind of a meltdown moment and your perspective seems to be well they're just like any other participant with collateral that's that's underwater and the markets have to flush we got to flush this out of the system and then your markets go down and then we kind of move on so we I guess what is your take on that because um some people are very fearful of a massive meltdown if like and we should we we should say it's not clear that UST will kind of fail but there's only three billion dollars to liquidate so that's it it's just another big whale Market participant three billion dollars it's not massively systemic risk to the crypto system or to defy in your mind no I mean does does this change the anchor protocol I don't know what the knock-on effects are um you know as you said maybe there's more knock-on Flex in avalanche I don't know it's a very complicated ecosystem Terror so I don't really know it inside out much like you know try and pick apart the the ethereum ecosystem it's immensely complicated nobody really knows where the fault lines lie who's got the leverage who hasn't but you know markets like this this is what they do they find that they find the weakest hands um and drive drive it into the strongest hands I mean that's just always the way of the world what the clearing price is I don't know because I don't really know how much Leverage is or margin because this wasn't so much leverage as just the the kind of margin the collateral of this system being asked back dokwan just tweeted out deploying more Capital steady Lads um so this is this is kind of the moment right where like do they have enough ammo in the reserves to to defend the peg or is it is it all going to get depleted I don't know if it's 3 billion or not but uh Raul you sound more informed than me but like can the crypto markets can be the Bitcoin markets like accept three million or three billion dollars of liquidation depends how fast it happens right um it's it's possible and we don't know who the buyers like one point sorry to cut you off 1.4 billion it just got sent out of the Bitcoin Luna Reserve wallet um like obviously they they can choose to sell out that at any rate that they want but 1. 1.4 billion dollars is the number you know what's kind of funny to me is we're all talking about this is um the fact that we get to see this all play out on chain the data in real time like well this has to happen all of the time in traditional markets of course it just does the public doesn't see it we're not talking about it you do see it sometimes right we saw it like a European debt crisis that played that in real time on our screens but a lot of the time you don't not the play-by-play yeah not normally you don't because it's some bloke at a bank calling up and saying there's no way but sometimes it happens on a gigantic scale which was like Greece blowing up in Italy and Spain and here it is in the crypto Market yeah it's just a very interesting world so uh yeah regardless of of what happens we'll see if crypto can sustain it but this is definitely the time where all of these protocols get tested we'll see if this latest the bigger question is is let's assume that this is a [ __ ] show and that this continues and them and there's other leverage to come out of this system from some of the defy uh ecosystem what does it mean for regulation yeah I mean so this is in my question like so you know part of we we've had Tara on uh before and uh the folks kind of the bull in the bear case for Tara and part of our sentiment has been like hey let's not screw it up guys like uh there are Regulators there are legislators like Elizabeth Warren who are already biased against our industry and will be looking for opportunities to escape goat the entire industry and point out uh when things go haywire and this is a concern I have uh about kind of more centralized elgo stable coins and I'm wondering what your take is on this so let's think let's assume this is a [ __ ] show it may not be hopefully things come out on the other side it it doesn't go in that direction but let's assume it goes in a negative Direction what do you think the regulatory impact might look like I think it's going to err towards and I've always thought this is nobody no government wants unregulated stable coins they want Central Bank digital currencies whether they're private sector or state sector I think there'll be a blend nobody wants this so they they will use this as an excuse and you know it's probably good for people like paxos and it's probably good for people like Circle and it's not so good for tether and it's not so good for Terror and you know the problem is is if we are using borrowing somebody else's currency then we have to play their game whether we like it or not it's their currency you know so anybody thinks that oh just because we've got some algorithm it's not the federal reserve's currency smoking crack [Laughter] I mean crypto is importing the unit of account of the dollar right and so I do understand that Jake correct I mean it's like the SEC cost anybody trying to do synthetics because it's like I mean this is this goes back to the role of a Bitcoin or an ether like a monetary asset that doesn't have an analog to the real world and the value of having that in the crypto system and keeping us more resilient that way because in these cases we are not borrowing the unit of account from any Central Bank exactly and I don't have an issue with stable coins I mean I think they're very useful because we need to integrate from our you know from The Sovereign systems we live in to these digital web3 world and and that that's an integration tool and it works very well so I have no issue with that but the key point is yeah if you're if you own ethereum or Bitcoin or others you own them it's not somebody else's liability it's not their asset I mean the dollar it became absolutely clear to to the Russians that they thought they owned dollars as their own asset they didn't the US had lent it to them it's like you know you've you've got to realize what game you're playing here and that's why you know I think the stablecoin industry as is is going to shift towards the highly regulated and I I don't really have a problem with it sure we're all utopians and we'd love this other world but we also need to be pragmatists if we want this world to win we need to realize there's some battles we will fight and others that we can't win I do I do still think it's a net win even in that world where you get regulated staple coins because what are they ultimately settling on it's crypto rails exactly where does the value of cruel accrue it accrues to crypto it's not a ban of ether Bitcoin or anything if anything like the assets that are underlying the stablecoin system become these more base crypto native assets so it's still a win even in that zone totally agree I totally agree so as as we uh zoom out a little bit with the crypto markets uh again we we talked about how like a lot of the equities the NASDAQ are back down to their coveted depths um but crypto is definitely not like ether hit 80 in March of 2022 or 2020 and now in in 2022 it's at 2 200 203 2 300 and Bitcoin has similar levels of performance and so like we're the we're the parts of the traditional Market are back down to their lows the crypto markets are over 10x like you know 15 20x their their previous lows uh and and so I mean granted that some of this should be expected like the nft industry has completely boomed the fundamentals are so much better there's been a lot of growth in the last two years but well would you say that the performance of crypto Assets in the last year since the FED has begun to tighten it's it's a monetary policy starting I kind of in January or so the resilience of the crypto markets has that surprised you at all yes well no it was what I was hoping to see which is that the the more mature the network gets the less volatile the price becomes so I was expecting and yet to be proven out that each time we go through a bear Market that we see lower um percentage Falls so Amazon is I I use this as my best example of network adoption models you know it came out of it went public it fell 95 or 96 percent in 2001 it then rallied back it fell 65 then it felt like 45 and then the sell-offs were 30 and then was even less so that's because the network gets more mature as more and more people join it so it becomes less volatile so that should be true of Bitcoin and should be true of ethereum and I think that's playing out so what ordinarily would have been maybe at this point down 70 percent has now been a sloppy down 50 sideways range okay that's a whole new thing we haven't seen before so it's interesting now it's it's yet to be proven out you know who knows what plays out where do you think we end I'm just I'm I'm just looking at uh percent down from all-time highs and I'll read a few assets out for us here so Bitcoin we're now at about 55 down from all-time high from Bitcoins all-time high uh ether we're about 53 down from all-time high uh other assets uh Solana it's you know more in the alternative layer one space it's 74 down from all-time high cardano uh 80 uh Tara uh is hanging out at 60 at this point time Dogecoin 85 Avalanche 70 where do you think we end up with maybe let's start with the Bitcoin and eth do you think that's like 60 70 down all-time high or do you think we get even that you know higher than that it depends what else happens I'm gonna I look at the chart of ethereum and I'm like you know this could be a head and shoulders top in which case we go significantly lower you know we go back down to 1500. who knows um or what's more likely is I think as we're forming a another sort of wedge and that therefore 2000 is the low I just you know I don't know these are volatile assets but you know that the early adopted so Solana should be what ethereum was in the last cycle how much was ethereum down in the last cycle 95 percent well it's going to be somewhere around that right and we've seen that play out that kind of you know ethereum well ethereum has been slightly different because it had so much adoption in this cycle but generally speaking they kind of look like each other at early stages like the Amazon so the early ones look like Amazon and they become less like Amazon over to you know they become less volatile over time so Bitcoin needs to seem very similar these days in that kind of volatility structure but you know Solana Terra all of this needs to be proven out it also took a long time for that to play out too I mean this took 2018 20 it wasn't until 2019 and then of course we had covet in 2020 where we saw the ultimate low for these assets but that uh that that coveted drop aside I mean this was a kind of a a multi-year bear Market from a time frame perspective do you think something like that is ahead or do you think now that we're playing with kind of the I guess the the FED um when you call it rubber band or something where we're slingshotting back and forth do you think that maybe this bear cycle in crypto is faster than 2018 2019. hey yeah it feels structurally different but you know it's very difficult when markets like this when everything looks absolutely terrible you know it's very easy to extrapolate the worst but generally speaking it feels that it's going to be shallower and shorter because I don't think it's driven by the halving cycle any longer I think this is driven by the macro this is a pure macro event and I think as ethereum has become a more dominant ecosystem over this cycle its own kind of triple halving or whatever you want to call the uh the eth2 merge is going to be another Factor within this Market so I think the structure of the markets changes and that's just the network maturity that we talked about before it's just how things how things evolve over time so I think the structure has changed I think it's going to be shorter because we think the macro cycle is shorter I think we all kind of agree that that feels like that that's where we are so it's short and brutal but it's not been as brutal as the past ones because the bus past ones were crushing bear markets don't forget this time in 2018 we talked about 2018 a lot in this um chat is at that stage 2018 we were down huge I can't remember what we were down in Bitcoin by the 2018 fed pivot but that was the low right that was the low for Bitcoin yes and uh you mentioned the merge and so I kind of wanted to Pivot the conversation towards things that we can be optimistic about like so let's be happy now on the horizon yeah and so uh the last time we had you on Roll was about uh the the merge trade The Ether trade uh we're we're still burning an insane amount of ether on a weekly daily basis uh and the merge is closer than ever even though it keeps on also getting kicked out it's also closer than ever uh and so I I'm wondering if like you think that the the if you buy into the triple habiting thesis and and if your opinions on this has changed since we last talked um where just the the merge because ether uh historically has always been like uh bled more than Bitcoin um previously up until now where in the last like three to four months it's actually fall tracked Bitcoin and which has never been seen before and so like is leaning into some evidence as just to Ether the asset structurally having a lot more faith by investors the the in this part of the cycle so I'm wondering what your position is with uh just will the merge save us Raul so it looks that ethereum is over fair value because of the burning which is a different source of demand that doesn't appear in the metcal's law kind of models I think that's interesting and that has been why ethereum has done very differently now if that increases because of the triple halving effect then that should further lead to the Bitcoin outperformance uh the the outperformance of Bitcoin which I've you know been watching for extended period of time and that seems to be ongoing so barring any change in anything it should outperform over time unless something dramatically changes with volume structures now what we and we go back to earlier what I said is when I look at my analysis ethereum is going nowhere we've got no new participants and bitcoin's going nowhere but ethereum has had had luck because it's had nfts and they've burnt a [ __ ] ton of tokens and that's been because ethereum ecosystem is vibrant within it it's just not growing I.E people are not coming into it let's talk about some of the other I guess ways out of this or or things that might save us so you're saying even with the prospect of a a crypto bear market and just an asset bear Market in general uh the merge should help dampen the blows to Ether the asset though not completely avert them yeah all it does is it it lowers the volatility over time it helps support but if prices turn up and we get demand back in the system okay then it supercharges everything it turned it's it starts to supercharge things well can we talk about that what do you think happens to maybe another element that's still been relatively hot even in q1 of this year and into Q2 is the nft market do you think there is some salvation for crypto there do you think that remains hot or you know is it are nfts kind of voodoo and like no one knows which way they're going nfts are a meaningful culturally significant thing and what we see of nfts now is not what nfts necessarily be but we'll be using them for every ticket we purchase we'll be using them for so many things you know insurance contracts derivative contracts they all suit nfts so the Genies out of the bottle sure we start with monkey pictures but those have actually morphed into communities and into media companies and there's a lot going on in that space and it's really important so I think that is big and I think the social token Market which I've been talking about for a while that you know I'm about to go public on a business that I've launched with a bunch of kind of well-known people on that um that is coming as well that's tokenizing communities and you guys were very advanced in that you've had your own social token and you know I don't think the world is yet ready to understand what that means so the sources of future demand are stacking up every day so it's this period of time that we're talking about is where we know the technology is growing it's in an exponential Trend but the Market's been trading sideways we've just raised what 42 billion in VC money for the space that is going to be a spent on marketing budget b it's also going to be spent on developing new cool stuff and everybody kind of knows that we need consumer facing applications if not we're just selling stuff to each other in the ethereum ecosystem and that is not how to get this network adoption model so I'm incredibly positive about the space incredibly positive with the amount of stuff that's being built who's doing it how much money's gone in so crypto completely survives this down cycle that other VCS May struggle with um and other tech companies will struggle with because everybody's fully funded so that means that you know people just build over this period and we come out the other side with a whole set of other opportunities because the last building period gave us Define nfts what's the next one going to give us so over time in a network adoption model these big pauses that are bear markets are just kind of fuel for the next stage and I'm particularly optimistic because how much money flowed in 42 billion came in over 15 months and how much of that has been deployed I mean not that much so well another way to ask this question is do you think any of this any of this action any of the like you know maybe the future bull market do you think any of that changes the fundamental thesis for the space or the fundamentals of the space as a whole the only way that can change the fundamental is if adoption stops so how does adoption stop people don't find a use for it that's pretty difficult to think that that's going to happen now and again considering how much money's gone into the space and what's going to be developed on top of it so the only way of stopping that is regulation how much could you slow Network growth by Massive regulation that's always been the risk right we know it you do kind of wonder what the regulatory appetite might be against crypto in a bearer Market it seems like the regular Regulators uh get more concerned when there are bull market things but maybe maybe this maybe this changes in the bear Market if things are blowing up and uh investors lose money and that sort of thing but let me ask you the big question but also don't forget a lot of the fragilities are not in the US the US is the kind of global regulator of concern and Europe there's not a lot of these ecosystems that are there because the US doesn't allow much leverage in crypto so it's kind of okay in some respects that is true that is true let me ask you the the big question it seems to be throughout this this episode um you've talked about the thing that's going to break the bear markets back and sort of you know reverse course and have the FED reverse courses this idea of a a stimulus did you call it a direct deposit earlier you called it direct transfer payments yes so what is that and how does that happen in each country and do you think this is sort of a an act of legislators or do you think this is coming out of the the Central Bank sort of describe this scenario for us this is the stemi check the way it was this the stemi check was a new thing that we'd not really used before as a monetary tool so the issue is with just printing money is it makes the rich rich because the the nominator Falls and the value of the assets go up so people who own assets make a fortune and the people who don't earn assets get poorer so that's creating you know this issue with with polarization in the population populism but if you give it directly to people politicians love it because you buy votes without having these pork barrel things that you get in the US you know where you know people get their defenses fixed by the government because they they refuse to sign a deal unless it's done that goes away you kind of bypass all of the political system and you give it directly to people it actually helps people who need it so it helps with the disparity between rich and poor it is kind of a bit of the welfare state that you know the U.S could never Implement While most other countries have it so it's a way of kind of doing that by the back door um so I don't see a world with which this does not get used particularly when there's some complexity to the macro which is prices are high you know if we seem to be stimulating by cutting rates people can accuse us of stoking inflation so why not just give people money directly do you think debt forgiveness of the US is talking about like uh debt forgiveness is this a an element of the same thing you're talking about right absolutely and I've been talking about this for I don't know six seven years yes when you've got a world so much in debt if you can forgive debt you will because a mostly it's never going to get paid back anyway and secondly you win votes does this cause the problem that we started with though that we're trying to solve in the first place which is inflation so if we start cutting stimulus checks or you know some basic income forgiving debt debt forgiveness that sort of thing does this get us back into the cycle that we're in right now which is like no double digit inflation no because all you're doing is allowing people to pay their bills so you're not increasing incremental demand in pandemic you're increasing incremental demand which is why we had such a wild effect this is actually trying to get people back to flat so I don't think it does that so I don't think it drives inflation now it depends what the Central Bank does do the central banks start monetizing some of that I by buying government debt again in more QE if that's the case then that debases the currency and assets go up again now I don't think governments can afford to hand out stimulus checks add infant item without going cap in hand to the the central bank and saying please sir can have some more so what do you think will be the uh the rationale for stemi checks in this day and age where there's not a pandemic to justify it uh how do you is that politically uh like are we able to do that politically like right now because there's no there's no monster to be issuing stimmy checks against like there was with kovid yeah don't forget real wages real disposable income of the lowest they've collapsed we've never seen people with such negative incomes now it's all right for you and I we've all got sources of income we've got assets we've got savings but if you're just the average dude you're screwed you you can't afford to pay your electricity bill so if that's not a crisis worse than the well not the worst in the pandemic but of the same kind of magnitude for certain people then yeah I I don't I don't have a problem with it right okay so I mean it's just like I've never heard the stimichex conversation in the last like six to nine months right and so like happening in Europe right it's happening right now because you're saying is coming to America this is the cost of War we've got War here the sacrifice we need to take is we are not going to rely on Russian oil and gas and therefore we're going to have higher prices for a period of time and we will help you deal with those higher prices because we understand it hurts you economically Japan has done exactly the same so I think it's coming to the us too so we're using the the war in Europe the actual war in Europe as like foreshadowing for for what's coming to here to America yeah because the price of everybody's cost of living has gone up and they can't afford it now you it feels a bit weird now but wait till you're in a recession and gdp's down three percent everyone's gonna be begging for it um and so this is largely going to be disconnected from the actual price movements of equities and like the crypto markets right because people are going to feel the pain on their personal income their personal expenditure independently of whatever like the NASDAQ does uh and so like this Demi check conversation the recession conversation can be independent of asset presses although yes don't forget this there's two groups of people here they're kind of asset owners and the the worker classes the work classes are going to have to get bailed out if this continues the rest of us are all taking a [ __ ] massive haircut you know if you want to calculate your net worth it's not a good look right everything's gone down every single thing you own has gone down um so you know everybody's taking some pain here and that's what recessions are about everybody takes some pain I mean I I do think that's like there's an element of like the asset uh class uh has benefited massively from the run-up the asset price run up and that you know the the monetary policy for the last decade or so so I totally understand where this where the sentiment is coming from and where some of this action is coming from let me ask you this Raul do you think there's anything to the it used to be a narrative that Bitcoin hard assets like that cryptocurrencies would provide a hedge against inflation of of some sort now here's inflation it's the thing to be fair the crypto Community has always said would happen like the crypto Community is always anticipated that inflation was cut sort of right around the quarter asset price inflation but an actual CPI inflation now here it is do you think crypto will provide a hedge against it in any way over is completely confused between what inflation is the thing that every that crypto is all about is the debasement of fiat currency that is the printing of money the printing of money has proven not to be inflationary in Japan and Europe and the US there's no correlation inflation is a different thing driven by the supply and demand of goods it is not everywhere and everything a monetary phenomena that was taught to the to the monasteries back in the 1970s coming out of The Chicago School it doesn't work because velocity of money doesn't pick up so people have been the gold crowd the same as like the inflation what a goal do and protect against that because gold actually protects against debasement of currency and not the inflation inflation nothing protects you so you think that the narrative has been wrong from the start that crypto's not never has been never will be inflation uh Insurance resistance basement yes resistance that's the real narrative correct it's a long duration asset long duration assets get discounted by the rate of inflation so it gets killed so no it can't be it's it's debasement so it's the value the purchasing power of currency that's that's the thing and people confuse the two because they assume that printing of money causes CPI to rise which it does not it causes the denominator to fall which causes asset prices to optically look like they've gone up in price they haven't they've maintained so if you look at you know over these periods if you look at the relationship between gold and real estate inequities they've all remained roughly consistent and it's the actual Factor was the was the fed and the other central banks printing money lowering the value of the currency purchasing power terms against scarce Supply assets so something that there is more of goes down in value versus things that are scarce which is the whole crypto industry is built on this one premise as well and that is right well I want to pick your brain as to how you're actually playing this right now uh as we're looking at the crypto markets there's definitely some blood on the streets not too bad but could definitely get worse but also there's definitely Blood on the streets and same thing with the uh with the equities Market as we said like the equities back down to to the pre-covered levels so what are you up to right now what are you doing are you sitting on your hands are you starting to deploy what's going on I haven't done anything I've not sold a single thing not done anything I've started to average in on the grow really growthy tech stocks for the reasons we talked about because into the Carnage if I'm right and this is a super Trend and a super cycle then you want to be owning this stuff for the long run now which companies are going to succeed or fail we don't know so you buy kind of baskets of stuff you know much like you might do if you wanted to capture the the movement in crypto crypto is the same is you know you've got to be if you believe that that Network adoption continues then this is when you should be buying but you know it's just not everybody has endless amounts of cash to keep putting in that is the problem I wish we did we wish we did that's right so so I'm curious how has your crypto portfolio changed still since last time we spoke I think last time we spoke you had some Bitcoin for Nostalgia uh sake I think but you definitely had some Bitcoin you had a heavy eth position because you're anticipating the merge the triple happening that sort of thing you had a portfolio of other alternative layer ones and other kind of long tail crypto assets has that changed at all in in this in this world no because I'm trying to capture the overall space so I haven't moved around you know as ever you know a bunch of the more speculative end of stuff always feels terrible in the bear market and who knows what's going to survive and what's going to work but you know that's the thesis and that's why you buy a basket and it's only a small part of the overall thing um since then what trades have I done I had a go at buying calls on eth to say look if the previous pattern kind of held out then we could have seen a run in December through to March which failed to happen but you know I stuck like five percent of my eth in some call options or I added five percent in call options and that didn't work out well it's bizarre people like pick on me for for doing that it's like it's a mitigated risk good upside opportunity didn't work out I mean five percent it's like the bid off a spread on a day like today so who cares right so I did that and then I bought some nfts you know I got involved in the board eight thing because I loved the not so much not that bothered about the board 8 Community itself it's a Vibrant Community it's good but it wasn't you know I'm not I don't really like to be members of clubs because you know I don't like to be pigeonholed but I love what Yuga was doing because that's the Playbook that's been in my head which is you build engagement utility with nfts and then you build a social token around it and then use that that that's been the Playbook that I'm building a business around as well um and I saw that the moment I saw the eight coin was actually coming out and saw what they'd done with um with lava Labs I thought I need to get in and I want to own part of this ecosystem and hold it for the long run because this is something very interesting um and I bought some other nfts because I was interested in them um just to have a feeling like an mfer just because that was a Vibrant Community the CCO model is quite interesting um I also wanted to own a little bit of art based stuff so I was interested in Damien Hurst because he was an artist I grew up with and he's experimenting with the currency where they're either going to burn the art or burn the token you get the choice and you don't know which one's going to be more valuable just a fascinating experiment and you know Damien Hurst is a you know a cultural English icon um and then um I also bought one of the X Copy Max Payne and friends because I think his art is amazing but I'm not gonna stamp up the full cash needed for a proper x copy so I bought a few nfts just to get my toes in the water and just be involved well you've uh you've mentioned this uh the social token kind of idea this business uh that you're launching I don't know if you can uh tell us about that at all or reveal anything but it sounds very intriguing a little nft a little social token uh is there anything you can say about that or when is the going to be the next update from you so I think that culture is becoming an asset class and the world's largest cultural communities uh music sport fashion film and movie and TV franchises those things are all going to get tokenized right now everybody is tokenizing from the ground up building small communities I think we're going to tokenize at scale top down the world's biggest communities that's what I'm working on without giving too much away that's cool and this I think is if we don't [ __ ] it up the best chance we've got for master scale adoption we would uh love to have you back when you uh when you plan on releasing that before well it's soon as well we'll be able to talk about it soon um we can't really talk about the first client and stuff like that it's all pretty secretive but I'll be able to reveal more about the whole thing uh very soon well you know nft is a good cope through the bear Market you know when I'm like looking at the price of my tokens I just you know tend to go to the nfts and the art still looks good and you know the culture is still there and it makes me happy again yeah you don't notice that you're eats full than 50 exactly nft still looks IV it's fine yeah exactly it's all priced in it which you know I think this is fascinating and I think it's underappreciated is and I mentioned it a few times in this is how vibrant the eth economy is so if you think of ether's a country there's a ton of trade going on in the country itself there's just not much exports and imports going on right so that's been the most interesting thing I've seen that I haven't seen elsewhere is eth is really its own sovereign state right now its economy is definitely um not like if there's a recession going on in the real world you don't really see that manifest on chain in ethereum like no there's no you see the liquidations but that's only in U.S dollar liquidations like the native economy the purely digital only nfts eth only those the completely immune from the external forces yeah I think it's fascinating I've never seen that before it's really really interesting well for for first timers for unicyclers like like that we like to call them the people that haven't only been through the crypto markets one time uh they're probably pretty scared right now I remember my first cycle watching uh ether go down by like 50 and be like well I can't go do that again and then it did it like three more times um for those people that like they learned crypto as their first like foray into money in finance and they got really bullish uh so they have a lot of it and so now they're feeling their first waves of pain like what what advice would you have for for the this cohort of listeners it depends what your pain tolerance is so you know I put money into the ecosystem and just said well I'm just not really going to look at my p l because I want to be in it for a longer haul is that the right move because in the cycle in which one was it 2013 I bought Bitcoin uh early 2013 and sold it into the rally in 2000 18 but too early and then I didn't get back in until the lows that worked too so you don't have to hold on so if your pain tolerances I could do something else with this money or just keep it in Stables do that too that's okay but I've just kind of thought well if I just write it off and just don't think about it then I can just leave it there and I can add to it and I kind of do that with it's I alert this trick with wine so I collect a bit of wine and stuff that I've bought I write off immediately and I try and forget what I paid for it and then stick it in storage and 10 years later I don't have the oh my God I can't open that thing and you just forget about the value of it and what you get is at the end you get this you know amazing wine at the end of it that you can drink and you don't think about it with crypto it just allows you to be in it so I look at the price chart all day and I've got like five [ __ ] crypto charts next to me in real time on my Bloomberg but I don't look at my p l I will do I'll have a peek at highs and I won't at lows because I'm not going to do anything I'm not going to sell it and really all I want to do is you know if I can generate some more cash my wife stops buying stuff I could then put it um I could put it just more into crypto because my belief is in the network adoption and the space overall and this is one of the biggest fundamental change to both the financial economy and business models that we will ever live through or have ever lived through and to not participate is stupid so Raul's advice is to take your Ledger Hardware wallet stick it in The Wine Cellar for 10 years if you have to don't touch it don't worry about it uh Raul it's been a lot of fun having you on I um maybe just end with this question it's kind of the question we started the episode with uh but is this should we be scared right now like should we actually be scared to be in crypto to be in assets what's kind of your your concluding thoughts on this bear markets and recessions are scary they don't feel good you come in every day unless you're short and I used to always trade these from the short side so I Loved These but now I'm kind of looking it from the other way around and they don't feel as good and you know and I prefer the bull market but this is how the world always plays out is there a structural change in the economy that means things don't recover there is a non-zero there is it is not a non-zero chance I there's there's a decent probability that we could structurally change how markets in the economy works so that would be more scary because then you don't get to get your money back it just kind of dwindles on the vine um but generally speaking I think that central banks and their magic bullet drives up asset prices over time so if you remember that just make sure you own some of those Magic Bullets when they come and that is owning some of these assets so it shouldn't be scary if you've got any cash then you can buy more at great prices if you haven't then you need to make a decision is how secure is your income that's the key to everything income is everything assets are nothing is your income secure if your income secure you just write it out if your income's not secure then liquidate your assets and give yourself some cash and in that situation A friend of mine early on in my career gave me the great piece of advice which was he who has cash in a recession is King because that's when you can buy everything on discount you know that's when you can book any restaurant you want you can buy anything you want so that's that's the key so just if you can keep that in the back of your mind yes it feels scary but maybe you can take advantage of it there's opportunity here and great advice uh to end it on Raul thanks so much it's been a pleasure to have you where can
