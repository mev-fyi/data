welcome back to this nation back to the ecc experience episodes on this episode we're bringing in sunny agarwal from the cosmos ecosystem did a fantastic talk at ecc about cosmos if you want to dive down more sunny is as bullish on cosmos as i am on ethereum which means to say that he is quite bullish but his vision for cosmos is a little bit antagonistic to ethereum and you can get a little bit of sense for that in his talk at ecc but i am very interested in the cosmos ecosystem which of all crypto theses that's out there i think this one does actually hold weight which is rare to find in the crypto world uh sonny has been around for a very long time he's been very committed to this vision and so i just pick his brain on the cosmos thesis and how ecc always has this cosmos presence so i hope you enjoyed this in person episode with sunny auger wald we usually do our full pre-recorded ads for these podcasts but instead i'm just gonna speed run through them right now and we're gonna start with rocket pool rocket pool is ethereum's decentralized validator network where you deposit eth and you get r-eth in return and you can take that re into it defy and if you run a node you let other people deposit their eth into your node and you get to charge them 15 for staking rewards as payment for your node operating services and then you can take that reef and use the across bridge to join over 2.3 billion dollars in the arbitrary ecosystem across of course is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge and one of the safest ways to bridge your hard-earned assets in the world of crypto and of course arbitrary is where you want to be with over 35 000 contracts and 1 million unique addresses arbitrary is leading the way into the age of rollups you know how i know these numbers because i watched the arbitrage talk at ecc which you should also go watch but not before you're done watching this but when you do watch that video make sure it's on a privacy first browser which is why you should be using brave it blocks all the browser ads it's got a native web 3 wallet and it puts the user first the web3 way you know what else puts the user first ledger hardware wallets and the ledger live ecosystem i know ledger is a great product because i have literally nine of them and i have 99 of my crypto assets on my ledger wallets and the ledger live ecosystem is all you really need when it comes to living a bankless life such as buying with fiat swapping and staking but for the rest of you that are sitting on stable coins because the market is scary right now make sure you're using a decentralized bankless stablecoin may i suggest dive from maker down the most tried and tested stable coin in existence but with maker you don't have to hide your stables on the ethereum layer one maker is building die portals so you can mint die natively across all the layer twos so you can make sure that your assets don't go down another ninety percent but you still get to go do all the defy things across the l2 verse and so i hope you use all of these sponsors on your quest for going bank lists and now i bring you my in-person conversation with sonny agarwald all right sonny hey we're in hcc at paris uh you've been to a few of these before uh are you excited yeah i think this is my fourth one i think etc is always my favorite conference of the year yeah four out of five wow that's uh almost all of them why is the coveted one the music opener that's a good one that was my parents were like telling me that like hey don't you know you shouldn't go this is covert thing i'm like no no it's it's all in like italy nothing is happening in paris and then like they convinced me to skip it and then like half the people got it so i'm like okay that was good what about ecc do you like so much um i don't know just feels like way more community oriented and stuff like you know devcon is cool and stuff but it feels a little bit institutional e if the eef is an institution i don't know but like this just feels like the energy here is very different i also really like the old venue i don't know if you if you were at the early ones but they had this like huge courtyard and like there was always for some reason right around etc there was always like governance drama that used to happen the first two times and like you know there's always this like it felt like we were in this like big courtyard you know like the the uh the agora and we're all just like talking and arguing about governance it always felt really cool to me so uh i've noticed definitely a trend uh of like just more and more cosmos stuff going around in most like people's minds but also in development overall like how would you uh and cosmos obviously like kind of in my mind the the ethereum's like other half like the where i theory that i've been told that like and i'm trying to uh learn a little bit more about this myself is that like the long-term conclusion of ethereum and cosmos is like super super similar so maybe for the bankless listeners that i mean they mostly hear about ethereum stuff can you kind of give them like the high level rundown on on cosmos and like overall where you where the cosmos ecosystem is currently yeah sure so cosmos sort of is this idea uh that the future is application specific blockchains and that the a single chain is not gonna you know be it and like i i think every sort of blockchain ecosystem is coming around to that right like you know ethereum has also shifted more towards this more roll-up centric view on avalanche you have subnets maybe selena is maybe the only stickler right now who still thinks that a single chain could work um but i think one of the views is that like what makes it a little bit different still than like maybe the roll-up view is today at least for now they're all the roll-ups are very much like generalized evms and you just have like the sort of same internal ecosystems that they're still relatively isolated like optimism and arbitrary like yes they share security from the same system but like they're not i wouldn't really consider them the same ecosystem like the ability to interact between them is not arguably is more is less seamless than like you know maybe between other l1 because just because of some of the latencies on the bridges um what the view of cosmos is that like hey instead of having these like generalized vms and have like you know sushi swap go redeploy on every single spot it's like no we're going to build one chain that saw osmosis which is what i build it's a dex app chain and so it's like you know we're not deploying osmosis on every chain we build one app chain that connects to everything else but then we put all of our liquidity and so we concentrate our liquidity in one place we concentrate our ux flows in one place and then use these like bridges uh ibc which is this like very trustless bridging system that's based off of like client proofs whenever possible and then whenever not then we use more traditional bridges as well but that and then when you have your own app chain you kind of get a lot more flexibility to do things you couldn't when you're building on you know i call it building on someone else's chain right like you're kind of stuck with the design constraints that they're that they they laid out for you and basically we're seeing this big shift right now where uh a lot of applications are choosing to move into like their own app chain so you know the one that caught a lot of headlines was dydx uh they wanted a lot of customizability about around like how they do their because they what they're doing is they're running an order book in the mempool uh and only submitting settled trades on chain that's like a really cool architect architectural design but they needed to have their own custom chain to do that kind of thing um another big one is just that like you know you can keep you know uh anatoly had a good tweet a couple of weeks ago he's like the only value of l1 tokens is the mev that they can capture and it's like well okay as an application developer why am i giving my product the value that my protocol is creating and giving it into someone else's uh token when instead that can be that mev capture or that fee capture can be going to as protocol revenue for uh you know our gap so that's kind of a couple of the reasons we see this shift towards op chains so the the image that i have in my head is like we have these generalized layer twos which are large and flat right you can come like settle on them and like set up shop uh but then on the application specific chains you have these like large verticals uh that are highly optimized for their one thing uh and so we this is there's a spectrum here of like how flat and generalized you want to be versus like how vertical and specific you want to be yeah do you think that like the long-term conclusion of this multi-chain world is that we find some balance in the middle of these two things or maybe we find more chains that are on the pool or ends and less in the middle do you have an uh an attitude towards that yeah i think most like i think uh generalized vms are still going to be useful for like the more tail end use cases so you know if i'm gonna if i want to launch um i don't know an nft for something right i'm not gonna go spin up a whole chain just to launch my nft right maybe i'll go maybe what will happen is you'll have like chains that are specialized for like nft issuance there's one in cosmos called stargaze so they can do cool stuff where like you know the validators are required to be running ipfs like uh uh other endpoints but so that and like pinning data and stuff so like you can still have chains that are optimized for that use case but like yeah so there'll be this like tail end of things that will like be on generalized vms it just doesn't make sense to like launch your own chain but then i think like things like you know core protocols like you know we're talking about dexes lending protocols stable coins like these things that really would benefit from having their own uh chain i think those are we're gonna start to see like the you know the app chains are going to win out just purely because of like ux reasons and stuff over the generalized ones so in the uh ethereum ecosystem we generally have a pretty like good concept on like our road map and where we are in the road rap now like vitalik had that like uh you know the verge splurge merged blah blah blah all the urges uh which i did not correctly label out in time but unless you like for for people that are super familiar with the ethereum roadmap does it make sense to ask like what does the cosmos roadmap look like and where are we in that timeline yeah so i would say like cosmos itself does not have a singular roadmap like i guess one thing that's very different in cosmos is like we don't have a single dev team right you said cosmos is more of an idea cosmos is an idea and a set of open source tools that will like help make that achieving that idea easier so the three main tools i would say are tendermint core which is like the consensus protocol uh causal sdk which is like a toolkit that makes it easy to build your own app chains and then ibc is just the communication protocol but these are just like code there's no central blockchain in the cosmos system so there's no dev team behind the cosmos it's like you know our team for example is one of the dev teams because i mean we're one of the biggest uh users of the stack so we spent a lot of time contributing to that but then there's like i don't know i would say there's like probably like somewhere between you know how you counted somewhere between five to ten like core dev teams like contributing to the stack it's kind of kind of more similar to how you see like the eth2 row the client development teams that's kind of more similar but i guess the difference is in eth2 it's more every team is working on a for the most part it seems it's more like each team owns an entire client implementation from like top to bottom while in cosmos it's more like you know we're all contributing to one code base and because of that it's hard to kind of like say here's the road map as much as it is like well here's a here's a huge pool of things that we need to do and then like each team kind of like picks and chooses what they want to work what they need to do based off of their requirements so like you know the developments that we need to see from the cosmos sdk might be different than what a a different project needs from the constant sdk and so we're all sort of just you know contributing to this large repo together based off of our own needs right and like i think a difference between cosmos and theorem is like first you have like the beacon chain as like the central coordinator chain of all of ethereum and and also ultimately all the shards and all the layer twos and then you also kind of have like the central coordination of like the ef uh well like they don't coordinate things themselves they basically pay for that coordination by by pushing an outbound and cosmos it seems to be like build the code make it easy for this thing to construct itself but it still feels like very bottom-up construction uh so with that sort of like strategy how do you like accelerate that because we all want to grow these things as fast as possible to like take over the world and replace the financial system is there like an acceleration strategy for for cosmos yeah so i mean i think the our approach has always just been like an application first approach so like you know you know i guess our roadmap it would be like more focused on like how do we i guess okay the main thing that we've been focused on is on the application layer composability so one thing i like to tell people is that like look everyone is starting to think about cross chain communication now but in cosmos like ecosystem we haven't been thinking about it we've been building it and shipping it over the last three years like and we're like on the next step which is cross chain composability so you know other token other bridges yeah sure you can send tokens between them with ibc and the the the framework of crosstain composability we've been working on you can send nfts crosschain you can do you can have an account on one chain do actions on another chain so you can have a dow on one chain do their token swaps on osmosis you can have a uh we have a smart contracting system that has been developed called causal wasm and it's very designed for interchange native like native where a contract on one chain can make a function call to a contract on a different chain and it's the same apis as calling a contract on the same chain so it's like our our our bet is that like it seems that a lot of other ecosystems have been focusing more on like you know the the base security kind of like you know shared security fraud proof solidity proofs all which i think are like super great and i think that like you know validity proofs and stuff are the future but it's like there hasn't been enough of a focus on the actual user level composability how can i as a you how can my contract my dow on optimism make use of a contract on arbitrage and that's kind of what we've been focusing on cosmos is how can we get that our you know one of our north stars for osmosis is like you know we want to make sure the ux of the multi-chain is as seamless as the ux of a single chain and so that's kind of by building that and using that as our focus i think that's how we're going to get sort of the usage and adoption so the cosmos ecosystem and just like overall community along with the ethereum ecosystem and community have like been running in parallel for a really long time there's a ton of overlap and and especially at ecc i see just like the it's always when i run into the cosmos community members the most is that yeah ecc so like just overall like what would you attribute this like social alignment like this overlapping venn diagram that's not completely overlapping but still does overlap between like ethereum more than any other alternative player one that i would ever that i would mention like you know solana not really metro overlap i have a language not much overlapping costs a decent amount of overlap so like what would you attribute this to um yeah i think it's you know we were never you know everyone else marketed themselves as oh we're the ethereum killer kind of thing right like that i think that was never our approach with cosmos you know we just had a sort of different vision of the general architecture of blockchains um we where and we just sort of started building it in parallel and you know collaborating on you know a lot of like you know proof of stake stuff you know our our team was very early on a lot of the proof of stake stuff along with the like ef and stuff so we're climbing on that kind of stuff and then you know just letting you kind of just been letting the rest of the ecosystem eventually like you know pick up on that and i think that like the the stuff that i think basically like i said we're working on a lot of the application layer composability i think a lot of the ethereum ecosystem has been working on more of like the core chain level like integration i think these things are going to go together where i i completely imagine that like all these rollups are eventually going to integrate like ibc for example and then start using the application layer composability protocols that we've been building in order to allow this crushing communication i do think that application specific roll-ups are going to be like i'm way more bullish on application-specific roll-ups than like these generalized roll-ups today sure uh so the we've been calling it a bank list a build market not a bear market implying that if we want to get out of the bear market we have to build our way out of it uh so like in the next like you know 6 12 18 months what are you looking forward to in the cosmos ecosystem to build our way out of the bear market um yeah i mean there's a bunch of things that sort of our team is working on especially the one of the biggest things that sort of what uh trigger you know the original purpose of osmosis was we got really interested in like nav kind of stuff and mev reduction especially uh so you know i'm close friends with the flashbacks team and stuff but like you know we were like oh we don't want to be auctioning off this stuff we want to be like figuring out how to actually reduce it and so we had we spent a lot of time on this design called threshold encryption which basically is a way of encrypting the mempool and only decrypting and executing transactions after a block has been finalized so that if no one can read transactions in the mempool no one can front run or sandwich or anything like that and so this was you know our so how i how we started we started actually with that and then we're like well this is a feature not a product we probably should go build a product around this and that's like okay let's go build a decks um and unfortunately the threshold encryption stuff got like just kicked down the road because it's like one of those features that we know takes like you know probably will take another like six to nine months of like development work and then during the bull market we just have to you know keep focusing on those like faster two to three month wins and just like shipping features faster and and stuff and so now with the build market we get a chance to be like okay we can focus on some of these like longer-term initiatives so for us like threshold encryption and other privacy stuff is like one of the one of the reasons i think app chains are cool is we're able to iterate on like privacy stuff in a way that you can't on a generalized vm because you're stuck with the cryptographic primitives that the chains give you sunny thank you so much for joining me at ecc awesome thank you [Music] you
