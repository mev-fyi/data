I think as we go into the future no one no one can really say what's going to happen here we all just need to figure out what are the best defense mechanisms to prevent the sort of bad scenarios from happening that we don't want to have happen welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and today on the show we've got some bonus content for you banquization an episode diving into the nature of Soul the asset and the economics of Solana the ecosystem we haven't done too much Solana content on Bank list before so little in fact I'd say that it's actually kind of a meme that bankless just doesn't produce Solana content we've had Anatoly and Raj on once to discuss the solanaphone we had Anatoly himself exclusively on earlier this year post FTX collapse to give us the Solana story and then I also went on the validated podcast which shorthand is just the Solana podcast hosted by Austin Federer the guest on this episode so that's the entire spectrum of Solana content coming out of bank list but on this episode we're having Austin federa on to discuss the design philosophy that relates Solana the network to solve the asset and it's really sold the asset that has been the thing that has hung up me and Ryan the most while trying to understand the Solana ecosystem the investment thesis behind Seoul has never really been Salient to us if you know the bank was thesis you know that we think that there are very strong technical bonds between the design architecture of a layer one and the nature of the Native asset that it produces and tinkering with the properties of one impacts the properties of the other we think that a layer one that prioritizes decentralization and censorship resistance at the base layer produces Downstream strong store value properties in its native asset where a high throughput layer one for example sacrifices the hardness of its money by compromising on its issue and schedule and the properties of censorship resistance this has always been the bankless thesis that has guided us in our investing and our content it makes sense to us so it's the frame of reference that guides our thinking across other areas and it's how bankless has gotten the brand of being an ethereum podcast even though we're not we're just a bankless podcasts we've got our Theses it happens to line up with ethereum and therefore for all intents and purposes we're in ethereum podcast I see how people come to that conclusion sometimes though perhaps most of the time the Solana Community doesn't accept that and bankless is a subject of a lot of hate out of the Solana community and it's also impossible to tell what signal and what is noise here crypto tribes can a crypto tribe and the loud members of tribes often ex just drown out the quiet and contently satisfied parts of crypto but nonetheless Austin has always been a treat to converse with if you haven't listened to my episode with him on his podcast validated I highly recommend it if there are any listeners out there who have been following my path through crypto ever since my POV crypto podcast days my podcast before bankless these conversations with Austin feel a lot like my conversations with CK my old Bitcoin at co-host which is where a lot of early development of my thinking in crypto began and like bankless where both me and my co-host learning and content producing and tandem which is what I think that you will experience here with this episode with Austin about Solana and soul the asset so without further Ado let's go ahead and get right into that conversation but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic songs answers that make the show possible especially Kraken our preferred exchange for 2023 whether you're an

federa head of strategy at the Solana Foundation host of the validated podcast where Austin and I not too long ago went back and forth on some of the cultural and philosophical differences between the Solana and ethereum projects today on the show I want to continue that conversation with a focus on the native assets Behind These two ecosystems eth and Seoul with a specific focus on Soul of course because the rest of Bank list focuses plenty on eth because the focus on Seoul I think I would say is the biggest hang-up that both Ryan and I have about being able to integrate Solana soul and as an investment thesis what actually is soul I don't actually know the answer to that question so hopefully we can start to get around the Contours of what soul actually is here today here today on the show with Austin's help Austin welcome to the show hey thanks for having me on this is going to be fun yeah so Austin that was that was my Preamble um and we did we did a show on the validated podcast which if any Bank listeners out there is looking for the intersection of Solana and bankless that would be the show to listen to uh and Austin I had a ton of fun in doing that I think we can just keep going going with that conversation like I said specifically with the focus on like the native assets Behind These ecosystems uh I think there's a very deep integration between culture and asset in this space and that's one of the cool things about programmable money is you can program values into your assets and I want to know from your perspective what is programmed into Soul the asset and sometimes I speak in these words and I'm not sure everyone totally understands it but I think I think I think you you totally do are you ready to get into this conversation yeah let's do it I mean I think one of the analogies that helps people sometimes is the architecture of a network is sort of thought of as a City Zoning that New York is very different than San Francisco for many reasons but one of them is literally just what the zoning is of different parts of the city and what you're allowed to build there and what the sort of innate characteristics that these rules and Frameworks set up that's a pretty good analogy for non-technical people for blockchain architecture that the architecture of Bitcoin is based on allows a very different set of things to be done on that Network than what can be done on a network like Solana or ethereum sure sure and any long-time Bank list listener will know that Ryan and I have developed like models over time and one of the big stories of bankless it runs in parallel with the story of ether because ether in 2017 is not The Ether of today it's had a story arc we had to truly fight for the understanding of eth as money each as collateral ethas like triple point asset which now is ultrasound money and this was a story arc that's developed and would you say that that's the soul token is going through a similar story arc because that's my frame of understanding for these things and I'm wondering like how how to think about the story arc of solely asset so I want to get into I want to get into that um I think one of the things is useful sort of like a just a quick overview of like what Salon is trying to do from like a network architecture perspective so the thesis of Solana originally was uh you know basically NASDAQ at or blockchain NASDAQ speed right was the idea that you could build one Global State machine that was going to be as fast as traditional financial markets and it was a pretty narrow thesis in the beginning there wasn't sort of nfts involved there wasn't sort of social tokens there wasn't all this other world that we we now consider the broader part of web3 but that core thesis was that ethereum was right about one very important thing everything is better in one Global State and when you start fracturing the state up into side chains and l2s and sort of like even the approach that near takes with sharding you you reduce the developer experience you hurt the user experience and that if you can keep things in one Global state that is better now there are downsides of keeping things in one Global state right it's an ethereum node is a very light operation it's it's computationally very easy to run it's bandwidth-wise very easy to run because ethereum only does about 20 things per second right and so that is a a decision that's made to keep those requirements super light Solana the requirements are heavier right it takes about three thousand dollars of Hardware to run a validator on Solana that will keep up to the tip of the chain what that also lets you do though is things like keep one Global State and have a steady state of 4 000 transactions per second and so these are all just different architectural decisions about how to do things out into the future um I have a whole bunch we can talk about about like how Eve is actually going to get much heavier and much more difficult to run especially as we start talking about tracking l2s and Roll-Ups and getting a full state of ethereum if now as you've said yourself if ethereum is optimism and Arbitron and Hermes and all of these other types of things you suddenly need to run 6 7 8 12 nodes to actually get a full snapshot of the state of ethereum but just to sort of start out that's kind of the basic grounding principle of Solana is that keep the network as fast as possible keep the cost of transactions as low as possible and sort of the the model that ethereum has gone for of sort of artificial scarcity on the base layer and then offloading the scaling onto l2s and Roll-Ups and sort of things like that the design decision on this on a network is to flatten that into one stack and this flattening goes even further right so on ethereum you have the evm and you have Nakamoto consensus that run beneath it like if you look at a stack there are two separate layers there uh that is part of why if you run Geth locally you max out at about 400 TPS like there's limitations there that are from a software architecture not necessarily a network architecture perspective Solana flattens that into one layer so the VM and the consensus layer are basically all running in the same spot one of the trade-offs of that is if you have a crash in the VM you're going to actually have a crash in the consensus protocol whereas what you saw with ethereum is when the VM crashed for lack of a better term earlier this year twice the network was actually able to continue now it couldn't reach consensus they couldn't finalize transactions for an hour or so but that was a totally different type of experience than what you had saw in Solana in 2021 where you'd have a an outage where it wasn't a finality problem it was a block production problem now how does all of this architecture start to couple with the conversation of the nature of the layer one asset yeah so if you go back to gosh even 2020 there was no burn mechanism in ethereum right that whole idea that the way ethereum was going to deliver value over the long term was it was going to implement specific economic policies designed to create deflation right it was designed to reduce Supply over time that was what four five years into ethereum mainnet yeah we The Proposal was made in 2019 so yeah four years yeah yeah so that was very long into the main net now we're basically four years into Solana well less than four years into Solana Maine that it was March of 2020 that made that launched so there is this sort of thing where we're seeing a pressure on all networks to accelerate right it took it took 10 years for Bitcoin to get to the place that it got to ethereum got there and maybe four or five years and and so these networks need a little bit of time to figure out what are the innate characteristics of the network and what are the economic models that in some ways get backed into the value of where that Network comes from now a good analogy here and I really don't mean to offend any ethereum folks with this is there is a time and place where the way software was sold was 10 to 50 million dollar contracts with massive companies these were contracts by IBM these were contracts by Sun Microsystems they were contracts by Oracle and suddenly this crazy thing came along which was cloud and software as a service and it said instead of signing a 50 million deal with one company and becoming like the provider for x or yrz company we can actually sell slack we can sell it to hundreds of thousands of companies all over the world and it'll cost ten dollars a month and in aggregate we are going to actually have a much larger market and potentially a much higher profit on that than you get from this traditional Contracting model that didn't kill Oracle that didn't kill IBM Oracle is still around today the stock is still a pretty good performer there's tons of people who are employed by that company making lots of money ironically I believe Amazon still runs on Oracle as its back-end database for its store uh because these migrations are hard and people know the systems they know and that works great but this is a little bit of an analogy for what we might be seeing in the blockchain space too that the rise of Amazon web services and Cloud providers didn't kill Oracle it just created a whole new product category where the needs of those types of products and services are very different than what you can necessarily build with Oracle and we could see a world here where you know Solana's cheap transactions and massive throughput that ends up being something very similar to SAS for blockchain where on an individual transaction basis yes the fees are minuscule but when you have 100 million people per day transacting on the network which to be fair no blockchain has anywhere close to that today but in that future where you accelerate out and you say okay uh we're going to see priority fees we're going to see basic transaction fees and we're going to see network capacity increase to a point where you have functionally similar economics to ethereum on an aggregate level but the individual microeconomics are very different okay so how how we get there is different but the resulting conclusion is the same potentially yeah I mean there's one other key piece of sort of uh utility for Seoul introduced um in the last 12 months which is this idea of stake weighted qos um and so there were three pieces of tech that were sort of shipped over the last year and a half to really address some of the reliability issues one pretty boring quick it's just a new networking standard as opposed to using raw UDP packets to send data around the network the advantage of quick is basically that's a validator say this IP address is spamming me I'm going to close the socket connection which is not something you can normally do on UDP uh the other one was these local fee markets and that's kind of one additional area where you see uh changes in economic value on the Solana Network because now suddenly you don't have an incentive to send 10 000 spam transactions you can just pay ten thousand times as much for the transaction and be pretty sure you're going to land that Arbitrage similar basically is kind of addressing what eth went through with Shanghai attacks back in whenever that was a long time ago where someone just basically bought up all the block space right the last one is the stake way to qos and what this does is it's basically a guarantee for quality of service this is if I'm running a node that is 0.1 of the stake of the network on it I have basically the right to transmit point one percent of the blocks and this is not necessarily on like normally right you'd say on ethereum well if I control point one percent of the blocks of the stake I'm going to be building 0.1 percent of the blocks so from that perspective um stakeway to qos is basically a guarantee that says every block I have the right to put in my stake weight worth of transaction now I don't have to do that but if there's controversy around what fits into a block my transactions coming from my validator which is stake weighted is going to outpace your transaction coming from Phantom going through a public RPC with no stake attached to it of these things that you're describing seem like um margin the marginal utility of Seoul rather than like the base right these are like extra little add-ons that do impact the economics but only in only in more extreme situations or more marginal situations and so I think we've actually accidentally skipped to like the long tail Soul token economics let's start with the base like the very simple questions of like what does soul do why do will people buy it why will people why will the price go up like like because like the The Ether model for this is the triple point asset or ultrasound money like what what is that for soul what is the economic sustainability model for Seoul yes so it's very similar to ethereum the sense of the utility of the Soul asset as a civil resistance mechanism the same way in any proof of stake Network that that's why you have stake and then it is to pay transaction fees on the network right those transaction fees on Solana take two components one is a base layer fee which is five thousand lamports uh which is quite low it's like point yeah it comes from Leslie Lamport the computer scientist sure okay so okay uh you know for completion's sake way comes from way die who's a cryptographer so like you know we got nerds now yeah yeah all all of the people who are originally involved in all these networks are just massive nerds who love every blockchain um but you know the the fundamental uh point of the Soul token is to pay gas fees on the network right right and to help secure the network from a civil resistance mechanism uh that's it that's that's the base structure for nel1 it's not like polka dot where you use it to reserve state or something along those lines um it's very similar to ethereum and that fundamental architecture can you just like map on the triple point asset thesis onto Seoul and then like change the economics right like the per the unit economics but really the triple point asset thesis does map to Seoul pretty well it does if you believe that blockchains are going to be higher demand than they are today I think one of the things that the ethereum community and the economic modeling did very well is they basically created a system that said we don't really need much more adoption of ethereum for the effects of deflationary pricing to take effect right ethereum has always had about a one and a half percent inflation rate that's just like since Genesis Solana's inflation rate began at around seven percent and it decreases by one and a half percent every year until it ends at that sort of steady state of one and a half percent right and so uh you know from that perspective one and a half percent in a vacuum as in without any uh transaction burn from demand or is it always okay okay so if no one is using the Solana blockchain it it inflates at 1.5 percent assuming it's building blocks yes right as long as long as the network is building blocks there will be inflationary rewards distributed the same way in ethereum if everyone stopped using ethereum it would still produce one and a half percent of inflation per year okay okay and then so the whatever burn is is on top of that one percent one and a half percent yeah exactly now today I think it's closer to like six percent just because it's on a it's on a schedule where it steps down um but you know what was the schedule of that once once per year it dropped one and a half percent per year on a fairly linear decrease at the basically it's adjusted automatically at the end of every Epoch which is a three day so it's not it's not a Bitcoin happening event it's much more smooth yeah yeah exactly because like the happening is like you know look like so no one knew what they were doing when we made Bitcoin but like it is it is just like such a big media Enterprise for no reason right yeah uh I will say that like it's probably pretty good PR and like uh I don't know maybe more networks should think about having big splashing or something to talk about every four years yeah exactly besides ordinals right um but as we kind of Step through this process right it the thesis of saunas that blockchains are going to be incredibly widely used and if that's the case that the base layer transaction fee needs to be kept very low and so even when you saw you know the price of Seoul hit its all-time high the cost to transact on the network was still extremely low and a lot of that original economic modeling of sort of what is a cost per transaction uh was actually based on much lower numbers right the original economic modeling was sort of in a like one to ten dollar range for a price of of Seoul I don't think most people thought that uh these networks were gonna pop like they did and the user adoption was going to come and we'd have you know thousands of developers building stuff on the network uh in 2021 right like that that new to when the network actually launched so as you go through that process all of this sort of has to compound over time right you you need enough demand for Block space that you actually need a network like Solana and we're kind of seeing that already today in that the developers who chose to build on Solana in 2020 and 2021 and to some extent 2022 as well they couldn't build what they wanted to build anywhere else it was like technically impossible to build it on another blockchain because the Speed and Performance wasn't there they were specifically just building applications that needed the the massive speed that Solana can provide yeah yeah and and that is not to say those applications are better or worse than the applications you see on ethereum it's just the nature of them it's just very different right uniswap is built for large trades uniswap is more expensive than coinbase and more expensive than any other centralized exchange if you're trying to do 100 200 bucks now if you're trying to do 50 000. it's not uniswap that is more expensive it's the ethereum blockchain that makes unit swap more expensive but from a user perspective it's no different sure so right like the the economics if you want to swap on any Layer Two is going to not have the gas fees totally of ethereum layer one well maybe we'll see uh but the question there is when you start fracturing the state right is there enough liquidity on ethereum us on a layer two built on ethereum with a uniswap deployment like if we have 14 versions of uniswap deployed on cross with a bunch of different op chains a bunch of different Roll-Ups there's one on polygon there's one on fill in the blank you've suddenly taken your liquidity and you've had to fracture it and if you're if you're shuffling liquidity back in forth via bridges that is either time consuming transaction consuming because most of us still clear through the L1 or uh you it will and you also introduce a lot of trust assumptions into the mix there so it can work but it's just a much more complicated architectural system to get it there right um that's sort of the the pitch and value of saunas that you can do this All in One L1 and that's not to say the stuff here again not the stuff you're building on Salon is better or worse than ethereum but like you can't do helium on ethereum it's just too expensive and there aren't enough transactions sure and that's just a different architectural system like you don't have Central limit order books built on ethereum L1 you have dydx which went to Cosmos for right yeah yeah okay so in the triple point asset thesis it's um collateral is one pillar uh one of the three the other one is uh the burn which we've talked about and the other one is staking yields which we've talked about I think we can just strike collateral because I don't think there's any differences between ether and salon on their respective networks about collateral I don't think the network architecture of these things change the nature of collateral inside of these systems so these things are kind of like going to be the same out of the box correct yeah I think the only the only difference is is that there's less of a single player in the liquid staking Market on Solana yeah that's right that's where I was going to go with next with yield and so how is the LSD ecosystem on on ethereum I don't know if we guys call it lsds on Solana yes okay so like what does the LSD ecosystem on Solana look like like is is staked Soul as this is going to to be as strongly permeated as staked ether is assumed it will be in on ethereum so uh let me start by kind of a little bit of a scene set for ethereum there's a few architectural decisions that I think were largely economic decisions on ethereum that pushed folks into things like Lido the first is a requirement for 32e to be able to stake also if you have 33 eth you couldn't stake that last one unless you went through a liquid staking system right so there are there's also now an EIP that changes this that eventually is going to get it's going to get approved right but like on Solana you can create a stake account that has one soul in it right and so what that means is that initially with your three thousand dollars of Hardware or is that or with someone else's okay right so because again ethereum like the term validator on ethereum is not actually a validator I mean someone screwed up the language it could have been everyone else too uh but yeah the whole industry I know right there's if you go to like nodewatch.io or one of those websites you can see there's about 7 000 physical computers around the world that are actually ethereum nodes slash validators in the way that everyone else calls a validator sure so um the analogy here is like on ethereum a validator is actually a stake account and those stake accounts have to be 32 eth on Solana they can be any size like they can on many proof-of-stake networks so there was less of an economic incentive in the early days to go with a liquid staking protocol as opposed to just saying oh I'm gonna stake to the Bison Trails validator or I'm going to stake to the block name and validator you know the bankless validator fill in fill in the blank there today um there is actually a stake pool contract which is like the one that most folks on the network use and then there's a whole bunch of different liquid staking providers so Lido is on Solana marinade is something called msol there's gdo Soul which is a optimized basically stake pool and so there's a pretty robust liquid staking ecosystem today there's a little bit of fractured liquidity because of the withdrawal periods being like three days on that stuff but there's a group unstake it that are actually doing a common liquidity layer for all liquid stake tokens on Solana so I think we're getting to a place where like the ecosystem on ethereum is a little bit more robust but you're seeing the same sort of system develop on Solana but it is developing in a little bit of a different way because again the network architecture has different advantages and disadvantages right okay but in the resulting conclusion is like you still have staked soul and yeah steak soul will be collateralized in it's in Solana's defy applications in the same way like steak teeth or rocket rocketpool ether staked in ethereum yeah exactly like there's actually there's actually programs now that you can say I have a stake account that has let's say 100 soul in it I'm going to transfer the author Authority on that stake account to a stake pool and it will instantly mint me the equivalent of that liquid stake token I don't have to unstake and transfer I just have to reassign Authority on who owns that stake account so that would be like if I have a 32 East node that I'm solo staking and then I like sign it over to Lido or rocket pool and all of a sudden that protocol meant to be our ether staked Ethan return exactly it's a very very similar architecture to the way ethereum works from that perspective okay uh cool okay so that's the safety conversation uh I want to talk about Mev because Mev and then Mev burn is like a pretty strong part of ether economics so it's this Salon is there a philosophy that Solana has about how it approaches Mev and how it wants that to impact or not impact the sole asset so Judo is the group that has built the Mev client for Solana um they have done a bunch of work to basically build a relayer and all that sort of thing with with you know a bidding system where you it's very similar to what flashbots does on ethereum for that perspective um as an aggregate number of transactions though the the Mev on ethereum is actually pretty small it's usually single digit percentage of transactions that are actually getting searched and getting Chosen and getting packed that's partially because of the transaction costs that you need a larger Delta for that to be possible you see the Mev bots on Solana going after like two dollar opportunities because the transaction fees are so low right they they have to right because Mev on Solana versus Mev on ethereum it has to be so much harder because the blocks go so much faster and the margins have to be so much Slimmer it's going to be a much more Fierce competition on Solana correct it's actually even worse than that because we don't have a mempool so it's not even like there's this big pool of potential transactions you can pull from to pack you have to actually basically it's much close more like Mev is sort of like uh like fishing in a barrel on ethereum right it's like you can see the fish and you can go in and you can grab it yeah high school students are collecting Mev right now yeah yeah exactly like on Solana it's it's much it's a much faster process that's kind of more equivalent to like a bear trying to grab a salmon out of a stream right like right that's a little bit more like the high frequency trading uh exactly like the flash the original Flash Boys yes stuff yes yeah exactly and so it's much harder to do um the opportunities tend to be very non-consistent right you will you will see times when uh you know there's like a very small earnings for a day or two and then it spikes up because there's lots of market movement or something like that it's much more dependent on market movement or other on-chain activity than it is just sort of your steady

development the way it was always meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free so the ethereum philosophy or just like approach stance towards Mev is eliminated like do your best to suppress it do your best to democratize it uh obviously everyone knows it has realized that there actually is no eliminating Mev you can only push it to a different place but the place that we want to push it towards the philosophy of ethereum is into ether the asset because it's perceived that ether the asset is actually one of the most decentralized components of ethereum and so rather than letting one Central party own the Mev stack like capture Mev and own it themselves and they are just the Mev service provider of ethereum and they're they're jump Capital collecting all their Mev no you you take it from the large players and democratize it by just putting it into either the asset and the holders of ether the asset again the most decentralized component of ethereum are actually the thing the people the party the people that benefits from this well does Solana have some sort of philosophy or strategy as to wear it once Mev to go or what what is the end destination of Solana Mev so I think that's a slightly Rosy interpretation of what happens on ethereum there are still like one of the core principles of blockchain is British self-interest economic forces Drive good results for everyone and so uh there's definitely still a lot of people on ethereum that are are doing Mev that is not sort of as a public good but as a personal enrichment activity right this is like the long-term desire and with appropriate mechanism Design This is where it goes like we don't have me burn yet but in in the final conclusion this is like what the ethereum stance towards Mev is yeah I'm skeptical if we'll get there just because human interest is to steal as much as humanly possible and so you have to like that like one of the really interesting things about just as a slight deviation on the ethereum community is there's a lot of folks who hold a ton of ether who are very actively involved in building things like the Mev infrastructure I am skeptical that that's going to survive ethereum going mainstream that you're gonna have like the same way that uh you may have people now who are like I'm running these Searchers and uh my what I fundamentally care about is ether the asset going up because I have a hundred thousand each on a wallet somewhere eventually that economics are going to change you're going to have new people coming in who are basically like the equivalent of the people who sell you gadgets on Instagram that are like I don't have a storefront I don't have this like backhaul Legacy of Ethan my wallet that I can use to uh that I'm trying to enrich I am personally trying to accrue as much money ether usdc whatever we're talking about this moment as humanly possible and so I'm skeptical that that economic system is going to work in the next Bull cycle when we see a large expansion of the number of users with blockchain but we will see uh so on Solana like the the approach for democratizing this is stake weighted qos that is the Counterpoint Mev like on ethereum the only way that you can be guaranteed that your transaction is going to be included in a block is to be building the block yourself right on on Solana there is this approach with stake weighted Qs that says like if you're a D5 application and you decide to run a validator and you have point one percent of the stake that may be enough to make sure your most important transactions and your most important users are always able to be included in a given block and so that's sort of that Counterpoint there um the med clients on Solana are all sort of Open Source and about 27 of the network is actually running on the Judo client nowadays so there's a pretty serious percentage of the network that is actually using this stuff on a daily basis now but the way it works is like I opt my validator into being a part of this there's rewards based partially to that but the answer instead of driving value back to Ether like you're talking about over the long term this is where something like Judo Soul comes in which is a stake pool token where you're basically saying I'm going to give you my stake and then in exchange for that you're going to give me a significant portion of your Mev Revenue in addition to the normal staking rewards you'd receive okay so instead of it being burned in going into ether the asset it is just directed into this one particular Soul LSD token yeah it's sort of like if Lido decided we're gonna run Mev clients on all of the validators that we run for ethereum and then we're going to take those returns and bring them back now I actually think that's probably much more likely to be what happens in ethereum than people are like I'm a Good Samaritan I'm just going to return it back to the network because I haven't seen a good proposal on how you can enforce Mev burn because it's not protocol level it's application Level but maybe we'll see that in the future no MAV Burns at the protocol level it's got this mechanism of a an implied Oracle that can tell the ethereum layer one exactly how much Mev was extracted and how much Mev needs to be burned in order to make that block valid yeah but that's still functionally an off-chain system analysis right I think that's kind of the piece that like I'm I'm skeptical every time we bring in oracles those are like it's not it's not an actual Oracle it's an implied Oracle it's a it's a market-derived uh number that I can say is an oracle because it's external data coming into the ethereum one but it's not actually an Oracle in the same way that chain link it's an oracle totally applied one yeah but it's like how eth slashing can do up to six like there's a there's a six month lag up to in terms of like a slashing event and that gives room for human intervention right that's not because it takes six months to compute whether a slashing event occurred so I I think we'll see right as the answer here now what we could potentially see is that like the the Council of people who the Brain Trust of ethereum basically says like we are going to socially punish people who are not burning Mev right by saying we know your accounts we're going to actually ensue like a social consensus burn or slashing of some of your tokens I think that would be a massive violation of the ethereum social contract I do not think that that would ever happen I uh also don't think it would happen which is why I'm not sure we're going to see Mev return to Ether but uh only the future will tell okay so this is falling into the category of uh people who are making claims that ethereum won't uh actually execute the proposal that it's saying that it will execute which usually if you say that like ethereum is going to be late you're you'll be right but if you say ethereum's never going to do it you've never been right Bitcoin is betting against ethereum shipping the updates that it's saying that it will have never been right I'm gonna challenge you a little on this because what I would say is ethereum ships updates they are very often not the updates that they say they're going to ship if you want to specify in very granular details hey you promised this but we got this then yes there's differences there if you go back to the beginning of ethereum and also understand the ethereum again like philosophy and purpose and and general generalized architecture rather than the granular details everything that ethereum is shipped it's 100 in alignment with its original roadmap so I don't think that's a hot take so you go back to fall of 2020. the architecture of eth2 was supposed to be shards it was supposed to be yes and now we have layers Roll-Ups which is a difference but also the same well so this is where like uh they're different and also the same but also kind of worse right because a A Shard an executional layer chart so the original Vision right in like in 2020 like that white papers were coming out about people were writing about was basically that we were going to have instead of one Beacon chain we are going to have multiple shards each Shard was actually going to be able to run and execute smart contracts every 20 minutes those shards would sync up and you'd basically get a global State checkpoint every 20 minutes which is like which is like a step closer between what Solana is and what ethereum's role of centric roadmap is like it's a middle ground between these two things now we're like and so just to for bankless listeners because we haven't talked about the roll-up the the sharding roadmap to ethereum in forever because we've moved on from it but like think of Roll-Ups like arbitrum optimism polygon think of those as like actually being enshrined in the ethereum layer one and each of them are execution shards and they're actually more uh controlled by the actual ethereum layer one protocol rather than being controlled by these layer two teams with independent choices and so every single execution chart is like a roll up and then the ethereum coordinating Beacon chain just forces uh consensus between these two and end forces is probably a better word and forces coordination between these execution shards every 20 minutes and so these Roll-Ups all sync together every 20 minutes uh and then but we went even ethereum progress even more in like a laissez-faire way where they say like you know what we can just have one chain we'll stop with the execution charge and we can just let roll ups be these execution environments that can move asynchronously rather than synchronously yes now what I would say is that there's a real compromise on decentralization that took place that original vision would have kept ethereum just as decentralized as it was on a proof-of-work system every L2 is highly centralized every Roll Up is highly centralized the Solana ecosystem would love for for this to be true it is true you can't run you can't run a permissionless layer 2 system you can't become categorizing this as one of the things that like uh ethereum ethereum critics will say is true about ethereum but will also not give credit for the fact that ethereum has never failed to execute on this roadmap these are two different things that you're talking about and I get why you're trying to bring them together but if we look at a world where eth2 had actually done like L1 native Roll-Ups we wouldn't have a bunch of L2 tokens that have no economic value in existing right no that's not true either bro sure you would you would you would definitely have the tokens but they had totally have economic value sequencer fees man sequencer fees sequencer fees are paid in Eve right to the layer twos you you could have every L2 just have fractional transactions in ethereum that would mean you wouldn't need all these different tokens every time you want to be on a different roll-up or a different network you could just use ether everywhere for optimism polygon uh arbitrum yeah uh the only thing the only gas token that you need the layer two of is dark wear and it's like the most ethereum unaligned layer two of the ones I just I just mentioned it's also the only one that allows you to run a permissionless node but yes yeah because they have the BET and the benefit of having to be they can get to create their own ecosystem from the ground up all of the permissionless validation Network participating like arbitrum just just induced and introduced permissionless validation uh this last Friday and so yes their problem still continue so yes the next thing on the road map they're gonna do it dude yes but but you and Ryan are constantly being like Oh man like like Solana is so centralized right like that was like a whole thing coming from a lot of the brain Community for a while and it just didn't it felt very dishonest because yeah I know right like it was this it was this transition from saying like ethereum was depending on how you counted the first or second most decentralized Network and the entire scaling roadmap collapse that down into extreme centralization and this is not to say that it will be that way forever I actually do think that over time we are going to see l2s decentralized people are going to figure out a way to have permission people are going to figure out how to have more than one single sequencer on a roll-up or an L2 and then they're going to figure out how to have decentralized sequencers eventually I just think we're several years away from that and we'll get there right but there's this innate faith that you have yeah right and that others have that ethereum is the only Network that's going to figure it out and I just don't see like I think if you look at the pace of new technology shipping on the Solana Network and like where the network common in the three years that it's been live you'd say wow that's like an insanely High pace of innovation and change this reminds me of how ethereum relentlessly innovates on its core idea and the the point here is not to say like oh ethereum is supercentralized it's that like what you have seen over your engagement with the network is that you have a faith that is going to figure it out right and what I would give ethereum the benefit of the doubt and then we give Solana whatever it is yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah and and but also because ethereum has a track record and Solana a newer Network and so if Solana still has to earn its stripes you know this this is like what I've been calling the the L1 hazing of the last bull market totally it's like you're you're illegitimate until you make it through the next bear I I would say at this point Solana has been through at least as much hardship as ethereum has the salon has certainly been through a lot of hardship um and if it's they're different hardships they're very different they're different like the ethereum perspective would be like well Solana sold its soul to the devil with its with its uh cozying with SPF right ethereum's hardships were we almost ran out of money for two years straight I mean that also to be fair that also happened to Solana there there were the Solana Labs um you know in 20 in the fall of 2020 have actually they cut their staff by 50 they were almost totally out of money uh so like there has been that sort of thing too let alone obviously the collapse of FTX was just like a such a punch to the ecosystem yeah the difference though when ethereum ran out of money is that it had independent client teams that were all Grant funded rather than the Solana Foundation being this one like monolith of an organization supporting the network and so like ethereum as a movement had already decentralized and we needed like a pretty decent amount and we needed grant money to support open source client developers who were not a part of the EF and were just like doing things of their own accord like this is where the famous vitalik YOLO tweets came in and sent like a hundred each to Prismatic Labs which allowed Preston Van Loon and a few others to quit their jobs at Google in the middle of a bear Market to go build the first like Layer Two or if you're M 2.0 client right yeah and so the the the so yeah Solana also like ran out of money but it was different because it was Solano was like a startup whereas ethereum was a movement at this point well then that was also to be fair that was uh nine months into mainnet right that that event you're talking about did not happen nine months into the ethereum right that was four years three years afterwards yeah right so so today right the Solana Foundation uh has given grants for multiple validator client there's four validator clients in active development the one by Solana Labs fire Dancer by jump there's uh Sig which is a zig client implementation uh and there's gito and there's also a tiny dancer which is a light client so there's you know depending on how you count there's four or five in development and this is where like uh you're totally spot on that Solana is younger than ethereum it does not have the same ecosystem built out yet I just see us as on a very similar trajectory and that is not I I don't I don't see this as a zero-sum situation at all actually I'm kind of surprised that sometimes there is this like hostility towards like oh so on as a threat to ethereum I actually don't think Solana is a threat to ethereum any more than Bitcoin is a threat to ethereum or filecoin is a threat to ethereum yeah they're like all of that My Philosophy around layer ones is that oh they all if you're a layer one you compete with other layer ones um you can grow The Pie as well we can all grow the pies but all layer ones want to eat as much of the pie as possible I don't think ethereum's communing with other l1's I think ethereum's competing with nation states I think player ones compete with nation states yes but I think the primary opposition to ethereum today is not Bitcoin and it's not Solana and it's not polygon and it's what goes around Bitcoin except for the market cap which we'll one day get there sure but like the market cap is like the most boring thing about crypto right it's all but it's also like the point do you think it's the point yeah I think layer ones are supposed to be money and layer ones in like market cap and fighting nation states are like very similar and like like we like we said at the beginning uh we have the power smart contracts we can encode values into our native currencies and if you encode good values and the native currency goes up that means you are literally scaling values and so a lot of the values that make up the ethereum ecosystem like pluralism decentralization power to the individual are all in my mind comprised imbued into ether the asset and in order to scale those values to the world we need ether to have a higher market cap so here's my here's my criticism of that is that you're not gonna be able to reach to be egalitarian to reach the world to allow people to go bankless if the transaction fees are twenty dollars yeah right yeah but but here's the thing if eth is money and the idea is everyone transactions results there's a really big logical jump there to say like like the layering of ethereum up to l57s at some point in the future is basically a rebuild of the traditional Financial ecosystem where you start with the fed and then you go out to the commercial Banks and then you go out to the lending Banks and you go out to the retail Banks and you go out to venmo then you go out to the eBay store then you go out to the person selling the thing on eBay and each step in that line is a potential Taxation and value capture point and I don't disagree with that but I don't also think you get to say that they are equivalent the topology of the networks definitely lines up like first you have the global settlement layer which is the ethereum layer one which is the Federal Reserve and then you have the Commercial Banking layer which is the which are the ethereum layer twos and then you have like the stripes which are the the layer three payment chains like the that topology definitely Maps but you also have core unique properties that are also added to this whole stack which also just changed the way that these things are expressed and mainly the the new uh Innovation here is cryptography and we able and cryptography can take and scale Parts the properties of the ethereum layer one all the way to the L 5969 that whatever you want right sure and so like yes the and so like to me it's like yes the the topology wasn't created by the Federal Reserve Commercial Banking layer stripe Etc that was created by Nature Nature created that and ethereum is also mapping on to nature which is the same thing that the old traditional Financial system also mapped onto but ethereum is doing it with better tools that allow for minimized Taxation and maximized value transfers to transference across networks potentially the other version of that is you introduce a lot of security hops you introduce a lot of bridges the things in crypto that get hacked right now are bridges right and so every time you're going see this is our narrative too yeah totally but every time you go up or down a layer you are introducing a point of risk right right and there's a there's a there's an attempt to say that there's no risk involved in settling a transaction to the base layer one and that is just not true there is a lot of amazing work that's been done to reduce that risk dramatically it is not zero uh and I think that's just like worth worth noting here that like there is a there is a amazing egalitarian beautiful future where the ethereum stack and all of its layers ends up being something that feels much more integrated feels much more fair feels like it delivers much of the value it would as if it were in one Global State like the original eth2 design there's also a potential future where you know uh as people cycle out of the ethereum ecosystem as more people come into the ethereum ecosystem the Val there's nothing to to use your terminology there's nothing natural about the values of ethereum the values of ethereum are actually fairly weirdly anti-capitalist in from a perspective and it's great right it is actually this amazing social experiment and there's so much amazing stuff that's been made possible here I just I'm not sure that um those values can survive contact with JP Morgan and Raytheon and what we've generally seen is that when extreme extreme multinational corporate capitalism gets involved in systems it extracts value like what the private Equity firms have done to the Health Care system in the United States is like not accidental it's incredibly intentional and I I think when we're thinking about system architectures over a many many year Horizon reducing the points of potential capture and interference I think is a really good objective to have and so to bring this back to Solana right the The View there is that the socially safest thing to do is to keep everything in one Global State and that's not to say ethereum can't be successful in its drive to do this but we've already seen from a lot of other l1s that they're already like parachans are already facing capture problems right there's there's a lot of other things and maybe ethereum is is big enough and mature enough and sort of uh you know has the resolve for lack of a better term to escape that and to be able to actually get past it statistically there's only a few countries in the world that have ever done that most countries Fall prey to Resource capture most countries are authoritarian most countries have really unhealthy economic systems and maybe ethereum can get past that but like that is a big bet to make that anyone else can play that move and so that's kind of where from a philosophical standpoint Solana is choosing to do a zag where ethereum did a zig and that doesn't mean that it's better or worse it just is I think two very different expressions of trying to end up in a similar Place yeah we're definitely I would definitely agree that that is the correct articulation for like what we're doing here and why why we're designing the networks in the way that we're designing them the ethereum perspective will flip it flip it around and say like the ethereum layer one is deeper than any sort of corrupting influence corrupting Corporation will ever be able to get to it it's too deep in the stack it's too it's very very uh like metaphysically low and uh so like we have this old thesis called the protocol sync thesis this which yeah the most socially scalable and the most legitimate protocols sync sync to the bottom of the stack and if you are a corrupting influence of Raytheon like with capitalist interests whatever like the layer the role of centric roadmap of ethereum like a big big old uh not old big ships Big like container ships if they like run into ground or they run into an iceberg like a modern Titanic they're like compartmentalized right so like water will get in but it'll only get into like one small cell of the hull of the ship and it won't spread and that's that's how I would consider the roll-up Centric roadmap to ethereum like they can try and like we have the JP Morgan chain Quorum or whatever which is like a Geth Fork that no one really uses like they can make their own roll up and they can corrupt that as much as they want but they can't it won't spread it won't spread to the other chains and that because of the power of cryptography yeah and so like in getting deep getting down to the layer one and impacting ethereum governance super hard that's the hardest thing that that you can do because that's when you also you start to fight the social consensus as well not just the cryptography the ethereum perspective on Salon is like it's only one network you have one point of insertion if you get that thing then then the whole the whole system is corrupted like there's only one cell to puncture and all of a sudden you you have the entire stack and so like jump Capital making their client that gives ethereum people the heebie-jeebies like I don't want jump Capital making a client and then I will not download that software and so that that would be like the re-articulation from from the opposing perspective yeah I guess like when we're looking at like market cap capture right like the the thing Elon Musk did with Twitter right buy up a bunch of stock in secret in dark and then suddenly come out and say hey I own 10 of Twitter I want to buy the whole thing or I'm going to ruin your life that's not impossible to do on any L1 right you you could the theory of market cap is only 224 billion dollars today yeah right that is um a lot of money that is not an amount of money that is an opposition to potentially over time larger and larger chunks getting bought up right we see already with the trusts that exist and sort of the centralization of some custody it's not an ethereum problem this is sort of across across the space that the proof of stake is much more resilient than proof of work to capture but it is not immune from it and so the idea that you're you know you're spot on that like yes like if if polygon gets taken over by a bunch of like you know private Equity Firm folks you can just sort of cut off that tree and say all right polygon's dead we're gonna we're gonna not build on that thing anymore the base layer is still is still not immune to capture even if there's stuff on top of it that can be lopped off and I think the place you see this which is sort of a Counterpoint is Solana validators are pretty hard to run right and what that means is they're not run on AWS right and and if you look at the percentage of eth that's on AWS it's quite High compared to something like Solana now Solana like there's lots of other downsides or one of those downsides is that you have to run these things bare metal that's harder to do that is one of those things that like is a Counterpoint that capture problem now it's a very different solution to the capture than what ethereum's done but I think they're very spiritually similar approaches to preventing those sorts of problems from happening but yeah like I think as we go into the future no one no one can really say what's going to happen here um we all just need to figure out what are the best defense mechanisms to prevent the sort of bad scenarios from happening that we don't want to have happen well Austin uh this actually went in a different direction than specifically focusing on solely asset but I think that was actually probably the The Logical conclusion of where this goes because of the point of talking about what is sold the asset is to talk about what are the values of Solana the ecosystem and so I think this conversation did a fantastic job of uh peeling back the layers for a lot of people who haven't been too exposed for that in the bankless audience because we just don't talk about Solana too much so Austin thank you for helping me navigate this conversation hey thanks for having me on it's uh it's always fun to chat with you so banquilization if you like this conversation you want more of that let us know on Twitter or in the Discord but in the meantime crypto is risky ethereum is risky d5's risky Layer Two is a risky Salon is also risky you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the backless Journey thanks a lot thank you foreign
