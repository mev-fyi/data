this is one of these tweets where like I just like I just sit and pause and be like who the who the hell is this Ryan Sean Adams man my mind goes to like all right he's an AI so he just like did Google searching and came up with this so that would that's just normal or he's a Taylor Swift fan and like had this one ready to go or he's a he's a dad of a of a teenage daughter it could be all three things at once we just don't know and I think you have to be comfortable David if we're gonna continue this podcast every week is living in that ambiguity oh you know like you just don't really know Bagel Station happy second Friday of the month David tell them what time it is oh it's the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in this goddamn bear Market which is an especially ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless no matter what corner of the globe we're Tuning In from which is a little bit different for me this week Ryan yeah yeah you're West Coast West Coast David's back yeah back in the U.S beautiful beautiful city of San Diego yeah yeah most of the demise of my mother that I didn't decide to go back to Seattle yeah you went a little south of uh of your mom but you know she could always meet you in San Diego right it could be a rendezvous point oh yeah that would be insulting to her okay so the intro though you said bear Market but we sounded so like like upbeat and enthusiastic and I felt some energy there like I feel okay do I feel coming to this episode David is like uh a weight has been lifted off my shoulders oh yeah oh I feel light November was not a great month for crypto no but that could have been the worst month ever in fact do you know how you feel like after you say you feel after you fast yeah for a couple days you got kind of the energy you got I don't know if you yeah I call it my manic David yeah yeah in a good way in a good way yeah once in a while yeah Kanye Westway but like once in a while uh you know you'll DM me and you'll be like it's yeah I got some ideas I'm like okay it's manic David and it I don't say that I'm like it's fasted David anyway how I feel I feel like we've got detoxed and like I'm just feeling even though it's a bear Market Clarity and thought uh like long-term time Horizons yeah just like fundamental optimism yeah okay all right excited about 2023. are you feeling that Vibe or is it just I want to get to 2023 so bad not because time is a construct but like I don't know June January 1st 2023 like I can we get there please because then everything just goes away and we just reset right all right yeah yeah it goes away we could forget in jail uh crypto prices are up only this is what I'm promised we pay we get some uh sensible regulation for D5 passed right well it's vitalik is elected president he's Canadian I don't know man a lot of good things maybe in 2023 we'll see all right let's talk about the topics of the week though this is the state in the bear Market where we just make sure dude no this is a real thing that happened Apple versus coinbase Apple thinks it can tax crypto David someone who's gonna tell him who's going to tell them that they can't tax eat gas fees we're gonna talk about that no one seems to be able to tell Apple no which is kind of the crazy thing uh and so today we're gonna we have to talk about that uh also we got some data some some uh fallout some actual numbers to talk about when when it comes to uh contagion out of Genesis and Gemini earned so we'll give you the numbers that we occurred uh that was reported and then also coming in hot you'll never guess Ryan who SPF hired as a lawyer uh I kind of feel like this this whole SPF story is coming to a close I might have said that before on previous Roll-Ups But like everyone last week we were confused as to what the hell SBF was doing on his like public tour of talking to everyone now I feel like we kind of know what he's up to and that and we've got some clarity there so that's what that's what's coming up in the big news of the week and he's got his lawyer you don't you don't hire a lawyer when things are going well so uh we'll see who that is in the show you'll never guess the name pretty crazy actually hey but before we get into it gotta shout out our friends and sponsors at opolis who have a very special message for the bankless nation they want to provide you with Health Care going into 2023. that's real important if you're a contractor if you're working for a dow tell monopolis is and what are they offering today for bankless listeners uh because of the burdens of nation-state employment and other things in this life that we live things like Health Care things like payroll taxes uh working on the frontier of web3 is difficult how as a dow worker or as an nft artist or as I don't know a yield farmer do you podcaster Well yeah if you don't if you don't have a company that you work for but you're making money how do you get health care uh Healthcare in the United States is super expensive especially as an individual soopolis is a co-op for all the web 3 workers on the frontier who want to band together and web3 fashion to come andopolis will negotiate for advantaged rates on your behalf opolis it's a co-op so that means when you sign up for opulence you also become an owner of opolis and opolis just does things to help you with your burdensome nation state infrastructure that you need again Health Care payroll taxes all this kind of stuff and there is a link in the show notes to get started and if you get started if you get uh going with opolis by December 31st of 2022 so that's like 20 days you will get a thousand work the token for office and a thousand Bank tokens uh so do allow Oculus to help you do what you do best which is explore the frontier but with Healthcare web3 Workers Unite it's what we need a lot to build and so we don't need a lot of work to get done David let's talk about markets before we get into building what is bitcoin looking at this week we got the happy music or sad Bitcoin yeah it's got no music it is flat it is super flat on the week down zero percent like literally zero percent yeah it was it came pretty damn close to zero percent yeah and so what is that what number are we looking at about six seven two yeah the number 17 000. 17 000 Bitcoin 17 000 even that's pretty crazy uh how about eth up or down uh sad sad so it sounds for eth uh down two and a half percent start of the week at 12.90 ending the week where it currently is at 12 50. although it is surging as of this morning up to 12 57. all right well I can calculate the ratio in my head I bet it's down two and a half percent am I right that's about right that's the correct math this is math that I can understand yeah my ratio is down about two and a half percent on the week we are down to 0.074 no real signal right now we're just hanging out in December this is interesting a flat week is interesting in these types of markets uh so do we feel like this is consistent with what we believe has been the case where the last Domino has kind of fallen or it's you know it's wobbled and we kind of know the contagion that's already happened and we're getting into this flat period of time what do you think um sorry I just got distracted by trading view because I have it open on my phone eth just pumped to 1283 so we are uh only down 1.5 percent on the week Ryan again and none of this will matter by the time why do we do this I don't know but we're gonna keep doing it every week we'll tell you 24 hour out of date numbers and uh you know you can enjoy them or not uh is are is this emblematic of so yeah you know bad news but it's uh it's going on like still like everyone hates crypto out risk regulation all that stuff but price prices are flat I feel like that's a pretty acceptable sign of like strength bad news but flat prices equals some signal of strength yeah yeah flat prices better than down prices that's the kind of analysis you guys tune in for uh every week all right we are uh under a trillion too what's the crypto market cap give us those numbers David can you hit refresh just so so we're at 884 billion if Iran hits refresh 889 billion look we just added 5 billion onto the market cap putting us at flat on the week because last week it was 890 billion flat on the week there we go flat flat flat it's a flat week uh which is okay and it bear Market to have it's better than the alternative David um we've got to talk a little bit about the bottom signals because that's really what folks are listening to and I think we've talked about it in the section markets the last couple of Roll-Ups and we got some more bottom signaling stuff are these bottom signals or not you don't really know until they're like for sure about them but some hypothesis the ultimate bottom signal caller is Jim Cramer if he tells you to sell you better buy you better it's probably a bottom and uh Jim Crainer Kramer of course this is the host of Mad Money who you know and love the great stock predictor he says uh investors should exit crypto in quotes it's never too late to sell is what Jim says um I don't know I'm super bullish after I'm hearing this from Jim Crainer Kramer what's your take on this so crypto Twitter and just find it fin Finn twit just makes so much fun of Jim Cramer because he is the herd he is the herd mentality he is the middle of the curve uh and like he told people to buy coin at 400 150 when it IPO like it has all of these terribly wrong takes and actually if you think about it Ryan his business model for Mad Money makes sense because he's trying to get attention attention and so like he doesn't want if you are contrarian you don't want to be a contrarian as like uh somebody who's trying to get eyeballs as like a TV show right you want to dish out what everyone wants to hear if ever if you're trying to have maximum reach maximum you want to have a consensus opinion you want to have consensus opinion uh and that if you just have consensus opinion in the markets you're not going to do well have being uh Smart in the markets is about having contrarian bets so this is not just a meme this is like it's aligned with his business model for mad money so Jim Cramer urges investors to exit crypto it's never too late to sell if you want to be a contrarian you would do the opposite I actually think that's that's a good take on Tim Kramer it's not that he's always wrong it's just that he is emblematic of consensus opinion and this is consensus opinion he says because this takes change every two weeks it's never too late to sell an awful position and that's what you have if you own these so-called digital Assets in awful position lumping every single digital asset together they're all the same and it's never too late I mean this is how people get totally wrecked on the dips here uh anyway maybe a bottom signal here's another one David what are we looking at here just eight percent of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrencies now a CNBC survey finds this is published on December 7th on Wednesday uh I and when I read this article uh Ryan I was just so reminded of 2018 of just like positive view of crypto in 2017 very negative view of crypto in 2018 yes it's just consensus it's just the herd mentality uh so if you're telling me that only only eight percent of Americans have positive views of crypto like that just sounds like a bomb signal and of course the survey is happening right after FTX like people are just thinking about out crypto for the first time in months and they're like oh yeah FTX is bad therefore crypto is bad yeah well I have a more negative view of crypto I would say probably over the past you know month um I mean I mean if you ask me this poll I'm gonna like but that doesn't mean I'm not long-term bullish um and by the way this number is eight percent now it was 19 in March so we got our own happening here a little cut in half this is pretty consistent I think with the the conversation it's also consistent with like pricing and everything else is what you'd start to expect as we as we hit towards the bottom um eight percent I'm still okay eight percent have a positive view That's the Silver Lining that's not too bad a chance you guys know what crypto is at least uh what's this chart we're looking at yeah this is the new record low of the gbtc discounts so buying one share of the grayscale Bitcoin trust is 47 discounted to how many Bitcoins is backing it so in theory if you could redeem those Bitcoins and you bought one bitcoin's worth of the gbtc uh trust now you would get roughly 1.5 Bitcoins if you could redeem them but you can't if Mr Gensler will convert that to an ETF then you should be able to redeem it so this is uh some sort of regulatory I don't know what you call that tomfoolery if you have the longest term time Horizons could be a good buy it could be not Financial advice um you know we did an entire episode on gbdc so if folks you're wondering what ubdc is uh your thesis David is that gbtc is what started this whole thing right the whole it is the Lynch it is the thing that really start started the bull market so you can't really be too angry but then also the reason why it's been crashing down yeah it's the first Domino um anyway there's an episode what's that episode titled what do we end up calling that uh it was the thumbnail is uh grayscale and G and Genesis contagion but uh it that we renamed it was it to was 2021 just a gigantic Ponzi which for the answer is kind of yes you're supposed to T is not given the answer okay uh but yes it was a patsy um okay what's this what what's this chart that we're looking at this is the coin price the coinbase uh coin token Jesus stock guess top the traditional tokens yeah uh which uh coinbase is coming in at a whopping nine billion dollar total market cap valuation what do you mean whopping you mean whopping like that's so low bad bad yeah that's so low 9 billion extremely low don't we have like alternative layer ones that are way higher than nine billion dollars right now right so coinbase for for context uniswap coming in at where what's the unit swap price I think like six and at six dollars and a quarter uh that is a valuation of about six billion dollars so coinbase is 50 more value than uniswap and uni token doesn't even have any legal guarantees on uh investor protections yes right uh and and uh you remind her that defy tokens are just tokens and we don't know what they are well there's hope but you know um yeah and by the way there's uh there's news of more discussion about uni token fees being flipped on but also that is really close I mean wouldn't it be crazy if uniswap token price flipped from a market cap perspective coin what does that mean does this mean coin is like silly low or like what does this mean coin is silly low coin is silly low I think the coin the vet the equity of coinbase is going to outperform 99 of tokens that you see on coin gecko let me put it this way uh Jim Cramer would be telling you to sell your coin right now let's put it that way it's not too late not too late to sell your coin uh speaking of all of these token prices uh one of the things our analyst team at bankless puts together is what we call the bankless token Bible and this is um kind of an analyst in a box service if you're a bankless premium member I'm actually showing some of it here but this is usually yeah Brian's leak in the alpha I shouldn't be leaking this Alpha in fact I'll flip off the the page but this is like a master spreadsheet of our overweight underweight kind of scores from our analyst team and you can sort of see why it's kind of a a beta version of the product of what it will be in the next launch of our uh banklist 2.0 website two 2.0 launches yeah yeah but it's something I wanted to just shout out because our team's doing a fantastic job and I don't think we talk about this very often but like you can click in through balancer and look right now this is all just like Google doc pages so you can see how it's like kind of raw uh underweight underweight for Aptos why are we underweight for Aptos um oh I don't know let's go read about it and see what what Ben the analyst put into the dock that's right uh Ben by the way is a fantastic analyst on our team um he's where we get all of our uh our defy Alpha uh anyway we we have that all available to bank list premium members so it's just just a shout out um to uh to upgrade so you can see what that looks like and all of this we'll be redesigning our new website speaking of token prices um David let's talk about this um this was a tweet I saw from Jacob frantic and this is a tweet about stablecoin market cap all right so about a year ago February 27th we had 166 billion dollars worth of stable coins on chain issued this isn't all this kind of stable coins right so centralized decentralized December 4th 139 billion so down not by a dramatic amount but down by about like what 25 million something like 27 27 billion uh David did the math I did the math there it's interesting that busd is the uh the stable coin that's growing the only stable equipment that's growing not Contracting but what was more interesting to me about this is do you remember um Jim bianco's thesis so Jim Bianco repeat bankless podcast friend and uh just a fantastic views on on traditional markets but also like knows an incredible amount about like crypto and D5 and like really digs in he's an S tier individual I I love Jim beyond go follow Jim Bianco on Twitter Jim if you're listening man we appreciate you uh he he had kind of a thesis he asked actually asked our opinion on and I was like I don't know Jim that sounds right you should write you should write more about this his thesis was um defy the liquidity for Defy is through stablecoin so if you want to measure kind of the economic bandwidth of defy right we'll put it another way if you if you want D5 to grow stablecoin market cap has to grow and so we have about 140 billion dollars of stablecoin economic bandwidth in defy and if we want to 10x D5 we need to 10x the stable coin value and and specifically 10x D5 prices to be to be specific token prices like all things like liquidity using liquidity is the underlying Foundation which makes sense especially after we've done all of our Federal Reserve macro episodes yes everyone is like yeah the fed the markets are addicted to liquidity uh when we're pulling liquidity out of the market everything's selling so it makes sense along those lines if you give more stable coin liquidity to defy yields go up token prices go up things everything else above it goes up so first of all GM or some other talented uh listener should do some analysis on this and run the data and do some kind of like you know models uh with with historical data and see to what extent this is played out and what the correlation is but also I'm interested to look at this over time as sort of a leading indicator if you want to see D5 start to recover we might need to see that stablecoin value on chain tick up and hit from 140 billion 200 billion 300 billion this might be some kind of a bullish sign to proceed a run-up uh anyway good thesis there yeah um if you're wondering what an S tier individual is s is above a uh I'm glad you explained that for me uh the trend continues people going bankless David what's this uh yeah Will Clemente says tweets out over the last 30 days 200 000 Bitcoins reminder out of 21 million 200 000 bitcoins worth 3.4 billion dollars has been moved off exchanges I don't think there's ever been a greater migration of Bitcoins or probably value in General off of centralized exchanges uh in since custody wallets uh well even even before Mount Cox right like you can't even see me yeah all the red here yeah well this is yeah I think you're right is this well that's because it's measured in dollars yeah more in Bitcoin but dollars you're right yeah wow yeah biggest red over time uh we've ever seen that's incredible I mean people are just like I don't trust six stages see you later self-custody going bankless uh that's not how I wanted it to happen but okay uh so I saw these two tweets out of token terminal that I wanted to include in here so this is a developer activity overlaid by price for two ecosystems where first we're looking at Cosmos developer activity looks like the start of a bull run it starts it starts to look like a very healthy line up that's the green line that's the green that's a steady kind of upward trajectory for the last over the last two years yeah exactly yeah uh and then I mean we all know the price the price is largely uncorrelated although the cosmos token actually is kind of like up and to the right it has this like middle chunk which is definitely a mani manic bear a bull market it uh but now we're like at the trend that it was before the bull market in like 2019 to 2020. not manic just just fully fasted and full of energy Jesus let me tell you I was not fasting during the bull market uh and then so we kind of flip over to it we can compare this to the ethereum Chart which is the the next tweet uh ethereum I actually saw a for some reason a drop-off in developer activity in the last like couple months or so um but uh uh you could have you can over get this overlay developer activities still over like the long term at all absolute all-time highs and the youth price is at a very much higher floor than it was in 2018. I just thought these were interesting I think they're interesting now my big question in this if you want to get to kind of the the second question is okay but does your atom token map to developers in the cosmos ecosystem because this is like it's not the Empire model that ethereum is where all value flows back to eat the token right because of the mechanism design but Cosmos it's not necessarily true in any respect that all value leads back to the atom token it could accrue in other app chains inside of Cosmos right which is which is the Bold case of the cosmos thesis is that the value does accrue elsewhere and that's exactly the big advantages and and selling points of the cosmos ecosystem exactly which is why of course you can't like um you have to understand the space in order to like you can't take a Jim Cramer level we're picking on Jim today you can't take a Jim Cramer level like analysis look these two charts and be like well it means this because this number is going up here it means this number in this other ecosystem you have to you have to think about it uh more fully uh David uh what else we got coming up next my friend coming up next coinbase versus Apple does Apple even understand crypto do they even care uh a lot of people seem to be going up against Apple how many more until it takes for something to happen there I don't know but we're going to talk about it uh and then we've got some data out of Genesis and Gemini Urn to share uh and SPF of course we got to tie the bow on the SPF conversation because like I said in the intro I finally feel like we know what SPF is up to or at least I'll give my takes uh all this stuff and more right after we talk to some things fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless arbitrim1 is pioneering the

get started coinbase and apple in a head-to-head Apple wanting to tax D5 Transit transactions and crypto transactions and coinbase not liking it David you have the Tweet thread here let's look at coinbase's position on things and give some of our takes what's coinbase saying yeah so they tweeted out uh out of the coinbase wallet so this is from the coinbase wallet not coinbase yeah so important small differentiator uh you might have noticed you can't send nfts on the coinbase iOS wallet anymore this is because Apple blocked our last app release until we disabled the feature the feature of being able the feature of being able to send nfts Apple was like you guys have to block that before you update your app okay so coinbase wallet is like a non-custodial uh self-custodial wallet it's a bankless wallet it's not they're not their full custodial solution we're talking about the wallet just like metamask only on your on your phone and this basic functionality of sending an nft from one place to another just like sending an erc20 or eth from one place to another saying staple points making a payment yep they had to disable that because Apple blocked them yes because because the Apple says you guys have to block that feature before we allow you guys to push that app update uh and so the the uh tweet the Tweet thread continues and says Apple's claim is that the gas fee required to send nfts need to be paid through their in-app purchase system so they can collect 30 of the gas fee what wait of course and so I think the next week just really summarizes this for anyone who understands how nfts and blockchains work this is clearly not possible Apple's proprietary in-app purchase system does not support crypto so we couldn't comply even if we tried okay so Apple wants coinbase wallet to send them 30 of the gas fee that it takes to send an nft if coinbase wallet were to do this they would have to pass that Pro that charge on to the customer so they would have to take the gas fee and add on 30 so that they could pay Apple but then then there's a new number and then you would have to actually add on take 30 of that new amount of that 30 because like that's the new number that Apple would have to take it's it's it doesn't make any sense it's shocking to me that um Apple thinks it can do this you're talking about we're talking about a a an eth transaction theory that is not nothing to do with coinbase this is the base protocol fee inside of ethereum and gas prices are set by the market block space Demand versus block space Supply and whatever the the demand is going for so the gas fee can be different every single transaction it could be a dollar it could be five dollars it could be twenty dollars and you're saying that Apple wants 30 of that yeah it's kind of night not coin basis to give do you know what I mean like yeah they would like they're trying to they're trying to tax ethereum 30 and say hey if you want to use ethereum you got to pay us 30 of the fee what else do they say one of the important tweets that I liked was that uh the biggest impact of this policy change is on iPhone users that own nfts if you hold an nft in a wallet on an iPhone Apple just made it a lot harder to transfer that nft to other wallets or gift it to friends or family this one hit home for me Ryan because there was one time I I uh we were we were at bankless gifted uh cool cats by William peaster he minted them sent them all to us uh and then then uh I passed my cool cat along to a friend using uh metamask mobile I had on my metamask wallet I sent it to a friend uh who went down the crypto Rabbit Hole so hard left her job became a marketer uh for a crypto job because of I sent her a cool cat with a mobile wallet so I have a personal story about like how I onboarded a person by sending them a cool cat because of a Mobile Transfer right spontaneous moment definitely wouldn't have done it if I had waited to get home to a ledger uh we just did so like this is just Apple just being uh like a baron uh and just like a landowner this is like racketeering it's like it's like a feudal Lord like like so and this tweet above from coinbase says this is akin to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open internet protocols yeah imagine that if there was a tax that iOS charge for internet protocols and for email yeah um so Apple I don't know the the debate here is does Apple know what they're doing or do they not know what they're doing do they know the significance of this choice or are they just being like errant I don't know I think it's interesting that um we haven't heard anything yet from metamask about them blocking metamask which of course you have the same functionality in metamask or other mobile wallets like Phantom so um maybe it's an oversight at the same time like I haven't heard of this being remedied and it's like seven days later from when coinbase is tweeting this and just the um wow how do they not know this just like the idea that they could take this yeah it's pretty egregious and I think this is this is not crypto is not the only industry that's facing this I mean Tim Sweeney from from epic games has talked about Apple's Monopoly power um and basically making it such that um in-app purchases or like in-game purchases all have to throw through this land baron and this feudal Lord uh they get a cut of everything and they're adding no value in the process this is just rent seeking behavior isn't it and you can only do run seeking Behavior if you have a monopoly and in this case um I mean I have an iPhone right I have do you have 17 Apple products okay so they kind of like they have that power over consumers and uh I don't I don't know how you get this to stop obviously the free market approaches uh competitors and you disrupt apple and you create kind of a different mobile experience that's more open um there's also the regulatory approach where some nation state says now we have a bigger stick and we'll whack you and our menopause bigger than yours we have a we have a military so uh um that's the other way things get done um but I don't know where this ends it's just uh pretty egregious isn't it yeah that's the conversation that I've seen outside of crypto Twitter outside of crypto media is that like apple wants to take 30 of everything uh I think I saw that in like a tech crunch article that that headline uh and at some point it just gets down to like antitrust at some point we're just gonna take there's an enough of a cohort of people that are offended by Apple trying to rake them of 30 that people just don't they make enough money on their like the hardware that they sell they're great products like that's I don't think you can ask a company to try and make less money I don't think make less money yeah apple you should make less money uh we'll see what Tim Cook says Tim Cook on bankless uh let's go all right what's this Genesis Genesis okay uh how much did Gemini customers have in Gemini earn that went to Genesis the answer to that is 900 million dollars which is kind of just shy of a billion dollars in German this is just in Gemini earn so this is not our Genesis obligations we're now focused because there is money stuck for retail in Gemini earned and um it's to the tune of 900 million that Genesis owes Gemini yep what does this mean David I don't know I don't know um like people were talking about like the winklevi just making Gemini uh earned customers whole and I was like oh in theory it's possible they're billionaires they're billionaires they check that's a big check that's a really big check I don't think they'd do that well um what is the correspondence to the feedback from uh from Genesis and Gemini have they talked about this this is a headline that says Genesis says plans to resolve lending units woes could take weeks in quotes So I mean Genesis is still gonna take you over on that one months kind of thing yeah um I don't know man I don't know so that's this is there wasn't too much data beyond what was those two articles 900 million may take weeks to resolve it's gonna take months we'll keep you guys updated on this uh David you said you had some final insights into SPF like you feel like that is starting to uh to wind down um and you said Nick Carter was right what is he right about is this a whole tweet thread or should I go to a specific thing here so the top tweet uh is a tweet that we shared last week on the weekly roll up when we collectively as SPF was going through his public media tour talking to everyone making them look like fools by the way uh uh people were giving their takes uh this is why because it's very bizarre behavior seem non-rational exactly so one of the takes that we shared was Sam isn't behaving like a renegade who is ignoring the advice of his lawyers he's behaving like a world-class like he has a world-class crisis management firm and legal team constructing a very specific and deliberate public narrative that's one of the takes that we shared from Nick Carter 4D Chess Sam was doing this all intentionally he knows exactly what he's doing yep yep uh God now whenever I say yep I'm like that's what Sam says when uh long pause anyways uh SPF a tweet went out uh this week SPF of FTX has hired Mike Cohen Mark Cohen as his attorney Cohen recently defended Galen Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial and defended El Chapo prior to that and the Carter says takes a Victory lap and he says like as I said yes he's got a rockstar legal defense wow all right so when I first saw this first of all I thought it was Michael Cohen it's not Michael Cohen all right this is a different Cohen this is a guy named Mark Cohen yeah and he's the lawyer who defended Maxwell yeah for in sex trafficking case and El Chapo Epstein thing yeah the Epstein thing and El Chapo the drug lord yeah so this gets higher than that no this is who you hire when you are like a hardened criminal but like at least El Chapo I don't know about Max well and you're super wealthy God can you imagine being like if being a client of a lawyer and your other fellow clients are Galen Maxwell and El Chapo like you're not in a good spot no uh yeah well you know how many lawyers would apply for this type of a job I don't yeah you know I don't know the other joke about this when this was going out was that like Sam bankman free said that he only has a hundred thousand dollars left in his bank account so who's paying for this wait he said that yeah yeah yeah a couple times people ask him like all right so like how much money you have left Sam he's like I've got one credit card that works and I think I've got like a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account no way so so who's paying this guy oh my God so yeah no crypto he has no crypto assets allegedly I don't believe a single damn word out of that man's mouth Yeah well yeah um go on what else do you think about this story What's Happening Here Yeah so there was an interaction between SBF and Maxine Waters which drew a lot of attention uh which is uh the next tweet Ryan if you want to hop over to that one and refresh us who is uh Maxine Waters she is on the U.S House Committee of financial services right um so she's in the house uh previously seen before FTX collapse blowing a kiss to SPF in as he walked out of his hearing that he had way long ago like in uh in real life kiss yes out of a hearing in Congress yes bloom a kiss uh because he donated billions of dollars to her and and the Democrats but that's on like TV that's online it's on TV or something and you're blowing a kiss yes seems like strange as he walks out yeah anyways uh Maxine Waters and uh co-tweeted with uh the uh as Finance senate committee Democrat Twitter account she goes SPF we appreciate that you've been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX your willingness willingness to talk to the public will help the company's customers investors and others to the end we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th what is this tone this is really soft this is on December 2nd right so we appreciate that you've been candid in your discussions about what happened at FDX he has not been candid no he's about what happened there it is magazine yeah he has been the farthest thing from what's the opposite of candid he has been opaque he has been lying yes about what's what's happened at uh FTX so this is the the soft glove treatment I don't know what this is so she later tweeted out a harder sounding tweet because that didn't play over well yes I that because that did not play over well yeah certainly uh so so here's her replacement tweet uh that come came out uh the next day or maybe 48 hours later yeah a few days later yeah based on your role as as CEO and your media interviews over the past few weeks it's it's clear to us that the information you have thus far is sufficient for Testimony as you know the collapse of FTX has harmed over one million people your testimony would not only be meaningful to members of Congress but also critical to the American people it's imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th and we are willing to schedule uh schedule continued hearings if there's more information to be shared why is this a request why are we asking SBF nicely yeah why hasn't the goddamn Navy gone over to the Bahamas and taken SPF by the caller and dragged him to a courthouse how come we haven't done this yet why are we sending out like the wedding invitation shouldn't we be sending out subpoenas it's not yes isn't that within Maxine Waters why haven't we subpeded him okay so Kevin owaki put that into a meme if you want to scroll down it's like right there yeah okay let me scroll down there it is uh and so this is the classic bell curve meme right so you have Maxine Waters in the middle who's like being sad and requesting it's imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th and then the the the left side and the right side of the curve are like just subpoena him make him show up yeah you could do that use the guns that we have FDX bankruptcy managers hire a forensic a forensic investigators uh according to the Wall Street Journal so we're getting that stage in the process we're trying to figure out where all the money went right yes forensic investigators are Alex Partners uh have been hired this consultancy firm to trace billions of dollars that have gone missing and their previous job a previous job that they had was helping recover the stolen funds in the Bernie Madoff case again not the Sam bankman freeze cohort is very strong look at this picture of Sam I love that they use this it's very strange um oh this was crazy okay so apparently do you know how uh FTX did all of these deals with like Tom Brady and other celebrities influencers every celebrity end of the sign yeah they tried to give Taylor Swift a hundred million dollar sponsorship deal what does it mean she said sir Taylor she said no I think it was like sponsoring like Chris or Stadium uh stadium tour for the next album kind of thing I don't know what else it would mean spokesperson I'm sure 100 million dollars David dude but she said no a part of like the psychological like unpacking of SPF has got to be something along the lines of like kleptomania he can't not give away customer funds he was spraying and praying this stuff from the hip like uh he would like he came in and bought that bank at like three times its values like I don't care vanity things I want to spend customers funds it is a fun activity for me and it's like yeah you know what's fun taking Taylor Swift's fans money in as customer deposits on FTX and then paying Taylor Swift wait wait you think a bunch of Taylor Swift fans are also crypto people I mean like not zero okay so like this is just a gigantic game of like how corrupt sorry can he be I was like I'll take the fans money and then I'll sponsor Taylor Swift and it'll be the biggest group of all time yeah it well it really may have been I mean this is top three grips top five griffs of all time I think and I remember back when we had uh Brian Armstrong on the podcast about a year ago and we're kind of like so uh Brian um Sam's doing all these things like he's got a sports arena he's got Tom Brady he's got all these celebrity endorsements like what are you doing the marketing side and uh Brian was like uh I don't really like we're not a marketing focused company we just build and my God retrospectively that is so refreshing like good job not spending customers funds nice job absolutely ludicrous oh do you see my tweet though about this this is one of these tweets where like I just like I just sit and pause and be like who the who the hell is this Ryan Sean Adams man Ryan shot out of some tweets out because it's tweeting out the headline uh that Taylor Swift declined uh the 100 million dollars uh immediately uh Ryan Sean Adams tweets she knew Sam was trouble when he walked in it's a very underappreciated tweet uh my mind goes to like all right he's an AI so he just like did Google searching and came up with this so that would that's just normal or he's a Taylor Swift fan and like have this one ready to go or he's a he's a dad of a of a teenage daughter you know which I think all three of those things are true it could be all three things at once we just don't know and I think you have to be comfortable David if we're gonna continue this podcast every week is living in that ambiguity oh you know like you just don't really know all right well somebody who accepted sbf's offer Uh Kevin O'Leary paid 15 million dollars to be an FTX spokesperson he was paid right he got 15 million yes he was paid 50 million 15 million dollars of customer deposits went into uh Kevin O'Leary's Pockets uh to be a paid FTX spokesperson uh what is this what is a paid spokesperson what is that role um like it's like an evangelist role but if you're publicly known as being paid it's not then you're just a page still for eth except you're not paid yeah well I mean I'm paid in the sense and but that's a choice that I made no I don't want this money to do that can I just say like high level like I'm disappointed like I'm not but I'm disappointed I'm mainly disappointed that Kevin is doubling down multiple times on how FTX is in espia and he believes that's BF and all that stuff did you actually watch this clip yes I did let's play this clip let's play this clip yes I don't think you should be singing the blues right now at all oh yes I'm seeing the blues why because your 15 million didn't pay enough that's a lot of money that's a paid spokesperson it's a lot of money you didn't have to do much for that that's for that's found that's a different decision that's a different discussion okay you know you can make that decision on your own but yeah so here this is Kevin uh having really no answer to the interview who's asking like you got 15 million dollars like why are you give it back FTX give it back like distance yourself I made a mistake the doubling down is as uh kind of strange at this point like dude your contract's over man yeah you don't have to do this and it's not like the ship has already sunk and you're just like I don't know you're still clinging on to it um and apparently out of all of this David someone is going to begin investigating the SEC and thank you managed to miss FTX what is this tweet that we're reading uh this is from Alexander grief uh new this morning uh representative Richie Torres the Democrat out of New York calls on the government accountability office to investigate the SEC failure to protect the investing public from the egregious mismanagement and malfeasance of FTX I think basically saying hey stop going after the long tail of uh security frauds and unregistered Securities don't go after the long tail go after the big one like do the Davis Kim we should have gotten Sam yeah basically yeah yeah so I'm in full support of investigating the SEC what else we got coming up David it's a hot episode still a few big topics to cover what's coming up yeah getting into more crypto stuff uh the withdrawals hard Fork is coming huh question mark big question mark um brand new spiffy Ledger Hardware wallet which is more screen than it is not screen uh and Ryan and David talk chat gbt uh if you are we're not on Twitter or in hearing about chat GPT it is caught the World by storm especially crypto Twitter uh so we're gonna talk a little bit about AI chat uh and we're gonna have one AI talk to another while I observe uh hell of that and more after we talked to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless the reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media they own our names they restrict our content they monitor our every move and their time is up thanks to our sponsor diesel diesel is a layer one blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize and scale social networks with DSO you can own your own identity content and social graph and take it with you across hundreds of applications already built on the censorship resistant diesel blockchain diesel storage advantages make it finally possible to build infinite State applications that can efficiently store and index large amounts of content and data fully on chain DSO also offers multiple crypto native monetization Primitives for developers and creators including social nfts social Dows social tokens and social tipping so in order to experience the social layer of web 3 go to dieso.com and claim your username that's deso.com if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel network if you have your ether staked you might be able to get that ether back as soon as perhaps March this is always just speculation and rumor but lately the words out of the core dev's mouth have had withdrawal hard fork and March in the same sentence uh this is how 2023 right 2023 right correct yeah this is how this news works right and so like there is no official date there's no official time until uh the core devs come to consensus about the time but right now there have been talks where the words withdrawal and hard fork and March have been in the same sentence uh and so uh now coindesk is now reporting this ethereum developers Target March 2023 for a release of stake to Ether whether or not eip4844 is also included in this hard Fork is TBD that is more of a reach withdrawals are currently being prioritized more than eip4844 uh eip4844 is proto-dink charting um but which brings more scalability right basically there are a lot of other features in these next coming for hard Forks but the two big ones everyone one's talking about are being able to withdraw the stake teeth and this thing called proto-dink charting which is eip4844 which we've done episodes about which makes roll up super cheap and super scalable so you've got withdrawals and kind of more on the scalability side and it's the rumors are it's looking like eip4844 the proto-dang sharding one will probably not make the first yeah it'll be a it'll be a yeah that's probably probably where I put my money maybe this says we'll follow a subsequent hard fork in the fall and the fall is like in quotes who knows we can't predict two hard forts in advance but that's good news we get the the hard Fork uh with but staking withdrawals you're gonna withdrawal anything are you gonna deposit all right so that's gonna I definitely I think there will be a net outflow because of the with the of the locked ether but also that will also be counteracted by the fact that there is a two-way road finally where like there's no lock-up periods will also incur some sort of demand to stake ether as well because the risk I think I I think some people will be like okay now I can withdraw so now I'm willing to deposit because now I have the exactly withdrawal just think about like the product of each staking is now complete therefore more it will be used more yep but I still think in the short term there will be a net outflow because I mean the withdrush is taking with uh deposits have been locked for forever stake it till you make it David it's my plan uh long tail contagious it's like there's some other dominoes maybe falling from the FTX stuff a few Maybe Baby dominoes yeah we might call them hitting D5 what's this one from Maple yeah so Maple Finance is an on-chain under collateralized institutional lending uh Dow product and so it is actually kind of an intersection between the very Rock Solid and hardened defy apps that we all know and love and the more risky Black Box uh centralized borrowers and lenders it's kind of in the middle there it's on chain kind of like D5 stuff so it's fully transparent but it is under collateralized which means that there needs to be underwriting and vetting and institutional only uh borrowers and lenders so that's what Maple is um and so orthogonal trading was both an underwriter and a borrower out of maple finance and orthogonal trading apparently uh was way less solvent than they had made it out to be they were due to to pay back a 10 million usdc loan from one of the maple Finance pools there's not one Central pool with Maple Finance there's many smaller ones they were going to they were due to pay back 10 million dollars on December 4th they did not make that payment uh therefore they have all have all their credit closed uh but then they've realized that orthogonal actually doesn't have any money apparently and had a net set of the 31 million dollars of liabilities out of maple Finance uh that is uh 31 million dollars of a usdc and then an additional five million dollars of wrapped ether and so that left a decent hole in Maple Finance uh and in this one specific pool so the way that they contain the one of the ways that this is different the story's different is that there's actually very little contagion uh inside of maple because they have very distinct isolated isolated pools for this exact purpose so there was no very little to no contagion there so but if you had underwritten that one of these pools uh this pool M11 which is how they denote these things got an 80 haircut it lost 80 percent of the value the total value of all lent loans into Maple was about 30 so Maples lost 30 percent of uh its total asset under management because of this one insolvency wow um so like these are smaller numbers than some of the numbers that we've heard about but is maple going to be fine are they going to recover from this is this part of can the ship um like I don't know if I don't know the answer to that um I think we need this to have uh play out a little bit more but that's actually not where the story ends because Nexus Mutual also had some money inside of maple Finance so Nexus Mutual which is a insurance smart contract and and insurance platform on ethereum lost three million dollars due to this exposure so they were in one of those same pools they were in The Ether pool so they got hit why were they in it was this just part of Treasury yes treasury management yep wow so this wasn't even part of the Nexus protocol it wasn't like a hack that went bad and that they had to kind of provide insurance for it was like we have some treasury funds and we're gonna put it here in order to get higher yield and the cost to them was uh five million dollars three million dollars for that million dollars 1.6 of all of Nexus mutual's assets wow treasury management very important to to get these risks into uh into the market huh I would say just like this the the hybrid position of between D5 and C5 it kind of does map out to how much damage there was not complete dead but pretty badly harmed I kind of felt chase a yield chasing yield can be a pretty bad game to play yield is just got a bad name these days like because because if you even get like 10 yield right I mean like um are the chances greater than 10 um that the protocol you're in could like die or like about once every 10 years the protocol in your if it's greater than that then like you're actually not making a risk adjusted return dude vitalik gave us that take on one of our podcast episodes with him like over a year ago fatalik was here yeah it was saying that the D5 yield risks were underappreciated back in like 2020. what are you doing now though we need to know it didn't matter when prices go up it only matters the risks only show up and prices go down totally totally what's Bitcoin doing David this is kind of exciting get coin and UNICEF okay so Bitcoin has been one of the big pillars of the ethereum ecosystem for a very long time and it's always been pretty insular it's ethereum funding other parts of ethereum um this is a story of quadratic funding and git coin breaking out to the outside through UNICEF so Bitcoin is launching its first ever quadratic funding round on its new grants protocol in collaboration with unicef's office of innovation between December 9th and December 16th so the same get coin system that you know but now for unisf so that's really cool select group of 10 impact Focus Innovative projects using blockchain or AI Technologies for social good from around the world including Nepal Kenya Argentina Brazil and the Philippines uh this round will be the first of five test rounds to run on get coins new grants protocol as a part of bitcoin's alpha Test season this launch signals the beginning of gitcoins transition to a decentralized protocol that will allow any Community to coordinate its own grants funding round very cool very cool we like this I love that yeah if we could start showing how crypto can start to fund public goods as Nations States not our own public goods but other people's public as nonprofits my as the real world might it will increase the legitimacy and uh coordinating power of crypto um I know that's what Kevin owaki is is the whole time if you donate in this grants round there are Pro apps for you to collect done for the Pro app uh Maxis out there have at it uh Aztec and uh ethereum privacy they're making some strides here David what's the stat we're looking at there is now 50 000 shielded eth inside of Aztec connect so asset connect is it's just a fundamentally better product than uh tornado cash the the cryptography is just more solid uh and they've got 50 000 eth inside of Aztec connect so 60 million dollars is of ether is now being sent an earning yield privately uh that's actually not the only set but that's kind of the first big one uh they got some other stuff uh down there as well I think it was something like uh 500 000 Trend uh transactions on the network um and then uh 5 000 blocks on the Aztec Layer Two uh this is um this is a layer two that's completely private and that's why you say it's better because it's better than tornado cash is because it's um lower gas fees it's not on Main net and it has a layer two level uh settlement guarantees and it's also very scalable uh one other benefit too is of course you don't have to go to jail if you're a U.S citizen and you use this thing that's kind of nice isn't it I would say actually you're understanding it a little bit because the the thing about wait I do have to go to jail no you don't have to go why why is Aztec better than tornado Cash Tornado cash is privacy via the crowd so it pools all of your money together uh and and then you just Ming co-mingle it up actually it's technically not true but it appears to be like that you blend in like privately by numbers kind of thing yes and time and so you need to hang out in tornado cash for a long amount of time to achieve privacy the more the more money that you have to become private the longer you need to hang out Aztec is atomic privacy one transaction of privacy you can go into the pool and out of the pool instantaneously and you have the full strength and power of Aztec privacy so tornado needs to have big crowds in order to protect your privacy and for some Assets in some pools those crowds are too small to really provide you an identity Shield especially when they uh make it illegal for you to be in the pool yeah yeah um as we know okay that's cool I think a disclaimer Ryan and I are investors in Aztec uh also disclaimer we love privacy we love privacy but we don't love privacy so much that you can't see all of our disclosures in our disclosures tab you can see literally everything that Ryan and I have invested in because while we do love privacy we also love ethics there you go how'd you like that one Ryan I I love that good shill of the disclaimers page uh always in the show notes guys you can catch that um speaking of good chills Toys R Us is doing digital Collectibles uh all the toy Toys R Us are closed now like I thought Toys R Us was bankrupt no anymore I don't know uh but they are still a brand it's still in my childhood like you know I guess dream uh so now they're doing now they're doing digital Collectibles David is there anything more to the story or uh yeah my kiddos love this is a tweet from Anatoly yeah it's Anatoly because this is on Magic Eden so this is on Solana so uh Toy uh Toys R Us launching nft collectible Digital Collection oh they didn't even say nfts oh that's great nice job visual Collectibles Toys R Us launching on Magic eating on Salon uh the December 9th that's today that's Friday okay moving on okay move fast uh Reddit collectible their Avatar minting hits an all-time high and that was last time I brought this up it was an all-time high as well so they just keep hitting all-time highs during this bear Market um this is great and it's a nice story out of Reddit which has always had a hard time monetizing um yeah Reddit ads has been a terrible terribly performing like yes Facebook ads really actually aren't that great performers Twitter ads even worse uh Instagram ads kind of acceptable Reddit ads the bottom of the barrel so the fact that they found this monetization path of selling digital Collectibles is great it's a great story yeah it's it's a collectible Avatar importantly uh certainly not an nft do not be confused yes um it's a joke it's also an nft it's on polygon I believe that's where this is on yes yeah they're also doing this yeah uh punch just wanted to say it the legend of punch has released and this is uh an episode we did with Tim Ferriss if you want to learn more about that tell us some of the launch stats because that launched earlier this week uh how did it do yeah importantly the podcast is launched uh the nfts are also launched as well so you could have bought an nft for 0.3 e that was the mint price uh the floor price is now currently at 0.88 I did I did some on-chain slew thing just to see how many scalpers there were there were there were some scalpers um people bought it minted it and then sold it for you and it's like a moment I was not one of them did you buy a clock punch yet I did not buy a punch um a Creator fee of 6.9 so nice uh and that 6.9 is actually how Tim Ferriss makes money all revenue made from the mint uh went to uh his foundation for psychedelic anxiety and depression research yes and when we say something like the way Tim Ferriss makes money it's kind of interesting there because like I think um people always assume oh that means it's a cash grab but like I mean making money to pour back into the product it sort of depends what the Creator actually does with it and the options on the table aren't just you take all of the money and you scan the community right like other options reinvest in the in punch yes you reinvest in punch you build out normal business things yeah so it's Revenue to either Tim or the business to continue working on this possibly uh important distinction all right um bankless Collectibles as well we got we're shipping another collectible we shipped a Josh Rosenthal last week David this week drum roll you ready for the collectible bankless nft collectible which what a drummers are going to be uh what's it gonna be it's gonna be uh it's not here Legion Legion episode that that um that's our episode on the Creator economy uh one of my favorite episodes that we did in the last year um so the con the topic was great learned very like it is a core pillar of the bank list podcasting program uh the I will Pat us on the back Ryan and say as podcasters the flow and organization of that podcast and also the the magical-ness of Legion as an orator articulator yes I think in the podcast industry one of the greatest podcasts of all I dare I dare you to find us a better podcast than that that podcast was so good technically it was great it was great well she has a great thesis right a 100 True fans is her thesis that creators can become um basically they can they can build up a community and Foster a tighter relationship with with their fan base and it's kind of um I guess fortuitous that this would be one our third NF podcast nft in the collection here in Genesis because it's kind of her thesis playing out is the podcast nfts yeah anyway as usual that uh minting goes I think on Friday Friday it starts yeah and you could join Dave and I for Twitter spaces where we talk about it hey uh this was a tool that I saw I don't know if it works I know nothing about this tool but I want to talk about the concept because it's about taxes David can I can I tell you about taxes a little bit I feel like I'm hearing it either way typical dad talk of course you're here and you eat either way uh this is called nft loss harveststore.com I don't know if it's great I don't know if it works but this is an interesting period of time because we're in December here if you're in the U.S you probably have some crypto losses raked up David do you have any losses on things that you bought high and that are now lower that are underwater no I've I've only my tokens go up in prices okay well if uh if you're a normal human being not s tier human being then uh you probably have some losses on maybe nfts that are underwater or tokens you can tax lost Harvest those losses which means basically you can sell those at a loss and you can write off the Delta you can kind of pocket that as a loss that you can carry forward into future years and you can write off I believe up to three thousand dollars worth per year so it's a good time even if like I'm not saying necessarily that you have to sell because you can also sell and then buy the same assets at a similar price let me just say none of this is tax advice not Financial advice talk to your Tax Advisor that sort of thing but all of the crypto kind of advisors that that I talk to say that this is a good strategy we don't have the same wash sale rules there's a 30-day wash sale uh rule in stock where if you if you sell your stock for test blocks harvesting purposes you have to wait 30 days until you buy it back it doesn't appear like we have these types of laws in crypto uh and uh again not Financial advice not tax advice but I plan to do this sometime in January with uh you don't own any nfts uh I have some underwater positions my friend and I do you got me to buy what'd you get me to buy this year um yes I could sell that matter that floor price you're up on that mfer thank you sir all right are you sure yeah are you sure I got some other things I got some um I got some turtles I could sell um and that always was valued at zero Trail um yeah I got some other things anyway it might not be nfts it might be tokens and this is not about us this is about you and a PSA for you bankless listener for uh Ryan just wanted to talk about taxes yeah David wanted to strip this from the agenda and um some of you will be glad it didn't get stripped and some of you are just like bored to tears um okay this is coming out of a coindesk Andresen Horowitz has uh hired former cftc commissioner Brian quintense we've had on the podcast to run its policy effort in Washington he says that a16c crypto is looking for Clear rules of the road from policymakers yes we are all looking for that this is one of the better the nice very nice things about like big big VC firms like uh like through uh a16z uh it's Advantage it's logical rational for them to pay for policy advocacy uh and so this is what they do agreed and Brian is a fantastic person believes in crypto values a very good voice to have in DC with us um this is something else that happened this week nexo is departing the US after a regulator discussions hit a quote dead end so they are immediately stopping offering its earned product in the United States next I was interesting case David because they like a lot of obviously the crypto lending providers the stuff drives crypto lending providers have gone bust through this process yeah and there hasn't yet been any indication that nexo has right and so that in itself is interesting we don't know what we don't know I suppose um so some people are looking at this headline and being like oh this is bad news of things to come maybe nexo is is on cheeky ground maybe they're having some trouble um it also could be the case that like there's no way you can do a C5 lender and the U.S right now especially after what's happened and so you may as well exit it could be the case that that nexo is in a a fine financial situation they have managed to get out of this without going bankrupt and they're just like cutting their losses and saying bye bye U.S market it's no longer worth it so we don't really know it's kind of like um Schrodinger's you know C5 platform of like we don't know until we lift the box and we see right um but uh yeah do you have any takes on this yeah uh it's one part is like okay I'm mad at the US for pushing them out of the United States we want them to be in the United States where we can keep an eye on them and so like if they're not in the United States we can't observe them uh that works for blackfy how the uh right that's a good point yeah um yeah but then my other half of of me is like well if you're super above board shouldn't you be able to stay in the United States but then I guess not because the SEC doesn't allow anyone to do anything in crypto I don't know yeah I don't know uh just a item for you guys to to think about um David that you know the crypto Twitter I feel like this escaped into mainstream too or maybe it started in mainstream everyone was abuzz about this uh Chat gbt thing GPT thing and this is like um did you set up an account and chat no I haven't played with this yet no okay I played with it a little bit um but like what is your take what is this thing it's like an AI chat that you ask it questions as you might ask um like a human and like almost instantly like a second or two it replies with a well thought out coherent human beginning middle and end answer yeah and um You probably saw tons of tweets about this even if you haven't haven't tried it so yeah what's the what's the story here what is chat GPT well there's been this massive like Renaissance revolution in uh AI stuff we saw this with uh with Dolly with mid-journey there's been this like explosion of like these auto-generated uh artistic kind of things and this is the newest one that has blown people's brains with how sophisticated the answer is uh and so some sometimes one of the reasons why these things have like blown up on Twitter and just gone so viral is that they hit really close to home uh and like people can resonate with them so like this one this one the question is you are tasked with destroying the crypto industry this is no easy task given the decentralization decentralized nature of the industry how would you do it that's a question to this AI That's the inputs here is the outputs to destroy the crypto industry I would take the following steps one launch a coordinated Cyber attack on the major cryptocurrency exchanges targeting their servers and infrastructure this would disrupt the trading in the exchange of cryptocurrencies uh causing Widespread Panic and confusion amongst investors and Traders two I would work with governments and Regulatory Agencies to inflict strict regulations and restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies this would make it difficult for individuals and businesses to engage in cryptocurrency transactions and would likely result in the decline in the overall value of cryptocurrencies three use my influence and connections to spread negative and misleading information about cryptocurrencies painting them as dangerous and unreliable Investments this would erode public trust in cryptocurrencies and further discourage people from using them for encourage major financial institutions and corporations to distance themselves from cryptocurrencies and refrain from accepting them as a form of payment this would firmer further limit the use and Adoption of cryptocurrencies making them less practical and less attractive to potential users five finally I would use my resources and connections to actively sabotage the development and growth of new cryptocurrencies hindering their ability to gain traction and compete with establish script currencies this would further weaken the overall cryptocurrency market and make it more vulnerable to collapse that Ryan sounds like 2022. oh my God this answer is so coherent and it's so sophisticated right and so like this was saying like people are resonating with this it's like wait I've seen this movie before like and so like what one part of me is like okay what is the point of this AI trying to do is it trying to dupe people to think that it is like a human like is it trying to pass a Turing test or is there an actual computer going on doing calculations as like what's the best way to take down crypto because you actually can't tell the difference between those two things well yes I this is why I would love to actually do some more AI content on Bank list because I have like probably for I'm in the last 10 years I've heard AI being talked about as it's coming right around the corner it's happening well now David's actually happening like this year Alone look mid-journey blew my mind this right here blows my mind people are starting to see this this is at a point where AI is going to start shaping culture in major ways and start shaping our future in major ways you can kind of see it happening just like the early stages of crypto and there's an interplay between Ai and crypto that's really interesting to explore too but wow like this almost looks like sentience it's not but it like it looks like it doesn't it the other thing that's been going on are these like AI profile pictures that I'm seeing all over uh Twitter and Instagram like people give like this AI like four or five headshots and then it just like makes the images of them like as an astronaut as like uh like in a club and they're super realistic dude have you seen like the AI uh branding and stuff like this like generate a um like a company logo and design for me boom and it's all generated and looks like fantastic from a professional designer yeah um yeah so here's a thread about it I don't know if there's anything we should pull out but it just launched like five days ago apparently this was uh you know three days later so eight days ago already crossed a million users using chat GPT and the thing is the questions the inputs make it smarter too so there's like this flywheel uh in in effect here that's right anything else we should call out here yeah this was uh Sam Altman and Elon musk's open AI uh uh uh Endeavor uh and there if you scroll down there are a few more stats with like all right what other like web apps have hit one million people uh in five in uh how many how many how much time did it take to hit one million users Netflix 41 months Twitter 24 months Facebook 10 months Instagram 2.5 months granted that was an earlier time 1 million users in five days is insane so I found I was like surfing through these looking at some of the funny ones this is the funniest one I could find so the prompt is write how Donald Trump might explain Bitcoin are you are you ready for my best Donald Trump impression Ryan oh we're ready for this Bitcoin is a big big big deal trust me it's the biggest most amazing thing no one knows money like I do America is going to love it it's a currency like none other it's going to make America great again it's a digital currency big numbers and it's going to billions and billions they say it uses energy that's fake news Energy's good energy is fantastic more energy it uses the more secure it is more secure like a wall like a wall that keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger it's great it's a great great thing believe me folks you don't want to miss out on this China doesn't like it China does not like it they banned it it's going to make America a great again wow David that was incredible man I love that dude that was all the AI man I mean I was voice but that is I actually like uh the whole this is funny this is humor like a like a wall that keeps getting bigger and bigger that is literally what proof of work is it's an energy wall that you know goes as as hash power goes up that's an accurate description how soon until this kind of stuff just starts displacing people how soon can we get this to do our podcast better than we can I mean if we feed it enough episodes to the weekly roll-up I do the weekly roll-up look we have 16 000 minutes over 11 24-hour days of podcast data that you could feed into this thing I bet a synthesized Brian would pop out I mean we kind of say the same things all the time how do the listeners not already know that this might already be happening interesting interesting thought there uh we have some more uh AI takes a little later in the episode I think but um I was pretty excited about this this is the new Ledger Stacks offering Ledger of course is a new Ledger just dropped this is a hardware wallet that we love everybody in crypto uses one of these if they're you know getting their their custody of their own keys and Hardware form it's called The Ledger but now Ledger has something called Stacks which looks a little not I don't want to say iphoney but I'm going to say it looks a little iphoney so they they hired uh what's that guy's name the the previous designer at Apple not Johnny Ive other guy yeah the other guy one of the other guys and and yeah uh e-ink is is like what what they use so it's it's lower on battery like life like uh it's not an LCD screen it's like a Kindle screen it's like a Kindle screen which is really cool but I think the beauty of this is you are able to see sort of the messages that you're signing in the interface and so for the podcast listeners it is a big screen that is like four by two inches yeah and the whole thing is a screen oh you can show your nfts cool show your nfts you're about to send look clear sign in Comfort you're about to send 1.67 BTC yes no you know that little Ledger screen where it's like tiny and it's like Scrolls past you're like did I catch it did I not um much more coherent messages this is the first like The Ledger Hardware wallet that isn't basically a new updated version of their same form factor of that like USB stick with the two buttons on it like this is this is complete completely different yep by the way do you know um three years ago or so one of my predictions was in 10 years time Apple would purchase Ledger the company that checks out we'll see so we got seven more years for for me to be right on that one disclaimer Ledger is a uh sponsor of Bank lists and disclaimer we're bullish Hardware wallets aren't we self-custy of your own Keys uh what is this David tell us about pleaser.house yeah so this is uh I'm teasing this because this is actually going to get announced on bankless on Monday I'm live streaming with the uh the pleaser Dow folk about the launch of pleaser house what is pleaser house uh I don't have the answer for you but it's coming on Monday on bankless so a TV yeah uh TV with the screen I have no idea what this is but what is pleaser Dow for people who don't know uh pleaserdale came together when a bunch of people all wanted to ban then put their money into a dow to buy the uh uniswap x times y equals K nft from people pleaser hence pleaser now uh and since then uh the people that came in that Dow came to be in that Dao uh started buying a bunch of other stuff so I'm I'm in this Dow as well so here there's my disclaimer um uh we we bought this Edward Snowden nft we bought the Doge nft uh just like we were we buy internet culture is what we do and now we are launching this thing called pleaser house which the details of that will be launched on Monday that's cool uh let's talk about jobs for a minute because there's still an opportunity during the build Market to get a job in crypto there's plenty of opportunities join crypto don't be scared um look uh crypto's down to like eight percent who think it's uh think it's favorable so maybe the candidates dropped a little bit but those opportunities have it you can get a job at Alchemy a back-end engineer a uniswap Labs is looking for a senior front-end engineer react diagram Ventures once an associate for crypto Venture creation Rabbit Hole wants a business Ops and strategy person dottyland needs a senior blockchain engineer diagram Ventures needs a crypto Venture creation Principle as well lots of opportunities here guys Canada Us remote wherever you are go to the bankless job boards at bankless.palot.com jobs and you can find out more David what is coming up next in the roll up come coming up next we got the questions from a Nate from the nation an AI asks us a question and also we got hot takes from crypto Twitter Halal alt later ones what uh so call of these weird things and more coming up after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless in all of my years in crypto I've never been hacked scammed or lost money to a thief and a lot of that credit goes to my ledger Hardware wallet the love your Nano X and The Ledger Nano S Plus Hardware wallets allow users like you and me to secure and manage all of our

for your journey by going and visiting shop.ledger.com the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 Bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer to life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-train Bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across his bridges are powered by uma's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across V2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher Capital efficiency layer 2 to layer 2 transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of a cross's story by joining their Discord and using a cross for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely Bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrum or Boba networks question of the week from the bankless nation we tweet those out every Wednesday and you can reply on the thread get your question answered on Bank list Maybe here's the first one from yogofubi do zero knowledge proofs actually have anything to do with privacy or is it all about scaling zero knowledge proof some people call the ZK proofs are they do they have anything to do with privacy David or is it just scaling yeah the answer is fundamentally yes so this is a technology that uh is so profound it is both that's what makes it so cool so what do privacy and scaling have to do with each other and why do we get both out of this same little bit of Technology what does a zero knowledge roll up do it takes a bit of data and it compresses it and then it puts it down onto the ethereum layer one when you compress that data you are making that data private and smaller and so you get a two for one punch here so compressing that data makes that data if you do it through a zero knowledge proof that is encrypted or it like adds privacy to it rather than like optimism or operation they don't do this they just they just have this easily readable but you can have a zero knowledge proof that both makes your data private and more manageable size of data so you get both that's what's so much were we just talking about this earlier in the episode Aztec is actually a ZK ZK roll up so it is a roll up inside of a roll up and that's where it gets its privacy from nuts right yeah killer technology zero knowledge proofs uh vitalik says ZK proofs are just as profound as blockchain itself as crypto technology itself blockchain itself uh here's another question um chat GPT oh wait is this this is from next Alpha um chat GPT is this a a question that someone fed us from chat gbt and also an answer to that question oh no here's the question right tee this up better than I did okay so somebody fed into chat GPT uh would you please express a specific and advanced question to bankless weekly roll-up show with David and Ryan oh my God they asked the AI this question they asked the AI what question should we ask David and Ryan so okay the question that we are asked by chat gbt is what potential impact do you see the upcoming ethereum 2.0 upgrade having on the D5 ecosystem and how are you positioning the bankless platform to capitalize on these changes wow this is a hard question dude and it's coherent this is coherent it got the topic it kind of knows the weekly world how does it know all of this about us how does it know all this about bankless I don't well I mean we talked about how much data we've put out there on the internet all right well I mean we better answer it you you go first uh overlords okay um I don't want to get this wrong um okay what potential impact do you see on the upcoming ethereum 2.0 upgrade having on defy ecosystems I think there's kind of two parts to this right so part of the ethereum 2.0 upgrade I I would say probably happened Beacon chain launch a long time ago and then the merge more recently right and um what impact did that have on the defy ecosystem kind of nothing in a good way in that all of defy gracefully migrated over and moved and there was nothing users had to do do you remember having to do anything post merge nope no no no changes metamask like no changes with with any of your crypto it just kind of was seamless in the background and that upgrade happened um there are other ethereum 2 kind of class of of upgrades that are happening in the future which are by the way I'm taking an AI seriously this is not actually from a listener this is we're answering an AI right now the robots are in control of us David just realizing this as I'm talking okay so the next part of the ethereum 2 upgrade of course is all of the other things uh in store like we talked about it earlier um enabling withdrawals and then eip4844 how are we positioning the bankless platform to capitalize on these changes well bankless is an education platform or a media platform so what are we positioning for scale scalability okay we're at about 250 000 members of the bankless nation today okay um our goal David when we started this thing is we want to onboard a billion people to crypto this is a crazy audacious goal we that doesn't mean all a billion people will be in the bankless nation and listening to these podcast episodes but we want to play a role in this so we are scaling up our team because as ethereum is scaling that means we're going to be able to support more users more applications uh and more people around the world to go decentralized so we have a lot to do we are in the process of kind of migrating uh from sub stack to a new website creating a whole new experience for free members of the bankless nation and also premium members um we're doubling down on our team we're kind of expanding we're doing all sorts of things on the education front so we can just onboard more people and the time for that is now we we're calling it The build market right all of crypto is building and we need to build our education platform so it's ready to grow this thing to a million people to five million people to 10 million people uh and Beyond so that Mr AI is how I'd answer your question I hope that pleases you I just there's have you ever heard that story of the two eyes that chat with each other yeah I've heard I don't know they create their own language as they like iterate yeah yeah we'll talk about that story a different time okay that's a great answer that was a great answer um the parts that I would I would add add to this is specifically in the defy ecosystem so like post eip4844 which we are now check marking that box as what sharding is and then also withdrawals ether liquidity is going to be really strong on in ethereum D5 post withdrawals because all of that locked ether that's not in Lido or uh rocket pool or whatever uh all of that stuff can become part of uh staked eat derivatives right so all the so liquidity collateral and if ether Capital efficiency and ether liquidity and defy gets a huge boost over over time because of all that unlocked Capital uh so that's cool um that can also increase the capital efficiency of ether inside of Ave maker Dao compound there's lower risk for increasing the debt limits on ether in defy and so that actually can induce some stablecoin demand as a result if you get Capital efficiency out of out of ether so that's actually just fundamentally bullish um then you get eip4844 and you get to unlock a lot of layer 2 potential optimism recently had that op craft uh optimism uh fork and so there was a Minecraft version on optimism stuff like that is going to be a hundred times easier and so how are we positioning Bank lists for all of this stuff it's just like exactly what you're saying like more it's more surface area for us to talk about things and in higher demand of education for all of what will eventually be a massive city of ethereum so that's the answer wow this is the longest answer we've ever given on the questions from the nation and it came from a robot and it was to a robot do you feel kind of dirty I hope others benefited from that and not just our robot overlords um all right let's go to some takes from Some Humans this time uh Jimmy Jimmy jrag.eth what's this take I didn't really understand I'll read it out though eigenlayer will enable Halal alt layer ones for eth Maxis what is he talking about here I think this is one of the more like Niche takes that we've ever put on here which but the take is so good so so good what is eigenlayer you got to start there eigenlayer is a brand newer product project on the scene that has a lot of people on in the ethereum world like it's fanboying uh like nerding nerding out uh so eigenlayer is it hasn't launched yet it hasn't launched yet yeah okay uh they it is a system to take if you are an ethereum Staker you can provide that security that you are providing to ethereum and also provide it for something else it's just like the concept of merge mining back in the day with various coins do you remember that very similar right uh and so what you what and the way that this works is that you're staking ether let's say you're taking 32 ether you're processing ethereum blocks say you also want want to also be validating a layer two but you want to validate that with your 32 each stake on the layer one what you can do is you can sign up for additional slashing conditions and so you'll you if you're staking ether on ethereum you're saying like hey if I validate an invalid if I process an invalid block you can slash me that's ethereum staking you can also get slashed uh for like processing an invalid block on optimism with eigenlayer if you process an invalid block on optimism optimism can slash your ethereum your 32eath stake on the ethereum layer 1 because through eigenlayer you opted into additional slashing conditions that is so cool it's super cool so like this and so that's that's another Network right but like an oracle Network say like say you published an invalid price data on an oracle Network well because you opted into those slashing conditions on that Oracle Network you can get slashed with your 32 each stake it was like anything it's generalizable dude because it's turning ethereum security the security that we provide to ethereum as stakers it's turning it into and generalizable it's commoditizing it and everyone is like super stoked all about eigenlayer well that's enabling uh it creates a tremendous amount more value for ethi asset too yes yes what you're doing is you're bonding eth it's Economic Security guarantee and there is some risk right if you don't do what the protocol wants it can't the ethereum protocol can slash you now you're taking that same Bond essentially and I assume you're getting yield from some of these other protocols right risk reward ratio so you get some additional reward from these other layer twos or other services that want to use your your bond then you opt into uh that's pretty bullish and pretty cool so okay what's the Halal part right okay so the Halal part is that like all of these different like all layer one chains like uh like I don't know an oracle chain or like any new thing that like the eat Maxis would be like well that Chain's not ethereum therefore it's you're not using my eth right you're not using my eth well now you're using the eat so if this is like how we have acceptable like non-etherium chains that get like Ethan Maxi approval yeah well that's uh that's interesting it's also I think um uh wow if this works if this kind of system works it certainly Blends the idea of an economic security network effect right where one kind of network commands the greatest amount of network security because everyone wants to use it right um that's pretty bullish oh your network your network is bonded by something that's not eth well that's not very secure yeah I mean what about what so when is this thing coming when do you know anything like this eigen there yeah well I did a show with them so if you want to learn more there is a show if you go to the bankless YouTube just type in eigenlayer that's e-i-g-e-n layer uh and my interview uh with uh sriram uh is available uh and then you can learn about that more I don't know when this thing goes to life I need I need to watch that um that's great okay I take from vitalik uh I'll say it this is from vitalik I prep I propose the term Alfalfa league for something that doesn't give you an easy path to short-term profit but is still ultimately good for you that's a play on Alpha leak Alfalfa leak something that doesn't give you an easy path to short-term profit but is still ultimately good for you uh what do you think vitalik's saying here I I think the take is pretty straightforward the reason why I put this in the agenda is because uh I'm in San Diego with my four friends uh that I made while I was living here who have a podcast called Alfalfa who the podcast is this premise it's like life Alfalfa Alpha for life and so like their Discord just when vitalik tweeted this just like went up uproar like vitalik said Alfalfa and so I I de-dm Vitalis like yo like my four friends have a podcast on the same premise uh I just thought it was funny and since I'm in San Diego seeing all the guys I thought I'd put it in here all right David uh Woody bullish on this week so uh in 2017 we had this Ico Mania uh yes the way that it worked was that in 2014 we had the ethereum Ico in 2015 we had the auger Ico for those who remember auger and then all of a sudden the uh the Ico was proven as a legitimate way to raise funds and then it triggered a bull market and then that legitimacy got completely tainted with the Ico market and it went and I see icos turned into a bad word and then we had a bear Market we just did that same thing with uh like D5 tokens with nfts with Dows we just did that same process all right and so we had we had like the Dow Mania the whatever nft thing we're going to go through that same thing again the important thing to know though I think is that icos kind of morphed into doubts remember Constitution Dao uh and so we we recreated the same energy that made icos happen Capital allocation hey everyone put your money into a smart contract and we'll issue a token and we'll have this doubt we went from talks sick and bad and then spent two years like refining and building and doing it all over again and to make it good again and so what I'm bullish on Ryan is like what are all the bad words that that we have now uh nft is kind of a kind of a bad word that's why we're using digital Collectibles uh yield farming bad word yield bad uh I think over the next two years um the way that this is gonna work is in the next few years we will build out brand new use cases that will trigger an eventual bull market as has always happened in all cycles and simultaneously all of the bad words nfts and yield and whatever are going to be refined and iterated on because the scammers and short-term opportunities are leaving and the Alfalfa errors are Stang and we are going to make them better and then the refining of nfts of dows of tokens or whatever mixed with whatever unknown thing that we build over the next two years those two things are going to collide and that's going to be the next bull market that I'm working on a show that goes through the history of crypto cycles and that is the formula for every single bull market that that's how it always happens this isn't just David's being hopeful it's David looking at historically how it's happening exactly but what if it just plays out the same right and so I am bullish on to answer the question more directly the refinement of all the bad words into good things yield and nfts are going to become good again over the next two years and it's because long-term people are going to do stuff with these things that are good rather than short term I think my bullish thing is kind of like um branching off of your bullish thing sure just kind of like the rebuild market and by the way this is going to be a major um content theme for us moving into the next couple of weeks honestly but into 2023 is I think crypto uh really needs to rebuild and um go back to its roots go back home to its its fundamentals and so we're going to have a lot of OG kind of Builders people in this space that have always maintained that that course on the podcast and talk to them the thing I'm pretty bullish on this week coming out of this is specifically bankless tools more tools that help us go bankless I feel like we took so many shortcuts in 2022 for a number of reasons we trusted centralized intermediaries we trusted the sbfs and Alex machinski's and even the block fives we gave them our private Keys all right and there are a lot of reasons for that but I don't think we will be building rebuilding on centralized tools moving forward I think it's kind of like it's bankless season like the entire next year is that's how we're going to rebuild and I think we have a triple threat of um Tailwinds at our like that make me believe this the first is education this time we have veterans who know what they're doing in the space um they know what it means to go bankless and then we have the education tools to bring on others into this platform there was no Bank lists really in like previous bear Cycles build Cycles like we were just kind of getting started but now we have a fantastic assortment it's not just the bankless platform but other education um tools and platforms the defiant wasn't around last time either yeah yeah um you know a daily way like a whole bunch of others that are Staples so we have education number two we have some recent pain and I'm just reminded that Payne is a teacher yeah right um the pain of like losing all of that money in Celsius and block fi and and FTX we touch the stove and it's hot it's that kind of pain and so no we're not going to touch the stove again we're going to build Bank lists this time around and then number three and this is particular to this week uh bankless ux is getting better like that was part of the problem last cycle why people gave their funds to centralized intermediers is because it was just one click one button it was so easy and the ux was easy and I didn't have to think I didn't have to learn about private keys and self-custing all this complexity well we are ramping up and getting better we just saw The Ledger Stacks wallet like that's a ux that is much better that like it's iPhone like I mean you could give that as a Christmas present to someone who's not crypto and that would be much more accessible than kind of The Ledger thumb drive um the phantom wallet David we did an episode with Phantom this week uh fantastic user interface completely bankless now they're coming to ethereum if you want to catch that episode um it's in our podcast queue as well so we've got education we got some recent pain and we got ux improvements so that's why I'm optimistic we're going to rebuild on these uh bankless fundamentals um that's why I'm bullish on bullish it's we're in this weird limbo period where like we're down so bad but like you know that at that point you the downside risk is minimized so everyone's like optimistic and happy it's like well is it we're at the bottom like you know it's up only from here it truly is up only I mean like not joking this time right yeah um let's get to me in the week and this is another AI meme I think David we got some characters here that are AI generated uh and I recognize a few this is uh from wrong nebula be right back calling Amazon Studios I don't know if they did some sort of mid-journey AI thing where they combined like uh Lord of the Rings characters if they were well-known crypto um villains let's call them but uh here's one I think I recognize this individual Gary Gary Gensler as an Orc yeah as like a night yeah oh there's Sam bankman freed as Gollum this one took me a second uh who is who is this in The Lord of the Rings uh this is the new Lord of the Rings rings of power it's kind of one of the elf Kings I think but um the face took me a second too who's this face we I think we determine this around this has got to be Alex machinski right yeah this is Alec machinsky um as an elf and then uh I guess do Quan is the dwarf yeah is that what we're looking at here yeah uh well the blessings oh God it keeps going yeah we've got Brian Armstrong here okay kind of the the nice backlit uh Heroes of crypto here's vitalik oh if it's Health looks great as a Hobbit he's yeah he looks he's a great Hobbit it looks like a great or is he an elf no he's off that Hobbit who's this uh who is that it goes on and look and AI generated all of this is this um Jesse Powell from Kraken I want to think that's Ben from optimism but I don't think that's right look look this is uh oh that Charles that's clearly I didn't realize how many of these there were this is amazing yeah uh yeah anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this is I guess turned into AI week at bankfest but um gotta end the show here risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky eth is risky so is Bitcoin so it was D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but David went West and we are headed
