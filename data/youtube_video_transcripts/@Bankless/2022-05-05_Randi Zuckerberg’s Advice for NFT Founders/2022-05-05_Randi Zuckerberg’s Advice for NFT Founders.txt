is your advice or is your perspective if you can stick it out if you can not get burned out and if you cannot if you can make sure you you protect yourself you're not working at a pace that means you're gonna leave in a year in three years time a lot will open up or what are you telling folks totally that's literally my only advice is to like make sure you're still standing in the year 2025. if you haven't been thrown out of the dodgeball game by 2025 like you're gonna win because it means that you've pivoted it means that you've like not burnt out you've had enough resources to hang in there because that's what i saw in web 2. all of the early facebook apps and all the early iphone apps like they all changed they all pivoted but if you could just hang on for a few years to watch the ecosystem mature and understand what customers wanted you are so much better poised for success
