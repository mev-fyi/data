Twitter has this massive problem I'm like Elon Musk he's like battling the Bots all the time on Twitter and it seems like crypto has a solution for this why haven't we been able to kind of penetrate he takes a startups that's well networked enough with these platforms and be able to convince them to join this protocol where a digital signature is required to sign messages I think that's the only reason why the solution is not being implemented yet this whole deep fake thing is going to play a massive role in the next election but I think we only have one more election for this to happen because by the 2028 election solution will be ready
