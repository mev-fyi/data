what is your thesis for crypto at the end of the day all of us want to see greater financial inclusion and options for all but mildly differ on what might be the best way to achieve it i don't have a strong thesis i'm also not much of a crypto investor my first impression of bitcoin was that it doesn't make any sense as a medium of exchange this was back when it was the main narrative but i thought it's the greatest ponzi the world has ever seen my thesis was pretty much we love to gamble and this is the best one yet that was a while ago i haven't owned any bitcoin for years for a variety of reasons for the longest time i was out of crypto markets but i got kind of interested again in 2019 with the rise of d5 combine that with eip 1559 and proof of stake and there was actually something new and interesting here making money is the least interesting thing about investing for me it is about efficient allocation of capital and what matters most to me
