[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance but here today on Bank list we are exploring some New Frontiers New Frontiers in new technologies all of which seem poised to completely revolutionize the world and change everything about the operating system that Society is currently running in fact there are as many as five other Technologies out there that are all accelerating in progress and while each one of these new technologies are pioneering into their respective Frontiers they're also all beginning to converge with each other in the intersections of these various Frontiers are fertile grounds for massive disruption of the status quo AI longevity synthetic biology Network States and coordinations and zero knowledge cryptography each of these are Paradigm changing technological Frontiers and each of these industries are in various stages of development and maturity but bankless Nation I'm here to tell you that each one of these Frontier Technologies is a tidal wave coming for society the crypto wave hit Society in 2021 now Society is learning how to deal with his nascent but powerful technology and Society is in the middle of being hit with the AI wave now in 2023 and that wave only appears to be growing in size the waves of synthetic biology longevity Network States zero knowledge cryptography and other technology Frontiers are still to come this was the main subject of a two-month-long experiment called zuzalu bankless viewers who are watching the background of my podcast shift in the last two months will notice I was gone from my Brooklyn apartment for two months I was in Montenegro of all places at this thing called zuzalu zuzalu was an experiment in a temporary Community the idea here is that we have crypto conferences or conferences in general which are between two and twenty thousand people for anywhere between two days to a week and then there are hacker houses which are 20 people for even as long as one here suzalu was an experiment in a specific Arena of both size of people number of people and lengths of stay so Zuzu was 200-ish people for two months of time and then also about 600 more people that would come in for shorter term stays like one to two weeks during specific themed weeks suzalu is a brainchild of vitalik buterin but it was really a holistic effort of many different individuals from across many different Industries and also individuals who were adept at community building itself it was simultaneously a place for different Frontier Technologies to come together and discuss and collaborate and cross-pollinate while also produce this experiment in what a temporary short-term Community looks like something in the middle of a network State a coordination a digital nation that manifests physically in the world for two months at a time so like I said every single week as usual had a theme longevity week synthetic biology week new cities and network States Ai and crypto public goods zero knowledge cryptography digital tribes and QWERTY Nations the idea behind zuzalu is that residents were staying there for the entire eight week period and US residents would watch hundreds of visitors cycle through to have their week-long sets of talks panels and workshops well the visitors of zuzalu were able to present their respective work and Industry to people across vastly different other Industries the benefits of this are huge because some of these technologies have never really had a meaningful meeting place before for many of the industry leaders here zuzalu was the first opportunity for them to meet their fellow industry professionals but not just other professionals inside their own industry but Founders researchers and Builders across other Industries who can bring unique perspectives and knowledge to the table in order to cross-pollinate spread knowledge Beyond internal walls and not optimize for a Serendipity by just including new people from new Industries and then the community aspect of this made this especially unique because having cross industry conferences is one thing but this was a cross industry two-month-long Community we lived together we ate breakfast together we all became friends and that level of cross-pollination is just so much deeper and Lasting than what a three-day or week-long conference could even bring so Bank location this was zuzalu and here's what you can expect from zuzalu content my first conversation that you're going to hear is this one with vitalik buterin which we will get to in just a second and we'll talk about some of the philosophy and ideas and meaning and purpose behind zuzalu what it is what he thinks it is what it can be what other people who think it can be really the question of what is zuzalu is embodied in the question itself there is no answer it's up to us and eventually the idea is that zuzalu spirals into a headless movement where maybe soon there is a zuzalu near you I recorded 18 different interviews at zuzalu from all across the different industries that had representation there these interviews range from 20 minutes to up to a full hour these topics of conversations range from synthetic biology to AI to crypto in Africa to how to live forever to even conversations about zuzalo itself like this one some of these are very much crypto conversations a lot of these are only crypto conversations if you use your imagination so to understand the significance of each of these episodes I want to share my biggest takeaway that I got from zuzalum and that's this ethereum and crypto is the eldest sibling of a bunch of Frontier Technologies it's a loan in this room waiting for its fellow siblings to grow up AI is actually recently of age so now crypto and AI are starting to be able to play together decentralized science will help longevity and synthetic biology come into the fold the episode with Boris and Mikey will help illustrate that digital Nations have a lot of work to do and my episode with Primavera de Felipe will show you that way Network States and new cities there is an immense new Need for competitiveness in governance over our physical countries and cities when we get a bunch of new cities in the world where are they going to find financial and governance tools ready out of the box well ethereum of course in my conversation with Nicholas will guide you through this world so while crypto is currently going toe-to-toe with the old world of Securities Law and nation state regulation it is simultaneously stuck waiting for its future use cases across other Frontier Technologies to grow up and mature but the biggest takeaway that I got bankless nation is that as all of these other Frontier Technologies grow up and yes crypto is not the only Frontier technology that's up there they are going to need ethereum they are going to need open public permissionless block chain rails they are going to need secure block space the rapidity and speed of innovation and progress in the crypto space matches some of the Innovation and speed and progress and just Paradigm shifting Technologies being built elsewhere the Frontier technical nature of all of these industries will bring them together so meanwhile here ethereum sits alone fighting with his parents the nation-states The Regulators the old world while its younger Tech siblings are still too nascent to give it support but bankless Nation I guarantee you that day will eventually come where each one of these technologies will impact your life zuzalu was a taste of the future everyone and everything at zuzalu felt like they got beamed in from 20 years in the future to show the rest of zuzalians how the future will look from their vantage point the longevity people tell us of an inevitable future in which the option to live forever is a choice that you can make the network State people show us a future of fluid human migration and citizenship across the globe synthetic biology people tell us about a future in which we can grow buildings and vehicles and materials out of organic material and that material can self-repair and self-propagate everyone at zuzalu was a futurist and I would also add that everyone had a resigned note of optimism resigned specifically though as in everyone looked at the future and they see a paradigm shifting technology that could improve The Human Condition at a very deep level and then they also see these seemingly impossible obstacles that get in our way governments dystopia malicious use of the technology no one in suzalu Was Naive about the trials that each individual industry faces in fact one of the main purposes of zuzallo was to collaborate on how to get over these obstacles together but no one at suzalu was a quitter all the researchers Builders and Founders at zuzalo if they were given the one true ring they would all take it to Mordor or die trying so we're going to release these conversations over the next few weeks and months on the podcast and the YouTube so treat these conversations as suzalu as a sort of Choose Your Own Adventure so this is an opportunity for you to speed date other Frontier Technologies Beyond crypto because eventually all of these technologies will converge together on ethereum and that's what I see ethereum offers Solutions offers scaffolding offers a place for other Frontier Technologies to collaborate and communicate and build upon so this is why we're doing this in every single episode of bankless we tell you this is how to get started how to get better and how to front-run the opportunity these Zoo zalu conversations are how to get started with other Frontier Technologies technologies that are on a collision course with Society if you listen to these conversations and understand their implications you'll be ready and you won't be surprised when these tidal waves of technological innovations start colliding with the world that we live in if you want to learn more and just experience more at zuzalu in front of every single theme of an episode whether it's an episode about Network States or AI I will give you the taste of zuzalu during that week what was it like what was uzalu like during AI week because suzalu was different during AI week than when it was a synthetic biology week or network State week each Community each set of Founders and Builders and researchers kind of brought their own Vibe and also the community of also progressed and developed so zuzalu itself as a digital nation that manifested for two months is also part of this Frontier technology so if you are interested in explicitly learning more about suzalu they will be contained in the intros to every single episode so to kick off this Isuzu content we're going to start with our conversation with vitalik buterin but first time I want to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible

getting in their planes to go home and it has been a long two months vitalik we'll start this uh interview at the end because it is the end of this journey of trying to figure out what zuzalu is do you feel like that you have come to an answer as to what zuzalu is in some ways yes in some ways no um I think the yes part is basically like what this particular thing is um like it feels like we understand you know what it means to bring you know a few hundred people together for a few months from a couple of different communities and try to create interaction between people and you know help people learn about each other's interesting stuff that they're doing and just see like what kind of a community comes out of that um the thing that I think is still unclear is like sort of what lies in the future I guess hmm when the the original ideas of zuzallo came to be um in your brain and in other people's uh brains about what this could be like was there any original intent like what was the main goals but before people actually arrived at this place that we now call zuzalo so I'd been uh thinking about a lot of ideas in this space for a while before so last year I uh read an obology's book the network stayed and I wrote my longest blog post ever that was a review of it that just ended up being insanely long um I uh has had also been thinking about like crypto cities in general like more real world use cases of uh little blockchains and zero knowledge births and so the blog post I wrote on crypto cities two years ago I was like one example of that um but we also had some other ideas um that were since then um I uh feel like I'd been interested in the top like topics of uh you know decentralized governance going Beyond like what it means for blockchains um and trying to apply some of those ideas to other contexts um and just the uh question of uh like what are like I think I approached all those issues from this Frame of like what would actually be concretely valuable for people in the real world um and at some point the idea came to be to basically yeah do an experiment and try all of those things at the same time um so the way that I think about the experiment is uh like conferences have thousands of people and they last for a week right and those already exist hacker houses last for a very long time but they only have up to 10 and 20 people well what about something that has 200 people so more than a hacker house and lasts for two months so more than a conference and it has both of those at the same time and basically yeah bring people together from a couple of different communities with um you know some medium level of organization but realistically relying on people coming in to do most of the rest and just like see what actually comes out of that right like basically instead of just the discussion about creating you know new network States or new Societies or um towns or like any of these things being this kind of purely abstract thing where you have you know blabbers counter blabbing each other is blabbing uh we yeah like actually try this you know live thing and uh we'll just get a huge amount of uh you know real world and data and an understanding of like what that what it actually means in practice and go from there you said uh what comes out of that that being this space of 200 people for two months right well what do you think something like zuzallu or something like zuzalu what are your emergent characteristics that can come out of this landscape of size and time of 200-ish people for two months of time what's unique about that setup um I think the time duration is important because uh like one week is a break from your life two months is your life right and so just the kind of mentality that you have it becomes totally different and uh the uh like the kinds of uh things that you're willing to do become totally different there's time to like actually make new connections and uh actually start like doing things with people that you uh did not just kind of know before and bro and uh brought from outside um it's also large enough the number of people is large enough that it's big enough to hold like pretty big things with multiple sub communities right like uh you know we had cryptography lectures that brought in 30 people we had discussions about AI that brought in um you know like over 100 people we had you know some like various different health related events like exercise food bio tracking everything we uh minion had I mean cooking of different types I mean um you know like what are like Chinese karaoke is um you know hiking traps and like in a group of ten you're not going to get those things right in a group of ten you're going to have one of those things and like I think one of the differences between a yes City and a family is like a city has neighborhoods and 200 is like big enough that it actually had neighborhoods which was fascinating right so he actually got to see some interactions between communities I've got to kind of make some connections that did not exist before um even uh you know make some progress on some ethereum related things um you know had a good chance to talk to various different privacy teams and scaling teams and uh you know talk to people working on social recovery and people working on privacy at the same time and so it's uh like there's just a lot of uh things that become possible and it's uh interesting to see that like even at the scale they uh like those kinds of things already become possible so you said there are 200 people are here as uzalo but I think something like 8 or 900 have actually come through zuzalu yes over the two months right uh and in addition to the different like neighborhoods that you've called them like you have the longevity people yeah and the ZK people and the ethereum people there was and so like that has created some sort of emerging cross-pollination but there's also like from my experience from the last few months there seems to be even though it was just months Seasons Seasons that came and go uh because weeks had themes and different people came to populate what was uzalo at a different time what do you think was the benefit or net product of this Dynamic of Zeus Outlook 200 people here at one given point but 800 people over the the eight weeks I mean I think there were kind of two motivations there one was just uh you know if people only wanted to come and like experience like a little bit because they did not have more time than like they would be able to come in and then the concept of these theme weeks or theme seasons was uh basically sort of encouraged uh so that people who only had a limited amount of time and were interested in one topic area could uh come in for like the exact time that their topic area was the big thing um so I'd say yeah like those aspects succeeded but like there's also aspects of that that probably he had to not go over very well right like one example of this was uh especially in the free cities the network States events there was like definitely a large disparity that you could feel between like the kinds of uh things that people coming in from the outside carried about in this thing and the kinds of things that people had so we cared about the tribes did not mesh yeah there's uh like I think uh the the tribes could have meshed better if a lot more effort was put into it and I don't think people quite kind of understood going in what kind of effort was required another issue is that uh like theme weeks are not actually good for learning right like in college there's a reason why courses are like in parallel and not in series right like you know spaced repetition is the best form of learning and there's a good reason why it's uh you know it just like we like our brains were just wired in such a way that we remember things much better if we yeah repeatedly get exposed to them over a longer period of time and instead people just got this like crazy introduction to synthetic biology a big overload and then no more synthetic biology that people got exposed to like a crazy overload of cryptography and then no more cryptography like the word Nova God spoken like you know every minute for a week and then like exactly right so I think uh like that was one of those uh things that I think works less well like in some ways I think the biggest successes of as a result we might have even been the persistent themes like the development of Zupas for example right like I think that was actually yeah like a really great um kind of like technology sort of you know Community fit there because uh like for zoo pass it was oh for zuzulu it was an application that like God actually used to do some really cool stuff and then for zoo pass it was a yeah you know a community of real users that were actually like able to give feedback on a whole bunch of different edge cases um and like actually help I'm gonna zubas improve in a way that it would not be able to on its own and so the like I think if I were to like redo something like this like I would try to focus more on persistent themes and even like having goals across those themes rather than just uh you know lots of things coming and going and for people who want to know what zoo pass is zoo pass is kind of like it's a passport um except for Zeus aloe two month long passport that works inside of this community right um but it is now like infrastructure that futures zuzu's or future other um temporary communities can also use so yeah it was like this top is this Dynamic passport that could change uh but then also you could collect stamps right okay so the interesting thing about it I think uh just uh I'm gonna make it clear to viewers that this is not the same as a coveted vaccine card um is uh that uh it's the zero knowledge aspect right so like here if I can take out my zoo pass right now um I um hold on I have to switch over to my yeah other profile on graphene um and then I open up the brow the visual passport thing on my browser and I get this right it's a basically it's a QR code and that QR code contains a zero knowledge proof like just a you know standard snark I forget if it's growth or Planck or whatever which proves that I am a member of the set of zozoa residents without revealing which one I am um and so like a bunch of interesting apps were built on this so there was Zoo poll which I basically had like polls where only through silver residents could vote but the votes were Anonymous and only but once yes and only vote once and then Zoo cast which was a Twitter where all the accounts were numbered accounts and only if you were as a result of residents or you could only get one numbered account uh then so you know like a lot of uh really fun um you know online uh stuff happens I mean they're used for just like physical gatekeeping for an events when capacity got limited as well and then there's uh stamps which are the zoo pass equivalents of popes so like I was a cook for one of the community dinners and I got a pope saying that I'm a cook um and then uh what else you'll be getting one for being on the bankless podcast here at Susan indeed perfect um yeah there's like a a bunch of uh you know really nice uh popes that have been going around and I've only seen some of them um the next thing I was hoping to ask about is there's all of these different um uh fields of thought fields of study that came to be at suzalu yeah interestingly like I wouldn't really call this an ethereum focused event there were many many ethereum people here um but like you said there were synthetic biology people there was longevity people Network State people AI people um public goods people which were very much ethereum people ZK people who were very much ethereum people right but I wouldn't really call it an ethereum event um what kind of thought went into the selection process of like what kind of topics were going to be here at zuzalu yeah um so I think there is definitely like an intentional motivation on my part to like have this also you know remind ethereum people that there is a bigger role that they can be part of um uh so I personally like I knew some ethereum and ZK people and I knew um like some longevity people and I knew some you know free CD and network State people but then like lots of other topics just emerged organically on their own right like the AI group just kind of emerged by itself the whole um even synthetic biology like I did not really appreciate synthetic biology as a field like I don't think I even seen that that combination of words together before and then people just came to me and they're like yo dog we like literally made a brick out of carbon dioxide and like we made a sweater out of carbon dioxide made by algae do you want one and I'm like sure and uh yeah so that was uh really fun um but I think uh just kind of go back to the question of uh selection the I mean this was obviously like a yeah around one experiment and like I think we all knew from the start that like everything would be very imperfect in a whole bunch of ways um but the uh so there's uh I think an intentional desire to just like say we'll pick a couple of different communities and we'll like pick some great people from those communities and uh you know out of those whoever is willing to come and actually stay for two months like you know great well um and we'll have them and see what happens so we uh and basically made follow this kind of approach of inviting the inviters like we yeah invited about 10 people and then each of those started uh forwarding the invitations along to some others and that kind of seated the initial community so while I said there wasn't this didn't really feel like an ethereum event the undertones of this whole thing was very ethereum the residents that stayed for two months were disproportionately like crypto people um and to to say that like first there was synthetic biology week and then there was longevity week and then it was AI week kind of doesn't do the service of talking about all the cross-pollination that happened right um can you talk about like the what happened from your experiences the cross-pollination and the value that came out of having all of these different communities kind of churned together hmm um it felt like I mean there was definitely like a lot of love between synthetic biology and ethereum people at the beginning um like there was this uh strong desire to see that there were aligned values between these between the communities and uh it's good to like it I don't feel like anything substantive has quite come out of that yet but like it could right I think the like one of the challenges is always like converting this kind of like Vibe level alignment into substantive alignment and uh I think in a lot of cases the answer there is just that like the public goods finding aspect like there are a lot of tracks here where people talked about retro Public's good Goods funding impact certificates uh you know quadratic funding you know quality collusion resistant quadratic voting like all of these public goods funding ideas and a lot of those are relevance to like any branch of science right um so like I know Juan Bennett from ipf asset filecoin he's been for years like a very good bridge between the crypto and science communities and uh yes so but there's you know in increasingly growing uh decentralized science Community which is uh you know great and like hopefully more things come out of that um there are some interesting connections that got made between some of the longevity people and some of the young City people um you know they uh you know it seems like there's you know this kind of growing friendship between like some vieta Dao people and uh prospera and you know I guess uh you know we'll see whether or not there's uh you know more bio stuff happening in Latin America soon um yeah one experience I had uh while all of these different seasons kind of came and go was learning that every single one regardless of what what it was uh the longevity people the network Safe People the AI people the CK people they all there's all a very like practical and understood way that that connects to ethereum every single one has like oh this is the way that these two industries could right build together and in this current moment in crypto we are once again in the bear market and in Bear markets we tend to Soul search um yet again uh our meme coins dominating the the Twitter Zeitgeist of the moment which has left a lot of the long-term Believers once again frustrated that this is what this industry is at least at the cursory level the the top-down level um and so what I'm the reflection the learning moment that I've had I'm wondering if you have felt anything similar is that ethereum seems to be in crypto at large I think is like the eldest of a bunch of Frontier technologies that has grown up first AI I think is now also coming of age um but when we talk about like Network states where are all of these new Charter cities or new network States or new coordinations where are they going to get their Wall Street where are they going to get their financial infrastructure right it's going to be crypto right um uh decentralized science like ethereum offers a foundation for this industry same thing with synthetic biology and and all of these emergent new technologies there all seems to be a very good hook into ethereum and so my uh one of the biggest takeaways that I've had from zuzolo for me personally it's just like ethereum and crypto at large seems to be the eldest of many siblings sibling Technologies yeah and it's just looking around waiting for all the other ones to grow up um I'm wondering if you have any Reflections on that conclusion um yeah no I think there's definitely something to that um and I think it's uh like it's important to remember that I think like ethereum and crypto like they're always this uh combination of a technological movement and the cultural movement um and uh you know they like it's also the kind of you know the ideological continuation of The Cypher Punk movement it's uh I mean like biology likes talking about you know the uh the international and like the decentralized movement as a successor to the non-aligned movement um no no just like open source software as a concept like people from those communities often uh like also find their way into crypto they yeah they're so there's like this set of uh like ideological things that it's uh also inevitably ends up being beside and I think you know like to have us a yeah you know successful collaboration like I think you need like that idea level alignment and like that practical level alignment to exist at the same time and I think like a lot of the time it's like or there's definitely a lot of cases where like you have one and not the other or you have the other and not the first uh but try to find those uh opportunities where both exist is like really important and really valuable when it succeeds it's exactly why I would kind of bisect between theirs the the the knowledge side of of suzalo there's like the tracks that we've been talking about but then also like like you said two months is your life and so like there's a social life side of things yeah uh and so I'm wondering what what do you think for you personally everyone got to experience suzalu their life at zuzalo how zuzalo would change their life for their own because it was a Choose Your Own Adventure for what you wanted to make out of suzalu how did the social milieu and what Zuzu is how did that uh what did you really get out of that personally huh and it's hard for me to compare because this is like literally the first time I've been with a large group of people for an extended duration basically since University right like I've you know been nomading for um literally I think 10 years minus 10 days now and uh like pre-covet averaging you know 55 flights a year post covet a bit less but still a bunch um and like even during covet like I was uh you know stuck in one place for longer periods of time but I was not really with people um yeah so it's like different and nice and it's kind of hard to compare to other things um yeah I think like the like the value of that I think like a lot of people got is like just having this like very high density of value lines people around them and this uh perception that like they can just you know go out on the street and uh like if they bump into someone there's a high probability that that person is interesting and to them yeah so that's uh something that like you would be people generally do not get in other places and it's like the sort of thing that's missing in a lot of online communities like I remember my own experience starting as a Bitcoin magazine person right and uh like I always just basically participating from like kind of from the sidelines I felt because I was uh you know just writing Bitcoin Magazine from the internet and then I watched the Bitcoin Miami in 2013 and that's when I realized like just like how big the community is and how much like it's an actual Community that's like really actually capable of doing all of those things and uh like that really impressed me and then and gave me a lot of motivation and so yeah like I think that's something that's always important for like those kinds of like internet speed heavy spaces in general to have hmm what were you able to achieve at zuzalo that you wouldn't have been able to achieve without it I mean I had a desire to understand the experience and like I feel like I have like a lot more understanding than before though it's uh like it's understanding that's hard to compress into a few words um I mean yeah I yeah you know I hope still learning to learn some more about cryptography and you know to some uh to some extent I have like a you know understood how to use uh how to like actually use recursive sonarcs better than before and I like I feel like I understand Nova better than before but so you know some amount of progress um though I feel like you know if it were more structured it probably it could have been better for me but also like there's just lots of people that were like bugging me with requests the whole time so like there's definitely just is that anything new though yeah it is not I mean to be fair for the first month there was like there was much less of that and like I felt so happy um yeah like just being able to like go out and know that like if someone walks up to me the interaction will be pleasant and won't be a selfie request like that's special um yeah and that's uh but you know then the second month of that actually of like this definitely like started having more outside visitors and started to just like having more people here who are coming just because uh you know it's not the tourist season is starting and it's like nothing to do with Arizona and like it's sort of normalized a little bit and so yeah I'm uh you know looking forward to disappearing a bit again okay uh many people are getting on flights today and tomorrow and are largely going to be out of Isuzu uh what are you going to miss the most about suzulu oh I mean all all of the friends I've made definitely um hmm so Zuzu is coming to an end um but there's this desire for everyone to see more of it um do you have any aspirations or ideas about what zuzalu could become um what what could Zuzu be in its maxually manifested state I think it depends on what the goal is like I think uh this is a little as it was this year is like this uh like convergence point in that for a lot of like possible Journeys it's the uh it's this kind of first experimental step that makes sense as a uh as a first step on one of many different paths but as each of those paths go forward they yeah diverge in some different ways right so uh like one example of this is uh if you want to build a longevity focused Network state where people do Frontier bio research then like you need infrastructure and that infrastructure realistically needs to be in one place and like even if infrastructure was not a problem you'd still need to be in one place because it's hard enough to convince one country to adopt favorable regulations when uh uh so like you know I'm getting a convincing a new country every 60 days is just totally unrealistic right and but other people on the other hand like actually want a additional Nomad Village right other people want a similar experience but for a different set of communities or with uh a yeah somewhat different Focus right like there's just lots of spins of this that make a lot of sense right like one there's even people in Montenegro that want to say yeah longer term crypto City wait like once One path is toward you know building some longer term settlements with a particular goal one possible path is towards doing these uh you know intensive boot camps was the goal of building something right so uh we talked about zoo pass and uh um you know how this kind of served as you know the boot camp for basically incubating zoo pass and then the question is uh well you know what are other things that this could serve as a boot camp for like I don't know secure operating systems I'm secure uh smart contract well it's decentralized social media like uh I don't know right there and then like that's all in the yeah uh kind of you know the world of bits sort of tech land there's uh I'm sure equally many examples um you know in the yellow longevity and biospace for example or even just in terms of like cultural experimentation um so depending on like what the what the goal is there's uh the like different paths that you could take and I think like my ideal goal is to find a way for all of the paths to be taken and that uh you know my like might mean that like you know the names there's although I was like not going to represent like any particular one of those paths right um that's uh yeah like there's still this uh challenge of uh you know what is the role of like you know the core team like does the core team split like you know do people take on different responsibilities like what is that like you know like what kind of actually makes sense as uh an organization of this kind of ecosystem especially as uh you know we have all of these different visions that then start going in different directions from here hmm what do you want your role to be as zuzulu develops into into something bigger I mean I hope that it doesn't depend on me right because I think I mean anything that depends on me is uh not going to scale and uh even before it fails to scale it'll probably make me a you know go crazy from multiple interview requests every day so yeah so um like I said we're at the last day of zuzalu uh people are packing up their bags but yesterday we had a community moment of reflection and we all tried to come together to come to consensus about what are the values of zuzulu what does it mean to be a Zoo's alien um so I'm wondering what your perspective is on that question what does it mean to be a Zoo's alien maybe it's not my place to answer the question yet how do you think that answer should come arrive uh come about I want I I'd love to see like lots of other people writing about what their what their answer is and like I feel like this isn't even modesty on my part this is like actual curiosity like I you know like I'm looking forward to actually reading and you know seeing like what other people see as like this as being and like what kind of future they see it as driving towards and then I think there's going to be a lot of uh you know really valuable information in those answers too well vitalik thank you for being trusting enough of humanity to be able to cast off all of these things into the hands of humans that can do a variety of things to whatever uh is thrown their way so I appreciate it and uh thank you David for you know continuing to Steward of the bankless nation you know this is uh this is the West this is the Ikea Frontier this is the absolute unknown and uh you could lose all of your assets and all of your sanity but you know for those of us who have been here it's uh it is and uh I expect we'll continue to be
