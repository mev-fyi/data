there's all these things that the average person needs that the government can't print and if it gets going to not allocate the losses for all this this debt which is essentially that is I'm going to take the future and I'm going to spend it today right so we spent the future there's no more future right we have to pay for it and so if you have money inside of the system you will pay for it and it's an implicit tax on anyone who saves and things that don't go up as fast as the amount of money printed and so that's the game it creates a financial Speculator out of everyone even if you don't think you're a Speculator you are a Speculator bankless Nation we got Arthur Hayes on the podcast because it is one of those times where there is a bunch of Chaos in the macro world uh our banking sector is apparently completely underwater biology Eastern Nevada is claiming that Bitcoin is going to one million dollars inside of 90 days and it's not a bet on bitcoin it's actually a bet on the hyperinflation of the US dollar and that is a very similar subject to what we are talking to Arthur Hayes today on the show recently Arthur a prolific writer has written another article kaiseki we get into why he titled that but a little preview for this Arthur runs through the last 15 years of monetary and fiscal policy to get up to covid and then he runs through covid up to now and the FED rug pull of rising interest rates faster than they've ever had before to create a mass insolvency in the banking sector and Arthur walks us through this brand new thing this brand new credit facility out of the Federal Reserve the bank term funding program and really unpacks these significance of this Arthur's Big claim here is that the bank term funding program the btfp is constrained in two ways only certain eligible assets are available to access this new credit facility out of the Federal Reserve and this new facility is only alive for one more year Arthur's Big claim is that both of those two variables are about to increase in scope and that is what is going to ultimately allow for Bitcoin to reach one million dollars and so Arthur is Divergent from biology and that he doesn't think it's going to happen in 90 days but he does think it's going to get here pretty damn soon so that is a preview of this content I am here without our fearless leader Ryan it's just me today on the episode so bear with me as I navigate this one solo before we get into this extremely hot episode with Arthur Hayes in which he drops a bunch of f-bombs so fair warning about that we need to talk about Kraken who is our strategic sponsor for 2023 and is helping you go from what Arthur is calling the inside world of the Fiat regime to the outside world of Bitcoin and if Arthur and Balaji are

platforms that dominated the space during the previous bull cycle bitmex got in trouble with the powers that beat and now Hayes has moved on to be the chief investment officer of a family office Maelstrom but you might know Arthur as perhaps the dominant Financial creative writer in crypto when Arthur Hayes drops an article it commands the intention of basically everyone in the industry and not only is this one of those times in which we say babe wake up a new Haze piece just dropped but it's also one of the most chaotic and critical times in macro and monetary landscape that we've ever seen at least since 2008. so Arthur is going to hopefully walk us through how he is navigating these Stormy Waters as a banking crisis seems on the brink of creating a monetary crisis and what we all need to do about it Arthur welcome back to the podcast thank you for having me cheers my man this is uh like I said stormy times creative and your creative writing I think has led people along and navigate help people navigate this path and I think that is what we want to do here today and you start off this piece uh in good fashion with some really interesting literary elements starting with uh this line when you sit down for a kaseki meal the destination is known but the path is not and that really is the the way that you guide us through this article can you talk about how this relates to the money printer because that's I think what you were really referring to is a lot of these crypto people myself included we've all said eventually the money printer is coming back on we don't know how we don't know when uh but this is how you start off this article can you just unpack this metaphor because I think it's going to help us get us along as we go well if we've you know I think a lot of people in crypto and just Financial markers in general have gotten to the habit of studying past Cycles to get informed on how the policy makers will react to another disturbance in the baking industry and if we go back you know hundreds of years when central banks were first created and obviously the most important one today Federal Reserve created in 1913 and we look at what they do every time there is a flare-up or some sort of Financial Risk we find that they resort to printing money and the most poignant example of what happens in their minds when they don't print money is the 1930s depression in the U.S and if you remember the Fed was not as happy with the money printer go Burr button back in the day and they actually allowed baking credit to get liquidated I think I I forget if you secretary Secretary of the treasurer or not but um Andrew Mellon you know remarked that do they need to let the leverage get cleansed out of the system and people need to go bankrupt and this was sort of the ethos back then a little bit more uh huge to the free market capitalism versus you know modern day corporate socialism that is in most countries around the world and so the U.S authorities essentially let the bacon crests unfold they let the system get cleansed of the leverage and one can argue that the US actually put itself in a better position vis-a-vis Europe who didn't do the same thing faced with the same sort of deflationary impulses and ultimately that led the way for the U.S essentially to bail out the Western World when they decided to blow themselves up in World War II but after that everyone learned this lesson they thought they learned this lesson that anytime there is the threat of deflation anytime there is a threat of a baking Panic for whatever reason the response must be to print money and every single cycle they come up with a new term for it you know the most recent one was quantitative easing which I believe was a phrase coined by Professor Werner when he was talking about the bank of Japan after the 1989 crisis and essentially it just means that the Central Bank in some way shape or form is printing money now technically speaking it's not like the Federal Reserve has a money printer and there's a bunch of dollars coming out in the prior Circumstance the the Fed was printing Bank Reserves uh and so you see this balance on the FED balance sheet of how much excess money the baking system has and it's something like three trillion dollars last time I checked but that's essentially what they respond to and so as crypto people like okay well 2000 2009 right after the global financial crisis Lehman Brothers went bankrupt um that December Ben Bernanke had basically announced that he is going to embark on this thing called quantitative easing purchasing these assets to sort of you know bring Financial conditions more frequent so that people can make loans and businesses can expand at least in his theory and starting in March 2009 is when the FED made its first purchase and that pretty much marks the bottom of the s p about 666. and obviously we know that the Bitcoin Genesis block was you know in in January of 2009 and some could say that it was imparted direct response to um you know the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s and the response of the authorities which different from then was to okay we're going to print money and bail everybody out and so we went through that cycle um from 2009 until basically up until 2020 uh when prior to covet the Fed was toying with this idea that they were going to in Janet Jillian words watch paint dry as their balance sheet declined and um Jay Powell who was the FED Sherman at the time was in the beginning of trying to tighten monetary policy and then all of a sudden covid-19 happened and you know there were this Specter of lockdowns in America and the financial conditions started at Titan everybody was worried about all these different companies going out of business the corporate credit Market froze and you know there's just basically a tailspin and the s p 10-year treasury touched a low intraday low I think 33 basis points um and then the FED responded with an immediate emergency meeting and they said essentially we're going to nationalize the entire U.S corporate bond market by Gary teachable being above you can sell it to us and we're going to provide infinite liquidity to make sure the financial conditions can stomach this pandemic and then obviously in response the the U.S federal government out of any government in the entire world develop and developing printed the most money by basically handing out checks to people um yeah the stimi checks right everybody got a check some people bought you know went on Robin Hood and punted crypto and Doge and stocks whatever some people bought a you know got it put down payment in a new car whatever everybody got money and everybody did whatever they wanted to do with it right and so that was in the tune of a few trillion dollars and guess what people are like oh that's kind of inflationary we don't actually want to own U.S treasuries if the government's just going to be handing out money to people so what happened the Federal Reserves you know did their job and they bought almost half of the issuance of of this debt and underpin this massive amount of money printing the most since World War II for for the US and obviously crypto went from you know three and a half four thousand to sixty nine thousand at the peak and then obviously the authors are oh my God we overdid it so we need to go the other direction and then you know Jerome Powell raised rates the fastest of any fed chairman in in modern day history and now we are where we are today the consequence of super easy monetary policy and One Direction really quick super tight monetary policy in the other direction really really quick and now we essentially bankrupted the entire U.S banking system so the punch line that I think really we need to get to is this thing called the btfp the bank term funding program uh and you thank you for walking us through the like what was the setup to this but I want to really just drive this the the setup home uh and so a bunch of money gets printed in this crazy bull market that happened both inside and outside of crypto and as a result of that a bunch of new money gets deposited into a bunch of new Banks and this kind of sets up a lot of these commercial Banks the Commercial Banking sector into kind of a trap because once the FED raised all the interest rates all of a sudden the Paradigm shifts can you can walk us through that last bit of context to set us up for the uh this Bank term funding program sure so obviously you know post the global financial crisis essentially the U.S banking system is bifurcated into the super large too big to fail they call them globally systemic important Banks like the JP Morgan the cities Wells Fargo's Bank of America those type of Banks and then you have everybody else right and there's a lot of the new regulations passed uh on how to do banking in the US and around the world that's Dodd-Frank in the US and Basel III uh internationally and basically what it meant was only the really large players could really make money because it's just so expensive to be a bank um but you know America is very you know there's obviously High income disparities between people and businesses but there is a big tale of people at the middle and the low end right and all these people got checks from the government and what do they do they went to the local bank um it might not be a JP Morgan or a city it might be a community bank or Regional Bank and they deposited all this money and then you know let's take the the one case everybody's really focusing on the Silicon Valley Bank okay and you have this this history of startups raising a lot of money you have 2020 2021 just massive money printing Tech is just going bananas people are raising massive rounds and what do they do they stick all their money right back into the bank that was supporting them Silicon Valley Bank right another you know no name small bank that sort of rose of prominence I don't know who published this chart but there's a great chart that shows percentage rise of deposits over the last um three years and you see Silicon Valley Bank is like one of the biggest beneficiaries of of just deposits in general uh and so as a bank what do you do when you get a lot of money right the job of a bank is to take money from the positors and to lend it out right and you know as we know Banks don't actually like to take real risk if there's a way that the bank can earn money without taking a lot of risk and the risk in this sense is more like a credit risk right lending to an individual person or a small business is way riskier than lending two to the United armor of the United States government so the bank says okay well I'm getting all these deposits essentially for free I'm paying zero percent I can go lend to the US government and treasuries one to two percent I can help originate mortgages or buy mortgage-backed Securities and those yield three to four percent and then on billions and billions of dollars I just get to sit here and take money pay nothing lend money to US government and I make one to three percent you know net interest margins that's a great business and you know as I put it out in the article the shares of the small Banks you know soar right something like over one and a half times uh in uh from 2019 to 2021 at the peak because these Banks had never had so much deposit that's never had so much raw net income from just lending to the US government and then as a maker how can you how can you lose your job it's not like I'm going out and learning to like sketchy individuals I'm literally lending to the US government who essentially regulates me so what what's wrong with this I don't see you know if I'm thinking of a bank manager this is like this is the best trade ever my stock price goes up I make a lot of money I'm taking little to no credit risk because I'm lending to the government so and that's and also importantly they're buying very long-term bonds correct that's also like a super important part of the story yeah so they they didn't they couldn't just lend to the US government on like an overnight basis or a one-year basis because that was basically zero because that was where the fed the FED plays and that you know zero to one the two-year Mark that's where they really control um the short end of the curve and that was at zero percent that's perfect policy so they said okay we need to take more duration or time risk that's led to the government for longer periods of time so we can earn more income right so that's you know 10-year treasuries 30-year mortgage bonds and essentially what that means from a risk perspective is the longer the bond the riskier it is um as interest rates change and so a small change of interest rates can change the price of a 10-year 30-year Bond much more than a small change in interest rates can change the price of a bond that's going to mature in the next year and so the base instead of having credit risk they had duration risk um if interest rates Rose they stand to lose a lot of money and so from 2008 the banking sector probably loses their appetite for credit risk I think that's one of the important pieces of setup here and so what you're saying is like go into uh the most solvent entity that exists which is the Fed because they can print money but in order to have any sort of margin whatsoever they have to buy the longest term bonds because we were existing inside of a paradigm of zero interest rates for so long that was the equilibrium that has been established almost almost completely since 2008 and so that's the setup for like what I'm modeling out as like the FED rug rug pull because they inject a bunch of liquidity and then they jack up interest rates faster than they've ever jacked them up before and so Arthur what does this do to the banking sector and like this is the setup for this current crisis that we were inside of correct yeah absolutely so the banking sector has all these U.S government bonds long-dated bonds and then the FED goes okay we've us and the fiscal politicians have created all this inflation we need to we need to rein this in and so we're going to raise rates really really fast and you know Jerome Powell I think he's in the modern day Paul volcker who you know that starting in 1979 wrote a short-term rate something almost like 20 to sort of break the back of inflation um and Powell says okay we're going to raise rates too really really fast to get to in his mind's neutral and so the FED is targeting uh core personal consumption expenditures core pce is is there a measure um and so he needs to raise rates really really fast and obviously every month there's a new high and you're on your inflation that's measured by the Consumer Price Index and the politicians are all over him you know the Democrats are looking like they're going to get their asses kicked in the midterm elections because everybody's worried that the price of gas and the price of milk is going up so there's all this pressure in the FED beat inflation beat inflation beat inflation that goes okay well we stuffed the banking system full of reserves right so there's they're very very solid there's trillions of dollars sitting over here that I see um from from the banks that I regulate okay they can handle it so they start jacking around and so what happens the the prices of bonds in 2022 so that communicates starting in December 2021 hey we're going to start this thing called quantitative tightening which means we're going to allow the bonds that are maturing on our balance sheet we're not going to reinvest them into the bond market so our balance is going to shrink solely at the tune of about 100 billion dollars a month starting in they've ramped up starting in September of 2022 and we're going to raise your short-term policy rate starting in March so they started raising policy rate in March quantitative tightening kicks in so you have this dual effect not only is the price of money going up but the quantity of money is going down as well and so it's really really tightening uh Financial conditions and as a result 2022 was one of the worst years for the bond market on record right because when you move from essentially zero to one percent interest rates to even 2 three four percent like to us it says oh yeah it's only a few percentage points difference in the rate of interest but that's a two three four X Change in the nominal level of interest rates and on a highly non-linear bond that has a lot of what we call gamma convexity um at the zero bound it causes ridiculously bad losses for anybody who's long bonds and as we saw bond funds got their asses kicked Bloomberg aggregate Bond index was down something like 15 or 20 percent of the year which is the worst showing since probably late early 19th century at least in the U.S context in terms of the bond market and the banks are basically sitting on all these losses and so the base balance sheet is broken up into two things they have what we call available for sale bonds which are the bonds that they they Mark to Market and so those will fluctuate and you can see you know gains and losses and then they have held to maturity Securities which is this essentially sleight of hand and they get to play they say oh I have a 30-year Bond I'm not going to sell it for 30 years therefore even if the price goes down 50 because I'm I'm waiting for maturity and I'll get back all my money plus interest I don't need to mark that to Market and so if I have a lot of Health symmetry Securities and the prices start tinking hey regulator don't don't come after me for breaching regulatory deposit or you know requirements these are held maturity you can hold these at par and the regular is okay sure because we don't want to like actually like do our jobs and you know look at what the banks actually hold and so then we get to play this game that big banks have all these unrealized losses on health and treaty Securities but on that from an accounting standpoint they're they're solvent and they meet all the requirements and so for some reason this is legal which is insane right because we're we're basically pricing in the future of what a bond will be priced at in the future and saying that you can account for that today do you have any intuition as to why this is allowed well you know from a from a logical standpoint if you if the bank says I'm never going to sell this and um it's with the US government then I should not be penalized in terms of a capital charge so if you think you know U.S treasuries don't require any additional Capital against them as per I think Basel Free banking regulations so what is the bank versus if they elect to you and me they need they need to reserve against losses right because we could default so from a capital perspective lending to the government means I don't have to put up additional Equity or Capital against these loans or reserve for losses versus lending to real people and real businesses that's required that's considered riskier therefore I need a preponditional capital so am I going to make those loans no I'm going to leave the government right I'm getting two or three percent risk-free essentially for doing that versus taking real risk to underwriting a loan and then getting charged more capital and possibly I could be in breach of my of my requirements I'd have to go to the equity markets and raise more funds and just not not a lot of fun I like to do the easy thing and still get paid right and so that's what banks did and importantly regardless of how you measure the value of the bond whether the government allows you to measure it at the full term maturity it still doesn't change the fact that there's only so much cash that's available for withdraw by all of these Banks and so that kind of businesses like the market doesn't lie you know the treasury is down at 30 okay cool you can ignore it for 30 years or if you have to sell it today then you're realizing a 30 loss and and that right was the issue and this is kind of where we are in the current state of affairs in the last like week or so where Bank stocks are like read across the board uh and so can you just like give us an audit a sit rep of the current state of the United States banking sector like everything from my knowledge is like deeply red uh how bad is it again it's a bifurcated Market it's um I think the the US is sort of at this um ideological turning board they don't know what to do right it's do we want to be like China which has you know essentially Four State Banks all credit is you know going through those Banks and that's Bank of China ICBC big Communications um and uh CCB China construction Bank you could the analogous would be like JP Morgan City Wells Fargo Bank of America right is that what the you is that what the US Regulators want the baking system to be let's have four really really big Banks they do all the credit creation their Super Sound but there's you know they ossify there's little to no Financial Innovation blah blah blah but you know they're essentially actors of the state or do we want to have a more freewheeling Market where you have thousands of small Banks catering to the different um you know how different location might do baking or different credit conditions right it's kind of the reason why you have either like a one Central Bank which is like let's say the ECB right there's one Central Bank for all of Europe versus the FED system where there's I forgot how many Regional Banks there are and they feed up into into the Board of Governors right because it's a little bit more decentralized structure because the US is coming from this agrarian perspective of okay there's different regions in the US of different Industries therefore there's going to be different rates of interest that would apply which one do you want to choose it's sort of a philosophical question and so essentially in the US you have this sort of um schizophrenia you have on the one hand all these rules that are supposed to make Spanx safer but all they do is increase the cost of compliance and mean that there's only really a few handful of players that can afford to do it they're really really big Banks and then you have all these long tail of smaller banks that essentially serve all the things that the big Banks don't want to do because the big Banks don't need to serve Silicon Valley startups the crypto industry um legal marijuana like all these different things that that people that other Banks might cater to that the big Banks of need to because they have so much business they have the biggest companies in the world stashing billions of dollars of deposits they can lend them money it's very safe like those are the kind of clients that these smaller banks will never ever have and so you have this sort of this different banking system because the Big Bangs are fine they've got 300 of excess liquidity with with the FED they have essentially an explicit government guarantee because they're a deemed too big to fail but then the smaller Banks don't have this guarantee they're supposed to be these free market actors responding to you know supply and demand in the market and and so that was a setup for where we are today everybody did the same trade it's just a smaller Banks needed in much bigger size relative to their Equity Capital we got a lot of deposits that they never had before they made a lot of loans to the US government right and not only the US government they were responsible for a lot of the you know construction loans a lot of the commercial real estate loans which is now in Focus right so they were doing all the things that generate the academic activity of the United States in most countries in the world it's the small businesses the single operators they're responsible for the majority of all economic activity those people can't get Accounts at the GP Morgan or a city but they can get an account at um First National a Silicon Valley Bank at some of these smaller Banks and so they were the ones making all this these riskier loans they're the ones who had much more exposure to you know a rise in interest rates based on their government Bond portfolios and that's where we are today now obviously all banking stocks are down across the board but no one's worried that JP Morgan is going out of business but yeah they're worried about these smaller banks that that aren't too big to fail at the question mark what is it what is the government going to do are they going to extend can they access a discount window are they able to do the things at a JP or a city can do vis-a-vis their interactions with with the government and this this uncertainty was is what's driving people out of the system like well okay do I leave my money at this smaller bank and take any risk that for whatever reason the politicians decide this one we're going to let this one fail we're gonna do free market over here socialism over here and so then you're like I'm gonna go with socialism because then I get my money back and then that's and that's the problem so all the deposits are like  this I'm out and then as a deposits leave the small bank's like okay well what do we have to do to to give back the money we have to sell these bonds and then that is why this this is where this Bank term funding program uh come about is like okay the FED doesn't want us to sell bonds because if they sell these treasuries not only do they realize a loss and technically go bankrupt they um create a disorderly Market in the treasury market records liquidity has declined since 2008 when essentially the the government made it very hard for banks to make markets and treasuries profitably so they said you know okay we're going to step back now the majority of liquidity are these non-bank Financial actors but you know they're not going to provide liquidity you know when it's needed they'll provide it when it's not needed the fair weather Friends of the market and so the last thing that fed in the church would want is everyone don't think bonds to get deposits to just go to stuff them and JP Morgan right it's kind of this like it's this vicious cycle right okay we need to bail out the small Banks because everyone is not is worried that we're not going to extend the same preferences to them that we're extended to these big guys over here so everyone's going to the big guys and then the small Banks go under and it causes all this this you know this knock-on effects and so that was what the bank term from program is there is there to solve it says don't worry you don't need to sell your bonds if depositors leave just give us the bonds we'll give you the full value of the bond in cash and then you give your deposit a cash and now you've done your duty as a bank no issue no big failures you might not make any money but management you're not looking like guys from SCB silvergate signature who don't have a job anymore because they've been taken over you know you're there right so that's that's essentially the program in essence I've actually haven't heard it articulated in this particular way that I actually found this really really useful my mental model for like the all the shenanigans that have happened in the banking sector is that there's been a flight Upstream to the big Banks the long tail of banks is more or less getting cut off because of the rising fastest rising interest rates that we've ever had that I think is more or less what most people understand the fact that these the fact that this long tail of banks are also serving the long tail of the economy is actually a new a new insight for me that I haven't heard before and so this is perhaps why you're you started this conversation saying well what do we want out of our banking sector do we want it to be like China where everything does centralize in the four biggest banks inside of the country or do we want to actually promote the long tail of banks that promotes the long tail of the United States economy and I think what you're saying is this new institution this new bank term funding program is a political statement that we do want to support that long tail is this this is my interpretation it's kind of a halfway house it's not there yet it's it's still the first problem the first problem was I'm not gonna get my deposit back so after you know this it was um silvergate first now unfortunately they were they were the brunt of the litter no one's getting their money back um and then you had Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank depositors are getting their money back but Management's been kicked out equities been zeroed right and then the third iteration was okay we have Bank term funding program nobody's going bankrupt nobody's losing their jobs depositors get your money back but the the cost is it's not free so the problem is that my deposits are were at zero percent the FED via the reverse repo and short-term treasury yields is four to five percent and so depositors are like okay I can leave my money here take risks at the spank those bus and I get zero or I can go give my money to the FED overnight via money market fund they could print money they'll always pay me back and I get four percent why the am I sitting in this deposit and so I'm just gonna keep funneling money up to the FED right funneling money to the US government in short term treasury treasury bills and and what is a fedu says okay well to fund that we're just going to let the banks give us their underwater um paper their mortgages their treasuries and we'll give you back dollars but that doesn't solve the issue that the difference between what the banks can afford to pay which let's call one percent on deposits versus what the federal government is giving at an overnight basis which is four to five percent is too large right the banks can't make money sure like small Banks cannot make money borrowing short and lending long we saw this with the inverted yield curve you know two year versus tenure two three versus Thirty you're at you know before this crisis broke out 100 basis points negative um essentially massively inverted which is telling you the banking system cannot make money and as students of financial history the you know the central banks know that if your banking system in a Fiat economy in this this leveraged business cycle that we have if your banking system is not sound your economy can never be sound and it's been evidence time and a time and again right Japan 1989 crash economies Flatline for the past 30 years China tried to go after its property Market Bank because banking system was about to collapse they've relaxed some things a bit but China's on path for another 20 to 30 years of essentially if you look at the real numbers zero growth right because the banking system needs to allocate these losses the U.S did this well some people would say the smart thing in 1930 is very painful they allocated losses in the 1930s caused a Great Depression however that was all expunged that the GDP was much lower when they came into World War II versus Europe who didn't do that and they benefited from it because they took the pain this this situation we don't take the pain we we extend it out further but the pain will get paid by just below Trend or zero growth and so this is what happens when the baking system can't make money and everyone requires a loan to expand output the small Banks cannot make money if the FED funds rates at four percent even if they give their treasuries to the FED great they've solved the bankruptcy issue everybody gets back their money but the bank cannot make money the bank is just going to accrue losses so these stocks even if they're not a zero they're dead money why would you invest in these things these small Banks can't make money especially if the zero covers even if the Joker Goes positive the shorter in the rates are still too high relative to their Blended costs of where they originated these initial loans they can't pay four percent on fed funds so while the FED has solved the issue of everybody getting their money back um it was a U.S Bank who holds treasuries they haven't solved the issue of I'm a small bank I cannot power the American economy because I can't issue loans because I'm losing money and their interest rates are too high at the short end for me to pay depositors something that's going to attract them to buy Banks so that I can lend money to the small business or the single proprietor so they've solved this very small issue I mean it's massive impact in terms of liquidity but they still haven't solved the real issue which is the banking system is broken they can't make money they can't make loans and the U.S economy and I would say most of development developer world economies are on on track for a nasty business cycle credit-induced recession because the banks can't make any money with short rates this at least this high

from talking about what's happened to uh what is going to happen going from the past and present into the future so there's a couple of different threads we can pull on there's the the recession and threads like okay so I think you're actually kind of just Illustrated that this is what's next is at best uh non-growth at worst uh a recession but then also I want to talk about because like what's going on in on the other side of uh uh this content sphere is is biology is insane prediction that Bitcoin is going to hit a million dollars inside of 90 days because uh all of this money printing all this QE is coming into this world and I'm wondering what's your what's your take on that and so we'll talk about the recession we'll talk about how this relates to crypto assets and what we all need to do about it but let's actually start with crypto assets uh because we have this Bank term funding program we have a bunch of new injection of liquidity and money into the economy uh what does this do to crypto and what does this do to just or risk Assets in generally speaking right so let's separate risk assets so um I spoke about at the end of my article um I think it's uh Perry I forgot his name this is Professor I think um Columbia inside money outside money inside money is money where you're a liability on somebody else's balance sheet right inside money is a US dollar it said money is Japanese Yen Euro C you know are you on whatever inside money is stocks inside money is bonds right these are all things that exist in the financial ecosystem you can't utilize these things without interfacing with the Fiat Financial system and the people deputized to act in it and you have outside money outside money is not a liability on somebody else's balance sheet that would be gold that would be your real estate your apartment or your house that would be Bitcoin obviously um outside money doesn't care what happens to the banking system goes bust outside money still works you still can live in your house you still can walk around with a bar of gold you still can use the Bitcoin blockchain irregardless of regardless of whether or not JP Morgan or city or First National or svb or any of these banks are in business right and so there's risky Assets in both of those buckets but if we're talking about essentially this is the end game where the explicitly or implicitly the major central banks are now in the business of cashing the checks of the government that is by definition the road to hyperinflation doesn't mean you're going to get there but you're putting in place the prerequisites to get there then do you want to own inside money because inside money is going to get deflated because there's gonna be way more Fiat money out there you want to own outside money you want gold you want property you want Bitcoin you know you want vintage cars whatever it is right and so that that is the the setup right if we believe that the authorities are committed to saving the banking system and saving the banking system essentially means guaranteeing that no make an ever go bust which means that banks that buy government debt can do it as much as they want and we're going to give them par whatever the value of the debt is power meaning 100 or face value of that debt at a certain point the money supply expands infinitely and I don't want to have claims on this system I want to be an outside money I want Bitcoin right and that's where this Trope of Bitcoin 1 million comes from now while Bellagio I think is doing a very great marketing campaign in this bet and I don't know how much he how much he's going to lose if he actually loses the bet probably nothing in the you know percentage of his net worth um do I think bitcoin's going a million dollars in 90 days no um I do not do I think Bitcoin could go to a million dollars in this in this cycle absolutely and this cycle would be the next two to three years for sure um and the reason why is okay yes I know I and others say this is quinitiative easy and this is money printing this Bank term friendly program but right now all this is doing is guaranteeing the deposit is get their money back this isn't inflationary as long as the positives keep their money in the banking system because what's going to happen if all I'm doing is taking my deposit from Silicon Valley Bank and putting in a JP Morgan and Silicon Valley Bank or whoever buys it can't originate any new loans achieving work is not going to originate any new loans GP mortgage is going to stuff at an interest on excess reserves at the FED they're not lending any of this money out so there's not any credit creation happening I'm just guaranteeing losses right so for the time being this is all a dead bunny the banking system can't expand because it's underwater because short-term rates are too high right but because I've put this facility in place either the FED starts cutting at the next as the next meeting I don't think every way they will but they could or a nasty recession forces them to cut anyways on in the in the near future that I believe is my mental models for like that's going to happen once those rates start dropping you've you have this all this dry powder that's here and then if you're like yes okay baking system sound yield curve is is um steep again or not inverted game on I'm buying everything under the  sun and Banks start lending people start buying and that's when you get the massive inflationary impulse and that's when you start seeing the real gains in in Bitcoin so while we've had this move from fifteen thousand to to you know close to 30 000 100 off the lows I think that's just telling us the direction of travel I think that the the path to get there is going to be quite Rocky because let's say the effect comes out tomorrow and they say or by the time this airs and it's 25 or 50 basis points hike right and essentially they're going to melt down the rest of the U.S banking system by doing that over time then you could see a risk-off scenario and Bitcoin could get impacted and give up some of these gains you could see they can run from 28 down to 25 000 right and not go into this million dollars everybody's talking about so the path is uncertain we know the result the result is the Fed either hikes and crashes the banking system or Cuts saves a banking system either way they're going to be cutting it eventually and the money that they've created in this facility has created an infinite guarantee which I think will expand it even further as they see more and more of these small Banks you know and the Fiat 110 the faster the American political system is even these flyover small Bumble states have two senators right so they still have power and if mama pop is banging on their senator's door why the are you letting my bank fail and these in New York are have paying bonuses to JP Morgan guess what's happening there's a there's going to be a nationwide guarantee on all Bank deposits it's just politically um that it's in a post agrarian economy where you still have a lot of power in in these smaller States um that aren't really connected to New York and Silicon Valley there's going to be political pressure to extend this this guaranteed everyone it's just going to take a banking crisis and some more Banks to fail for them to get there but they'll get there eventually but it's set in the Seas for when things really take off they're going to take off even bigger than before because the pile of money and the guarantees that have been put in place are essentially guaranteeing an infinite amount of money printing as much debt as the government can print can issue the banks are there to buy it because if banks don't have any risk anymore that's the point I'm making but we're not there yet and so yes okay Bellagio's making this bet I don't think it's going to happen um my mental model is it's probably we're probably you know a little chop here maybe we get the 30 000 and you know don't break through whatever uh I still see some medium-term choppiness before we really get lift off we really need the FED to really break the banking system now maybe they're going to back away from the precipice and not hike I don't know I think I'm still missing a link here between uh how there's enough Total Money creation to send Bitcoin even to a million dollars inside of two years the numbers that you put in your article is that the the bullishness if you will because of you know money issuance is bullish for risk assets you're saying that the uh the bank term funding program is implicitly printing 4.4 trillion dollars and that is just what I'm understanding to be the Delta between the actual value of these underwater treasuries and what they will be valued at their full-term loans is that in that that I'm basically saying the not the amount of U.S treasuries and Mortal mortgage-backed security is held on U.S banking system balance using aggregate is 4.4 trillion and though that's been guaranteed right so if you want to go in 10 noodles to the fed you can get 4.4 trillion dollars now it's up to you or your deposit what you do with that money but essentially the entire deposit base 4.4 trillion dollars can be exchange for cash using these security that is quantitative easing by definition right what you do with that cache determines how financial markets you know sure deal with it right right and the next question is okay 4.4 trillion is about 300 billion more than what happened during covet in terms of the rising the failed balance sheet that still doesn't get us to a million even if we extrapolate on a one-for-one basis how do we get to a million dollar Bitcoin well the the next situation is okay well the small a lot of small Banks and the ones are really getting punished right now are the ones that don't that didn't lend to the government these are the banks that went to the multi-family like the condo Builders either the banks that lent to the person building an office building these are the banks that lend two Mall operators these are the banks that lend two small mom and pop businesses they originated all these loans these are not eligible at the fed this is their predominantly with their loan book is handled but everyone says small Bank bad big Bank good I want my money back right and they go well we can't give this bond to the FED because they're not accepting it so we've got to sell it who's buying it nobody right no one's buying these bonds these markets dead right BlackRock has a real I forgot the name of real estate from they've gated withdrawals this American's nobody's getting out right and so this is why the stress is not going to it's going to be on any bank that the majority of their loan book is non-us treasuries and mortgage-backed securities because those are not guaranteed right now and that's where the pressure is going to come and so once we see one of those Banks fail and I haven't done the analysis or I don't know the names of the banks that are more heavily in this that bucket but if you're looking at Banks and you want to say okay this is the bank that I think it might be a good short those are the banks the loan book is predominantly non-treasury non-workers about Securities because those are not guaranteed so when the deposit leaves that bank goes bust until the government comes in and says actually every single loan originated on a bank balance sheet regulated by the FDIC or whoever the regulator is is now guaranteed so what is that in the US is about like 18 trillion um of of deposits um and in essence the entire banking system right they need that's where they have to go to because the Market's going to say okay well cool you got treasuries we're not with you you've got loans to commercial real estate malls businesses yeah we're with you right and so those are the people that are going to feel the pain and I think eventually they're going to get bailed out too because again they're the ones that power economic growth there in states that have two senators and they can apply political pressure to get what they want and so I think that's the master of travel so that gets us to 18 trillion of implicit guarantee now the real coup de gras for this program and I think which is super elegant and what they did is the real problem is not the immediate problem of the banking system the real problem is after the debt ceiling gets raised July August September whenever it is the US government is fighting Wars all over the world and not just you know  them up Shoot Em Up Wars It's we're on climate change you know all these esoteric you know non-defined Concepts that we're fighting a war on right and so these are expensive because you're spending a lot of money you have the inflation reduction act or whatever  name they came out with um and they're just handing out money to Preferred Industries to do stuff right it's expensive and it's not as if tax receipts are growing they're actually falling and so there's going to be deficits that need to be funded in the single-digit trillions and it's going to keep growing year after year after year who's going to buy these bonds like the U.S banking system post covid could be counted on to buy government bonds because they had a great spread on them and the FED said inflation's transitory there's no more inflation it's dead blah blah blah you don't have to worry about interest rate risk the bank said okay my Regulators tell me you don't have to worry about interest rates I'm not worried about interest rates I'm trying to get paid here and and so they piled in but you've just taken that away they just blew up because the FED blew them up by raising interest rates so high on their U.S government securities so how do we get the banking system back in the business of buying the debt that we have to issue well we guarantee that if they ever get into problems we just give them back dollars that we printed and from a technical standpoint the Federal Reserve from an Optics perspective is not cash in the checks of the government which In classical Economist says hyperinflation hyperinflation we need to sell bonds it's the banking system buying the bonds of the US government because they're guaranteed to get money whenever they need it from the fed and If the Fed reduces interest rates are low enough rate where the curve goes positive again long-term rates greater than short-term rates it's profitable for the banks to have deposit base buy every single issuance that they can of U.S government debt and if they ever need to give their deposit respect money they give the debt to the fed the FED gives them dollars right and so we go this little Merry-Go-Round and the US government gets to stuff bonds down the throat to the banks and everybody's happy and that's what I think the real end game is and that's how you get to bitcoin one million because that is yield curve control that is the Central Bank cashing the checks to the government few steps removed but it's the same  thing and that is right that's where I think this program is beautiful in terms of how beautifully Sinister but beautiful in the same in some respect and how it accomplishes this goal people aren't going to think about it until it exists and you know obviously they have this oh it's going to end next year there's no way it can end next year if why would I hold a baking stock if I know that they've got all this thing all these debt that they can't tend into the FED they have the same problem the problem hasn't gone away um so are we going to crash it thinking system again March next year we're just going to keep doing this again and again and again no they're going to extend it and once they've given an infinite extension then the bank says okay cool regular so that I can use this program oh government's selling a bunch of 30-year debt that doesn't matter what the interest rate is it's positive spread I get to make money on my deposit I'm there taking all that  oh I need my my customer wants to take that money and I don't know go buy something cool fed here are these bonds give me back 100 um I'm still making money great so it's that's the one million dollar Bitcoin but that doesn't happen immediately this is It's a path there um and I think it's not entirely straightforward but that's where I see it going and I think Bitcoin eventually will discount that future it's not going to happen before June um to help Elijah out but I think as we start seeing the slow motion evolution of everybody getting the bailout to guarantee expanding expanding and expanding as more holes are poked in well why did he get a bill and I didn't get a bailout right that's the question that's that's the it's the um unevenness of the response some people are getting you know a good response to some people looking at bad response and it's only to do with what they hold them on on their balance sheet and there's nothing else to it than that and so I think as we move down this path that's how we get to one million dollar Bitcoin but it's not an immediate thing um it's going to happen in overtime right okay so implicit in your uh uh model of the future is just an increasing scope of the bank term funding program so the bank term funding program is constrained in the assets that are eligible to access the facility and it's also contained constrained in scope in that it expires according to the FED inside of one year and what you're saying is that both of these variables are going to expand just because of the political interests the political forces that will inevitably be placed on on the fed and the market forces okay the the FED just bailed out two Banks oh the positives of these specs and if we you know take the media narrative at face value it is the most toxic sector of the banking system One Bank like to do the crypto Bros the other big one to the tech Bros I couldn't think of two worst constituents in American politics right so and but so we started from a real good place the management management got balanced and Equity holders got a donut okay but the deposit has got their money back so expand that right why if they're willing to do it for them why are they really going to do it for you know XYZ bank and Bumble flyover country America who lends to Farmers and we all know the farmers have a lot of power because of how the system the political system is set up um between you know Senate house and the executive branch and so I think the politics is going to dictate that you can't bail out the the banks on the coast and not fill out the banks and the Heartland right and that's and it's just this state versus photo you know continuing you know Clash if you want to call it that that exists in all countries with this with a similar sort of um political setup because who how do you politically allocate the loss that's the question the politicians had to tell us okay well there's a loss we know there's a loss in the banking system who who takes the loss is it the small Bank over here is it the large bank is it the central bank is it the federal government is it the state government that's up to the politician to decide uh and so um and you're and if you're not able to uh clearly allocate losses in an objective manner then you just get to bail out everybody and so that's where I think we're going to go to because there is no reason why I should bail at a treasury bond but not the bond for the commercial real estate project why that one not this one right so Arthur who loses here because this sound you're you're painting a very um I think Rosy optimistic picture uh oddly because like eventually you're saying that everyone everyone's getting all their money banks are going to be able to take free risk Bitcoins going to a million dollars in two to three years where who takes the L the L is anyone who holds you know dollars right and inside inside of the system right so if you if okay if bitcoin's a million in oil is 500 right or if bitcoin's a million and it costs you you know a family of four could feed themselves for ten dollars and now it's fifty dollars right and they didn't own any Bitcoin and they didn't own any Financial assets outside of the system that's who loses the inflation just goes nuts yeah you can get your money back we'll give you all the dollars you want those dollars just don't buy real stuff anymore hey I need I'm an older person and I need health care right and you know the healthcare worker instead of it's a you know to get a nurse and it's 200 000 a year now it's half a million to get a nurse and um and so healthcare costs go up right there's all these things that the average person needs that the government can't print and if it gets going to not allocate the losses for all this this debt which is essentially that is I'm gonna take the future and I'm gonna spend it today right so we spent the future there's no more future right we have to pay for it and so if you have money inside of the system you will pay for it and it's an implicit tax in anyone who saves and things that don't go up as fast as the amount of money printed and so that's the game it creates a financial Speculator out of everyone even if you don't think you're a Speculator you are a Speculator because now you need to determine okay I know my family's cost of living is going to go up I know my health care is going to get more expensive what can I buy that's going to help me you know accomplish those goals within with an acceptable amount of risk the answer is nothing you become a Speculator you're speculating on stocks you're speculating on property you're speculating on crypto you're speculating on everything because you're spending all your time thinking about how do I provide for my family when the currency that I hold is being devalued constantly and that's who loses everyone loses they just don't think they lose because yes I got my money back in nominal terms but the cost of things that are outside of the banking system that I need food energy Health Care are all going up exponentially so this sounds like uh something uh crypto people are all too familiar with it they've been paying attention to the world of inflation this has been a big crypto narrative for a long time uh and then biology in our recent podcast with him said yeah uh America is the new Argentina there's new rampant inflation uh and so I think this is this is what you and obviously it's not just America it's the whole Fiat banking system because while America is the worst example of this it's in Europe it's in you know it's in China it's in everywhere capitalist Communists whoever the ISM you want to say your country everybody said I'm going to borrow from the future to fund stuff today because that gets me elected or that keeps me in power and it doesn't matter how you get elected that that was the game right everybody played the game Future's over okay unless we're going to discover as I said in the article some new sorts of energy that's extremely dense um it's gonna power the next you know path forward in human you know evolution of society then we got to pay this this debt um right and it's going to come in the form of inflation and zero to no growth for a very very long time so the answer to the question who's taking the L is not just the US dollar but it's the entire Fiat regime exactly okay wow uh that but that the the Argentine we know this is the case and we know this is the case because what did the FED do last weekend um or whatever it was they said they didn't they didn't come out and say oh we're gonna bail out the small banks in Iowa Nebraska who lent two real American businesses oh no we're going to bail out every single friendly Central Bank whose banking system all had the same trade on because once they guarantee that if you hold the U.S treasury and you're a U.S Bank you get your money back as a depositor why the would I hold my money in any other bank right U.S government most powerful government US dollar Reserve currency of the world if a bank held U.S treasuries my money's good backed by the government and if I have a forward account if I'm abroad and I have a foreign account in the US where I can stuff my money I'm dumping Euros I'm dumping in I'm dumping everything I'm buying dollars and I'm putting it in the bank because I know I'm safe because guess what every other single banking system did the same trade print money in 2020 2021 Jack Industries up to 2020 to massive losses right Undeclared losses every single banking system has the same trade to the varying degrees everybody knows this and now we've just called on the banking system and so the FED had to bail out every other one of their foreign central banks who are friendly by saying hey we have unlimited swap lines for you guys so what's the trade for them it's okay I have treasuries or whatever client says I want my dollars they get the dollars from the FED they pledge whatever they need to pledge right and so this that was a bailout of the entire world euro dollar market uh over the weekend that the FED did because they all have the same issue and until they all move to the same sort of deposit guarantee um then they're going to see the sucking sound of deposits from their system to the United States and the swap line sort of solve that issue so it's given the time for the ECB the boj the bue the RBA and all the different central banks to enact a similar sort of guarantee on deposit it's coming everywhere the America is just the worst example of it but everywhere in the Fiat world this is going to be the name of the game because guess what they're all educated at the same schools they all believe the same stuff and they all want intellectual cover so if the fed and the treasury have started the bank term funding program they'll change the letters put the Google translate on and they'll they'll make it sound whatever native thing they need to make it sound like so it doesn't sound like the main term funding program it's the same and it's gonna happen everywhere okay so the Federal Reserve in the dollar obviously is like the epicenter and what you're saying is that like this gravitational pull is pulling in all the other central banks along with it can you unpack the the swap uh what's the swap thing because that's the the really the thing that connects to all of this can you just do that yeah so if I'm if I'm a local Bank in Europe say say I'm uh I'm Credit Suisse uh and everyone's like oh credit Suite is I want my I want to put my money in in dollars right so I'm gonna don't I want my Euro deposits gone I'm gonna FX them into Dollars I'm going to put them in a U.S bank branch right where the dollar is going to come from the banks have to sell something right what the US government does not want is all these foreign Banks dumping treasuries to get dollars to pay the deposits back for the dollars that go into the US banking system because in the treasury market blows up right they've got all these fires beware and they're trying to piecemeal patch them up they don't want the interesting Solutions foreign Banks owns United States treasuries that's a common absolutely and so this is the ammo that they have to fire into the market to sell but you're saying the the United States fed can't that's untenable for them exactly so they don't want people you know indiscriminately dumping treasuries to get dollars back to pay back their depositors with those Dollar Trees coming back in the US anyway so they said hey guess what swap lines are open you know so it's National Bank ECB Boe don't sell your treasuries why don't you like take those Treasures on your balance sheet we'll give you dollars don't worry about that get make sure your banks are cool right so you don't have a dollar funding program problem anymore you can get all the dollars you need to satisfy deposits just please please please don't sell treasuries right that you don't want that to happen keep them where they are so here's a swap line so we'll print the money and give it to you that's actually what they're doing um and they and again you know the point I made is it's you know America like every other country in the world uh domestic politics is very xenophobic if small Bank in Nebraska ain't getting bailed out why the is Credit Suisse and UBS and Deutsche Bank and Barclays and all these foreigners getting their dollars and I can get my  dollars and that's what they're playing they're not saying this but that's why you do a swap line where people dealing with a swap is right because it's a very you know to most people it's an esoteric concept taught in business school it has no bearing on their daily life but it's a bailout of the form banking system that most people aren't going to notice so Arthur what's the punchline here uh punchline a few punch lines are the Fiat regimes going to zero dollars are going to inflate aggressively maybe I don't know if you will use the word hyperinflate but it sounds like we're at least trending towards that uh crypto and hard assets that are quote outside the system are bullish and hedges against all of this like how would you really just summarize what is next for this world because this seems to be a phase change in the world of money and finance and global global economies that uh I have we haven't seen since 2008 and maybe even bigger than 2008 what's the punch line here well the punchline is that the banking system is being Prime globally to be the buyer of Last Resort of all government debt right and so if we think about the trillions and trillions of dollars of government debt and if you want to add in like unfunded liabilities which I would say is health care for the Baby Boomers globally right hundreds of trillions of dollars that need to find someone to buy it at a price that makes sense right there is a price you want to let the free market operate in the 30-year at 10 10 great a bunch of people going bankrupt right but bunch of people don't we don't want them to go bankrupt but this the loss is there there is no escaping the loss now we're as a society going to politically determine who Bears the loss right and instead of saying you know financial institution ABCD you bear the loss we're going to say the entire global population in the Fiat world is going to Bear the laws by inflation and if you don't get your money into an asset that outperforms inflation in the Fiat term it doesn't necessarily have to be hyperinflation you will lose out on real terms so you better understand what's going on and become a Speculator because everybody's a Speculator now now I believe that Bitcoin is a great asset you might not believe that and you may think it's gold you may think it's car reshales I know the doesn't matter but again in your mind you're now a Speculator everyone needs to understand that because this isn't yeah they got paid a lot you get your divided back hunky-dory but the end game is the banking system must absorb all the government debt that is coming due to pay for all this stuff to pay for climate change to pay for the richest generation in the world dying and spending a lot of money on end of Life Care um as a parish right these are the things that must get funded and we have less people with money to fund them therefore there will be inflation and so I think this is just a clever way to stuff it in a place where people aren't necessarily going to associate with hyperinflation because what you don't want to have happen is a mental shift of the average person saying my country my currency is I get paid at 12 o'clock on Friday at 1201 I need to have bought everything I've needed by right that that's Weimer Germany that's Zimbabwe that's you know that's hyperinflation where you need to dispose of your currency as soon as you get it because you're worried that the real good is going to be gone or it's going to be at a much higher price in the immediate future and so that is the end game and so that is why everyone is now a Speculator I believe that Bitcoin is one answer to this there's all sorts of different answers but that is the end game is another way to say everyone turns into a Speculator uh perhaps another way to illustrate this is that the denominator is uncertain as in it's no point denominating dollars anymore when they're all just losing their value and so you need to change up your denominator and that is a source of chaos as the world tries to figure out all right we're not using the dollars at the denominator anymore we need a different denominator what's that denominator going to be is that another way to say this yeah exactly like what what is as is it gold is it coil is it natural gas is it whatever right it doesn't doesn't matter what it is but it's not as easily mentally to think oh yes I get a dollar I know in a year that dollar is going to buy me a loaf of bread the and I don't have to worry about that now level bread is two dollars that just adds an extra level of inks and anxiety into the average person that now they have to worry about all this and what do they do they say okay  I'm gonna buy everything I need to buy today right now because I don't know what the dollar is going to be worth I don't know if the yen is going to be worth I don't know what the euro is going to be worth right I don't know and so in the face of that uncertainty I I should just hoard as much as I can today and that's how you get these these insane you know price Rises price Falls and everything just becomes super super chaotic and you have all this volatility and that's what you know central banks are there to do is to suppress volatility and now it's going to explode in their face that's what they're worried about so Arthur what are you doing what's your denominator my denominator is essentially like okay oil right that that is the master energy resource and so okay what obviously you can't just own barrels of oil and like you know go and like scoop out a bit and use it whenever you want right you need to have something that is a abstraction of that Bitcoin is pure energy money because I burn energy to do work to create this this system uh it's and it's capped at 21 million right and most importantly it's invisible and weightless I could have as much or as little Bitcoin as I want and nobody knows I have it and so in a system where the average person is worried about how they're going to afford their next meal you can't be driving on the street in the Bugatti flashing yellow that  gets killed right and so um ostentatious shows of wealth in places that are experiencing hyperinflation is a very dodgy dodgy position to be in so if you think that you're going to hold all your money in some very obvious form then you're going to find out that you might be relieved of that that sense of security very very soon and so that's why I think Bitcoin is very beautiful in that no one knows how much anyone has of it and we can transact purely over the internet and we know it's firmly based in spending energy to do work that it is pure money purely worthless at the same time I'm purely worth everything at the same time and that's why it's such an elegant concept and I believe that it's going to be for a certain percentage of the population very well sought after but the time is now because again if money leaves a system then that loss gets recognized as long as there's as long as you stay in the system as long as you own inside monetary assets then you are subject to be inflated out of your money but if you take your money today and you move into an asset outside of the system then now they can't take your money away from you you they can't inflate you away right and so you're going to see it become harder and harder and harder to own these things now I don't think they're going to outright ban things because you know with the internet and to the general level of information out there I think people would take that as a very signal that the game is up but you know they can heavily promote you know ETFs and all these products that live inside the baking system that supposedly give you access to price moves but they don't actually give you the thing itself and so I think people need to recognize that and it's very subtle and unfortunately it's very annoying like you have to think about these things but if you want to have outside money make sure it's actually outside of the system and make sure you get out as soon as you can get out because it's just going to be like a vice closing in and you're optionally more constrained as things get more down the line if this path continues the way I think it will well Arthur uh I think this is uh like you said in the beginning of your article we didn't know how we would get here but this has been the destination that bitcoiners have been saying that we would arrive to for a very long time now so thank you for for writing the article and guiding us through this this uh piece of content here today I really appreciate it the the guidance and the articulation if there's anything any topic that we've missed or anything further that you have to add that I haven't asked about has anything come to mind no this is great Arthur thank you so much uh where can people read your stuff where can people find you how can people follow along yeah so medium um crypto Haze that's my handle there blog.bitmix.com all the articles are published there so you can just subscribe to either one of those mailing lists and you'll get my articles or at crypto Haze on Twitter um I post them there as well so um yeah stay tuned it's going to be you know a crazy wild ride and we're only just only get started but this was definitely a momentous occasion in terms of you know financial markets and what's going to happen over the next you know three to five years yeah uh to put on the crypto perspective this seems to be kind of more or less what we were training for perhaps uh and at least we have your writing to guide us all along the rest of the way Arthur Hayes thank you so much thank you Pecos Nation you know the deal risk and disclaimers ether is risky crypto is risky Defy is risky but so is the entire Fiat regime and perhaps it's more risky but you know capital is uh flighty no matter what you can lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot thank you foreign
