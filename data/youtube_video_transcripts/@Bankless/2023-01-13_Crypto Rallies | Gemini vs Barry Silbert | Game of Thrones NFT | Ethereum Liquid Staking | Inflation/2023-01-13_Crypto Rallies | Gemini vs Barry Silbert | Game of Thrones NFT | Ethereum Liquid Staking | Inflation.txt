the winklevi escalate their fight against Barry Silber and digital currency group causing Barry silbert to have to release uh in letter to investors uh Sam bakeman freed our favorite three-letter acronym dude as doing more Sam banquin free things so get ready to face palm coinbase lays off 20 of its staff while binance is looking to increase his staff by 30 percent bankless Nation it is this the second Friday of January we're in 2023 I hope you're ready for what we're about to give him David the bank List Friday weekly roll up Brian where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless into 2023 which so far has been bullish has been so far bullish numbers 12 Days 12 days of green yeah we've got some double-digit green too we're gonna get to that in the markets uh also going to talk about digital currency group versus the Winklevoss twins the fight has escalated even further on Twitter of course because worlds do modern people fight gotta be in public got to be on Twitter we'll cover that we'll tell you what's going on there and uh we'll see if we can draw any conclusions from that what else are we talking about today meanwhile FTX discovers 5 billion dollars under the couch cushions wow that's pretty sweet uh SPF requests access to his Robin Hood shares in order to pay for his legal defense you'll never guess what happens next and then sadly the coinbase has to lay off 20 of the staff ahead of crypto winter but binance is hiring uh and then Ryan's also going to walk us through some CPI numbers as well because we got that literally this morning just a few years ago inflation's deflating inflation down so that's that's good news inflation deflation let's talk about that in a little bit but first gotta tell you about our friends and sponsors over at osmosis osmosis is a cosmos app chain that specializes in defy David you want to tell the bankless Nation about this uh cool app chain and what it can do yeah it's the liquidity app chain of the cosmos ecosystem and so if you ever listen to our episode uh why uni chain is inevitable with Dan Elite sir he gave the case as to why uniswap will eventually produce its own application chain osmosis is the instantiation of that thesis inside of the cosmos ecosystem and it is perhaps a place to get started if you are interested in exploring the cosmos ecosystem you can Bridge right in to osmosis from ethereum polygon binance polka dot arbitrum all the all the highly used places and you can do some things uh the normal things that you would do on any sort of decks you can swap tokens but because it's an app chain you can do some other cool things as well like liquid staking and other things like this so you know if you want to explore the osmosis universe and the cosmos ecosystem there's a link in the show notes you can go to osmosis.zone bankless you know David I wouldn't have said this a year ago but um Cosmos defy on the cosmos e in the cosmos ecosystem is really matured and I think it's worth exploring some in 2023 at least that's been part of my New Year's resolution all right David let's get to markets we got the happy music I hope it's happy because I'm very happy Bitcoin is up tell me about it oh it's uh it's a bigly it's up uh 8.7 starting the week at sixteen thousand eight hundred dollars ending where it is right now at a whopping 18 250 8.7 on the week is this uh up on CPI is this up on macro is what why are we up well okay so so if you look in the far right on the screen you see that big red candle that goes from like eighteen thousand dollars down like eighteen three hundred down now that was right after the CPI print so CPI print came out and then it jumped 200 downtown two or three hundred dollars and then immediately jumped right back up to where it is now at 18 250 but it's been running up all throughout the last week or so and especially yesterday uh this also happened to Ether too 17 it went from seventeen thousand four hundred dollars and just zoomed straight up to eighteen thousand four hundred dollars inside of like half a day it's um cryptos kind of following the market a little bit I think I wonder what the correlation looks like right now by Chad Market yeah Trad market stocks and such um I guess just just more so um well maybe this was a disproportionately good week for crypto though even even though uh markets went up okay what happened with each price that's a big story too yeah ether started the week at 1250. dollars where it's been hovering around being just like the 1200 stable coin for the past like two months uh up 12 and a half percent all the way up to fourteen hundred dollars it hit a high of fourteen hundred and twenty dollars which was the high exact high of 2017. by the way there's that number again yeah uh uh fell down did the same thing at Bitcoin as soon as the CPI print came out it dropped down to 13.50 uh but it has since recovered in that moment back up to fourteen hundred dollars where we are now so up twelve and a half percent on the uh on the week the question David and I are about to discuss in a little bit is uh have we bottomed yet think about that listener as we get to the next section but first we'll talk about the eat the Bitcoin ratio an important ratio in this market what's that showing uh we are up three and a half percent on the week it's been a very good week for the ratio uh it's harder so like moving it the ratio is harder than the dollar like crypto prices move uh very a lot versus the dollar but ether and Bitcoin they don't move as much in relation to each other so 3.5 percent is actually like a decent move we are currently clocking in at .076 we hit a high of 0.078 David this is not the eighth of the last bullet of the last bear Market this is a totally different a different different I think we can see it here here's ultrasound money um a number you and I were looking at uh earlier in the week was the supply change since oh my God a thousand Ethan a week yeah so over the last 120 days guys eth has only increased in its total issuance total Supply and this is of course selling pressure by 2000 eth right it's not ultrasound it's not deflationary at this point but only 2000 Eve versus what it would normally be and what it was in the previous bear Market we would have added 1.4 million each Supply and what does that equate to David run some numbers for me what does that equate to in terms of uh rounding up slightly to two billion dollars two billion dollars of cell pressure just a limited did not have and that was in last bear Market no wonder eth went all the way down 94 and uh way underperformed Bitcoin um different eth different asset completely and so I'm actually not surprised to see the gains on the ratio let's zoom out on this chart really quick if you don't mind let's go out let's go out really really go uh oh now the candles are getting super tiny these cracking charts can do anything so we can uh yeah if customers are wondering these the sexy new interface is the Kraken Pro new interface uh Kraken Pro has really got a cosmetic upgrade lately so thank you for cracking glorious for serving us these ever important prices I mean so we have a lot of time left to start filling out these this bear Market candles uh there's probably I'm if this follows the like last bear Market which is a lot more volatility still has to leave we're just gonna like find a bottom yeah look at this over here right yeah and chop back in 2018. but I mean if you compare those two Peaks like you can kind of tell we're at the tail end of uh just like the the depression of the the Peaks uh they're over here there was this maybe like there was that one moment uh back in like June July of 2018 where like ether and Bitcoin started to flatten out like I think Bitcoin was flattening out at 6 000 ether was flattening out at like 300 and they're like okay fine we established the bottom and then the bottom fell out and we went down like another 50 um so if we are trying to say that this is the same as last cycle then that would still be ahead of us but I don't necessarily think that that's ahead of us I do think that ether is a different asset this cycle and it might be more apt to compare Eve to bitcoin of previous cycle than Eve to eth of previous cycle I don't know if that uh throws any insight but like I was just looking earlier so eth is down 71 from all-time high Bitcoin is down 73 more than eth yeah that's certainly not the case last bear Market where uh Bitcoin was surviving and doing okay when Bitcoin was and eth was completely getting destroyed uh very interesting okay what about total crypto market cap uh where God above above 900 billion so we were finally back above 900 billion we're at 919 a billion dollars okay well 16-9 there it is uh let's talk about the inflation numbers they uh came out earlier this week they were good December inflation report the headline is Consumer Price gains continue to cool here's the chart for you um David do you see this kind of Spike for inflation this is a fully zoomed out chart all the way from 1965 all the way to 2023 where we are now and uh we're down to 6.5 inflation for December and that of course is a low number of 6.5 well it peaked in June 9.1 percent and uh ever since we've been going down down down uh last month that we saw a report November was 7 1.1 percent now it's 6.5 percent the reason the market reacted favorably-ish to that uh was because it was just exactly at what was predicted by the market the street was saying 6.5 we came in at 6.5 this of course is still well above the fed's uh Mission which is a two percent inflation rate maybe they'll increase that to three percent that's what some are saying Powell's holding firm that the target is two percent uh and then of note of course before the pandemic before all of this chaos that you see from 2020 onwards inflation used to be 2.1 percent used to be the most boring number in all of Finance because for the last like decade or two it's always been like two percent never changed uh quite volatile these days what do you think are we are we done with inflation so we just recorded our podcast with Tyler Cowan which comes out on Monday and he mentioned that uh we really need to see three months in a row of decrease inflation to really feel okay-ish in confidence about the trend here and he was and we recorded with him a few days ago and this was the print that we were looking for to see if it would continue to Trend down for three months in a row and it is uh I think and so he said three months is what you need to start having some amount of confidence so I think we are in the earliest stages of being able to have some amount of confidence about a downwards Trend and I think every single month after that where we continue to print lower we're just going to start stacking on the confidence and the confidence and the confidence and that's really what it takes uh for risk appetite to come back and so we are on to the first of many boxes that are checked but it is the right step in the right direction well let's switch back to the uh the crypto Cycles again so some people are saying there was a lot of Leverage in the system quite obvious built up in 2021 and 2022 and now that Leverage is gone it's been washed out it's been flushed down the toilet by by three areas capital and all of the margin traders that got completely wrecked this is a tweet from Jack do you want to tell us what he's saying yeah Jack is saying over leverage was the theme of the gear it was really the theme of the entire bull market being over leveraged but how much leverage remains in the system this year he asks despite major blowouts from incumbents like FTX Bitcoin liquidations are down significant and significantly in the second half of 2022 suggesting that the majority of Leverage has been washed out and that's probably also why we're seeing a lot less volatility in crypto asset prices is that Leverage is volatile leverage adds to volatility and now that like things are stable there's less incentive to take leverage because you can't really trade as much in this market but you're just seeing a lot lower liquidations both on the long and short side meaning we are in a much more healthy much more grounded phase in the market which implies that we are closer to a bottom than we otherwise would be if we had a lot of Leverage well let's just flat out ask the question uh I I did on Twitter has crypto to bottomed this was a results poll 44 said yes 55 0.3 said no so kind of spring even pretty even I call that even a little more saying no what's your answer to that have we bottomed yet David have we seen the all-time lows of this cycle yeah I I mean when we hit below 800 ether and like below sixteen thousand dollars for Bitcoin that I don't think we're going back there like Bitcoin got or ether got down to 870 or something like that was the question I think we bottomed I don't think we're going below that I think that was uh in your predictions I think I think you're still like cautiously worried about a three-digit ether and I still don't think that's gonna happen I don't I don't necessarily think we'll go below the 800 was like 800 something I can't believe remember what the bottom tick was for eth but um I mean I I that that's something really bad would have to happen yeah it would have to be another event I mean like go back and look how strong eth is from a from a supply perspective right um it would have to be something that utterly shakes the confidence of existing holders and I can't actually think about what that would be um if like coinbase would have to go insolvent or binance would have to go insolvent or something like that I mean I really do feel like and we'll talk about this a little bit later that um the digital currency group piece is the last bit of contagion that's really where we ended the year and and that still feels kind of uh to be the case but can you make um you know so if they're either bottomed at 880 by the way I am also going to I guess I'm making things less interesting by agreeing with you but like I'm also going to say crypto bottomed now that doesn't mean we're not in for a lot of chop and a lot of stagnation and this whole apathy phase ahead I still think that's in store um but can you make the uh the Steel Man the argument that um crypto has not bottomed yet what would somebody who's still bearish on crypto say what do you think would be their their main um arguments here uh I'm not gonna be very good at this uh there's the uh you you had the complacency bottom first we had like the leverage and flush out bottom which we think happened and then you were talking about a complacency bottom or like sweet now crypto is going to be boring for like two years in a row and people are gonna be frustrated that nothing exciting is happening in the crypto markets and then like just three years down people are just like this is boring I'm out uh there's an opportunity elsewhere and so people sell for the complacency bottom that marks the actually the beginning of the next bull market I think there's that but I don't again I don't get much Credence to that and then and then there's like there's actually more contagion that we really know about when dcg it's totally gonna go under they're gonna sell everything that they got uh that's gonna put a lot of cell pressure into the market and that can do another round of cascading liquidations for over leveraged players that would be the other case I don't think that's gonna I think that I I think that would be the steel man argument it's just that there's this um this apathy um drop and it's gradual and it's over time and that's in the it's basically in crypto if there's nothing new in crypto that means down by default there's nothing new people lose interest it's down and so you kind of have to bet that nothing new is going to happen apathy will will creep in over the next year or two David I gotta say I can't get behind the case that nothing new is going to happen in crypto there's so much building going on there's so much excitement I mean yeah that's a big difference between the last bull market or last bear Market in this bear Market is like there's so much energy in Pockets there's there's pockets of very strong energy like the Arboretum ecosystem I've been hanging out with the uh the the treasure ecosystem the smallest they are they're crazy dude they're nuts they have so much energy and like they're in during the 2018 to 2020 bear market like it was just like you and me and the investor and Anthony cesano and you're like that was like the most interesting thing that we had there was it was just like hey guys uh how's your anyone dancing anything new with you uh eat this money right yeah there's money right guys um this is a chart you put together and this is kind of a commentary on um on the cycle and where the the last cycle actually topped can you explain what you're showing here David yeah so this is a little bit of a messy chart uh but that's because I had to layer the same charts upon each other over and over and over again um but so the only thing that is uniform about this is time uh prices are not uniform of course but uh all time lines up and so we've got the Solana the Luna the polygon and the ethereum chart Solana is the main one that you see in purple uh Luna is the gold one that's kind of invisible but it's different colors so you can kind of see it and it's also the one that goes to zero and maybe just look at the shape guys yeah look at the shape yeah and then there's polygon which is like the cyan color and then there's ethereum which is the normal coin gecko blue color in the very background and you you can kind of just see the the progress of the bull market uh go on uh if it was if we've said it before it was ethereum's show for the all of 2021 and then the first half of 2022 uh and that is where I am like hovering my cursor over right now you can't really see because my cursor's white yeah Ryan's got it uh that that that Peak right there that was it was ethereum's bull market uh and that's also when gas fees hit like 600 and people newcomers were like I'm so excited about crypto but I can't use ethereum what else can I do uh and that's when Solana started its Bull Run it's also when polygon started as Bull Run uh and so then that's when Solana hit all-time Highs at around the same time ether hit all-time highs four thousand uh like 900 Solana it it's all-time highs of like something like 250. uh and then polygon not or excuse me um Luna not too long after that a few months after that it's all-time highs and then went to zero immediately after hitting all-time highs uh I just think it's a nice way to kind of do an audit as to how these markets progressed well this is what Vance Spencer Spencer called everything after something like April or May of 2021 is was the low conviction rally yeah right so we had first we had the high conviction rally that you see kind of up to here and I felt like that lasted through kind of like March of 2021 like and that was a lot of like bear market ogs like us saying like everything that's happening right now makes sense oh dude I remember for for months before I would just tweet out on the regular like ethos stupidly underpriced right right and I just hit like it's still stupid it's 300. it's still stupid uh like I would keep doing that and I kept tweeting until about now that I recall until about like eth was above a thousand to like March of 2021 and then stopped tweeting that right but like that felt real to me everything after this was like narrative uh clearly a lot of margin it was a lot of like kind of greed it was the market getting carried away wait they call this the exuberance face this is not this is not particular to crypto this happens in every single Market where human psychology is involved which is all markets and so um I don't think the market was very honest past April uh of 2021 past two thousand dollar ether which it hit in like April of 2021 I think it's when uh we got carried away with leverage as an industry yeah and that's exemplified by the fact that ether goes from two thousand dollars to four thousand dollars inside of like six weeks and then it crashed from four thousand three hundred dollars down to like one thousand seven hundred dollars from in from May to June of 2021 yeah and that was that was the first indication that like hindsight 2020 that this Market is now based on Leverage everyone is taking leverage this is now the full-blown Casino it's no coincidence that now if you want to buy eth you're paying like first quarter 2021 prices basically because that was back to the time when the the pre-lover the market made more sense in the pre-leverage time all right Dave we got a lot more to talk about other than markets of course what's coming up next coming up next the winklevi escalate their fight against Barry Silber and digital currency group causing Barry silbert to have to release in letter to investors Sam Bateman freed our favorite three-letter acronym dude as doing more Sam banquin free things so get ready to face palm and coinbase lays off 20 of its staff while binance is looking to increase his staff by 30 percent so all of these conversations and more but first a

how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics in our able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop here it is digital currency grip versus Gemini round two round three round four I don't know what round we're in David okay Cameron Winklevoss tweeted another open letter out this time to the board of digital currency Group which of course the board appoints the leader of digital currency Group which is the CEO uh Barry silbert it seems like there is definitely a feud going on um I don't know David if if you want to pull out any colorful quotes from this uh this open letter I will say the tldr is Cameron wants Barry fired he says he's unfit for Duty basically and that the board should uh he's proven himself here's a quote unfit to run dcg and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable as a result Gemini acting behalf on behalf of its uh 340 000 earned users wow that's a lot request that the board removed Barry silbert as CEO effective immediately wow shot across the bow actually it's more than a shot across the balcony that's a Direction that's a chart that's a criminal charge from Cameron Winklevoss 2 Barry Silber and what what uh the things that if you read this full thing it's actually pretty uh interesting uh he's basically saying that uh Genesis gave Gemini and Gemini earn information that made them believe that Gemini was totally solvent and that was only true based off of misleading and fraudulent statements kind of cooked the books yes and so whether or not this is true or not we'll we'll take an investigation into grayscale and into Barry Silber but that's kind of what Cameron is saying this is what we need because uh we as operators of Gemini earn feel rugged because of misleading and fraudulent statements as a as of Barry Silber and Genesis and grayscale and so he's documenting all of these things that he is claiming is true about Genesis and Barry silbert and putting this into a letter which he then uh released on Twitter there's also some righteous indignation here because it's not it's not just Cameron and Gemini but he keeps talking about retail um you know 30 340 000 Gemini earned users who effectively are out of money their their money is locked in digital currency group so he's kind of Shifting that onto dcg not all is healthy in dcg world as well so what is this headline yeah so uh there is a wealth management division out of dcg that is shutting down and this actually isn't news this was released as intention from Barry Silber not too long ago but part of the digital currency group are winding down Genesis is actually laying off a bunch of staff and so they're doing a bunch of cost cutting coming up for the the crypto winter and of course they have that hole in their balance sheet that everyone knows about so in the digital currency group side of things they are just doing kind of the same thing that everyone else is doing which is trimming the fat cutting costs retracting for the winter um and so that's kind of par for the course uh Barry silbert however did release a uh in letter to investors a letter to shareholders of digital currency group and this came this was basically in response to Cameron Winklevoss although not actually officially in response but like you know you read between the lines it's like this is being sent down to his shareholders technically but he's yes yes but it's been definitely inspired and motivated by being charged with fraud by the Cameron Winklevoss so he starts off the letter saying first I'm incredibly proud of the role that dcg and I have played as pioneers and Builders over the past 10 years he then goes on to list a bunch of accomplishments from dcg he says I have fond memories of the early days of our industry working hard to educate fighting in the trenches to with fellow entrepreneurs and investors looking to gain legitimacy for crypto it's funny because he's been here for a while I mean yeah Vos twins but so has he yeah uh he he continues and he's kind of like kind of trying to prop himself up it's like hey I believe I'm an OG yeah I've been here working in the trenches lately this line speaking at conferences to rooms with three people getting snickered at on CNBC right he's like I am deep crypto he then continues in contrast the past year has been the most difficult of my life both personally and professionally Bad actors repeated blow ups wreaked havoc on our industry with ripple effects extending far and wide Although dcg our subsidiaries and many of our portfolio companies are not immune to the effects of the present turmoil it has been challenging to have my integrity and and good intentions questioned after spending a decade pouring everything into this company and a space with an unrelenting focus on doing things the right way so this is this is the part that's like basically the response to Cameron winkelva saying I am offended that I'm being charged of these things um and uh there's uh he then finishes this letter saying I hope this letter and the accompanying q a there's a q a in this in this letter which we don't have time to go into but it's linked in the show notes that explains other developments and addresses some of the speculation about dcg some of which is reasonable and some of that is completely basis and false hopefully this helps clarify our position so that was very silber's response we don't know the full truth yet right um the easy answer it would seem is if everything's going okay can't you just give the 900 million dollars back to Gemini earned customers uh it's I'm sure it's definitely not that simple of course um but we do know authorities are definitely involved so dcg is being investigated right now by the Doda and by the SEC as well so I'm sure the truth will emerge yeah but specifically the report says that neither Genesis nor dcg has been accused of any wrongdoing so they are investigating and they have all the the Department of Justice is investigating along with the SEC dcg and they have said that DC they are not charging Genesis or dcg uh with anything of wrongdoing it just feels like taking a peek we're kind of in the he said she said moment of things where like one of them's probably right or there's some truth in the middle but we just don't know yet we don't have kind of all of the facts in this case so uh I don't think this will be the last time we talk about dcg but the the last Domino has not fully Fallen yet um David what else we got to talk about oh you know our good friend SPF uh so there's no real Rhyme or Reason to these flow of stories or is going to go through them one by one uh first up the most comical one uh SPF seeks access to his Robin Hood shares worth about half a billion dollars 450 million because he needs to pay for legal fees uh so SPF is like hey can I have some of my money so I can pay for legal fees um guess what happened Ryan uh just a few days later what the United States government sees the Robin Hood shares wow so the answer to that question was no no you cannot have yeah there are's now thank you for that half a billion dollars in other parts of the Sam bakeman free I don't know debacle I guess it was when you uh Titan they found FTX has found over five billion dollars of what they call Cash liquid cryptocurrency liquid investment Securities and measured the date in question so the recent times they found money they found five billion dollars they say uh that's that's the change in the couch you were talking about yeah exactly the five billion dollars have changed uh have you looked in your couch cushions lately Ryan you might find five million dollars uh importantly in this uh memo that they've released it doesn't they do not ascribe any value to the Holdings of dozens of illiquid crypto assets which are Holdings that are so large relative to the total Supply that our positions cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token sure so they're they're saying that like they're not they're not counting the liquid tokens that they can't sell which implies that wow that's that's five billion real dollars are not buying this people are not buying this and so this is a tweet from uh uh Connor who I'm not familiar with but he just says five billion dollars question mark I went through every wall that I could find that FTX owns the biggest positions are 700 millions of Soul mostly locked 575 million of ftt 371 Millions not count yeah sorry a bunch of millions of dollars of other tokens that I'm not familiar with 90 million dollars of uh wbtc maybe they know something about that that we don't and maybe they know ethereum addresses and other addresses that we don't but if these are the addresses then that five billion dollars is questionable so we are unsure I think the jury is still out as to how much money was actually found all right well in fantastic FTX fashion so the same same Conor Twitter account says my simple model is at the estate the FTX estate wants a win and good publicity to talk about all the progress they've made in my opinion this five billion dollar number vastly overstates what they could sell in an open market an improper improperly sets creditor expectations of a high percentage of asset recovery don't give us hope yet don't give any of the creditors hope it's probably a lot worse than that but they were very clear we have located five billion dollars of cash liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities that's a very clear statement that was very clear yeah I hope that would be backed by something more than we saw in those tweets um this is a tweet as well uh coming out this is breaking as of earlier this week prosecutors are telling lawyers connected to SBF fro the fraud investigation case that the case is so sprawling that it could exhaust resources of the southern district since it includes potential bribery count them that's one campaign contribution violations to Market manipulation three on top of theft for and fraud that's a lot of things a lot of things that it could exhaust the entire Southern District's ability to actually prosecute these things uh someone I think uh called this DDOS attack yeah I bet you if you scroll down you'll see Nick Carter it's like the old legal system dos attacked denial of service attack that's like a loophole inside of the universe is like if you can do so many illegal things that the court system can't fund Finance itself to sue you you can get away with a portion of them I mean you're still going to jail for life but okay well um yeah exhausting entire District's capability to prosecute you that's crazy you are so incredibly illegal that an entire District doesn't have the money to sue you so this happened too this morning uh just tweeted this out it's a link to his sub stack SPF has a sub stack apparently now brand new um in the title of this article is FTX pre-mortem overview and Sam just gives it a complete overview of what happened did you read this perspective skimming through it to see if there was anything new but I think it was just like a documentation of all of the stuff that he's been saying on Twitter spaces and all like you know what it was to me because I haven't watched all the Twitter spaces it's just like shifting blame right like so uh basically the first the first second sentence here at the end of the day FDX is just somewhere between that of Voyager and Celsius we're not that bad in between Voyager in Celsius okay look at all these there's a lot of that conversation about being not as bad as Voyage or Genesis Celsius blockified Gemini happen to all of us all as a group there were comments about um down here David uh you know about how crazy the market actually was the 2022 Market crashes um he goes in this narrative and he says then over the course of the Year markets crashed again and again and again and Alameda reportedly fails uh to sufficiently his position until summer Bitcoin crashed 30 Bitcoin crash another 30 Bitcoin crash another 30 and then unless all of the things that happened in 22 I'm like yeah it's freaking crypto what the hell you know like he doesn't know that dude are you Sam bakeman Friedman yes he was the first cycle trader is new he doesn't know that and like he was born in an up-only Paradigm David earlier in this in this he he was uh bragging about and I don't know if any of this is Justified but um something about that that like Alameda on the book should have had enough reserves to sustain a 94 market crash I'm like 94 percent I mean we've had those before you know right like you like if that's what you should expect that's the base case that's not the worst case that's exactly what you should expect especially when you printed a bunch of funny money bro this was perhaps the most detached statement in the the whole note that I read um he said this I believe that had FDX International been given a few weeks it could have likely it could likely have utilized its illiquid assets and Equity to raise enough financing to make customers substantially whole he even now he says I believe that if FDX International were to reboot there would be a real possibility of customers being made substantially whole he still thinks he's still exists back to our conversation uh last week where like one take is that SPF actually thinks he's innocent and a good guy trying to do the right thing I think he actually does think that we've just given an incredibly deluded person like billions and billions of dollars and he continues to be uh diluted diluted yeah um wow what what a lesson I'm sorry I'm sorry all right what else we got David our third news item this week yeah yeah sad news out of coinbase they uh are cutting a fifth of its Workforce they also cut 18 of their staff last in June so um just overall big contractions in coinbase employees but I think this is this is par for the course course that's happened last bear Market this is just what it takes to be on the frontier of growth that means that when the bull market comes you lay people off it's not like a mistake uh it's not like a misjudgment as to crypto it's just like oh the bear Market here we have to cut we have to cut costs as a result of all these layoffs coinbase says that this is bringing down their operating expenses down by 25 for the quarter ending in March the company will also be shutting down several other projects with quote a lower probability of success this article continues with like General commentary about the tech sector and it says coinbase joins a course of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the coveted pandemic last week Amazon said it would cut 18 000 jobs Salesforce reduced its head count by more than seven thousand jobs which is 10 Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter's Workforce after taking the Helm of CEO meta Facebook cut 11 000 jobs about 13 and also crypto companies Genesis Gemini and Kraken also reduce their workforces uh the the last line I'll read here is every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth growth growth and people were almost using their head count number as a symbol of how much progress they were making Armstrong Ryan Armstrong said the focus is now on operational efficiency it's healthy for the ecosystem and for the industry to focus on more on those things this to me is just what a bear Market is as prices go down as things contract you operate on efficiency rather than growth these are Cycles things go too fast and now they came down fast and that's what's happening although although David hello binance is Bucking that Trend yeah right or or posturing at least to say so true crypto exchange binance plans a 15 to 30 percent not cut hiring spree this year in 2023 even as Rivals slash jobs uh that's what CZ is saying that they're focused on hiring and they're going to hire another 15 to 30 percent uh what do you think about this yeah CZ says that binance needs to get the company well organized ahead of the next cryptobul wrong and admitted that the exchange is not super efficient um yet who wants to hire more it might be some posturing I don't know show strength there's there's we've we've definitely seen CZ posture before remember when we had him on on Bank list and and uh it was we were like oh this is the question we had was like CZ SBF and FTX are buying everything under the sun like what are you doing and CeCe was like uh binance has first first digs on everything on everything he's buying our leftovers yeah he's buying our sloppy seconds yeah yeah so there's definitely some posturing out of CZ that we've definitely seen this behavior before so far it has not been inaccurate and yet we don't know we don't know one way or another do we but but uh CZ has definitely been been kind of hard to unsee as the number one exchange uh so much so praying for binance's solvency uh all right what do we got coming up next coming up next optimism takes the number one spot of transaction volumes across layer twos and open C integrates arbitrum Nova which is arboretum's gaming chain into the openc marketplace so the L2 Wars are hot and everything is good for ethereum of course nfts had a crazy week pleaser Dow's working with Edward Snowden Rolling Stone magazine is working with [ __ ] Riot and Game of Thrones launches an nft it's not great get your face Palms ready because it's gonna be funny so all of that and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you can go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer 2s are supported right out of the gate but that's just Defy uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim 1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrum 1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to Orbison Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free all right guys we're back uh the flipping no one was talking about optimism overtakes arbitrim for daily active addresses and transactions per day so this is arbitrum still leading on Total Lock to Value so it's kind of like an asset on the Chain sort of measure but optimism leading on transactions what do you what do you make of this David yeah I mean this is just momentary to optimism taking the lead we'll see if they can sustain it I I think I don't know how to read into this too much there's a lot of more like analysis that really needs to go into why optimism is getting more transaction volume but I think it does lend itself a little bit to the philosophical differences between these chains Arboretum is very very defy heavy optimism and the optimism team are always really focused on like literally how do we build a new world like a new governance structure new organizational systems new economies and so the fact that the economy of optimism as a governance system a two house model and all of the and all the real defined nft stuffs going on that kind of tracks uh versus uh arbitrum which is more like defy and uh nft and kind of I guess arbitrim is just getting more Finance use cases maybe maybe yeah uh we'll have to get Ben on it I think we should get Ben on why on on this like what what about uh what's new in the optimism ecosystem but those charts the trend here if you're looking at the screen the optimism transaction volume chart is just like a solid rock solid up and to the right arbitrum had a big wave and it slowly come down since a peak um I bet you these things with LeapFrog over and over and over again yeah it's uh it's really interesting to see these economies emerge um openc is now supporting arbitrim Nova what does that mean David arbits from Nova is arbitrum's second chain so the first arbitrum chain is called arbitrum one because it's the first chain uh arbit from Nova is the second chain it's a chain dedicated to Social and gaming uh and so it's like a roll-up but with off-chain data so there's other data dependencies uh your data is not stored on ethereum it's stored with what's called a data availability committee which is a committee of data providers that are not ethereum so there's different dependencies there but what do you get from that uh super fast and super cheap and so this is arbitrum's gaming chain and now our arbitrum has two chains that are integrated inside of openc uh so just big progress big progress yeah uh that is big um what do we got here David you're calling this the L2 bull market uh why uh this is just a list of very green numbers of transaction volume across ethereum and all the layer 2 Chains uh so in the last seven days uh 58 increase in transactions on optimism 42 increased transactions on arbitrum one immutable 47 increase dydx 113 increase in transactional volume now if you look at the numbers the actual numbers are ethereum 13.7 uh transactions per second optimism seven transactions per second arbitrum two and a half immutable two and a half dydx two and a half so like still actually low numbers but these are just actual these aren't capacities these are what is actually being used and so the volumes are up uh but still have a lot more to go I expect things like optimism Arbitron immutable to definitely pass because they have the capacity to to definitely pass ethereum in transaction volumes I expect that to happen this this bear Market this was interesting too uh it looks like coinbase is maybe becoming a rocket pool odow member uh why would they do that so coinbase has its own ethereum staking service of course uh internal but they are also going to be working with rocketpool yeah so we uh bankless is an Odell member for Rocket pool sazzle Anthony cesano is also a new odow member to Rocket pool what is the odao it's called The Oracle Dao rocket pool just needs uh the Oracle price for ether they just need the as a part of the system they need to understand what the price is for ether and so they get that through the oh Dow so uh people that are trusted and also put up a bond to um to report the Oracle price of uh ether to rocketpool coinbase is now being proposed as an Odell member and so uh this is that doesn't mean they're going to stake any of their any customer funds no it does not rocking that is not what it does mean they're getting involved in the project exactly and I think that's really the import important point to take home is like the Odell membership for coinbase is them getting their foot in the door because now coinbase has Odell like governance if you will as and like they are part of the system I think it's the first way that coinbase becomes comfortable with staking through rocket pool and if you've been in the rocket pool trading uh Channel and inside of their Discord it's like one of the most high energy channels that exist yeah they probably think this is incredibly bullish and that this has always been mistaken is imminent this has always been one of the Theses of uh the bull case for Rocket pool uh it's part of the um D5 mullet thesis or the protocol sync thesis uh which is something that we've been hammering into people's heads for as long as we can uh centralized companies can use decentralized protocols for their services and if coinbase just Stakes through rocket pool they actually can make more money than if they just run their own nodes themselves it's profitable for them to stake through rocket pool and so I think this might be an early indication of that thesis playing out that could be cool that I mean that would be amazing we also see like um how much better would it have been if block fi for example in Celsius and all of the other centralized lending companies used something like um Ave or compound exactly rather than kind of these centralized providers for it as defy mullet as well all right let's talk nft stuff David so the nft community seems uh full of life this is um a new Announcement by pleaserdale can you explain what this is yeah and also disclaimer I'm a part of pleaser Dao uh pleaserdale is working on a web 3 auction house uh and so an auction house for the metaverse is at pleaser.house that's pleaser without an e in collaboration with Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg uh do you know who Daniel Ellsberg is Ron I don't know who's Daniel he is The Whistleblower that released the Pentagon papers that started to actually turn the tide of the Vietnam War for releasing a lot of the back Channel comms in the in the Pentagon that was like Hey the Vietnam war is like totally illegitimate that's Daniel Ellsberg right there uh and so um pleaserdale bought the Edward Snowden piece the the nft that Edward Snowden made that was in um about his whistleblower for the uh the NSA uh they bought that for four point something million dollars uh we bought it uh and that's an nft that is inside of the pleaser vaults um and now that the pleaser Dow has created this auction house uh Daniel Ellsberg is making an nft kind of how Edward Snowden did and is going to be auctioned out off today in a few hours so yesterday for for listeners uh hopefully it goes for a lot of money because all of the money is being donated 50 is being donated to the freedom of the press Foundation which is also where all of the money for the purchase of the Edward Snowden nft also went the four plus million dollars and then the other 50 of this Daniel Ellsberg auction is going to the Daniel Daniel ellsberg's like personal foundation for also donation so I think that's really cool very cool yeah and I think you did a show about I haven't caught up with that show with the song bankless with um James I'm talking about that um nft artists did you know they are launching on Instagram these days yeah uh this is a headline from coindesk so top nft artists are launching projects on Instagram and they're selling out in seconds this to me David is somewhat detached from uh crypto native world so I I don't necessarily see what's going on in these communities but uh if you'll recall meta and Instagram added nft functionality I first debuted to kind of view nfts now apparently the ability to Mint and sell nfts uh and they're they're selling like crazy um I don't know what we're looking at this specific one yeah that looks like a weird nft to Showcase but okay it's uh here's another one from Sandeep so a lot of these are are based on on polygon of course this is one called uh uh accuitars I believe um anyway what's interesting about this is there seems to be still appetite for nfts it's in a new platform on Instagram they're digital Collectibles yeah sorry sorry sorry digital Collectibles and what's interesting to me too is meta is taking like 15 to 30 percent uh sales all right and creators are still doing it uh so black guy bullish question mark bullish digital Collectibles at least not nfts of course those are bad um I I think it's gonna be stuff like this and the combination of uh Instagram and The Branding digital Collectibles people are just gonna get it like oh this is a digital collectible on the internet that's a cool technology when my tribe does it it's cool when your tribe does it I hate it well sure yeah your nfts are dumb uh your nfts on opens here are dumb my digital collectibles on Instagram are great amazing why because it's from my favorite Creator in this amazing fan community and like yeah it's totally tribal isn't it I think this is just like the technology of ethereum slowly working its way into corners of the internet that already exist this is again the protocol sync thesis playing out and this is also going to unlock new creators and new communities to have digital collectible powers and we're not going to hear about it on crypto Reddit or crypto Twitter like it's going to be new communities and that's going to be part of the vision of how this whole Revolution happens yep I don't even know they're using crypto has always been the always been the vision um lens protocol is letting creators issue token gated content so uh what do you make of this David uh yeah this is as following into the footsteps of other platforms that we see in the space like mirror any sort of content can be turned into a token and be created but also there are creating tools for token gating so uh posting inside of lenses token getting application all that content becomes encrypted and only made accessible to users who meet certain conditions having a certain amount of reputation and holding a certain token being a certain I don't know thing or a person it's really smart right it's so simple it's like the idea you know Twitter rolled this thing out um I don't know if I've even seen it used but the idea that you can subscribe to different Twitter accounts basically uh it's a kind of a premium service and just receive their their premium only tweets substack has a similar model and that you know they'll send out free post and then premium post well lens is just doing like um a token gated posts right because none of these previous web 2 platforms are doing token gating at they're just doing Simple subscription payments and I I think that creates a whole new incentive model it's really smart of lens to uh to do it's like a web 3 native feature that only they can do I really wish I could tweet out and have a tweet only be read by people with a certain like nft for example so if I wanted to tweet out to all my mfers to be like no don't show this tweet to anyone who doesn't own an mfer right yeah like just the bankless community there was a bankless nft oh my God can you imagine there are uh bankless badge badge tokens of course which are like our poet badges we did nfts before it was cool yeah uh digital Collectibles actually well no ours are nfts okay nfts uh what's going on with uh Rolling Stone [ __ ] Riot what's happening yeah so Rolling Stone magazine is in working in collaboration with uh Nadia AKA [ __ ] Riot aka the dissenter who made a bunch of fun of Putin and then got kicked out of the country uh and so just in the same vein as Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellis uh [ __ ] Riot is selling nfts on the coinbase nft platform uh in collaboration with rolling stone so we got some two eth bids for a collection of I think 11 or 12 of uh [ __ ] riots pictures uh if you don't know who pussyride is and you're looking at these pictures for the for Simon you're like what the [ __ ] that's a normal reaction that's kind of the point that's kind of her brand I've hung out with Nadia a few times she's she's deep in the crypto World she's also a member of are now actually she's uh she's a hoot to hang out with let me tell you he I I she's DM me before I've never connected with her but she listens to some Bank list doesn't she I think so yeah yeah okay uh all right we got um she has a necklace that she wears all the time and it's just a dude big penis it's a penis necklace fantastic yeah if you didn't if you didn't know that um Blue Chip nft project Moon bird signs with Hollywood talent agencies uh what is this about yeah I don't know much of this world uh you it was it United talent tree agencies yeah yeah uh United talent agency is I think like a massive deal in Hollywood it's kind of like the Guild of actors maybe it's like a little bit of a monopoly I don't know uh but Kevin Rose and the moon birds have signed a deal with United talent agency to just promote the moon Birds brand uh and so uh what does UTA bring to the table this is from the article they are 1400 people with divisions in film television music video game Sports books branding licensing speaking marketing network of influencers like old isn't it is that what it is I'm asking a question actually I don't know um uh they said their job is to vet broker and execute Partnerships and expansion opportunities across a variety of fields is to help promote the moon Birds brand on a global scale fail and just and trying to get out of just being recognized as a Big Brand inside of web3 uh this has I learned also already been done by both larva labs and yoga labs and so this is not a first in the nft industry you got to do it ethically with full disclosures though as Yuga Labs learned I think recently um this is Van Spencer's take on it what does he say this is Advanced Spencer take from back in the day when larva Labs did this deal in the first place this was August of 2021 so over a year ago this was raised by Luke on the bankless side of things who used to work in Hollywood before we totally poached the hell out of him uh and so Vance Spencer says the larva Labs UTA deal is great but the bigger vision is to create IP with open licensing apis where anyone can use the IP for anything example UTA goes out of business and larva lab stops calling the shots but then Vance finishes and says the blockchain unlock will be moving IP licensing from scarcity to abundance mindset and so I think this is really the early conversations of the decentralized bottom-up brands and these are kind of the nfts that I really like like mfers for example is a decentralized headless movement of branding whereas uh Moon birds in Yuga labs and larva Labs anyone who signed a deal with UTA is like hey UTA make our brand better like a scribing agency to and to an agency to make the brand better versus MFS just go wild make infinity derivatives just bmfers like there's two different anarchy versus like top like centralization right and like I don't even know what's more effective inspection circumstances yeah each one's probably got its own facts and circumstances um I know that this I guess this is not an effective nft well I mean at least for me uh Game of Thrones nft that builds your realm experience brought to you by Warner Brothers uh so we now have Game of Thrones nfts as if the show didn't already jump the shark they're getting on the nft bandwagon wow I have good things to say about Game of Thrones uh I mean what do you think of these nfts David do you have good things to say about them uh any takes here yeah so I think what we're looking at here if you go back to the marketplace these are like packs like card packs like if you open them up there's like five of them if you hit filter in the top left yes uh yeah so yeah so here are the animations of the people of Game of Thrones and man does it look like a cheap mobile game oh wow yeah did you see this tweet here dude yeah so this is funky donk saying I bought this for .07 eth why might you ask do you hate yourself funky no it's because I know art when I see it and these fingers that's art and so we are looking at an animation of this guy who's like it's definitely some Junior animator who's got some crazy spindly like two feet long fingers that's attempting to grab this Spear and it's just like missing and the animation's all bad and this it's it kind of feels like a Kevin moment you remember Kevin yeah yeah so how are they selling David they sold out dude of course of course they did how do they still sell out they're even calling them nfts I don't know people who's buying these things but apparently so there's a game that goes with these things apparently so there's like utility maybe they can maybe they can fix the animations all right well maybe Dave and I are missing out on these fantastic nfts um you know art is uh completely subjective um all right what is backing a usdc this is a tweet from John Paul koning who really follows stable coins quite well it turns out that 30 of usdc is actually BlackRock government money uh so BlackRock bonds I believe and this is up from zero percent in October so it happened really quick from zero percent to thirty percent that's about 13 billion dollars of usdc reserves those are that's the funds the collateral that backs the coin usdc when you use it on ethereum or any network uh is actually managed by BlackRock what do you think David is this a good thing or a bad thing BlackRock bad BlackRock is a bank and so we shouldn't want them in crypto What's Happening Here Yeah so John continue this thread and gave a take that I think I agree with it goes uh since the proportion of uscc reserves invested in the circle Reserve fund has risen to about 28 billion dollars he says that this is likely a win for uscc users because circle is yielding some control over usdc's reserves to an external manager subject to SEC regulation which ultimately makes usdc safer transparency improves since users can now get regular their updates from BlackRock and BlackRock is like a you know like a Trad Phi approved institution regulate regulatory Mega institution right and so it's basically an extension of the state and so using a BlackRock as like a vehicle to put uscc inside of is what he's saying is like this is just a good use of transparency tools and protections for users and ultimately usdc is already an extension of the state anyways it's dollars in a bank so it doesn't make it any more centralized so I think this is just layers of protection around companies that are very much the opposite of FTX if you will well I think it's definitely regulatory protection too because now that the someone like the SEC looks at tether and they're like no and then they look at UCC and they're like ah okay BlackRock our friends yeah the incumbents we know these guys and they're okay with usdc I think that's what's probably going on yeah um this was kind of disturbing and disappointing to me David this is uh Ben Hunt talking about blockfi and specifically some of the leadership of blockfi having cashed out during uh the last year or so do you want to read this out uh yeah so this is after we got a report a transparency report uh from block five and Equity holders in the cap table so apparently Ben went down this Rabbit Hole to just look at the data and he goes uh tweets out on Twitter CEO Zach Prince cashed out 9.3 million from his block by account about 70 of his account in early April 2022 this was right before the Luna three hours Capital contagion and then he cashed out another 850 000 in mid August 2022 after uh blockfi got bailed out by FTX I think it was actually Alameda um and he says he follows yes I'm accounting for Market declines in the assets and so Cashing Out seven 9.3 million dollars before every all the contagion happened you know you I think you can kind of give him the pass on that um cashing out almost another million dollars after getting bailed out by FTX uh it doesn't feel great not so great not so great um yeah it's like it's like the cost between like that is his money um he's totally that's his money he's able to withdraw he's able to press the withdrawal but I've been drawing from his own product though his own yeah it's like lack of confidence right and that in the second piece especially in mid-august right and even the first piece in April I mean block five yeah I mean an informed person might be able to understand the writing on the walls it's like it is like he would be able to see like how solvent blackfy was or not um I I think it's hard to not give him a pass on that one but it's still it's still you know it doesn't feel great it doesn't feel great when a whole bunch of people lost money in Block five specifically yeah um and the leader didn't okay well speaking of C5 nexo office was rated by Bulgarian police in a wide investigation uh what is going on with nexo David this was breaking uh as of I think this morning so yeah this was uh kind of crazy this is out of Bloomberg crypto lender's office in Sophia was raided by Bulgarian police on Thursday as a result of Investigation into suspected money laundering and tax crimes more than 300 police officers prosecutors and National Security agents are taking a part in this operation uh which was uh stated from the a Bulgarian Chief prosecutor uh who told reporters in Sofia next I used to operate inside the United States but like a few months ago they is closed down their operations because probably I'm guessing what happened was the SEC was like hey that's a security and they just didn't want to fight it so they just went offshore started to be like some smoke out of nexo the article continues saying authorities are investigating london-based nexo on suspicion of money laundering tax crimes and offenses involving unlicensed banking activities uh kind of all the same thing that I think the SEC would was worried about uh nexo put together a tweet thread which was kind of like a defense of themselves um you know I I skimmed through this and the trouble with this David is you just really don't know who to believe looks like this tweet thread was centered on AML kyc and maybe they're kind of implying that's the reason that they're under investigation I suppose you'd call this but they said that they've always been abiding by the laws now David at this point in time I don't I've you know we're hearing things whenever something like this breaks you're shooting kind of uh Bank Run types of of murmurs right but we haven't actually seen anything to indicate that that people are unable to withdraw their funds now the knee-jerk reaction is nexos insolvent they don't have any money but that's not what's being reported what's being reported is tax fraud and banking violations right I mean where there's smoke there's might be fire and I know and I would suggest if you have money in EXO to probably withdraw right but I haven't seen anyone say hey I have money in nexo and I can't get it out I haven't seen any report like that yet I have some seen some things on Twitter of uh critics saying hey bankless why did you ever do anything with nexo in the past before um I think it would we should probably talk about that and address that and bankless listeners long time bankless listeners might remember a stint that we did with nexo as a sponsor of Bank list they actually booked a podcast um sponsorship slot for the entirety of of last quarter of Q4 um we cut them short after about six weeks of this when there started to be some fishy stuff going on in the general C5 space Nothing by nexo uh we met with them we told them hey we don't feel comfortable given everything that's going on with FTX uh in continuing this partnership and we sort of we cut them off there and then um I will say retrospectively and we've we've kind of talked about this in general um partnering with nexo at that time in Q4 was definitely a mistake right yeah um I think that uh our feeling going into it was not all centralized lending companies are bad there are some good ones aren't there um there have to be uh nexo had just come through the gauntlet of Pharaoh's Capital getting destroyed and block five getting destroyed and Celsius getting destroyed uh and they were actually like talking about acquiring other companies right um it felt like a reasonably safe like if you go in with eyes wide open and you understand that giving up your private Keys means giving up your coins but you're willing to do that you do your own due diligence uh it seemed like they they might be able to make it and look they still might but I've got to say this doesn't make me feel good that they have been associated with the bankless brand like you don't like to see one of your um one of the sponsors of your podcast being raided by the police for right tax and money laundering yeah exactly uh so even though the scope of their ad was like short and very limited um I gotta say I mean I think you and I have talked about this and and we regret it um so we wouldn't do it again I mean I think there were some lessons learned in in sort of all C5 lenders uh coming out of of 2020 too and it's it's something that like very few of them are on Solid Ground if any of them are on Solid Ground um I will say if you kind of like zoom out and look at the discernment we've had on sponsors just in general um I felt pretty good about our discernment with picking sponsors up into this point you know like um this is an industry that's incredibly hard to navigate right like you know how we end every podcast with like crypto is risky you could lose everything um even picking sponsors like we don't know which ones might have Smart contract bugs or Shady spot you know Founders and we try to to do our best in this case I think this was a probably a big fat fail and I definitely regret it um and so apologies to anyone we may have let down with this one uh you could tell like Dave and I are not perfect we do try our best um we we hope and we think that the good outweighs the bad generally on bankless I would take this one back if if we could and I I hope you guys know we're not going to get everything right on Bank list but we're going to continue to to do our best I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that David yeah I just trying to put myself back into the shoes that we were going into Q3 Q4 2022 was when we signed on on nexo uh like of course the the taste of centralized borrowing and lending desks weren't was not good at that time and so like it was it was a conversation we has like is is this the right sponsor and using the calculus of like well nexo wanted to buy everything that Celsius would give them uh uh before they got outbid by FTX and so to me that was like oh that's we just went through the acid test of who who was over leveraged and who was responsible and nexo kind of seemed like the responsible one um so now now that we have more information turns out that that was incorrect what was so crazy about is Dave is like all of them failed yeah like that's that's kind of the unreal thing is like not one borrowing and lending desk made it through 2022. they all blew up and I was hopeful that there would still be some kind of good guys uh there that were able to make it and there just haven't been uh anyway we are leveling up we're learning from this experience I think as an industry we're learning from this do not expect us to support any centralized lending companies uh in 2023 probably ever again unless we get some sort of proof of Reserve System down and uh we're being much more Discerning we're not going as fast when it comes to sponsor selection and uh we're adding some new due diligence to the process yeah and I think the last thing I'll say on this is like this whole 2022 like aside from like centralized companies blowing up was a massive lesson for I think for all of the industry and definitely me as well is the combination of just like well interest rates are very a very big deal as it turns out but also the idea of like how toxic yield is when it's like paired with a borrower on the other side and but that's like you know there's all there's a bunch of borrow money markets are a thing in traffic and they totally work in tradify too but it's the combination of like money markets uh you know Gemini earned Genesis like all that stuff and then on the what is Downstream of that which I did not appreciate until after all this contagion happened was like 1000 apy pool twos and funny money printed out of thin air and basically the entire bull market which was just like high yield and funny money and then I went all of those pool twos dried up and went to zero like that just slowly worked through the system and it didn't it didn't really matter how responsible you were as a as a money market it was there was too much hot air in the entire industry and so every single centralized lender lender went into solve it and that's just like a a lesson in economics that me and I think the entire industry learned this year yeah absolutely well speaking of of which I guess as we're long so we're talking about investigation uh who is this guy I remember him from some time last year but uh the stable coin exchange uh saber is under investigation by the doj as well who's this guy Ian I believe his name is and Dylan are they twin are they Brothers yes I think they're Brothers yeah we reported on this a while ago or you remember the story of the one or two like Solana developers that spun up and saw puppeted like 12 puppet accounts like defy apps on Solana and it triggered a bunch of tvl and it was like responsible got lost in all the scams last year I'm sorry I just forgot this yes right this was this was the one developer who was actually like 11 different pseudo-anonymous developers that created all these like Financial interlocking protocols that double in crypto triple accounting uh counted uh crypto deposits and it like inflated the Solana tvl by like 40 percent that guy that guy those two brothers are that's what we're talking about okay those two brothers are under investigation so okay surprise that's great one note on races of course is that uh startup funding levels are now their lowest in almost two years so VCS is about a 75 drop from last year in terms of funding activity look I think that's a very healthy thing because the private valuations in crypto that were out there and that we were seeing were absolutely crazy yeah and so they needed some cooling down um and I think this is bullish and also not surprising you have anything more to say on that the numbers here is that VC firms invested 2.3 billion in crypto startups during this last quarter it's a good number not a bad number uh but that is a 75 drop from the same period previous year so like one interpretation is like oh VC funding is totally dried up I think that's actually the wrong angle you should say healthy VC funding was insane a year ago yeah and now it's now it's just healthy yeah it was bad now and now it's now it's much better yeah um speak of which there's still investment going on in crypto and there are still jobs to be had in crypto in particular Bank lists is hiring we are looking for a director a business development got some sales experience Come on talk to us we're going to swap Labs senior software engineer webassee is software engineer of adapts webasse also a QA analyst you can find these jobs you go to bankless.pellot.com jobs uh all right what do we got coming up next David uh we're gonna get into questions from the bankless nation uh and this is coming out of the bankless nation Discord which Ryan did you know that we completely revamped the structure of the bankless nation Discord I didn't know that it's uh looking pretty good the conversation's hot what's going on uh what's the talk of the Discord this week and and by the way how do people get into that Discord because it's uh you can't just uh click a link right uh yeah so there will be one soon but there is a link in the show notes if you want to go into the Discord channel to ask Ryan and I questions because every single Wednesday before we record this episode on Thursday we go into the weekly Roll-Ups questions Channel we at everyone and say hey what questions do you want us to read out on the weekly roll up uh and so uh there's that there's that channel there's also a bunch of other channels uh like I said we completely reorged them uh so there's a lot of Vitality being injected into the Discord and so Ryan are you ready to get into questions okay so the first question is from walshi uh Washi he says the first crypto conference I ever went to was permissionless I guess that was last year sorry to ask you someone chill your own conference I'm so glad you asked but I had an absolute blast it was my first real web3 social experience everyone I met was so warm in the vibe is best described as welcoming galvanizing I learned so much by following your advice and taking as many people as possible to all of the talks and booths and meetings and everything else what could we expect from permissionless V2 in Austin later this year and uh where so it's in Austin uh when is permissionless V2 and what can people expect David yeah permissionless 2023 coming in hot in uh September 11th through 13th of uh 2023 that's his year so you got uh eight more months to come uh it's gonna be a lot bigger the the biggest take I heard was when I told people that permissionless was a first year conference last year it was like what uh which is I'm super proud of that fact and the blind of the block Works team feels similarly so I mean the second round of permission list permissionless 2023 is just going to be that much bigger and better because it'll be our second time doing this so we got Eric Voorhees locked in as a keynote speaker we got Mary Catherine Lotter from uniswap we got Justin Drake of course coming back hazu's coming in Donnie's coming in Zachy manions coming in and we're just you know we're eight months out so we haven't locked in even all like the big Super Chat speakers that we really want to which is to say nothing about how Chad Eric Voorhees is um and so I'm super stoked for for everything that we're going to do there's also this year going to be a hackathon as well and so that is the shiny sparkly new thing uh out of permissionless it's going to be a hackathon leading up to this uh which I'm pretty stoked for and there there's one thing that I think people should appreciate about hackathons they're pretty considered they're considered Dev oriented right these are developers to go compete for prizes but a hackathon with a non-dev person who can communicate extremely well who can make a pitch deck who can present a non-technical person I mean is uh super appreciative and dev's kind of often devs need somebody to do that that lift for them so if you are a non-technical person but you want to get involved in like very big projects come out of hackathons earnify which is now called bankless Labs came out of a hackathon so there's a lot of opportunity there uh and in addition to the actual conference which is going to be some great talks I'm sure Ryan and I are going to moderate a ton of them uh there's there's the hackathon and then there's also these side events there will of course be the bank list Meetup we are organizing for the Inner Circle if you for the bankless nation Discord if you are in there if you're a premium member we're going to organize a Meetup at East Denver we'll be doing the same thing uh in in at permissionless in Texas and also tickets are going on sale every single week a new batch of tickets is going out actually just went out uh prices go up every two weeks so the longer that you procrastinate and don't get your ticket the more that you pay more money so you can go if you know that you want to go to permissionless in September uh definitely get your ticket now there's a link in the show notes to get that done the way that it makes the most sense to get that ticket is to upgrade bankless premium by the way right when you do that you get part of the you get into the Discord we were just talking about and uh you also get 30 off that ticket so it kind of pays for itself premium pays for itself because 30 off of permissionless is more than a year is a paintless premium um the next question is with people and crypto companies having PTSD from all the Cascades of liquidations will people be less inclined to take such leverage risk next time I hope the answer is yes but at the same time I wonder if that will make the next Bull Run less explosive what chance do you think there will be a next Bull Run that does not bring new all-time Highs are we going to get a muted Bull Run or are we ever going to see all-time high again what do you think about that David and this question is from yeti77 thank you for the question uh I think people will totally ape right back into leverage as soon as the bull market comes back part of the fact that we are not in a bull market part of the fact that like prices are more stable they're less volatile they're also lower is a symptom of people taking less leverage that's when people take leverage they mint money out of thin air and then they use that money to buy crypto assets and that makes the crypto assets go up in price uh and so the fact that people aren't doing that is why we have settled down to these new lower prices of 2400 or 1400 ether and eighteen hundred dollar uh eighteen thousand dollar Bitcoin um we're kind of monkey brains people that participate in markets are using their reptile brains and so as soon as people get bullish people are not going to be able to think rationally they're going to ape right back into leverage some of them will be able to make money many of them will not um but uh what does the chance that the next Bull Run does not bring new all-time highs uh depends on what crypto asset you're talking about uh I won't consider it a bull run until we do reach new all-time highs however uh and the fact the idea that ether and Bitcoin won't reach new all-time highs again I ascribe zero percent chance to one percent chance for Bitcoin yes basically if that happens then kind of crypto's dead it's just like uh if you believe like it's gonna hit another bull run it like the contrary bet to to all of this is like you betting against fundamental human nature yeah right to think that another bull market won't play out like the last you know three or four in crypto it'll play out similar the there will be some differences it could be longer there could be different highs or lows but like fundamentally we're just we're just looking at fractals and we'll see the exact same fractal play out in the in the next bull market and if you if you think that we won't hit all-time highs it's kind of be because you think crypto's already peaked is that zero and if you think we peaked at how many 150 right million people around the world uh that own crypto how many people are in D5 right now I mean the population of a large city I don't know maybe five to ten million something like that like it's relatively small if that's our Peak wow I would be blown away surprise we we are just scratching the surface yeah we're still in this early adopter phase so um you have to be patient here's the thing this Market will also test your your faith or your belief in that yeah because you'll see some jumps and then it'll hit something and it's not quite all-time high and then you'll go back down and it'll be apathy for like weeks and months and be like well maybe it was all over maybe bankless is wrong about this maybe the thesis is not playing out how my belief isn't going to 10K oh no no maybe none of those things it's you just have to be patient is the thing yeah uh and uh yeah that's coming from you know somebody who uh has we've been through a couple of these Cycles I felt these same things um I asked that same question that you're asking last cycle and um I guess I just um I feel like I know how it's gonna play out for the next cycle not exactly but um I'm making the bet for sure uh David we got another question from Zen mode uh how do you think the Shanghai upgrade will impact LSD narratives steth dominance versus R eth is the question from uh Zen mode here yeah so this is definitely in Vogue in conversation in the ethereum land is is like all right what are when withdrawals are unlocked what's gonna happen like what are the narratives um I think we were talking a little bit about about this last week Lido has a ton of eth that is locked in its vaults that becomes on unlockable and so we are going to see how much of that Lido staked eth gets withdrawn how much of that withdrawals goes into other liquid staking derivatives like rocket pool stake wise maybe centralized providers hopefully not um and so like that's like rocket pool super hungry for some of lydo's eth like if you're a rocket pool bowl you think that that's going to become your staked eth inside of Rocket pool and the only reason why it's not already is because we haven't enabled withdrawals um and so these people are like you know they're all chomping at the bit to get to eat at lydo's lydo's ether and lydo is probably like you guys aren't going to get any of my ether like you these are this is my ether you're not getting any of it and so this is really like the the fight that's going on right now yeah I just wanted to find some terms for people right to make this a little 101 how do you think the Shanghai upgrade Shanghai is an ethereum upgrade that is probably coming the end of this quarter or early next quarter that will enable people to unlock their staked eth okay so that's what the question is asking will impact LSD narratives that is liquid state staking derivative narratives for two specific protocols that is liquid staked eth and liquid staked uh rocket pool eth liquid staking is basically just like once you stake your eth you have the ability to uh then use that staked as a token do other cool defy things you can hold in your wallet you can um you know trade against it so it's it's actually fully liquid it's not steak this doesn't feel like it's locked anymore it's a token representation of that stake and I do think you're right David it's just we've talked about this on Bank list this is kind of a snow globe moment for liquid staking which is like you're gonna shake the snow globe again and then all the kind of the the snowflakes are going to just fall in different places uh I don't think it's going to be just down to these two right Lido versus Rocket pool right you mentioned a couple of new entrants I I'm aware of a slew of new entrants there's a bunch of startups uh some are in stealth mode some are about to show this date and they're hungry and they know the Market's gonna reopen right uh after the Shanghai upgrade and they're chomping at the bit so uh big opportunity the games begin the games are just beginning that's right all right um speaking of which David let's get to some takes of the week are you ready for the first one yeah let's do it all right take of the week this is from LOL I will read the Tweet out LOL says there are a dozen or so Nike Swoosh level memes that could emerge from independent crypto artists in the next decade artist is leveraging the power of Creative Commons IP and immutable Tech to compete with Behemoth institutions here are a few in the running at this time what are we looking at here so this these are the noggles the nouns goggles the nouns classes absolutely iconic they were in a Super Bowl coming up next I actually don't know what this one is uh this is cat with a shadow not iconic for David and I yeah yeah I don't know what that is uh this is an MFR which I'm a huge fan of and this is x copy right so these are some of the very identifiable very decentralized headless Brands and this kind of goes back to uh the conversation about uh the the talent agency out of moon Birds versus a headless brand like mfers I'm a big fan of the Headless brand movement uh I think that's cool what's new I think the mfrs are so iconic and so recognizable that calling them the decentralized Nike Swoosh brand of web3 I think is a great take that's why I put it in here look at that guy look at that guy he's so cute he's just being a little unneffer you know he's like mine knows his own business what's cool about this is um unlike unlike the swoosh right no one owns it right I mean Nike owns the IP of the swoosh and they're gonna do the contracts with all the athletes to plus up the swoosh and make it cool um it's up to these communities to kind of do that it's just a completely fundamentally new model that um do you remember the take of um the professor we had on uh we could or two ago and talking about a copyright yeah Brian fry he's basically like nfts May kill copyright you may not need it any longer and um you know if if he's right about that then I definitely think something is going to emerge as a Nike Swoosh probably even bigger uh Chris branninski says if I had to guess this rally has legs people were so downcast near the bottom that lots are par probably poorly positioned may end up chasing it they can't cat if they can't take the fomo doesn't mean we won't get a retest later but a hated rally for a Time makes the most sense here what do you think so he is quote retweeting DC investor who is saying I'd prefer if no one really trusted this rally so people are going back and forth and like all right like ether is up like couple hundred dollars Bitcoins up a couple thousand dollars ooh we're bullish we're bullish I'm definitely guilty of this it's back on baby but Chris berniski is saying if I had to guess this rally has legs implying that there's a real movement here like people were overly bearish and now they because we stopped going down people are saying well for stopping going if we're going to stop going down does that mean we're going to go up and that's what is happening and so Chris is just saying people were overly bearish and so this rally is real Spike up and then a retest yeah probably probably that's how it's played out in the past so we were light on the takes this week so I'm just going to ask you a question David that I'm curious about because we never discussed this um now that we're in 2023 we can look back and zoom out and reflect on 2022. um do you regret it would you wipe out the year 2022 in crypto if you could this is very like deep philosophical question I think because like all right uh would you go back and erase World War II like would you go back and erase the kill Baby Hitler yeah kill Baby Hitler I might kill Baby Hitler I might do that but but then like if I didn't I kind of my philosophy on this is like okay if I did Kill Baby Hitler there would just be another one later right like you actually don't solve the problem he wasn't the problem there was a deeper root problem right like there was mob mentality in the 20s and 30s that created the space for that right and so there's a take like from history which is like um look uh it wasn't ever something like that was inevitable I mean the shape of it was definitely shaped by the person but there's some inevitability about the lesson that right people need to learn at that time something like this so like who was the biggest villain of 2022 it was like SBF right so what would would I delete FTX and SPF well like sure but then it would just create like it would just leave the door open for a different person to do the same exact thing right and so humans we learn through pain if everyone is feeling very in it has a mindset of pain right now and loss because a lot of their hard-earned money is now worth a lot less like this is a lesson that you are now going to learn and if we didn't learn this as an industry in 2022 then we were just going to learn it at a different time and maybe it would actually be even more painful and so I'm not really one to say that like 2022 brought nothing of value it definitely brought hardship um you know that Meme of like Good Times Hard times breed breed strong people strong people produce good times good times produce weak people weak people produce hard times I just see us going through that cycle and you can't skip forward in that cycle like you have to experience For Better or For Worse all parts of it I agree with that I I just don't have a dissenting opinion on that I think 2022 needed to happen it was ultimately it was uh it was healthy it's going to be good for us uh long term we have to kind of zoom out and um with all of this stuff you have to take the uh the bad with the good um I I just look at the way we're entering 2023 and I contrast that with the way we enter 2022 and the way we entered 2022 was very very deeply fundamentally unhealthy it felt like kind of a just a different kind of community that was not in touch with the the utility it was providing to the world and was not in touch with its core values and I feel coming into 2023 like we've restored some of that yeah it's more quiet yeah we don't have the kind of the mainstream attention but guess what we haven't deserved it yet we're still in the the you know like the early years of this decade so um let's go and earn it so I'm actually happy that 2022 happened um it's you know unfortunate a lot of people got hurt if if you could win these lessons without that I mean that would be amazing but I just don't think life works like that at least um yeah I just I've always learned through my mistakes and through um like you know kind of problems as long as they're not catastrophic uh then then we can kind of learn and rebuild and and move on and and be stronger so uh yeah I agree with you I I didn't know what your take would be though but that's uh it's interesting that's what it is so the only thing I I want to add on to this is is this is should always be a moment of reflection like bull markets make people think and do things and become a different person everyone's a different person in the middle of a manic bull market and so you should think about how did that bull market change you as an investor as a as a person as a character how did it change your personality and how perhaps did that impact your decisions to buy or sell like did you did you fomo into that nft you should have a self-reflective moment as to like how did that impact me because we are going to do it again and if you are not in more deeper touch with yourself that because of this last bull market that we went through you perhaps will make the same exact mistakes that you made uh last full cycle um so that'll be my one my one message about that all right man so what do you bullish on this week David uh well uh this is gonna be a moment where I'm glad that I'm going first because I know that you and I are bullied you took mine didn't you the same thing yeah so we just recorded this episode with uh Wayne from Spruce ID which is the organization working on the sign in with ethereum standard it was a good episode a really really good episode I think it's going to be one of these episodes that like embeds itself into listeners brains they're probably going to be thinking about it for a very long time about its implications and they're going to realize that they are here for the tech because uh I think the the best take out of that that episode is that Google Facebook Apple are just banks for our identity and our data so there's you got the banks of tradfy but the banks of silicon Are banks for your data and your identity and this has all been a part of the grand crypto Vision uh first money then identity yeah uh look you took mine so I'm just gonna plus one that I did I'm sorry but look our brains are in sync on this I I think we we both feel that um the time of I like for identity for decentralized identity is like is here it's just like firing up it's like it's like 2016 again the birth of ethereum and smart contracts and programmable money now we have this decentralized programmable identity uh type of primitive taking hold and uh I I feel strongly David that like identity could be just as important just as profound if not maybe in some ways more profound than than money than taking back money uh and uh this is a technology that I I think I I support I believe it's it's not good for for the world what's nice about this too is the signing with ethereum there's no bags to Shell there's no token right all right and like how can anybody be mad about this uh external to crypto it's literally a net good created it's a public good created as a byproduct of the existence of ethereum if ethereum didn't exist I don't think we could have a a decentralized identity tool like sign in with ethereum and if by the way you don't know what we're talking about right now at this point why this is so great or why David and I are so excited about it stay tuned for that episode I think it's coming out not next week next week is Tyler Cowan on my Monday but the week after I think is when we have this slated David yeah but it'll be next week for bankless premium subscribers who get the early release there you go um and uh yeah you you tell us if you think it's as important as a an episode and topic as we do so yeah uh David meme of the week what do we got this week meme of the week meme of the week I saw this one on Twitter we might have actually done this meme before I think we have but since it was a CPI print day today uh we're bringing this meme back uh and it's the meme of uh the chat human looking at a monkey the chat human is saying you're such a dumb animal and then the monkey responds you're waiting for the FED to tell you how much your how much value your anti-establishment digital currency will lose we are subject to the gravitational forces of the FED aren't we but that's the system we're trying to disrupt we're just not there yet yeah we got a long way to go uh stay tuned for the Moment of Zen this week by the way great Moment of Zen if you are listening to this on the podcast it's a good song but it is a even Raider video so definitely watch it on Twitter which is where it's hosted uh band that's that well I'll end as I always do uh risks and disclaimers of course crypto is risky so is D5 you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] is crashing to the ground Celsius [Music] [Music] [Music]
