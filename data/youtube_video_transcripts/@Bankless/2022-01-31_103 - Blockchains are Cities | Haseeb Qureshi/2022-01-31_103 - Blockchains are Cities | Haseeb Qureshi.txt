in every single country there is one most dominant city and that city is usually you know at least twice as big as the next largest city in a way is almost exactly what we see with lead ones welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless really excited about this show this is on blockchains as cities we use cities as a metaphor to determine how blockchain scale we have haseeb on the podcast who shows us what this looks like the big question here for the guest was are we going to live in a multi-chain world or will there be one chain to rule them all hasiv is very much a multi-chain world person a few things to listen for number one we talk about why networks aren't the right analogy for change why cities are number two how blockchains actually scale like cities number three why ethereum is new york city solana is la avalanche is chicago number four what this means for layer one investors number five we end with where david and i disagree david what were your thoughts on this episode with haseeb i mean you know ryan that i'm a big sucker for metaphors and mental models and so that's why i thoroughly enjoyed talking with haseeb today because metaphors are just a shortcut to understanding and i think a lot of newer people who are still trying to wrap their heads around the blockchain space are really going to appreciate just understanding the relationships between cities and blockchains and how they relate to each other and i think perhaps understanding uh you know ethereum's uh roll-up centric mode roadmap uh using new york city as a mental model for that and then also how uh solana is like la and la kind sprawls very horizontally where ethereum builds up very vertically i think people are going to really appreciate these these mental models but also just talking about why uh blockchains have scalability issues in the first place uh we talk about stuff like this at the very in the first half of the show um but then we go into the second half of the show where uh you and i uh uh take apart a little bit of uh hasev's mental models where he calls blockchains as cities but we think blockchains are actually nations uh and so we unpack all of these uh metaphors at some point at the end of the day all metaphors break down and so we really stretch this metaphor these metaphors into their limits uh but uh i think it was it's just overall super helpful nonetheless yeah and this is worth listening guys because i i do think this is the question of the year maybe the question of the next few years maybe the question of the decade uh remains to be seen which is multi-chain that means multiple layer ones or will there be one primary uh central chain like an ethereum for for instance that provides settlement to many of the other chains that is the discussion the debate today and the context as well guys as always if you're listening with us thank you very much make sure you like and subscribe wherever you're

guest haseeb qureshi hasib is a managing partner at dragon fly capital which is a cryptocurrency venture fund a pretty fantastic one he invests in all aspects of crypto this entire industry he's one of those investors who's also had a very successful background in poker which would be a topic for another podcast we're not going to get into that today we've had him on the show before we were talking about something similar subject of cities how crypto was going to scale how it was going to evolve in the future in in the future and we've invited him back to talk more about that today he published a fantastic post uh using cities as a mental model for blockchains which we're going to dive into haseeb great to have you back on bank list how are you doing today i'm doing great thanks for having me oh man it's an exciting time in crypto of course we're trying to figure out this uh the scaling thing we're wondering if there's a bear market going on and in the in the backdrop of this you wrote uh this post and i think this post is kind of an analogy for probably one of the most important debates i guess in crypto or investment thesis which is which is this are we going to live in a multi-chain world or will there be one chain to rule them all by multi-chain of course i think that means multiple layer ones versus one chain to rule them all is one heavily dominant layer one that's kind of the juxtaposition so that's what we're going to be talking about today but i want to start with maybe this uh this this cities metaphor that we're using um let's get in the frame of mind where we're when you tell us about cities what cities have you lived in in the past to see where you where are you living now what city you living in now i'm i'm living right now in san francisco actually since covet i have been kind of floating around a little bit but san francisco is usually usually home base which it features in the article um it's interesting actually uh kind of the genesis of this whole metaphor because as you mentioned you know i'd written about this uh this metaphor of cities and kind of trying to contextualize blockchain spatially uh actually writing about sharding and writing about e3.0 and in many ways sharding is the whole idea of sharding is actually very similar in principle to what we think about when we think about a multichain world because you have these logically separate kind of mini blockchains operating alongside each other kind of doing different things but being able to connect up to each other in some way and almost every vision of how to scale blockchains is directionally similar right like layer twos are sort of these like mini blockchains that kind of spin out from layer ones their other alternative layer ones are so many of them are evm compatible so they're literally built on the exact same uh virtual machine that ethereum is built on but they happen to be you know totally different validator set or totally different consensus mechanism sharding is a similar story but in you know ease 2.0 which i guess we're not allowed to call that anymore whatever you know the great future of ethereum we'll censor that yeah sorry sorry sorry please please believe that please please um you know the vision of sharding is kind of similar and what i found in the last year so you know i'm an investor in the last year i've been chatting with lots of folks who've come into the crypto space who are brand new and don't know about any of the prior art for all these conversations that like you guys and ourselves have been having and they just come into this world they're like okay i keep hearing all this stuff about solana salon is the future of you know crypto isn't solana just gonna eat everything and isn't this just like an open and shut story that you know ethereum was like ms-dos and then like solano is now you know windows 10 and isn't that just how it works and um i realized that it was very difficult for a lot of folks who are entering into the space to wrap their head around a good mental model of why isn't it that a blockchain that's just faster and can fit more people into it and fit more transactions into it why is that not obviously going to win and in most technologies that's the case the thing that's faster and bigger obviously wins right if you just have you know if somebody comes along with a database that is you know 10 times bigger 10 times faster 10 times cheaper than postgres it's just going to wipe the floor everyone's going to be using it in five years that's just obviously how it works and the thing is i think you and i know people have been in crypto for long enough know that in crypto that's the wrong way to think about it it's it's correct to an extent but it's it's not sufficiently uh it doesn't sufficiently understand the nuance of why it is that blockchains are what they are if that were true then you know bitcoin would have been superseded by bitcoin cash and buy bitcoin sv and buy litecoin or whatever right like we know that these things don't happen in things like bitcoin why don't they happen for ethereum and that's what led me to coming up with this metaphor and trying to you know i i i use it informally in a lot of conversations with people when i was trying to explain to them why it's not the case that salon is just going to eat everything necessarily it could be that salani is everything but it's not obviously going to happen um and that's that's why i decided hey you know what i should write this thing up because a lot of people seem to find it a very valuable mental model for understanding their ones and hesiva bankless listeners will know that we are just a complete sucker for mental models and just the actual concrete imagery i think will actually allow people to just grapple on to this concept of using cities and geography as a way to understand a blockchain so let's just go and get started with unpacking this metaphor why are cities a good mental model for understanding blockchain just setting the context for the whole rest of the podcast why cities yeah so usually when people describe blockchains the word they use is network and the place where i want to start is that network is actually the wrong word to use when you're trying to describe a blockchain and the reason why is that network brings with it a lot of implications about the other kinds of networks to compare blockchains to right so when you think network you think like the internet you think like uh you know electricity grid you think like um you know something like telegram or facebook you think of traditional types of networks in traditional networks when you add another node to the network you add another server to facebook you add another whatever you can basically scale a network linearly it's almost this kind of ethereal thing that can grow as a larger larger cloud over time but blockchains are not like that blockchains when you try to make a blockchain larger the larger you make a blockchain the more expensive it is for that blockchain to get validated and there's a bound on how large a blockchain can be right even something like solana which tries to be extremely uh sort of scaled vertically by just saying look the nodes that run solana are going to be super beefy and highly optimized and have you know 16 gpus or whatever it is uh even even for this there's a there's a limit on how big solano is going to allow its nodes to be right there's not arbitrarily scalable the way that facebook is arbitrarily scalable or google is arbitrarily scalable and so the reality is that blockchains unlike traditional networks are physically constrained there's only so big that a blockchain can get per unit time and that's why we have finite block sizes and that's why we have this fundamental problem of blockchains that they cannot get arbitrarily big and that makes blockchains more like cities cities are constrained by the land that they're on they can grow they can kind of scale out more and more over time but they can't get arbitrarily big right you can't have a city the size of an entire country when you do naturally what happens that the city sort of gets cut off and a new city starts at some point and that's just the nature of how cities evolve and so if you think of blockchains as cities what is ethereum everyone complains about ethereum right ethereum is super expensive it's super slow it's congested you know everything's super old things never change like people are like oh what happened to what about turbo geth what about e2.0 nothing ever seems to actually happen around here ethereum is manhattan it's a super expensive or new york city more broadly it's a super expensive city it's super old it's been around forever and everyone is annoyed anyone who goes to manhattan will just complain non-stop about how you know that the train stock and the infrastructure stocks and the homeless are everywhere everything's too expensive the rents are crazy nothing can ever seem to get built but manhattan is the most happening place on earth if you want to be a somebody and you want to be at the epicenter of the financial activity and the cultural activity in america the one place per square foot that that is maximized is in manhattan and ultimately if you want to find the richest people in in the us they're in new york if you want to find the the most culturally influential people in the us they're in new york maybe in l.a but let's say new york and in the same way if you look on ethereum ethereum has the most you know the biggest whales are all in ethereum the most expensive nfts are all on ethereum the biggest d5 protocols are all in ethereum the biggest nft uh uh the biggest dowels are all in ethereum like manhattan new york is like ethereum in that it is the oldest and most robust place now if you want to go start a new d5 protocol the same way if you want to go start a new bank if you don't have a headquarters in manhattan then you're not serious right you're not gonna be playing in the biggest games yes i know manhattan's expensive yes i know that everything's crowded and everything sucks but look if you're not there then you're just not gonna be playing in the biggest games and that's also true today on ethereum if you're an emerging d5 protocol you might say look ethereum's too expensive i'm going to go here i'm going to roll up i'm going to go to another one but it's it's obviously true today the vast majority of tvl that exists in d5 is on ethereum now if you're a newcomer and you weren't around in the early days or you're not super wealthy or you're not you know one of the one of the sort of rich and famous or part of the intelligentsia then you might say like look it's it's a little late for me to show up on a theory the fees are already crazy high there's no room for people like me i don't have a rent control you know i don't have a rent control department so i i if i want to strike out like look i can't move to new york it's just too expensive i gotta go find some place where i can build my career and for that marginal person that marginal entrepreneur that marginal user they might say like look this stuff is too expensive for me the ethereum's for the billionaires i gotta go somewhere else so the question there is how do you scale a city when uh you know new york is just there's only so much land and and not that many more people can can go there so broadly speaking there are three approaches to scaling blockchains and in order they are rollups interoperability networks and other ones so i'll go through each of them in turn well can we just pause here before we go through each of those to see um i want i want to go back to what you said around the physical constraints right and make sure that that is hammered home because um you know what you said it's like facebook you could just add servers you could scale and blockchains you can't just add servers and scale just just to ground people on that particularly those who are new why are blockchains physically constraining themselves right so i'm not sure that this necessarily might make sense to someone but like uh are they doing this because there's a trade-off are they doing this because our cryptography isn't good enough are they doing this because there's some sort of other bandwidth limitation like why are they even constrained in the first place that's a great question so the reason why blockchains constrain themselves is not because you can't build a big distributed system that you know grows arbitrarily big the reason why is that the core foundational component of what makes blockchain's blockchains is the fact that they are trustless now what does it mean to be trustless right we can we i mean this this could be itself an hour-long conversation but part of what it means to be trustless is that you yourself don't have to trust any third party in order to verify that the blockchain has been executed correctly no one's cheating no one's making [ __ ] up no one's creating money out of thin air or deciding to change the rules on the fly everything is according to the way that the rules were originally set into place when the blockchain was initially created right that's what everyone wants to know and so in order for you not to have to trust a third party you have to be able to run the complication yourself or verify the computation yourself that what has happened in your corner of the world in your blockchain and everything that touches you has been executed correctly now if the blockchain can only be run by a supercomputer because it's so large and it's so big that the that all the computations in it cannot be compactly executed or verified on consumer hardware the kind of thing that you or i could get our hands on and actually run ourselves then ultimately you have to trust a third party you have to trust somebody else who is actually going to go run the supercomputer who is actually going to check all the transactions on the blockchain now you might think that look i'm okay with trusting a third party because you know whatever i i want to but uh the the the core philosophy behind ethereum and not every blockchain shares this philosophy but the core philosophy behind ethereum is that individuals should be able to check themselves that everything that happened on the blockchain is correct and therefore that they do not need to rely on any third parties outside of the kind of things you could run on your own consumer hardware without relying on aws without relying on the government without relying on anyone intermediating between yourself and the blockchain right um go ahead so blockchains are physically constrained because they are attempting to keep the cost of verification low while also scaling the amount of transaction throughput so that's the key there is keeping the the cost of verification low and that's why they can't just like expand indefinitely that's why they are more like cities because they have some borders they have some limitations they have a set of square miles that um you know they've allocated for themselves and they can't really expand beyond that exactly that's exactly right and the the way that i've thought that's a useful way to understand this is that if we want to just you know scale up a web 2 database right like a facebook database we can just arbitrarily add more cpus more more gpus more memory and it doesn't really matter because generally we're adding that physical hardware into the same spaces as all the other physical hardware like you like facebook only has so many databases google only has so many databases there's a handful of them you know five i don't know five five to ten ish uh in blockchains and and when we want to have things be trustless we have an arbitrary number of databases that all need to maintain consensus they all need to sync up with each other and so in a web 2 world when you add hardware to a database because it's centralized you just linearly add capacity just resources but in a blockchain world because all these locations of these databases are spread out around the world when you add a new computer to the network when you add a new node to the network you on net actually slow down the network so it's the in web 2 when you add resources it speeds it up and web 3 when you add resources it actually slows it down and the way that the way that it slows it down just to unpack that a little bit more is that some blockchains accept a certain level of speed with how much data they allow with the network to handle and some networks want to throttle themselves back so that any computer any reasonable computer that was made in the last five to ten years can keep up with a chain and then other blockchains say like oh we only want computers that have been made in the last uh two years and also are super powerful we only want those to be able to keep up with the chain and so it's it's an inversion in web 2 world when you add network resources you speed up databases but in web 3 world when you add network resources you slow them down because you need to make sure that every single individual is able to keep up with the chain and the tolerance for how many individuals can keep up with the chain is a uh spectrum that different block chains can you know tinker with as they see fit um do you want to add anything to that metaphor no i think that i think you you nailed it so um i think the intuition that most people should be walking away with is that look different blockchains have different ideas about what that threshold ought to be how much uh how how much is it okay to say that this is the kind of hardware or the kind of cost that you need in order to actually verify the blockchain yourself if you're buying smart chain then that cost is very very high it's very difficult to run a node for binance part chain on any kind of consumer hardware for solana it's maybe you know similarly quite expensive but maybe a little bit cheaper than buying smart chain and as you go further down the chains with respect to their intrinsic performance requirements those things get cheaper and cheaper and sharding throws a whole other you know curveball into this whole story because sharding kind of uh makes makes the story a little bit more more complex but i think it's probably beyond the scope of this particular conversation because um it applies in general even across individual shards about okay even within the context of one chart how big is that shard going to be that you can actually verify it on your own consumer hardware okay well so now let's return to our thread has even where you're going the question of how do you scale up a new york city how do you scale up you know generalize at any city uh what are the different paths you mentioned three of those and maybe you could reiterate those and then we could dive into them one by one yeah so if if a theorem is new york and ethereum's too crowded how do we scale up new york and the three approaches within blockchain land are first roll-ups second interoperability networks uh and third would be other layer ones so let's start with let's start with rollups roll-ups are the um well so if you sort of take it to the city analogy right let's say you're in new york and you know it's i don't know maybe year 1900 and you're like okay new york is full everyone is here rents are super high everything sucks how do we get more people into the city because there are a lot of people who want to live here and the answer of course in urban planning is build up so start building taller and taller buildings until you culminate into skyscrapers and skyscrapers are obviously they're you know they're marvel of engineering they're incredibly complex to to actually build and get them to where where we are today with skyscraper technology but the fundamental thing that skyscrapers do is they allow more people to fit into the same city with the same kind of underlying land because the fact is if you build up yes exactly the same the same footprint on the on the underlying land now putting more people into a city is a beautiful goal but uh when you have skyscrapers we have a city full of skyscrapers the reality is that so one although a lot of people have managed now to be able to move into the city because they can live up above the uh the underlying ground um each person who enters into the city through the skyscraper um they require less overall land but they still tax the underlying resources of the land to some degree right if you have if you have people living on the ground floor and then you add another you know you add another uh uh uh another layer on top right and then so great you know you have a two-story building and new people come into that two-story building um the overall utilization of the city has increased much less than it would be if you had to add more you know those people on the ground floor but it's increased somewhat it's increased very very slightly right and as you keep adding more and more layers you can add people more and more cheaply um but the experience of those people if i come in and live in a skyscraper in manhattan right um it's it's maybe nice because it's you know we've added a lot of headway a lot of extra rooms there's a lot of vacancies rents can go down now that we've added more land or not more land but more rooms rather but the downside of living in a skyscraper of course that if you live in a skyscraper and i live in a skyscraper and i want to come see you i have to go down my skyscraper get on the ground floor go hail a taxi get across town pay the tolls along the way and come to your skyscraper and go up all the flights of your stairs until i go find you and by the way in new york it takes like one hour to go like you know three miles that's right it's a it's a huge pain in the ass right we do not get to escape the fundamental constraints of the city we live in if you and i live in different skyscrapers which we most likely will if they're going to be a lot of different skyscrapers in the city so now what's the blockchain equivalent to that it's roll-ups vitalik has claimed that roll-ups are the future of ethereum scaling right we now we now have this full capitulation in the story of ethereum i want to say 2.0 the future of ethereum that uh post-sharding ethereum is not going to have native execution on its shards it's instead going to be a roll-up-centric view of how ethereum is going to scale and so what that means is that uh these roll-ups so roll-ups i mean i get probably beyond the scope of this to exactly describe the mechanics of rolos but long story short they are scaling solutions they're like kind of mini baby blockchains that emerge from the underlying blockchain with the security properties of that underlying blockchain they sort of obey the institutions and the trust properties of that underlying blockchain in the same way if you live in a skyscraper in manhattan you might have you know some rules for living in the building but you're still fundamentally living in manhattan all the rules of manhattan apply to you and all the trust model all the taxes all the whatever you're you're still a member of manhattan just because you live in a skyscraper you might have extra rules on top of it but you fundamentally still live in the same city the same thing applies in a roll-up a roll-up extends out from the layer one uh everyone who lives in that roll-up has the same trust guarantees as the underlying layer one that they're operating on which in this case would be ethereum um but they're uh things are a lot cheaper things are faster things are more scalable right now they're not infinitely cheaper or infinitely faster and you know there's some non-roll-up designs like you know volition or validium that that might have very very very high scalability properties for most roll-ups uh it's a you know very significant factor uh increases you know 10x or 20x or something like that but it's not you know 1000x or 2000x or anything like that for most of the rollup designs that exist today so all that is to say rollups have the same issue that i just described in a in a skyscraper if we're in a roll-up uh if i'm going to roll up and you're in a roll-up and we're not in the same roll-up then if i want to transact with you i have to exit from my roll-up go down to layer one transfer across layer one and then go up into your roll-up to go and transact with you now there are other solutions like crosstalk bridges you can imagine you know there's maybe uh uh you know kind of like the the you know those those sky bridges you have those disney towers yeah sky bridges yeah that's what they're called yeah you can imagine like some sky bridge type things type contraptions but you know if you want to move an enormous amount of stuff across the sky bridge maybe you can't do it right like it's it's somewhat complicated with these crossbridge um these cross-chain bridges they can't bridge exactly everything there are some things that can't be bridged um all sorts of things in particular some of the sky bridges look a bit more like tightropes right exactly exactly exactly it's not quite it's a very narrow sky bridge at least today and i think there's some fundamental reasons why those sky bridges have to be narrow because of liquidity that's needed for uh the the different assets that you might want to bridge on each layer too but at the end of the day skyscrapers are great they're a huge improvement of on what you can build inside of a city but skyscrapers are not themselves i mean if you think about it like okay we we got skyscrapers now in big cities but not everybody lives in manhattan or new york even though we have a lot of skyscrapers right there is a there is only so much you can get in cheapness from living in a skyscraper in new york right like fundamentally living in a skyscraper in new york is never going to be cheaper than living in you know just some random town in virginia um and that's a fundamental property of the fact that you have to be taking up space in manhattan there is some externality for you being there that is imposed by your presence in the city and if you want to get to the place where basically you're paying you know some small town in virginia type rent or let's say you know some some new layer one type fees which which can be you know in the fractions of ascent you're never going to get that in a roll-up doesn't matter how you know it doesn't matter how beautiful or how well designed the roll-up is going to be or at least you know to a first approximation if it's truly a roll up and it actually is posting uh transaction data on chain which all roll ups do then you're never going to get it to be that cheap compared to an underlying layer one transaction and that's why roll ups are themselves probably not the end of the story on scaling every city eventually as it grows has skyscrapers but skyscrapers are not themselves alone enough to say okay great everyone's going to live in one city and that's the end of the story okay and that's why we have to explore other solutions so this is the building up approach this is what you would you would consider just to classify which you know chains you would consider doing this ethereum you would say is doing this building up method any blockchain maybe that's taking this uh modular blockchain design type of method where they're scaling up with roll-ups like a maybe a near or a tezos is probably taking this approach are there any others that come to mind i think those are the main ones and the reality of course is that the one that needs it most desperately is ethereum because right now you know it's it's almost like the year is 1850 and new york is the one city that's starting to you know push up against the boundaries but almost everything else is still frontier and as a result you know when prices are so cheap and people are building new housing every single day and like things are growing and and uh you know cities are on the rise there's not a lot of need to start figuring out how to build skyscrapers uh it's only the demand for skyscrapers i mean you can sort of see this right like the plasma which was the first layer two uh that was seriously considered for ethereum uh that was going to scale kind of general computation uh plasma was first uh plasma originally was not general competition but eventually there were designs for general computation um plasma was first announced and explored in 2017 when ethereum started getting congestion and of course almost every other blockchain today is not seriously facing congestion except you know maybe in times of you know total turmoil like what we saw you know a couple uh last weekend uh during the during the market downturn but generally speaking most these blockchains have tons of headroom so there's not actually a burning need the way there is for ethereum today to build vertically at least not yet one thing i really appreciate this met about this metaphor uh is a couple things um the subway system in new york uh hissy view kind of talks mac about the new york infrastructure but coming from seattle uh the the the level of degree of new york's public transportation infrastructure is just astounding to me and well and it's got this fantastic just mesh network of subways connecting you know skyscraper to skyscraper and that feels like the ethereum l1 where you know you're not supposed to be in the the subways are not where you live like that's not where you spend your time you just are there while you are going from more desirable place to more desirable place the more desirable places being the buildings the ones that are building up vertically uh and uh even though like you know you can build a pretty damn tall building with a ton of apartment units in it but at some point you approach physics where we cannot build an infinitely tall skyscraper we can innovate but at some point the the laws of physics get in our way and so that to me is like what a rollup centric roadmap looks like we have all of these machines that are fairing people and their stuff from skyscraper to skyscraper and then the skyscrapers have built up to the match the demand as much as they can of the people that want to live in manhattan and are willing to pay to live in manhattan and that's how we get scale and so we have these very very vertical skyscrapers that are being coordinated by the roots of the city which are the subways which are like the fairing of value between roll up to roll up that's kind of how i think of ethereum in in this city metaphor i i think that's absolutely right i think in in a post-sharding universe that if we do actually see this roll-up-centric roadmap be delivered that's what ethereum is going to look like now the the big the big thing of course about that vision if you imagine a vision of a city where basically everyone either is in a skyscraper or they're in a subway it sounds like a slightly dystopian vision of a city and i think part of the reason why uh you're actually seeing so much demand for some other approach beyond just okay we're all in shards and then we like move in between these roll-ups is that uh it's actually very it's very complex because you don't have the composability that right now we have like right now ethereum is basically like one of these old-timey cities where you just like walk down the street and you there's like horses and there's you know old ladies selling their wares and there's a park over here and you can walk around the park and like there's an ice skating rink over there it has it has a kind of dynamism that comes from composability and in this post-roll-up world one of the things that you give up by having a world where it's all these vertical skyscrapers and a subway system that connects them is you give up that that composability that is defining characteristic of a theorem today so obviously within a skyscraper everything's composable because you know you can say oh great you know you can this floor has the gym and has the swimming pool and has this thing but um in in the in the vibrancy that we get from cities unless we see something like where there's one super dominant roll up or maybe two super dominant roll ups within which the composability is enough so there's you know one giant you know sort of snow globe that is kind of one mega roll up and there's almost like an entire city embedded in that in that uh in that roll-up you know it's too early to say it's truly to really know but i think that's one of the reasons one of the weaknesses i'd say of this vision of blockchains is that that lack of composability okay well uh let's move to the second approach for blockchain scalability which uh et's didn't you mentioned so this is interoperability network so this is kind of the the cosmos polka dot type of approach where you have this internet of change this network of chains and they're all linked in some way can you talk about that approach to scalability and the pros and cons that you see yeah so if you take okay so let's take for granted that skyscrapers are coming but um let's see what other ways are there to scale new york aside from skyscrapers now one approach that is one of the classic approaches to scaling blockchains i mean this has been going on since you know 2017 2016 is this idea of let's create an internet of blockchain so that other blockchains can help scale the the sort of the the excess the overage from ethereum and this was the original vision behind polkadot and cosmos and increasingly what you see today is that the way that polkadot and cosmos have kind of oriented themselves is that instead of really focusing on okay let's connect up ethereum to a bunch of other chains what they really focus on is let's create a network of blockchains that all obey the same kind of sdk that have the same kind of underlying sort of infrastructure and underlying guts and you can really easily spin up a new blockchain that only does one thing these are often called application specific blockchains so you can imagine that someday maker dao could have its own blockchain or compound could have its own blockchain in fact compound was talking about this with uh uh gateway i think is yeah compound cache oh no that was the yeah yeah right yep yep sorry which is going to be issued on top of gateway right cache cache would be the native very simple point um so there are many many applications that have contemplated the idea of creating their own blockchains and becoming these application-specific blockchains that connect back to ethereum now the vision and this one you know you talk to the folks at cosmos or the folks at polkadot they'll tell you is that you know the the idea that you're gonna have one big super city that's gonna encompass everything that's just never gonna work it's not gonna scale that's not how that's not how modern distributed systems are built they're built with lots of individual systems that talk to each other asynchronously right and so you will have according to these people you will have a lot of small blockchains that do one thing and then talk to each other over some interface whether it be through the polka dot relay chain whether that be through the cosmos uh cosmos hub or through osmosis or whatever uh through through ibc and uh you're gonna have lots of individual chains that do only one thing and that's how smart contracts are going to scale some things will live in ethereum sure if you really need to be in the metropolis sure find be in the metropolis but lots and lots of industries going to take place in these small application specific chains the way that today most applications you know on the internet they don't take place in common servers right you go to cnn.com and they run their own server and you go to you know att.com or you go to apple.com and they run their own server and everyone has their own machine that's the vision of application specific blockchains now the the equivalent analogy that i give in the city's metaphor is that application specific blockchains are kind of like factory towns or they're kind of like you know sort of a town that's just just as one thing so you can imagine a town that's like just you know just has outlet stores and nothing else and there's maybe a gas station or a town that's like you know it's just a mining town and everyone here is mining everyone here is like you know there's an oil rig and everyone here works for that oil rig and the town exists only to do one thing and it's not a generalized you know cosmopolitan place the way that we think about a place like ethereum so if this is the right mental model for these types of chains then what i argue is that look i think it's very likely that we will see some application specific blockchains um the application-specific blockchains that we see today are pretty small though right so you know one example of it is something like osmosis osmosis is a cosmos sdk based chain that only does one thing it's just a big basic it's basically the equivalent of balancer it's a big giant balancer thing that exists on consoles sdk connects to other cosmos chains across this big highway system that is the cosmos cosmos kind of you know ibc routing system um it only does one thing and it does it pretty well you know it's pretty good at being this kind of cosmos balancer thing um but that's it it's not you know there's not a whole universe of things happening on top of osmosis it only does one thing and it's likely that things like this will exist but i don't think it's likely that this is going to be the lion's share of activity and if you sort of think about the city's metaphor it drives you in the same direction there are you know towns that only just you know mile everyone works for some oil rig or there are towns that like everyone here works for this one office of this one company that happens to have a factory nearby um but they are not the lion's share of where people live they are not the lion's share of where economic activity happens they're not the lion's share of economic innovation they're important they're part of the landscape but it's very clear that cities are really important cities is where almost everything happens because of the fact that they're these tightly connected very dynamic very interconnected places and those interconnections is what creates innovation economic opportunity uh and you know if you if you live on osmosis and all you can do is trade you know one different you know cosmos based token for another um that's useful but there's not a lot of creativity that's gonna emerge out of cosmos and it's very clear the reason why cities and you know layer 1 blockchains become so valuable is because of all the innovation that's occurred on top of them and that's why i think although these uh you know sort of application specific blockchains exist they are not going to be the most important part of the scaling story so you are bullish metropolises and and bearish like you know one factory towns i mean bearish is a strong word right it's sort of relative to the price if you look i mean if you look today at the landscape of layer ones or sorry the landscape of public blockchains you can see you know look at the top 100 there aren't that many applications specific blockchains there which it's kind of like look the market is telling you that they don't really value the application specific blockchains very highly and i roughly disagree with it i'm not saying that i think osmosis is going to do badly from where it's sitting or these other application specific blockchains are going to do badly from where they're sitting i just don't think they're going to be the lion's share of where value is created in public blockchains okay so when we look around the distribution of cities in the united states or or the world at large we see many many cities of the type like manhattan like l.a like uh seattle like chicago but i'm trying to think of a like company town or mining town that i know the name of and i don't really know the name of one so perhaps like the distribution and if we want to take like physical real estate land geography i think that would equate to block space and really what do blockchains do blockchains sell blocks uh there's not that much physical real estate that is claimed by the world of specific like one use case cities like a mining town and so perhaps if we extrapolate out to the end game of whatever this crypto industry uh morphs into perhaps application-specific blockchains only take up a relatively minor portion of the total blocks based demand um would you agree with all that yes uh not just that they're going to take up a relatively small amount of total demand um the the demand that they're going to be competing for is going to be valued less highly which is which is an important distinction right you can imagine that actually a lot of the us is taken up by like wind farms and you know just you know things that take up a lot of space but that space is not in high contention no one is fighting for that space in the same way look trades on osmosis are really cheap and they're really cheap because not a lot of other people are trying to do things on osmosis other than just trade on those buses um but if osmosis lived on ethereum or ontario or on some other you know blockchain that had more contention for that same underlying land that underlying block space that underlying resource then you would see things be more expensive yeah it's like metropolis uh space per per square mile per square foot is much more valuable than like some rural uh geography right from from a real estate perspective and like i think you have to go back to why people choose to live in the city that they choose to live in um there are many factors quality of life you know culture what do they enjoy culture all sorts of things but also um economic opportunity is a is a massive driver of where individuals choose to to locate like where are the jobs where are the good jobs right and i think that's another driver that that probably comes into play you're not going to find the same type of job in a small rural town as you are in manhattan or la or some other metropolis and that factors in so let's um let's talk about the third path then because there are three paths here wha what is the third path here this is more cities haseeb what are you talking about more cities we could just build more of these things yeah turns out uh you know when when new york got full or i guess it was originally boston and you know the history of america when the first city gets full people know what to do and the answer is you go build a new freaking city and the history of cities is obviously that there is not just one city in every single country there are many cities and interestingly what you often see is that the cities tend to be far away from each other and they tend to become very different from each other and so you know the the two major cities in the u.s are new york and l.a and la is really far from new york it's literally the absolute opposite as far as you could possibly get from new york and it's really different the culture of la is completely different than new york now when you build a new city the first thing about building a new city is that there's a lot of stuff you have to do all over again it's a lot of redundancy right when you start a new city you have to start with building a bunch of basic infrastructure you have to go in you have to build you know there needs to be plumbing there needs to be roads there needs to be a police station there needs to be the market all sorts of bazaars exactly you need basic infrastructure in order for people to actually be able to live there right like if there are no schools if there is no you know fire stations if there's no any of this stuff then people are not going to want to move to this new city so initially when you first start a new city there's a lot of just you know infrastructure plumbing redundant work that needs to be done that you don't need to do when you're building a skyscraper and you don't need to do when you're building a you know like a factory town or like a you know a wind farm or whatever and uh so initially it might look that building a new city actually seems really wasteful right we already we already have great hospitals and great police stations and great roads in manhattan why are we doing all this all over again um but the advantage of building all that infrastructure over again is that you are not burdened by this sort of technical debt let's call it or like the bad decisions that were made by those older cities and that's why you often see when you have older cities that eventually get too big and someone goes and starts a new city that newer city is much faster it's much cleaner it's more efficient it's better it's laid out more intelligently uh whereas the older city kind of you know it's a sort of process of accretion and things kind of get bolted on and everything's like it's got this complicated story of like why is it that the train doesn't go here and like it goes does this crazy loop-de-loop before i can go to this other thing it's like look it's so hard to explain and something happened like 70 years ago and like blah blah blah something about world war ii or whatever just you deal with it um and when you start a new city it's a blank slate you can do everything over again from first principles and with the tools of kind of modern civil engineering and science and whatever and so uh when you when you see the equivalent of new cities in blockchains those are that's what new layer ones are that's what all these new emerging ones are we new york was full and so we decided to create la we decided to create boston we decided to create uh you know chicago and and houston and all these other cities and now you know to my point about infrastructure one thing that you notice with all these new layer ones especially when they're new is that a lot of infrastructure is missing so it's like okay where are the block explorers why can't i see the smart contract code on chain you know why are the rpc endpoints so so crappy why isn't there you know a good ether scan or a good dune analytics or a good you know uh good security tooling or good you know developer experience all this stuff needs to get rebuilt for these new chains and you know some of them can can kind of piggyback on uh ethereum if they use evm but but even still there's a lot of infrastructure that is missing no matter how similar you make it to to the original city and um but the advantage of building a whole new city is that you get to start over with institutions the institutions of new york are very conservative in a lot of ways right because new york is this old very stalwart city it's been around for a very very long time it was built on you know this global finance this this you know this incredible pedigree that comes with being uh you know descended from new york same thing with london same thing with all these very legendary massive cities um when you start a new city you can kind of say like look we don't need to be what new york is we can be more nimble we can have different values we can have different perspectives we can value different things we can be governed differently right one of the things that you'll notice about california versus new york is that the the way in which laws are laid out that govern california are very different than what goes on in new york and so uh the way that i liken these cities and i have these very specific analogies which i'm sure we'll go back and forth on um but i compare solana to la and the reason why i compare solana to la is that solana is like look you know solano went as far west as you can go right solana said look new york those guys over in the east coast they care so much about decentralization they're so you know up their own asses constantly talking about how nation-state attacks blah blah blah but look fundamentally i know what people want what people want is they want entertainment they want fast cheap transactions they want everything you know straight uh you know fed down the tube of their tvs that's what people really want and i'm going to give it to them i'm going to go to the most beautiful you know the the the the most beautiful sunniest place in the world yeah exactly this manicured place where all the you know the people who want their 10 minutes of fame they can come out to solana everything's cheap everything's fast and like we're for the builders right that's what we're all about and if you want to be a gaming project an ft project look we are we are the best place for you to be everything is cheap and fast and we're going to sit down with you we're going to help you help you make it happen and for those people who are not too fixated on decentralization and they don't think that that's the be all end-all for a lot of them they say like great that's an awesome vision i love that vision and it's almost as polar opposite as you can get within the within the scope of all the you know the kind of big dominant layer ones salon is kind of as far as you can get from from ethereum and in many ways you can also see it you know within new york or sorry within uh crypto the the two biggest layer one blockchains uh are ethereum and solana in the same way the two biggest cities in the us are new york and l.a now i keep going down the list and giving more examples i can stop there i can keep going if you want to keep going uh i was just gonna bring that up yeah so you list off some other cities and some other blockchains that you think resemble um blockchains that resemble certain cities and so i think that's just a fantastic game so let's keep on going with that sure sure so the the next on the list that i put on there is avalanche it's not literally the next blockchain on market cap but it's the one that i i think is uh you know worth worth putting in this list um so avalanche the way that you can uh that i like to analyze avalanches avalanches like chicago so chicago is the third largest city in the us um and of course chicago you know it kind of has this it it is sort of a financy city like new york um it doesn't have quite all the same kind of cultural um sophistication that new york has but it's an aggressive city it's a you know it's a fast-growing city it's a newer city and it's one that is ultimately it's made a name for itself by being really really good at what it does um and in the same way i think avalanche is kind of this you know finance oriented up-and-comer it's very aggressive it's it has this kind of very brusque identity uh but it's look we're gonna be the next generation of wall street we're going to take the we're going to take the wind out of the sales of ethereum and be the future of what you know wall street wants to do um you know it's a little cold in in chicago same way it's uh you know avalanche obviously is a snowy name and they like to use a lot of cold metaphors so i felt like it was very appropriate to to brand them as chicago and then um the the the the the next one i put on that list is um san francisco davis is actually not one of the one of the largest cities actually they're pretty far down the list actually but in terms of cultural significance i think it's pretty obvious that san francisco is enormous in terms of its cultural roadmap or its impact on the overall culture and on the overall country by gdp and the same thing is true in many ways for near near is actually pretty low on the list of total tbl chains at least right now but you can obviously see in terms of price it's it's moved dramatically or especially over the last couple months and um and near i analogize to san francisco where near is this near actually very much embraces this ethereum 2.0 vision is that you know look near we are you know sharding before ethereum can ever get to sharding we are the decentralization maximus we're the idealists about what technology can accomplish you know we're a bunch of like ex google and xm sql engineers who are trying to build this next generation of tech and and we're true believers in that decentralization vision it's not there yet we're on our way um and i kind of analogize that to like okay you guys are trying to build the future it's very you know idealistic much in the way of of san francisco so those are the blockchains that i threw into the post but you know it's a it's a it's a game that we can we can we can take further if uh if if it makes sense too yeah i want to know what the random town in virginia which blockchain that is hasid because ryan took that one personally oh [ __ ] i didn't realize i live in a random town in virginia okay literally but no offense taken yeah i i totally get it but um can i ask you a question right because this this is interesting a lot of people frame different chains and bankless has we have in the past as taking uh completely different trade-offs but i think you're saying a little bit like yeah and that's the point these cities are making different trade-offs right you're saying la is going in a completely different direction in york but what they're all after is is sort of the same fundamental things they want population growth they want economic growth they want you know prosperity they want more more citizens i suppose more gdp for their city so they're all competing over the same types of resources and the same metrics and yes of course they are all making different trade-offs would you agree with that these these cities are all making different trade-offs but they're all after the same thing yes to an extent right so the classic way that the multi-chain story has often been betrayed or portrayed is that it's a zero-sum battle and the zero-sum battle is basically that um who's going to be the dominant blockchain and whoever picked the right trade-offs is ultimately the one that's going to be dominant right that's the traditional network effects model uh blockchains that there's gonna be one that's the right one and everyone else is basically gonna die off or be a ghost town and the vision that i'm painting here is a different vision it's a vision that look new york and la obviously in some sense compete over people because some people decide whether to live in new york or whether to live in l.a but when you see that there's a lot of um you know when you see outflows today not you know 100 years ago but today from new york or from la it's actually not that common that people from la go to new york where the people from new york go to l.a that's usually actually not what happens what happens is that people in new york go to other places in new york or you know they go to connecticut or they go to jersey or city or whatever and same thing in california if you don't like l.a you go to san diego you go you go to some other place in california and the reason why is that ultimately i think what is going to end up happening in blockchains this is kind of the prediction the underlying prediction of this model is that um the different places in the trade-off spectrum actually are going to attract mostly different people the venn diagram there's some people who are going to be look i just want to be in the best city and if new york is the best city and it's the most happening city i'm going to go there and if it's la i'm going to go there and like i don't really care about the underlying culture or the underlying values the underlying whatever but a lot of people are going to find that the cities are so different they house such different applications such different kinds of people such different use cases that actually it's like look if if i want to be you know uh playing games then i'm going to be on solana either way and if i don't choose salon i'm going to choose some other thing that's going to make a similar set of trade-offs i'm never going to be going on a theorem to play games it's just not the place for games and in the same way like look if i want to go be an actor maybe actor's not a great example since they both have uh acting um but you know let's say that i want to you know be in uh hollywood right hollywood yeah okay i guess i guess hollywood is is that if i want to if i want to make movies right like i mean obviously there's there's uh there's there's you know sort of play acting or like broadway which is in new york but if you want to be in movies there is one place to be and that's la and if you are not in l.a and you're not making movies like you're just you know what are you doing like it's just the wrong place to be um and i think in that sense you will find that as blockchains as these emerging letter ones grow the prediction from this model is that one they will become more distinct from each other initially when they all start they're all kind of the same right because they're all just a big pile of roads and a police station and you know whatever it's all just you know it's a block explorer and then a you know a twitter account that's like talking about how great it is but eventually and you've already seen this the the communities are getting more and more different they're becoming more and more uh variegated over time and as they do that they're going to attract different communities different industries different kinds of developers different kinds of applications and if that happens then the substitutability of these cities for each other will go down over time and you won't say okay i don't like ethereum therefore i'm going to go move over to near what you will say instead is that like hey nir is like really good for i don't know decentralized social media or you know some other thing that is not the thing that ethereum is dominantly used for and and vice versa do you think there will be some power law winners here at all yes i do and i think again this is another prediction of this city's model which is why i like it because it predicts a lot of things simultaneously um what it predicts is that look when you look at cities you do observe a power law in every single country there is one most dominant city and that city is usually you know at least twice as big as the next largest city almost always very rare there are two cities that are almost exactly the same size and you see that in the us right in the u.s new york is like something like eight million people and then la is like three point something million people new york is almost twice as big as la and the you you see in and then it falls down and then there's you know one point one point something you know chicago's maybe two million and then uh you know houston is like 1.5 million or something i'm picking i don't know exactly the numbers something in this ballpark um in a way this is almost exactly what we see with letter ones with letter ones we see that ethereum is huge and then after that solana is pretty big and then we see these other ones that are somewhat small and then it really falls off a cliff after you start going further down the list right but it looks like the the power law distribution looks very similar to what we see with respect to cities and so you know if you take the holistic view of this model the reason why i like this model so much is that it almost perfectly describes what we actually see what we actually see in terms of layer one blockchains their utility sorry i should say their utilization their prices and their value is that meant you know the the cities the big cities are where almost all the value is right so like ethereum solana uh near avalanche terra et cetera all those cities are hugely valuable but it's concentrated mostly in ethereum and then it kind of falls it goes down a curve after that and if you go further further down the list of cities those cities are not valuable at all they're very very small right second is that uh when it comes to roll-ups or or uh you know the the um the skyscrapers skyscrapers are important we're seeing lots and lots of investment in the skyscrapers as you would expect as cities grow really large but you know the largest skyscraper which today is arbitrary has way less economic activity inside of it than la which is you know maybe not surprising if this analogy is correct and then third is that the application specific blockchains which are these are factory towns like you know something like osmosis are tiny compared to all this other stuff going on within layer ones and layer twos they are they're a tiny uh blip in the overall economic picture of what's going on on public blockchains and to see you make a you're going through some of the predictions that you concretely write out in your uh in your paper which is basically what we are are going through right now in this podcast but there's one prediction that we haven't touched on yet and that's the very very last one uh which is that cross-chain bridges will be extremely valuable can you unpack this element of your thought and mental model here why why why are bridges so valuable so this one this one i think doesn't follow directly from the analogy but i think it's it's one that's not a far leap from the analogy um so crosstalk bridges are basically ways that you can connect up between two chains or two cities or you know even two skyscrapers for that matter um and in a world where the distance between those two blockchains is very large and very treacherous what what you actually have seen you know in order for us to get the massive uh sprawling infrastructure that we have in the u.s there was an enormous investment into a highway system and the highway system that was you know built by the government is obviously very very valuable uh before we had that you know we had uh roads and railroads and railroads of course were extremely valuable some of the most valuable businesses uh in in the world before uh you know the the you know the basically the highway system was built and totally uh made public and uh transportation across the us became much cheaper and of course before that it was canals and canals were extremely valuable and uh you know it's because they were effectively the choke point for a huge amount of commerce and in the same way if there's any good analogies you've drawn here you know transportation is one of the most one of the largest industries in every developed economy and transportation in the realm of public blockchains is basically bridges it's how you connect assets and uh even potentially you know smart contract execution from one chain to another chain if you're going to see more and more distribution across the landscape in crypto across different layer ones and layer twos and applications certain blockchains then the connective tissue that connects up all this stuff is going to be very very valuable in the way the railroads are valuable and the way the canals were valuable so that's it again it's not a direct consequence of this but it's a prediction that i think is is probably going to i think probably going to come true the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross

few tweaks that we we want to make so we want to dive into uh how we would tweak these these ideas and concepts to the way that we see this uh playing out it's mostly the same it's 80 the same but instead of cities we've seen blockchains cryptoeconomic networks as nations nation-states not necessarily cities and the reason why we we think that we see blockchains to be cities especially um the ones that take the modular approach is that to us the the l2s the rollups take the take the role of of cities where the ethereum l1 takes the role of like the federal the federal government right the coordinating body behind all the cities and that's why you can drive from new york to la without ever going through a security checkpoint you don't actually ever have to cross a border you can cross state borders but like no one's there checking in on you saying like hey can i see your documentation uh and and this the way that this um this works is that because every single city which and we're kind of blurring the lines between cities and states here um every single state slash city is all abiding by the same central protocol and that is the ethereum l1 and so you're saying the same citizenship that you have inside of you know la is the same citizenship that you have inside of new york and uh you mentioned earlier about how boston was actually like the epicenter of the united states and then also we have washington dc where like literally everything gets decided but let's go ahead with and just uh you know to discount all the ways that this metaphor breaks down when we make it extremely concrete we'll just assume that the epicenter of the united states was new york because it kind of is and when people decided to move out of new york new york was settled in like the 1650 something and then we made the constitution of the united states like almost 100 years later and the constitution of the united states set the rules for how people can freely migrate across all the states across all the cities or perhaps across all the rollups uh and so where ethereum the l1 has like this evm the the central guiding protocol that allows for all of these different cities to sync up on their central nodes right and so all of these states uh collapse down to the center of the federal res the federal government uh and so we are all of these uh cities or and states inside of the united states of america all abide by the same central protocol which is the ethereum l1 and that makes interstate highways free of free for trades free trade between states like you don't actually have to pay taxes to go trade between states not not to the federal reserve and you also have all of the same rights uh that you do when you go from state to state and city to city and this starts to that breaks down when you go across a border and so like we will have um the united states of america be uh be united states and then like solana can be uh canada and you actually have there's friction going across the border like you actually aren't guaranteed to have like be able to pass through that and while users can freely consider themselves like a citizen of any single l1 and all of them simultaneously assets are the things that are actually have prominence right if an asset is born on ethereum then if you want to migrate that using a cross-chain bridge a multi-sig bridge going from united states to canada united states and mexico or to europe you actually have to ask permission and you need to go through a permissioned bridge and that is the difference between a multi-sig bridge where you have a set of signers which is how you cross across uh blockchains versus a roll or l2 roll-up cryptographic bridge which has uh as far as my understanding goes much more bandwidth to allow for things on the l1 to pass up to the l2 and so there's friction between these borders and that's because canada abides by some certain set of raw of laws it is a particular protocol and america abides by a certain set of laws that is its protocol and these laws are asynchronous and so you so you have to actually go through like some sort of arbitrary coupler in order to have your uh things on one in one nation state go to another nation state and some nation states have really good partnerships perhaps like it's actually way easier to go from ethereum to avalanche because they are abide by a very common set of principles the evm and that's why uh transportation across things like united states to canada are it's actually relatively easy because we actually have shared culture but going from the united states to some like country like iraq gets a lot harder because we do not have shared protocols shared laws we operate on different rules uh how do you feel about uh this tweaking of the metaphor how has this landed with you um so i i like it i think by kind of zooming out a level and kind of saying like okay we're actually let's let's let's pull everything up one one kind of uh level of size you end up at an interesting place where as you were talking about um you can start contextualizing the relationships between layer ones as like i like your analogy of like look yes you're absolutely right there is more interoperability much easier between avalanche and ethereum because they share this common language of the evm which is kind of similar to like how canada the us share common culture and common legal norms um although it gets um like i i'm i think at the same time though it is a little bit early to start calling alliances between layer one blockchains because i think we don't actually really know how it's going to play out right like i think it's it's it's sort of like you know it's the year is still like you know uh you know 1790 and uh you know france maybe just help us out a little bit but it's kind of like okay well i don't really know what you want to do with us now that you got us out of this war and i kind of feel like that's a little bit of how the l1s are looking at each other today is that look everyone starts friendly because they're like what's the point of not being friendly but as competition ramps up um we may see slightly less friendliness over time it's it's hard to say um but uh but yeah i think your analogy also works very well and captures some other elements of how the um the different little ones uh relate to each other the the other i guess question i have about um kind of the the multi-chain world and the multi-chain idea uh and like we can get a bit more concrete we don't have to stay with the city's analogy although i do think nation states maybe um implies this better is the topic of security so um you know all of these cities all of these chains let's say have to fund their own security budget their own military right and this is this is more than like a police force this is an actual military because you know police force is mostly for enforcing the law in a population you know your city a military you're actually fighting external forces right so like you know the us might have to fight another country or something or some other country might have to attack the us right you have to defend against that as a nation-state and that it seems like is the uh the primary cost of running a layer one running a blockchain is security cost and you pay for it in one of two ways you either pay for it via issuance so you mint new tokens and those assets are worth something the layer one assets or uh you fund it through transaction fees and the minting of new tokens the transaction fees they either go to the military in the form of miners or they go into the military in form of like validators right and all blockchains basically work this way so you have a security budget um and so i guess the question for me or what i've struggled with with the multi-chain uh thesis is how is a layer 1 going to compete against a layer 2 uh when the layer 2 doesn't actually have to fund itself so the nice thing about being a layer 2 is you kind of get the military for free right so like you're just again if layer ones are nation states you're in the u.s you know and a layer two is a city like san francisco or la the nice thing is new york city la they don't need their own militaries they just depend on washington dc and the federal government right but if you are spinning up your own country you have to have a sizable military i think not necessarily to take on the us but to build your network effect because i think there is a an idea here and i'm wondering if you agree with this idea that applications and users will go to the highest security blockchain that will be the chain that wins so the chain that has the highest security will eventually be the dominant chain and that may or may not be true but that i think is an underpinning of this thesis and if that's the case then yeah i mean basically chains that become money their underlying assets become a monetary asset of some sort they're able to create the highest security budget they will attract the power law the vast majority of all of the value and other chains won't and particularly because those other chains will have to compete against player twos that pay nothing for security what do you think of that how does security budget factor into the multi-chain thesis that you have physique yeah so there are a lot of things there and i want to make sure i get to every component of them um to to kind of forge my answer so the first thing is i i i think okay the the country metaphor here i think gets a little bit treacherous because if we actually want to play out the metaphor then it's like okay well one's the us who's china who's germany and i i i think it starts getting yeah it's getting a little bit politically yeah yeah it starts getting politically messy that's one of the reasons why i like the city analogy is that it's more politically neutral um or at least less charged when we started like assigning assigning names um but second is i do think there are actually some important disanalogies between nation states and cities right so cities still do have what we might call a security budget right you need a police force you need a fire station you know you need there are certain services that must be administered by the municipality in order for a city to function correctly right there are um kind of public goods that must be administered by each city and uh and security is just one such public good right it's kind of the most principal public good uh in a blockchain now the question that you laid out there is a look if i am choosing a city to live in am i not going to choose the city that has the best police force like isn't that just obvious because if i go to another city there's a marginally higher chance that like i get robbed or that i get killed or that i get whatever and the answer is well obviously not right if you if you frame it in those terms or the question is okay look which shouldn't i live in the country that has the highest you know military per capita which actually i you know i don't know if the u.s has the highest military capital but let's let's say for instance that it doesn't let's say there's some smaller country somewhere that has even more forces per capita right um it's like okay well i no i wouldn't choose where i want to live based on that i might go live in switzerland because switzerland is just really nice and like it's good enough for me and you know switzerland has been invaded in a very long time and uh if it's going to be invaded anytime soon i can leave and you know find somewhere else to go live um the reality is that that's that's just demonstrably not how people choose where they live now there are certain people who are making their choices based on security right there are certain people who are saying look i am going to live in new york because i want to make sure that like my real my assets are protected by the most ironclad um you know legal framework possible for protecting people's assets right uh a lot of people do that a lot of financial assets are look i'm only going to be in new york banks and i am not going to entrust myself into any other jurisprudence i'm not going to have money in in hong kong or in singapore or in germany because i never know what those governments might do but i know what you know new york is going to do new york is not going to steal my money and that that you know set of case law is so ironclad that i can trust it in the same way some people are going to say look i'm only going to be on ethereum because i don't trust anywhere else not to eventually [ __ ] up and that's why i'm going to choose ethereum and nothing else there are some people who will make that choice but uh only one obviously the people who do that are probably going to be the very very wealthy so you know it's the whales and the kind of billionaires and the kind of crypto elite who are going to be saying i'm only going to choose ethereum because i don't trust solana or avalanche not to have faults or not to you know to actually be able to survive a nation-state level attack etc etc says the first thing very few people are making their choices based on that criteria second you can sort of see it by people's reveal preferences is that there are more users on binance marching than there are in ethereum you know ostensibly um there are if you certainly aggregate all the other lab1 blockchains there are definitely more users on all the other layman blockchains than there are on ethereum uh if you combine them all right it does not seem to be the case that people are measuring the security budget of ethereum how many people do you know who have asked you can you please describe to me the difference between the the security budget of ethereum versus security budget of solana i have never heard anyone ever ask me that question that is not how people are determining what blockchains they're going to use so now there are important considerations about how long is this blockchain been around how robust is it how you know how likely is it to be bug-free those are all things people very much care about but the security budget and this is something that i i've written about actually a bunch of times um i wrote a piece uh i can't remember i think we may have we may have spoken about it right a long time ago called um why decentralization isn't as important as you think and in that in that piece i talk about this decentralization s-curve and the s-curve basically describes that when you are not very decentralizing a very low security budget increasing the security budget that you're spending doesn't matter very much because if somebody wants to go and like you know if you're robsten right let's say or like i don't know cheap do you guys know cheap is that another test night of some sort it's it's like a it's like a it's like a real test net but it's you know real money you can go buy it it it trades on like some random [ __ ] coin exchange um it was actually made by george hotz it's kind of cool but basically it was like it's like the kasama for for ethereum right yeah yeah value laden uh real mainnet um so uh if you go on cheape and you want to go do a 51 attack against gp that's pretty easy it's not that hard if you marginally increase the proof of work on cheap it'll it's not going to change that anybody who really wants to and wants to go spend you know ten thousand dollars or i don't know however much it costs to take take it over you can just go do it right it's not that hard so increasing the spend does basically nothing but at a certain point you'll hit this curve where now it's like okay now it's a hundred thousand dollars an hour if you increase enough now you start climbing up this s-curve where the amount of extra security spend is really materially changing the number of people who would need to quit or who can single-handedly coordinate to take over your blockchain right and so you start climbing this s curve and really having an impact on the effective censorship resistance of this chain and decentralization of this chain but then eventually you're going to hit this point of declining returns and then it really starts leveling off right if i told you hey you know what i think ethereum should spend you know a billion dollars more per year on a security budget would that materially change your your desire to use ethereum no of course not right like you would probably wouldn't even know you you didn't even know to ask the question of hey should a theorem be spending more on its security budget you're not even thinking about it right you you know that ethereum is safely past the point where it needs to be worrying about how much it's spending on its security budget and if i told you that hey ethereum is likely to lose 10 of its security spend next year you would say okay whatever like that's probably fine uh because you know that it's safely past that rise in the s-curve and so for that reason the thing that really matters is that most of these layer 1 blockchains pass that really high ascension in the s curve and further marginal decentralization or increased security spend doesn't matter that much right if all that you know if you had your mossad or you know the fbi or you know these other really concentrated actors coming together and saying you know what we're going to go break ethereum there's a good chance that they could even do that to ethereum today and if uh you know a a you know a group of script kitties or you know as one of these you know hacker groups came together and said i want to go break ethereum or i want to go break avalanche they might not be able to do it today and so they both actually are not that different in their material respects with respect to how secure they are now i mean look you can argue at the margin whether or not that's true of avalanche whether or not that's true of the theory whether that's true of tasos or whatever my point is that uh it's definitely not a question of whichever one is the most secure is the one that everyone's going to use that's not even the criterion people are using today do you think uh i want to get back i want to get back to that because i think the first two points you made are good but um do you think that that still holds true if we assume users are no longer individual people but they're actually chains because that effectively is what the ethereum roadmap and the modular blockchain thesis is like pushing towards it's like no users aren't going to be using main chain actually other chains are going to be purchasing the block space of main chain and so the argument would be well security actually really matters maybe not for individual users you don't care like i'll use coinbase all the time i have assets on coinbase like whatever i don't you know but um for chains if they are planning their entire economy and their entire future they have to have the most secure chain in order to root themselves in order to have those settlement guarantees does that change the calculus at all and and to to elaborate on that the more security a federal government has the stronger military a federal government has in the world of blockchains when we extend this metaphor to blockchains you are literally making more space for more cities because you can fit more roll-ups on inside of your nation and so again it's not it's asking a question a question the question to users like yo like do you want to go to the most secure chain they don't really care they just want to go to where the fun is they want to pick their favorite city that vibes with their culture the most but when it comes to a nation or a blockchain how house your level of security is determine how many cities you can fit inside of your protocol how many cities you can fit inside of your nation so it's a it's it's an interesting question and i think i get your point is that uh chains are going to be in some sense they can aggregate the preferences of their users more effectively than users could maybe individually um and it might it might be that look when you're big and giant you're just going to be more risk-averse and you're going to be more conservative the way that governments are tend to be more conservative than maybe users individually are um [Music] that being said i mean again we can it one is i think it's very clearly security is not the only thing that chains care about right they also care about composability they care about you know economic value they care about also i mean one thing that a lot of chains are can and do uh uh concern themselves with is you know what is the what is the um trajectory of this chain am i attaching myself to a rising country or a falling country and you know people want to bet on winners they want to bet on and there's more returns in many ways to betting on somebody who's rising than on somebody who's flat or somebody's falling um the prediction that almost falls out of the the the suggestion you guys are making is that look the u.s is the biggest country it's got the biggest military right so wouldn't it be the case that every single other country on in the world would become basically a satellite state of the us and the answer demonstrably is no like it's just not the case that every single country in the world is a satellite state of the us because there are many other things that matter besides your military might and i think that um i mean again this is where the analogy breaks down because there's obviously so many more variables in geopolitics than just your military um but i think what we'll find is that it's likely also true in in blockchains and it's also a matter of when it's not just a matter of this will eventually happen when ethereum achieves its you know eventual roadmap there's also a question of like okay well how freaking long is it going to take because i'm ready to go today i'm like an entrepreneur i'm here ready to build i have users who are not sitting around waiting for this eventual utopian vision of sharding and blah blah blah and i think all the stuff is clearly path dependent because if security is not the only thing that matters which i think we can all agree it's not the only thing that matters it might matter a lot but it's definitely not the only one then um if these other things matter and and uh they can be delivered faster by these other architectures of these other chains then i think it is very path dependent how all this stuff ends up evolving i think one one kind of interesting you know implication of this whether we see layer one chains of cities or whether we see them as as countries as of as nation states like if we look at the world today both of those things do break down like do um turn into power law distributions right as far as like gdp as far as like you know economic power that sort of thing like there are generally power law winners at one given epoch in history and there are other you know smaller uh nation states as well and so maybe we're also arriving to a similar conclusion whether it's nation states or cities um exactly okay so how bullish are you than on non-layer non-ethereum chains right now haseeb do you think that this is where the bulk of the growth and the value will be had for investors moving forward i'm quite bullish i don't know about the bulk of i mean that's a very strong uh that's a very strong phrase so i don't know if i'd say that the bulk of value is going to come from these emerging layer ones but i do think it's the case i'm not making a bold prediction that's already happened obviously so i'm a little late to the party but um i was i i was also if you if you um i think you and i talked about this briefly i wrote a piece back in i think it was a summer called um i'm worried no one's gonna care about roll-ups and in that piece basically one of the i think one of the lines i put i don't know if this actually was a line but basically i said you know one of the reasons why i'm worried about these emerging uh roll-ups being this huge story and people thought oh skyscrapers are gonna be the biggest thing and everyone's gonna live in a skyscraper um which you know today is obviously not not the case even in the world that most people don't live in skyscrapers um and uh the reason one of the reasons why i was concerned about this story is that these emerging little ones can move so much faster than the roll-ups it's it's so much easier to go build a new city than it is to like go perfect skyscraper technology and in fact i i was worried that look these guys like they can iterate if there's a bug and a roll-up game over potentially you lose all the money right it's extremely careful engineering if the skyscraper falls down lots of bad [ __ ] and like no more skyscrapers for a long time really that's that's how bad it's gonna be um but uh with emerging layer one if something goes wrong that's cool just fork it fix it you know if you need if you have a dow fork situation that's fine right you're still in your infancy it's all good everyone's calling this stuff beta software even though no one's treating it as beta software um it's all good you can you can do that really easily you have the flexibility um whereas with layer 2 you don't have that and furthermore from the perspective of a user most users who are entering blockchains today they're just here you know they're here to train nfts they're here to like liquidity mine they have no idea what's going on they have no idea what any of the arguments that we've been you know going on about for the last three or four years and so when they show up and they see a cheap chain it's like hey this skyscraper is really expensive this other one is really cheap and both of them you know have you know ponzi schemes on them great i'll go i'll go on this one which is way cheaper and from the perspective of a user the best layer two is the new layer one so that and you know that that was a a concern that i was voicing back in the summer and i think the so far um that's turned out to be the case is that the most vibrant happening places in crypto today are probably these emerging their ones um and uh the layer twos are still relatively anemic in their in their growth haseeb if you had to this is the you're the closer question for the podcast uh okay what's your favorite city to live in in the in the real world or in crypto i'll let you figure that one out okay okay uh my favorite city to live in um uh i would actually say new york um although i don't live in new york i think new york is probably my favorite city it just happens that at dragonfly we do so much work with asia that living in new york would just be absolutely brutal in respect to time zones but uh new york particularly in i'll say not in the winter non-winter new york i'd say is probably my favorite city um and uh maybe that betrays something about my my views about uh ethereum is that i think it theory is amazing except when it's congested then it sucks and i also heard winter and hopefully we're not in a in a crypto winter right now has see do you have any thoughts on that yeah uh i mean i i was just uh i was just asked this the other day from somebody who was uh like uh the reporter type and what i told him was like look you know you're asking like are we in a winter do we know where how do you know and the answer is like look you know when you see it like the point where everyone's asking the question of when are we in a winter the answer is yes that's what david says it's like i you know i'm not convinced we're in a bear market but he's like if you're asking that question then we're in a bear market because it's a bear market is about sentiment exactly bear market is when you look around and ask people are we guys are we still is anyone excited that's how you know it's like when you're looking around looking for trying to get people hyped up that's okay yeah you're not there anymore you're not you're not in a bull market anymore well this is great has he this has been super helpful thanks for coming on bankless again and just talking about cities man i i really like this analogy i i do think um you know geography cities social structures all of these things are helpful very helpful for understanding blockchains and uh thanks for laying out the multi-chain thesis today totally it's a lot of fun action items for you bankless listeners of course we'll have a few links to resources in the show notes the first is read haseeb's piece we've been talking about today blockchains are cities is the name of it if you want a throwback go all the way back to summer i think of 2020 yeah summer 2020 when we last had his heap on where we talked about d5 in the e2 metropolis it's another city's analogy to describe starting and how scalability would emerge on ethereum so those are some resources for you of course as always risks and disclaimers guys all this stuff is risky everything we've been talking about none of it has been financial advice eth is risky defy is risky so all there's cities and chains out there you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope you
