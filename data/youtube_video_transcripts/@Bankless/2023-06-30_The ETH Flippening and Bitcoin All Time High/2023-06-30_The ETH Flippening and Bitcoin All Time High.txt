oh my God they're large wait two wait two trillion trillion with a t okay and BlackRock is double that size oh my God it's like between them a lot of them they got all the assets but what does this do for our bags that's a big question here bankless Nation it is the last Friday of June 2023 and it's time for something special something we release every single Friday David what time is it oh it's time for the Friday banquest weekly rollout Ryan where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere nonetheless fully caffeinated uh I had a copy I also had tea this morning actually as well I had both well good for you and I got to enjoy some of your coffee in your apartment where you live in person for all the haters for all the doubters out there David can you confirm for the people that Ryan Sean Adams is a physical real human being he you do have matter there are there are atoms I'm still there's still like room for you being an AI but yes Ryan and I were actually hanging out in person doing some co-working uh in the bankless offices uh this last week which was pretty interesting the bank location is going to see some uh some side by side same camera same microphone podcast coming out on the YouTube very very rare stuff we could uh put them in his nfts they should be Collectibles uh but that's not all we got some big topics of the week number one Bitcoin hits a new all-time high wait what did you write that yeah you didn't hit all-time high what do we mean technically technically it did it technically okay okay you'll have to explain that one to me what else we got uh staking also hits a new all-time high and formally passes Supply on exchanges we're gonna get into the details around that the Bitcoin ETF race turns up like two notches it's getting real really hot uh ZK sync drops the ZK stack and there's a new airdrop targeting East takers so check out your eligibility that's me David that's you need steak yeah you're getting your tokens I hope so I I can't wait for you to tell me what they are how to do that yeah um we also have something really cool that we want to share this is more friends and sponsors alright this is a group this is a conference that David and I support this is a bankless plus block Works conference it's called permissionless this is the only conference I go to every single year that that'll be this will be the next time you and I meet I think David um tell us what is going on at permissionless what are the dates who's speaking why should bankless listeners be excited about this I've been headed down working with the blockworks team to to finalize this agenda and man it is it's really coming together okay so permissionless September 13th 11th through 13th in Austin Texas while everyone is paper handing the absolute F out of the United States permissionless is going to Texas so we got Eric Voorhees we got representative is this even legal yeah we are allowed crypto people are allowed to assemble and so we are fulfilling our patriotic Duty by assembling in Texas we have Tom emmer and Hester purse on a panel together that's going to be pretty sick hazus is coming in Kevin owaki Melton demirs Jim Bianco it's going to be one half of a reunion of every single bankless podcast episode and one half of a reunion and have every single blockworks podcast episode uh I'm I'm pretty pretty stoked for this we have we're putting Solana Cosmos and ethereum people all on a panel together to talk about you know differences coming together and also fighting I mean Hollow from polygon Ben Jones from optimism uh van Spencer from framework torgel from scroll so all the layer twos everyone who is fighting as a family will all be there at permissionless look at this lineup dude Anatoly Raj Santiago Jesse Pollocks Donnie Michael Anderson tarun Lee Jin Jin Bianco I already said his name but he's worth saying it twice man there's there's it's it's quite the lineup it's quite the lineup uh very exciting so what should folks do if they want to get a ticket David oh if you are a bankless citizen you should definitely use your code to get 30 off you can find that code in the Discord or in the bank list perks page there's also a hackathon this year so first time we're doing this hackathon this year four and there's also a Dev track as well because we're really expanding the F out of permission list this year so Link in the show notes to get your ticket uh if you subscribe to bankless you get 30 off which is more than pays for your ticket so that's what the rational economic agent would do there hmm do we have any of those I don't know if I don't know we'll find out no I have faith in the bankless nation uh David let's get to markets though what's Bitcoin doing you told me this was all-time high I feel tricked yeah it's not in dollars but it is an all-time high it is at an all-time high okay well what price are we at this week Bitcoin started the week at thirty thousand dollars ending the week at thirty thousand five hundred dollars you know nice nice and healthy three three zero you really gotta appreciate that three I'm zero America 30k I'm feeling great yeah above 30k I'm just feeling just fine I'm all right with that uh of course we're watching this on the Kraken charts play out Kraken Pro easy enough for me to use it how about ether this week we up we down down a little bit ether started the week at 1885 ending the week at 1850 down a percent and a half so Bitcoin up a percent and ether down a percent hanging out in the 1800s huh yeah yeah the Victorian age yeah uh Civil War era 1850s 1860s you know I don't know every time every time ether goes through the 1900s I'm like Oh my birthday [Laughter] um all right let's do Bitcoin eth on the ratio we don't have to do that one we can see no we can't it's down at points where you want to skip it are the weeks that are they're more oh that is a discount and that goes down into the right yeah it's definitely I'm scrolling out it's still down yeah it still goes down when does it at all has it gone ever gone up yes it has gone up how about on the year let's scroll at least to there okay it's just been flat ever since even like the start of the last bull market so it's between .06 and like 0.08 all right yeah definitely on the lower side of the race Bitcoin gaming gaining some steam this week maybe that's why you you told me it was a at an all-time high and we'll find out more about that I think uh but before we get there total crypto market cap is that looking at on the week uh we are coming in at 1.2 trillion dollars so healthy okay the numbers in my head are Bitcoin over 30k feeling good eat the price over 2K I'm feeling good it's not there yet but I'd feel good if that was the case crypto market cap over one trillion I'm still feeling good so overall I mean spare Market has been hard I guess but I don't know at one trillion dollar market cap how how hard has it actually been yeah that's that's the topic of discussion I I think uh and we'll get into this in further into the market section first off Bitcoin new all-time high seven million 7.6 million dollar Argentine pesos so new Bitcoin all-time high for the country of Argentina for the fiat currency of Argentina reminder all Fiat currencies go to zero so I'm just go faster than others uh so yeah you feel rugged bankless listener David told us all-time high now he's saying it's in Argentinian Pesos hey it depends on your frame of reference my man like not only is that a little bit of an all-time high that has screamed past the all-time yeah this is just a good reminder of inflation in Fiat currencies are bad there and the U.S the strength of the US dollar is a privilege and all other Fiat currencies are weaker than the dollar and we should on the dollar all the time yeah it is and and the only reason the dollar looks somewhat good at like you know five to ten percent inflation rate is because everything is like a lot of other assets are so much worse a lot of other Fiat currencies are so much worse that's why the dollar uh looks good uh sometimes uh this is interesting though Argentine Congress approves IMF debt deal that would discourage crypto uses so this is what I worry about when Fiat based countries which is which is all of them start to feel under threat from crypto what do they do when they start to bleed relative to other Fiats of course but relative to crypto assets what do they do we haven't yet seen this kind of reaction in the US because I don't think we've bled hard enough but um this is interesting discouraging crypto use in Arjun uh Argentina that seems like a big step what do you think about this the quote from the article that stands out to me to further Safeguard Financial stability we are taking important steps to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies with a view to prevent money laundering informality and disintermediation they're trying to they're trying to prevent this intermediation I would like to encourage disintermediation that's when I'm here they're trying to prevent informality what does that even mean I don't know to me you sound like a money launderer right now I'm talking you're talking like a money launderer you're also a terrorist someone's gonna clip that out of college that's gonna be fantastic um yeah preventing money laundering that that's the reason they'll give it has nothing of course to do with the inflation of the peso in our country I I just I look at this and I'm kind of like yeah coming to a Fiat economy near you just watch out for this odd thing right it's going to us yeah okay um this is interesting from Charlie Bitcoin returned since 2010 this is on the yearly year start year end what are we looking at in this table it's just a nice reminder of what Bitcoin does every single year which is always the answer to that is always large either red or green uh 2010 nine thousand nine hundred percent twenty eleven one thousand four hundred percent uh 2012 186 2013 500 and then 2014 negative 58 and like when negative 58 that cuts all previous numbers you know by half right and then 35 125 1300 and then 2018 negative 73 uh so 2022 we had negative 65 2023 year to date 85 in the green for Bitcoin and so it's just like also the regularity of the of the red ears David is he's a pat are you seeing the pattern here three bankless three greens and a red three Greens in here twenty ten doesn't count or Twenty ten three greens and a red uh so we had red in 2022 year to date 2023 strongly in the green I think we get two more greens and then we get a red and so what are you serious 24 is green can happen perhaps very green 25 is very green 2026 is in the red so this is TA sir are we Traders now I I look forward to once again not selling in 2025 and then having this clipped out and I said like oh I was gonna say I should sell in 2025. I totally think this is the base case for how it plays out again yeah you know and what this says is since Bitcoin has been in existence it's only been unprofitable you bought it beginning the year three years out of like the 12 13 plus years it's been in existence right just three years it's been a bad bad deal let me tell you uh the negative 60 the 1300 Trump those yeah I'd say so yeah over time it's appreciate it I made this uh in Photoshop just before we started recording uh the red part of this graph which is this is the Bitcoin uh chart that is the only part of the chart that is in the red that is only the part that's a lot of green like so you're saying if you bought from about 2021 to halfway through 2020. in 2022 you're in the red but if you bought any time before that you are still in the money right in your Bitcoin purchase and also anytime between now and halfway through 2022 so this is what I'm calling Schrodinger's Market so like where are we in the bull market bear Market cycle are we just closing the 2022 Gap 2022 was just too bad too much blood that we just mean reverted or are we at the beginning stages of a bull market so if you go back to like we can't do this because I didn't include it in the uh in the screenshot but like if you go back and look at the 2017 bull market it started in 2015. it started like that was when the up only markets began but in 2015 you felt like you were in a bear Market because it starts the year after the red year right yes and so right now we're in Schrodinger's Market are we just recovering from the bear or are we at the start of the bull it's kind of the same thing but you don't really know where you are and it feels the same it does feel the same but I feel like I know where I am you know what I mean like just like it's just it's probably just gonna play out the same way it always does three greens and a red this is pretty cool State eat now exceeds eth on centralized exchanges we're going bankless fam what's his chart uh this route we showed this last week and maybe even the week before but these lines have touched what are the lines one line the top line which is now the bottom line is ether on centralized exchanges loser line uh the winner line is the bottom line which is now the Top Line uh is ether being staked so more staked than on exchanges is this the flipping sir this is a flipping okay not the flipping even the flipping of course 20 million ether is currently staked with a 2.9 Million ether of queued ether to stake wow ether is in the queue that's insane it just keeps growing they just keep staking when are they going to stop staking David when are they going to stop staking what is this from poop man uh this is a it looks like a fantastic very credible account here poop man uh what what's he got for us uh they're just talking about the growth of eth staking it has slowed down in the last 30 days but that's after the acceleration of post merge uh he says I'm very optimistic about the LSD Market he has checked Dune analytics and found some interesting stats the fastest growing swell network with 58 growth and followed by figment with 57 growth and then the largest outflows of ether is wobe and bitstamp two centralized exchanges he follows and says swell means the to be the staking Superstar out of the bear Market because it's successful Pearl incentive campaign is like the airdrop teasing campaign uh meanwhile centralized exchanges such as coinbase and Hobie are getting a downturn likely due to regulatory issues uh so this is just talking about some some data out of the seeking as a service industry uh well has a lot of growth but although it is still very small so like it it it's got like 28 000 000 it's still a sliver it's one of these tiny slivers over here isn't it yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't even know where it is but um it's certainly not the 30 31 of lydo yeah um or the uh the still the 9.5 but it is good it is great to see that um competition entering the market David what do we have coming up next coming up next ZK sync releases the ZK stack and why it's got me all hot and bothered boy do I love biomimicry systems the ETF War heats the absolute f up Fidelity Arc invest vanic I'll enter the race but Arc jumps to first in line with this one simple trick how did they do it how did they do it yeah it would yeah so all that and more coming up as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially Kraken the place that we see all these beautiful charts every time we go through the

traders who trust Kraken Pro for their crypto trading needs visit pro.crackin.com to get started today mantle formerly known as bitdow is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web 3 space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web free onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for tvl and liquidity and on-ramp so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle a big release from ZK sync this week David what are we looking at zksig releases the ZK stack a modular framework for building Sovereign ZK powered hyper chains based on zksync's open source code so ZK stack sounds a little bit like op stack if you're using the op stack as a frame of reference you're off to a great start what's a stack why do they call them Stacks yeah it's like a tech stack it's like a technology stack and so the ZK stack is what does zksync do ZK sync does has zero knowledge cryptography but as a layer two would the one thing that they really do is their ZK circuit what is ZK sync they make the ZK circuit everything else about ZK sync is kind of a commodity they settle to ethereum they use ethereum data they use other parts of other components that could produce a layer two the rest of what that makes up the ZK sync Layer Two ZK sync era is more or less a commodity they make the ZK circuit so what is the ZK stack it is ZK syncs ZK circuit as a framework where you can take in the rest of the components of what makes a layer two and build your own Layer Two build your own chain fam build it build a ZK Workshop is what it is and so what the ZK stack allows teams to build their custom hyper chain which is zksync's fractal scaling branding a fully trustless cheap asynchronous connectivity to the rest of the hyper chain ecosystem now this is the secret sauce that the ZK element has that the optimistic Roll-Ups worlds do not have ZK circuits chains that all use the ZK circuits have a crazy amount of composability right out of the gate because that is the magic of ZK uh and so ZK chains like ZK chain a that uses the same circuit as ZK chain B have a ton of composability Tailwinds and benefits will it be like you have like will it be like you have the asset on the same chain will it be that easy to move from uh you know chain to chain and also if I can fit two questions in one here oh boy uh is this a layer three so we're basically talking about here uh both answers are kind of maybe yes uh so to take the simple one first is this a layer three it can be a layer three it is a open framework for deploying chains you want to deploy Layer Two you want to deploy a layer three you want to deploy a layer n you want to deploy a chain between chains and if fractal hyper scaling think of it like just a root system of chains like it starts to layer three is a very like number three like it's not so canonical it's like a tree branch tree branch exactly root system yeah branches of trees yeah uh what was what was the first question in your head I don't know they can do one question time yeah well uh the first question was you know David I can't remember it's been one of those weeks my friend yes it definitely has okay so uh moving on maybe I'll think of it uh ZK ZK stack the lightweight sequencer with low latency of sequencing that's the ZK element apps that can interact without the truss assumption at Bridge Bridges also I know yeah yeah I was asking you if the experience will be like um I have my assets what the experience is like from going from like one ZK enabled chain on the ZK stack to another right the answer is like kind of it depends the easy answer is yes the harder answer is like yes and there takes a bunch of additional like supporting infrastructure and development and abstraction to get to that point um but the answer is that we are moving there and this is a very big step towards moving there there's other things like we need etherscan to allow for when you like and rather than you don't you have RB scan and opti-scan and there's for every single like ecosystem there's its own version of etherscan we need optimizations and Scaffolding like etherscan to be able to work with networks of chains and they can do that but they need to do that well I don't need a bridge you do not need a bridge in these EK world you do not need a bridge same thing with the optimism super chain but that even has a even further challenge is because they don't have the CK element but there is a part in this roll up that talks about the CK world of the optimistic chains anyways um and uh okay a closed private chain with connectivity to the ecosystem that just means hey deploy a ZK chain you're connected to the zkc hyper chains but it's still your chain with a native way a way to issue a native token as that token space so that is all of what I am excited about this is my tweet the ZK stack shell and here at the internet what do I mean by this okay so this is why both op stacks and ZK Stacks just like get me going it's because these systems they're meant to be forked they're like both optimism and DK sync are saying Fork the absolute F out of us deploy your chains deploy more chains more chains everywhere just use the same standard because if you use the same standard then the network effects around these standards grow optimism wants you to use the their optimistic Tech stack standard called the op stack CK sync wants you to use their ZK Tech stack standard called the ZK stack and that's what you get you got the ZK and the op the optimism uh and so the idea is that they are just optimizing for what they are doing best and then they're Lessing letting the rest of the internet Express their modules their desires for how they want their chain to be expressed uh and so this allows the ZK chains or op stack chains to find corners of the internet because they're so customizable that chain deployers can make them fit into whatever corner of the internet that they want to go so the whole outline of like the ZK stack Sean here at the internet is a is saying that like we're going to this is the scaffolding that's needed in order to propagate chains so that we can take the internet and put it on ethereum there's an entire episode on this yes or not yes oh I did a show an episode on this with uh Alex glakowski and Anthony Rose from zks Inc uh talking all about this uh and so we talk a lot about the nature of ZK as a technology just like the principles and the values that ZK Tech as a technology embody and then we go into the ZK stack which is how those values get Scaled out to the scale of the internet one thing I would add to all of this is I know we're talking about some releases from ZK sync and also optimism next this week um polygon arbitrum they have their own versions of this as well I mean all of these large layer 2 ecosystems are moving to a world where it's very easy to spin up your own chain they all have slightly different approaches towards getting there uh and it's very very exciting to see so why don't you tell us about optimism what are they doing this week the cool thing about what this is Ryan this week is that this actually is an optimism this is O of one Labs who I don't actually know the name of that but I think they're associated with Mina protocol hence this uh announcement they say o of one Labs is excited to submit a proposal to optimism for the application of our zero knowledge proof stack to op stack fraud proofs this application is built on the groundbreaking mips ZK VM we're building as part of the Mina protocol roadmap why is this cool we've created kimchi our plonkish proving system this is cryptography words to help bring zkps to the web 3 intel in web 2 Worlds and so basically the op stack is like a bunch of uh modules every change is a module for the O for the optimism super chain and oplabs is submitting their version of fault proofs into the world of optimism and so this is like a path forward for the op stack to gain a ZK module inside of the op super chain world that makes sense it does I think so does this mean an OP chain could potentially be a ZK evm op chain so yes op chain can accept a ZK module and then part of the this is the cool thing part of the super chain all of the hyper chains that makes up the optimism super chain most are going to be uh optimistic Roll-Ups some can be ZK Roll-Ups and it can all be part of the optimistic super chain technically this is a very hard thing to parse apart and the optimism team knows this and they all understand are taking on the challenges of like how do we make a composable super chain like head on Ben Jones from optimism has this thing that he's working on to help like Define how does the super chain grow um but man does it feel like the layer two summer the layer two ecosystem is just on fire right now yeah it's it's uh really cool it looks like optimism as well has renamed optimism to op mainnet which is sort of interesting this uh this mainnet area for all of these op chains that's pretty cool um I guess one takeaway from all of this is um I feel like this time the next bull market we will have all of the block space We need oh yeah right yes so much block space and if we need more it's easy to get more now it's so easy to get more now making that composable making it private making the ux good still some issues of course but we got the block space right so low gas fee environments is going to be the case now I feel like we need now we have all the block space and we don't have enough apps but you know someone will someone please build an app consume some black space I mean but okay zoom out this is kind of what happened with the internet right yeah yeah um basically you had kind of the early internet and we're like we need more bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth billions and hundreds of billions of dollars went into bandwidth investment internet infrastructure investment then what happened.com bust all the money kind of evaporated and we're like now we have all of this bandwidth but we don't have the apps for the internet right guess what happened the apps came because there was high bandwidth environment we got things like YouTube for instance video streaming yeah like Netflix online we got all of the high bandwidth apps after that so I think the builders were cut will catch up they're taking notice uh the apps will come David never fear it is worth just taking a step back and just reflecting man like we do not know what's coming next but hey at least we have the bandwidth to support them really really crazy ideas next bull market uh okay uh disclosure uh disclosures both Ryan and I are advisors to both optimism and ZK sync I'm a big fan of Tech Stacks I'm a big fan of biomimicry there's a there's a video uh if you want to learn more about just the nature of tech Stacks the op Stack video on YouTube from bankless just type in op stack bankless uh it's the only video on YouTube that talks about the op stack oh really yeah you got that right David yeah the four thousand people have watched it hey but you can turn around the opportunity uh yeah so advisors to both optimism and ZK sync we also talked about swell earlier we also are Angel Investors into swell as well all right David I I'm feeling bold that's the bear Market what do I got to lose huh um down bad already make a prediction I think this is the year of the Bitcoin ETF spot Bitcoin ETF approval 2023 approval yeah okay I have I have this is just me going out on the limb here okay I have no knowledge of this but just putting some things together I feel like politically Gensler has to approve a Bitcoin ETF this is his kind of back pedaling moment to prove he is a generous God and he is not the unreasonable Tyrant that the finance and crypto industry paints him as so he'll give us this this gift the gift of Gensler and he'll approve an ETF also some of his buddies have been submitting lately I know you guys mentioned uh right and now now here we have Fidelity preparing to submit a Bitcoin ETF Fidelity knows what's up and they are doing the BlackRock play as well what's the what's the news here Fidelity is getting ready to submit their own spot Bitcoin ETF so Fidelity like I don't know how big it is but it's large uh joining the queue to get a Bitcoin ETF yes it's real big uh this is also not Fidelity's first attempt in 2021 they filed it was denied by the SEC uh and so like right after BlackRock uh Fidelity joins the queue and then interestingly Arc which Arc invest Kathy Wood they also have submitted a Bitcoin ETF request they haven't gotten theirs denied theirs is just sitting in purgatory limbo but they what here's what's interesting and here's how they are getting to the front of the queue and why like Arc might win this thing uh at least like when this thing is like they might get approved first because they're they had their spot Bitcoin ETF files paperwork filed first and they've amended their file work their 19B slash four first whatever that is for a spot Bitcoin ETF to include a surveillance sharing agreement with the SEC which is I mean words that came from the BlackRock uh Bitcoin ETF and someone gave them a heads up that they need this verbiage I think well well maybe someone gave them a heads up maybe they're just saying hey BlackRock is going to get approved and so let's make sure that if they get approved we also get approved and copy and paste their filing and make it look like our violing what is a surveillance sharing agreement it involves the sharing of information about market trading activity clearing activity and customer identification to protect against the possibility of Market manipulation if this is the thing that forces Gary gensler's hand to approve the BlackRock ETF or yeah ETF then therefore Arc will get theirs approved but Arc is still filed and so Arc will get approved first and so that's that's the Gambit that Arc is making not just Arc van Eck has also filed refiled for a spot Bitcoin ETF last week which also in includes the intent to add the surveillance sharing agreement so we have three large Trad players submitting all of the same spot Bitcoin ETF file paperwork yeah and this assumption is like Gary genser is either corrupt or going to approve it well look uh he's definitely correct Vanek is pretty large right yep uh 80 billion you know of course Kathy Wood Arc invest is pretty large okay you asked about Fidelity earlier guess what they are David uh large oh my God they're large four trillion trillion with a t okay and BlackRock is double that size oh my God that's between them they got all the assets like this is a tremendous amount of tradify Gary's buddies pressure that is raining down on him and you know Gary's posture has been like oh yeah big Bitcoin it's it's the only commodity there he hasn't been willing to extend that to any other asset oh yeah I forgot that he doesn't hate Bitcoin there you go that that's what I'm just putting together and that's why I'm uh making that uh prediction but what does this do for our bags that's the big question here what does this do for the price does does an ETF matter of course like I don't get super excited about it because it's not bankless and yet and yet it is a way to onboard retail and increase the liquidity of Bitcoin the asset so there are some good things about this what are we looking at from Melton and this is Melton Demers who I think is probably one of the most perfect people to really analyze some of this stuff so uh she the conversation is Bitcoin ETFs all over the place these are pipes we need money to actually flow through these pipes we can build the pipes but we need money to flow through them in order to material and materially impact the price of Bitcoin so Melton just you know puts on her analyst hat and asks where is that money going to come from uh and so she goes so financial institutions are building products and services to access Bitcoin but where where will the inflows come from in my opinion the biggest untapped market for Bitcoin is tax Advantage retirement accounts the United States retirement Market is 35 trillion dollars and has doubled in the last decade and so we have two circles here we have the total U.S retire retirement AUM 35 trillion dollars and then we have the amount that's allocated to crypto which is between 500 million and 1 billion dollars to say that these are two circles doesn't do Us justice the other is a spec one one is of taking up half the page and the other one is a period that is in the middle of the page it looks like the Sun versus the Earth yeah you've never seen this your life size yeah uh so a lot of room for growth here is what that means and that could be a positive influence of Bitcoin maybe that's why David Bitcoin prices uh been pumpy a little bit this week it's it's pumpy because the Traders are buying because they think this is going to happen but this is going to take a while at least that's my cope uh Milton this is a thread so we are just reading the first uh tweet of this red if you want to read further analysis from Elton yeah there's a link in the show notes to go access this treat but coming up next we're going to talk about microstrategy magically discovering hundreds of million dollars and then they turn it into Bitcoin of course uh there's some Zuki drama which I don't know if you care about Ryan I don't really care about it either deeply okay well we're talking about it binance claps back versus the SEC and then airdrop season for ethereum stakers man these are some fun words all of this and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible especially metamask brand new spiffy portfolio feature we all love metamaska now it can tell you everything about all of the things that you have in your metamask wallets we're going to go hear from them right now metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the best way to review your crypto portfolio from a holistic level

there's no consensus on Zeus versus F yes well there's no debate on that one it's okay Eddie Moore there's a shelling Point yeah what's the shelling Point around suzalu right Zuzu yeah uh or zuzulu there's no there's it's one of these two shelling points yeah okay uh do you remember when the background of my podcast was not my home in Brooklyn and it was instead this kind of sterile looking apartment boy do I ever internet connections lots of fun so I was in Montenegro for two months at this thing called zuzalu and if you scroll down you'll start to get a little bit of a taste of this it's a blog post on Bankers right yes so this this is a blog post on Bank list if you want to know and learn about everything that I'm doing I was doing at zuzalo and what zuzalo is this blog post is for you uh I like this line that I wrote uh vitalik from ethereum emad from stable diffusion and Grimes from Grimes all walk on a stage together from Grimes so Grimes the artist also has been previously associated with Elon yes correct and they all walk on a stage together and no this is not a punch line this was suzalu so this was the AI crypto week at Zoo's Aloo of there of which there were eight weeks there was longevity week there was synthetic biology week there was DK cryptography week there was public goods week Network States and coordinations and so this was this a social experiment of zuzalo like a two month long pop-up temporary Community where a bunch of Frontier Technologies came together uh and so that's like a cult David yeah they called it they called us a cult they called us a call like we didn't hate that that it was we thought it was funny um I recorded 18 interviews while I was there so not only am I telling you about it in this article about whether Zella was but I'm showing you with like 10 plus hours of content uh and just myself when you're talking in person well so okay this was me presenting web3 to the montenegrin government officials and so I had a 10 minute talk they say like 10 minutes uh and I I was elected to do the web 3 why web 3 pitch and right before my talk I was like okay you no longer have 10 minutes you have three minutes and I'm like nice and so I just started yelling dude in Squad stands in Squad stance yeah uh and so there was something like remembering about what the hell are all these like ethereum people and other industry people all doing at Zoo's Aloo or this place in Montenegro uh there was like this social contract of like Hey we're gonna all be heads down and focus on zuzelo and then we'll broadcast about it now we're broadcasting about it and so all of my content all the talks are now out you can read about zuzallo in this blog post it's at bankless.com uh and uh yes look guys look let me let me just um tell you the gift that David has just given us so if you can't go all the way to Montenegro or you were invited or whatever it was to it was too much David is giving a sneak peek to I think some of the best people best speakers the best ideas the best projects that came there and there's like a series of videos so in this post Alone David said you recorded 18. this post alone there's eight of them okay the first one's with vitalik no there's all talentine they're combined into the Eight Episodes so 18 so there's eight themes 18 episodes Consolidated into Eight Episodes each one of these is like almost two hours long this is a gift this is a gift uh so go click the link to show notes if you want some extra bankless content if you want some Frontier Tech content this is the place to get it um I can't wait to dive into these is there one I'm gonna I'm gonna start with the vitalik one but what's your what's your favorite after that oh God there's a handful so I have my favorites in each of them uh Primavera day Felipe and her definition of Cordy Nations I thought was really good uh drew enzy the the father of modern biology and synthetic bio in synthetic biology he's in that one I was walking with Drew uh he's like this older gentleman Stanford professor and he was like I've never really done a podcast but I've always wanted to this one guy Lex emailed me and I about doing a podcast but he wanted me to fly out to Austin so I didn't respond and I'm like bro you didn't respond to Lex Friedman man that's hilarious anyways I got him on uh on an interview uh and so so the idea here and this is the isuzalo pitch what how were these Technologies selected all of these Technologies are going to fundamentally change the future they're going to change society like longevity is going to happen people are going to have the choice to live forever synthetic biology we're going to be able to grow our materials organically that's going to change the world all of these are technological title waves that are going to impact your life bankless listener so there's all of this Zuzu content is for you to front run the opportunity for you to be ready for that tidal wave that is inevitably coming I feel like we're in the middle of the AI Title Wave in the future synthetic biology will hit us as a society like one of these one of these big ones hits like every five years yes yeah yeah you know and so so get ready so this this is just about understanding the technological tectonic shifts that are all being built uh and so with all of these contents you'll be prepared you don't have to enjoy every single one you can pick and choose your flavor it's a Choose Your Own Adventure um but they are at your disposal David is it airdrop season it is we tease that a little bit give it down we're proud to present the diva Dao pldr the diva Dao is being formed with an initial distribution to 15 000 unique ethereum stakers and ecosystem participants this is an eth staking protocol um pretty high in the decentralization Spectrum what's going on here yeah very strong commitments to ethereum uh values ethereum the ethereum protocol they want it to be built as a public good they want it to be built as immutable as possible uh one other thing that that excites me about uh diva is their commitment towards the DVT ecosystem decentralized validator technology AKA Squad staking and they've been working with uh people like the ethereum Staker group and and others as well the airdrop has gone to of course Diva OG contributors uh ethereum stakers from each Staker rocket pool SSV Lido and dap node community members from gnosis uniswap ens Ave maker Aragon and other dials and then the ethereum staking Dev and ecosystem contribute computers fifteen thousand addresses are eligible you can track your address at earnify earn I dot f i can go and plug in your address because we've got this Merkle tree built into earnify so it'll tell you and if you're already a member subscriber to earnify you already have your ethereum address there you probably already got an email address saying hey you have the new Diva airdrop and so that is in your inbox if you are a or defy subscriber if you're not you should 100 sign up there is a link in the show notes uh there is I listened to the diva Twitter space with superfizz this morning pretty impressed I mean everyone seems to really like what they're doing yeah super Fizz is a notable eat Staker he says I'm offering my services a diva staking delegate I am encouraged to see Diva soliciting input from the community I want to contribute my efforts to build another strong staking option I mean the whole idea is trying to decentralize staking a little bit more so I guess superfizz is signing up to be a diva um we always knew he was a diva did you mean to say that I mean isn't that's got to be the mean they're going with right oh the wasted opportunity if not from the Divas you want to be a Divas there you go uh disclosure to David and I are Angel Investors and Diva we think it's a pretty cool story I guess we're divas as well uh nft stuff azuki David I'm sure I'm sure oh wait you weren't biting your you weren't on the edge of your seat following the Suzuki drama no I I wasn't but I want you to tell me all about it so what cool things are happening in the nft space that's very cool things are happening I hate that I had to spend 30 minutes of my morning getting caught up about but you did though but I guess you took that for us okay so I saw some drama from azuki there's some sort of drop that um or some sort of mint that got some bad press what happened okay so azuki's like they're they're the anime pfp well like pretty high uh floor price it was like 13 14 15 eth before this Drop Like definitely a top ten project top five I think yeah like very very strong very very strong so they have been teasing this azuki Elementals uh drop mint and so the Elementals was a brand new project they have sometimes nft pfp projects they do further mints because my cynical take is like we need another idea let's do another mint I don't know so they said they had their uh the Genesis collection which are the azuki's and then beans which are one of these like pets things for zukis they're doing Zuki Elementals and so 20 000 nfts 10 000 of them were airdropped to azuki Holders during uh so already so 20 000 new nfts 10 000 azuki the the Genesis ones 10 000 of the new 20 000 Elementals were air dropped to azuki Holders the remaining 10 000 elementors will were sold out at two eacher to anyone that owned a azuki or a bean so being on the white list means you had to already be in the yazuki community so 38 million dollars was raised by the azukis from their Community wow yes so that's a big it's a very big number it's a very big number yes so they must be valuable uh so they were sold for two eth uh and then they were revealed and so the the metadata he didn't know what they didn't know what they were yes okay they were teased they they had there was like promo Graphics so people kind of knew what they were but they didn't yeah it's under wraps yes it's kind of the graphic okay so they were released and so on the left we have these are azuki's these are the Genesis collections these are the very very highly priced ones and then if you swap to the right these are the Elementals okay left here's the azuki's here are the Elementals okay let's go back to the azuki's and back to the Elementals this is this is Pam from The Office they're the same pitcher they're the same picture they're the same it's very similar they are the almost identical there's not much I mean there's like style there's there's not even stylistic changes it's just like it's marginally different properties okay go to the next one uh here's here's the meme that sums this up a bunch here's what one of the captures so like select all the images that are Elemental and it's just like you just don't know you don't know wait is there some like I guess there's a social contract that if you're releasing another 20 000 what they're releasing right pfps that there would be an entirely kind of different collection right rather than a clone of all of the attributes and everything else that you've previously done yeah is that whatever it's not a perfect clone like there are differences but you can't without deeply knowing if you're unless you're a nazuki expert they just look the [ __ ] same okay and so as a result of this the azuki Elementals minted at two are now trading below the two eathment the actual azuki Genesis went from 15th or 14th floor down to like 12. and so like market cap was lost they're not happy okay this is uh Jeff Morris I don't know who Jeff is but he says if any e-commerce site sold 38 million of merchandise in a pre-sale this would be headline news let's not forget that these digital products with these are digital products with Incredible margins for creators but nfts are dead is the popular narrative I guess that's the bull case that is the bull case that's what we uh it's an industry we're gonna beat our chess about it's like we made 38 million dollars of selling clones of I don't know can't adults buy what they want David yes they can well yes they can but they didn't know what they were they were like taking it on faith that the izuki team we're going to do something that wasn't dilutive of the Genesis I don't know anyways experts if you want to listen to if I'm sure Carly Riley has a much more informed take so listen to overpriced jpegs there you go uh but we are Bitcoin experts you just say that all right are we uh I know that this week microstrategy has acquired an additional twelve thousand three hundred thirty three Bitcoin for a grand total of 347 million dollars at an average price of 28k per Bitcoin is Sailor trying to own all the Bitcoin where does he get this money from his micro strategy that profitable I mean it's just kind of like um it's a it's a it used to be a business intelligence technology like software as a service used to be one of the leaders but it's not quite like market leader these days I don't know it's it's now become a Bitcoin hedge fund I guess or just a Bitcoin hold fun I should say okay uh we don't have this in the agenda so this is bitcoinetreas.net I'm reading just reading out some stats uh Michael Saylor microstrategy is in the green but they are up 1.03 X they are up three percent on their Bitcoin purchases their cost basis is 4.5 billion their current value is 4.66 billion do you know what's funny is for everyone making fun of him I've never been one of like I think it's fun I think it's funny that he's just using a publicly traded company to dollar cost average in and buy this thing I just think that's funny that you buy so consistently but I've always thought that this would pay off for him can I show you why David it's gonna work I'm gonna show you why yeah this is why this is that's why going back to the markets two greens and a red three Greens in a red three looking at this table and he's like okay if if I don't time things not just dollar cost average in where's it gonna leave me and uh I think the answer is he's gonna make money I I know you just said he if I don't time things but man did he time that poorly the last green before the red which is not where you want to start buying no but that's why you know uh you have to buy more that's the only solution to getting out of if you have a high uh cost basis you just keep buying until you lower that um anyway that's uh that that's that for Bitcoin what do we got here David this is the mstr price okay so this is just to round up this conversation microstrategy stock price yes uh so before all of the Bitcoin exposure before Michael Taylor engaged in Bitcoin Shenanigans with microstrategy microstrategy the asset the equity was trading at 130 today it is at drumroll 330 dollars oh okay so it's like almost 3x and like not only that but it hit over a thousand dollars during the bull market so like even shareholders shareholders who are like micro sailor what the hell are you doing to this company they can't be complaining microstrategy the equity has almost tripled no wonder he's getting all this money to buy Bitcoin it can't be the same shareholders that's a totally different investment profile you're like I'm buying a business intelligence software company versus like yeah now I'm buying Bitcoin basically I don't know like a publicly traded symbol yeah anyway uh kind of fun um David we said earlier there's pressure for Gensler to approve an ETF I think this is some of the reason why uh Christian Carlo was the former chair of the cftc he says this greetings from Tokyo where the headline in Japan time says exactly what I'm hearing here's the headline crypto tumult in U.S may be Boone for Japan Us's loss is Japan's gain Japan is moving pretty aggressively in a positive way towards regulating crypto David we saw um I believe uh Brian Armstrong threw this out um last time we talked to Brian Armstrong actually he was in Japan right so things are happening in Japan it's not just Japan uh HSBC Hong Kong now lets customers trade Bitcoin and ether ETFs what it's possible together nice in Hong Kong we can't have that product in the US it's too dangerous for retail uh the UK this just came out before we hit record crypto stablecoin rules receive Royal assent passing into law okay the the financial services markets Act of the 2023 this is in the UK classifies crypto as a regulated Financial activity and uh King Charles just gave his approval on that I guess that's what happens oh thank God the final final blessing from the King and so the king said yes and uh what's the US doing in the backdrop of this right these other countries these other like other nations other geograph geographies are competing against the United States for crypto and so they're rolling out sensible regulatory Frameworks and they're trying to win that business over what's your take here uh the US is just fumbling what is the US doing we're fumbling I mean hey like us has been in the lead for a long time well I guess it's innovators dilemma this is always what happens isn't it well I think it's fair just you know it's really nice of us to really just see the first place to the rest of the world it's so stupid it's so generous of us to help I I think this is another example of like I I just feel like our the people who are governing the United States right now are just not making long-term decisions yeah I mean this is not this is not good for the US um but good for these other jurisdictions meanwhile binance is doing some things to push back against that SEC what is this David Finance claps backs this is a meta law man who goes and says binance has gone on the offensive against the SEC in the federal court case accusing the SEC of violating court rules by making statements outside of the court that are false designed to harm the Finance U.S customers and to taint the jury pool so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so after uh entry of an order agreed to by the parties binus argues that the SEC issued a misleading press release claiming that binance had secured emergency relief that CZ had CZ had commingled and diverted customer assets and three that the order was essential to protecting investor assets and when questioned by the judge repeatedly SEC attorneys were unable to point to any evidence that CZ had diverted or co-main gold customer assets so the binance is accusing the SEC of saying public statements that are untrue and are tainting the image and branding of binance that would go against them in court especially in front of a jury and so far apparently allegedly according to medallamian and others that binance's side of this are is looking pretty good it's a pretty strong case yeah uh well that is that it that contributes to some of the pressure I think Gensler is feeling right now and maybe part of the reason yeah well think about this just like The Branding of accused accusations of unethical conduct coming from these lawyers that will like the idea is that that will reverberate in the halls of the SEC and the image of the secs like SEC gets in trouble in the United States court for unethical conduct and then all the crypto people are like hey Gary Gensler is being unethical and bad and mean to us all of a sudden it totally legitimizes the entire crypto Industries takes about Gary Gensler well this is pretty big like a regular a regulator cannot you lose its credible neutrality or or else it loses its legitimacy right and so I I listened to that I got caught up on the podcast that you recorded while I was out with um fantastic and he basically said hey Regulators are are kind of serious people they know they have a reputation at least most of them and they can't be seen to pick winners and losers so if the SEC approves um black rocks ETF submission because you know against our goes fishing with Larry Fink or something like that right and that comes out and they say no to fanach and they say no to the other for just reasons that don't make sense that is incredibly serious according to to Austin in your episode with him and it's not a light matter and this is kind of what binance is alleging that well I guess uh Gary is picking losers and it's the entire crypto industry uh and targeting uh targeting binance is the allegation here so we'll see what the we'll see what the judge says we'll see what the jury says in this case up next creditors are seeking block fi liquidation and accusing the CEO Zach Prince of Fraud and extortion damn those are some big words okay so creditors of block five have filed to liquidate the company's estate accusing deck Prince of fraud dishonesty incompetence or gross mismanagement and delaying bankruptcy proceedings so the Creditor said that it was it's time to end the extortion tactics and adding that it is time for debtors unsecured creditors to finally know what blockfly truly was who Zach Prince truly is how much he personally profited from the company and what he and certain of his colleagues were doing when no one was watching oof and then the context here is that with no Revenue coming into the company and with the company having compounding losses creditors argue that the case should proceed as a liquidation criticizing blockwise at administrative costs including the salaries for over a hundred individuals who quote have nothing to do have nothing better to do but work on their golf game oof arguing that the debtors are intentionally burning an average of more than 16 million dollars per month merely to Art augment defensive positions for historical management basically saying okay the creditors who are owed block block buys money and saying hey block fight is burning all this Capital to just argue for their retroactive decisions and it's not doing anything for the benefit of people who are owed money so let's liquidate the damn thing is that is dirty that's right for two years two years ago at this time block five was one of the um one of kryptos you know Darlings uh wow um I'm glad that they're seeing their day in court I just I'm gonna kick someone while while it's down so I'm sorry about that but this is laser-eyed bitcoiners version of D5 that they just like beated their drone like we don't need D5 we have block fi and then like literally the worst example of what a centralized Authority can do is what it was yeah um would have been safer to keep it in smart contracts I would say um David we got some big things we're releasing on Bank list this week what are we looking at here we now have a team at bankless whose job it is to go out and find as many cool perks for bankless Citizens as possible so we have this leaderboard this tally Board of how much value can we can provide to bankless Citizens we are now up to 1200 197 dollars of value for a bankless citizen membership so you get a 25 discount to Nason for a month one month of free usage of quick node 12 months of free access to Zengo MPC wallet 15 discount for crypto tax calculator 30 off of permissionless tickets and more and more and more and there's only going to be more this is our job we're going to make that number which is again currently hold us to this twelve hundred ninety seven dollars the value number go up number go up I want ten thousand dollars baby one day one day uh so this is all the value that you get as a bankless citizen uh and there are people in the Discord saying hey we want this and then we go send our our Hunters out to go get some of that but almost thirteen hundred dollars and it's 17.50 a month right that's that's that's what we call Roi right there right that's what the perks page is set up to do David there's more going on in the bank list yes we got more what is this I do not know French so Tuesday July 18th if you are a bankless citizen we are having our ECC Meetup up this is Meetup number two number one was at East Denver it was a raging success we had free beers because it was Denver and we love beer in Denver uh in France we love Cocktails so it is a cozy little cocktail bar uh so citizens only for a nice event with all of the bankless HQ member team members who are going to be there Tuesday July 18th uh so if you're a bankless citizen let us know and we will get you invited okay so funny story about this picture we're looking at my wife actually texted me last night while I was on on the train from uh from New York uh come back home and she's like what is this picture of you you look you look like Hitler I was like what no it doesn't have and this the mustaches is not at all right that's not a Hitler's stash at all yeah um it deeply offended but yeah it is this is a massive rug though because you will not be there all right David what's coming up next coming up next we got some questions from the nation followed up by the takes of the week followed up what David and Ryan are bullish on and of course the meme of the week this one the meme of the week has me and Ryan in it so we're going to talk about all of this and more but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum one producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social adapts like Reddit are also now calling arbitrim home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with the arboretum's recent migration to arborstone Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arboretum.io where you can join the community dive into the develop docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free if you haven't experienced the superpowers that a smart contract wallet gives you check out ambuyer ambuyer works with all the evm chains that are out there the layer 2 is like Arboretum optimism and polygon but also the non-etherium chains like Avalanche and Phantom because of the power of smart contract wallets and buyer lets you pay for gas in stable claims meaning you'll never have to spend your precious eth again the web app has numerous Fiat on-ramps to make it easy to dump your Fiat for crypto and if you like self-custody but you still want training wheels you can recover a lost and buyer wallet using an email and password but without giving the ambier team any control over your funds check it out at amber.com for the web app experience but also the ambier mobile wall is coming soon for both IOS and Android and if you want to be a beta tester you can sign up at ambuyer.com app and since you stayed to the very end of this ad read you should know that Amber is airdrawing its wallet token to early users for simply just using the wallet so if you want to get started with ambier all the links that you need are in the show notes question this week from Nick AKA sheep Roy Jenkins what happens to eth and eth L2 price if we head towards a future where anyone can make a blockchain quickly and cheaply for themselves or their companies interesting question so we have all of this excess block space we're just talking about that earlier in the episode what happens to eat price what happens to L2 price when we have all of this additional block space it becomes incredibly cheap what do you think David do you think in the phrasing of this question that it's actually the uh implication is that what how why are these things ether and ether Layer Two tokens why are these things valuable at all when anyone can make a blockchain quickly and cheaply is that the tone of the question is it like what what happens when these things are such a commodity that it's just free and cheap and easy to build a blockchain that's kind of the nature of the questions I think I think that yes and I think that the wider context of this type of the question is hey we're going through a massive Paradigm Shift of the the transaction volume and the traffic is going to be on layer twos moving forward we're going to have a lot of layer twos and it's going to be abundant so what what happens to the price of eth or even the price of layer 2 tokens when no one is actually transacting on ether like how they're transacting other places so I do think that's part of the context yeah Okay so I understand the intuition of just like Hey we're going to get 10 000 chains gas is going to be free uh there's gonna be so much block space that we're not gonna be able to fill it all what happens to Ether and and Layer Two prices when fees just like basically drop to zero layer one phase won't drop to zero there will always be a basal level of demand to transact on the ethereum layer one in fact I kind of think that like layer for one fees are not going not going down like the lowest that we see them is like 20 gray on average like 20 to 50 Gray I think is like the lowest it's going to be like they're in induce demand will manifest on the layer twos but man like at some point in time like we can talk about the economics of chains all we want and how about does that capture value how much value does that capture uh if it captures too much value won't we just spin up new chains at some point it's just mimetic if there's 10 000 op stack chains or 10 000 ZK stack chains those tokens are going to be valuable like just by nature of just the standard being adopted like the we can we always try and like here's a formula for understanding like ether like sure but it's just it's just so memetic and temporal and people don't understand these things they just buy uh and so the my intuition is like more chains means number go up more chains means more economic activity on ether people are going to associate economic activity on ether with ether price on ethereum with ether price and so I think when the idea of what what happens when anyone can make a blockchain trick quickly and cheaply for themselves and their companies if if it's easy if it's a commodity to build and add your chain to the 10 000 chains that are going on ethereum in the next five years the shelling Point becomes ether or the layer 2's Tech stack standard that that is built upon and so just think about the shelling point and think about the adoption of the technology if the selling point grows and it's like this one particular standard is the new way we deploy chains whatever token that is associated that with that is going to go up not be not become commoditized that's my answer yeah I think that's a good answer David I you know I guess I would add a few things the mental model of what you're investing in I think is you're investing in an emerging growing economy sort of what you're investing in um I think that ether in a world where there are many layer 2 Chains ether cements itself even further as a money in a store value a unit of account a medium of exchange for all of the layer twos so ether it appears to me like is in pretty good shape one other thing I would add to this is um the question was what happens to ethernet price when we head toward his future and anyone can make a blockchain quickly actually I would say we're already we've been in that future for a long time anybody can make a blockchain quickly it's just a side chain you know what I mean like it's um it's very easy to spin up a cosmos chain right now like it couldn't be more simple um that doesn't mean that the sidechain is more valuable so we're entering a world where now anybody can make an a blockchain that is secured by ethereum that is going to be net additive and net good to the ethereum uh ecosystem and and to either the asset even more than obviously much more than side chains uh everywhere so you've got that working in your favor um I also think that we're probably going to move to a world where a lot of these assets eat included but particularly Layer Two assets are valued based on um the price people are willing to pay for transaction ordering right an Mev and so that will probably be kind of the the non-monetary value bazel unit of uh of utility in a distance in addition to the you know kind of the gas demand and the demand to get your transaction into the block remember Mev is going to be a huge driver of value here so all in all feels pretty good I guess the last thing I'd say is um I think you're right David when you say the more users you get the more attention that comes to your ecosystem and on your asset so if I'm using the polygon ecosystem I'm going to be warming up to Matic right and so the next time I see Matic oh it's probably chain I uh polygon I use polygon right I might probably be more likely to buy a hit that buy button on Matic and so that that also has uh not necessarily a fundamental uh kind of a like doesn't affect the the asset price you know that's at fundamentals but it does increase the asset value more users is is good and it's hard to deny that so I guess the answer is uh number goes UPS number number goes up so there you go Nick uh David we got some takes of the week first one from Tyler what's this look like oh man this one resonated with me Tyler Reynolds says truth does not mind being questioned a lie does not like being challenged boy I wish I do I wish I had read this tweet and like why truth does not mind being questioned remember when we had the Terra Lunas is Terra Luna a ticking Time Bomb uh thumbnail and episode title and then every single Terra lunatic came in it was like you guys are just a bunch of dumb means in our in the YouTube comments yeah yeah it's like man I wish I had this as like a mental model to like lean back on it's like hey if I'm just like perhaps voicing a critique and I'm getting a torrent of toxicity my way it's because truth a very bad sign it's a very bad sign it's coming from a place of insecurity and so I think this is something just like hey if you are giving out legitimate takes and you're getting toxicity in return maybe you should look at why those reasons are toxic in the first place uh David I've got to take for you yeah you do um I think I'm ready to capitulate all right so uh price eth price about this time last year was just like dipping it into three-digit territory I think it dipped like twice right one for like a period of days or something and then there was another brief like down around this time ever since then I have been thinking we would get back to Triple digit yeah and there's a period of time where it was like you know training 1100s 1200s I was like okay well you know what it's gonna kick in the apathy Market's gonna kick in right and people are gonna be like uh why do like I'm I'm getting restless I'm gonna sell my my ether and we'll see you dip down to Triple digit eth and then you know what we saw so we saw FTX absolutely explode and eat did not dip down didn't even break during that event yeah into triple digit territory and I I remember telling you David it's like you're like uh you know like you buying big gear I was like yeah I'm still waiting for triple digit eth all right I'm ready to capitulate on that I don't think we'll see Triple digit eth again I don't think it'll happen the bear Market's over all right maybe I'm just tempting the crypto Gods because if it does hit Triple digits I'm backing that truck up but um FDX couldn't do it the bank crisis that we saw in the first quarter of this year couldn't do it not only could not do it I mean it was bullish apathy Market can't do it so at this point I feel ready to capitulate and uh you might have won that one David is that is that you this is David Hoffman replying to my tweet man that's a lot of words just to say David was right oh that's great now you're nice to me this week my flight was canceled and I had a place to go work yeah that's true that was fun uh what do we got here uh okay uh so this oh that speaking of which Speaking of which yeah that's you okay so I took this we took the screenshot because we were about to record a podcast with Rob Paul and so I was like this is hilarious let me take a screen capture of this and I'll post it and like even people in our company was like that's a doctored photograph Ryan's Ryan's faking that photo he's not actually in David's apartment and then this is Michael Wong's meme who's this is just a deep nostalgic Millennial meme of Jimmy Neutron and uh Timmy Turner from uh nickolo Cartoon Network oh I'm failing as a millennial anyways it's a crossover episode where where Timmy Turner and and uh Jimmy Neutron are Illustrated like each other God I'm butchering this anyways I thought it was funny yeah it was great to appear in the flesh we got three episodes never never would I thought possible yeah in person in person so we did you uh one thing I learned is actually you don't drink as much coffee as I thought that you did oh did I disappoint you yeah I do when I like so I make like at least a plot at home and I'll make a second pot in the afternoon I'm guzzling all morning but um I didn't want it like because I had coffee in the mornings I was bringing to your place I could get that I didn't want like to make you do coffee all day you make it by the cup don't you yeah I have a little espresso machine I'm not gonna let me tell you people who use it fetch my coffee all day people who have espresso machines love making espresso I'll tell you this there's a little process of like to make me more coffee yeah like yeah it's like because because like you went like oh this one's kind of acidic it's like oh I need I need that feedback so I can improve my coffee coffee making style I'm not gonna come over here it is a privilege to be made coffee by David Hoffman let me tell you well that's true I enjoyed that privilege it's a fantastic coffee I'm back to my old like you know just drip pot coffee and uh pour over in a paper filter inside of the Chemex no dude I don't even do that I'm just like push the button drip coffee I I grind my beans at least I do that but then I just push the button yeah okay it's drip that's how primitive I am so it's pretty primitive bro yeah so uh and when I'm going to the mountains this is my last weekly roll up for two weeks by the way so you and Anthony are coming up okay is this is this okay is this what you're bullish on by the way when we get to that right like because you're climbing three mountains three three mountains two mountains over the next uh 10 days but the point why this is connects to coffee is I'm I'm bringing freshly ground coffee in my aero press you know if Bank location if you don't know what an Aeropress is yeah and so like I'm gonna have my lovely coffee out at like 12 000 feet up yeah it makes great coffee like in fact I think it's some of the best coffee I've had uh yours not withstand standing my friend actually can I just pull up this tweet because I saw this this came up in my feed yesterday seven days until Bakers 12 days until uh Raynor is did I say that right Rainier you did not right near yeah Rainier uh 32 days until Matterhorn these are the mountains you're climbing yeah what's this one that one's Rainier that okay that one's special because I grew up in Seattle and so I would you can see that one from Seattle and so I would look at that mountain like almost every single day of my life and now I get to go climb it and you're doing that you're starting that next week right yes uh tomorrow I leave for Seattle gonna go hang out with my nephew and family for five days hang out with them for the fourth and then Wednesday at 6 30 a.m there's a gear check to make sure I brought all the right gear so I don't die and then we go to Baker wow David yeah I'm actually like I I go to bed like lately lately and I'm like I'm kind of stressed I'm sitting in bed I'm like oh man first one looks daunting to me and then they just get harder yeah bro look at that what is that are you saying that's not a very good picture of the Matterhorn but yes the the okay so Baker and Rainier is nice because if you like if you fall you just get back up like you just fall in snow on the Matterhorn you no you can't fall okay on behalf of the entire Bank list Nation just come back okay like just like I pay money to make two guides to make sure I come back it's it's somebody's job to make sure I come back and it's not me wow that that is somewhat comforting you're doing some training going into this too oh I've dude I spent six and a half hours on the treadmill uh stair stepper last weekend that was my weekend all right all right well be safe I'll be safe pretty bullish on I'm bullish on Frontier Technologies yeah and so throwing it throwing it back to Zoo's aloe content if you don't watch any if you only watch one bit of zuzalu content make it the intro and perhaps also the full interview of uh so like yeah I spend but I write like a there's like a video essay of me giving you the account of zuzalu the significance of it what it is and what my biggest takeaways so if you want to just like get these quickest tldr watch the vitalik interview or just the 10 minutes of like my video essay at the very beginning and that will give you everything that you need to know I was like I was listening to it because I hadn't uh listened to it in a while and I was like okay yes this came out the way that I wanted it to uh and so I'm I'm just bullish on Frontier Technologies what are Frontier Technologies like AI longevity decentralized science synthetic biology um you know public goods ZK cryptography and the the line that I give is like ethereum is the eldest most mature sibling of a bunch of Frontier Technologies it grew up sooner than the rest of them AI is now coming of age these other Frontier Technologies are still trying to figure out how to stand up so ethereum is like the eldest sibling that's like alone in this room fighting with its parents like The Regulators the the nation-states and it doesn't have any like other Frontier Technologies to support it because it's alone but all of those Frontier Technologies like AI longevity synthetic biology Network States they're not they're also going to need support from their siblings because the incumbents aren't going to accept them and then legitimize them so well I was reflecting on this too it's like some of the challenges that we've seen in crypto I mean you look at AI right now same time Regulators what do you get what are Regulators gonna do what is the right regulatory posture and then there's also some critiques of you know the the AI companies right now the big ones engaging in regulatory capture right it's a problem crypto has as well how do we make sure the big centralized as service providers or Banks don't completely own this thing regulatory capture it's like a similar set of concerns and um yeah crypto has been on the Forefront of that so AI is I guess is going to face them as well yeah so that's what I'm bullish on Frontier Technologies Ryan what are you bullish on uh Roll-Ups man there's been like a roll-up explosion um I feel like in terms of infrastructure we get cheap block space here so we had the announcement of zk6 ZK stack of course and it just seems like every roll up has a has a strategy here so ZK stack op stack polygon arbitrum I'm just looking forward to a world when we have cheap bandwidth transaction bandwidth and anybody can spin up their own chain is it kind of like the days of the internet where anybody could spin up their own blog or anybody could spin up their own server and host their own website I think it's going to unleash a massive wave of of innovation that again we still need the apps we can't we can't see those yet but now we have cheap block space and I think we're gonna live in a world of of many many chains you know thousands tens of thousands of of change I'm just excited about all of the work that's getting done in in the build Market as we've called it you know what I'm excited about what all of the layer two thesis that we didn't exactly become in as a as a podcast as like a media platform wasn't accepted in 2021 because it was all about the outlayer ones what is showing strength in the bear Market there twos they're twos and that to me is signal if you can show strength in a bear Market what do you think you can do in a bull market uh and so that's what that's what gets me excited and it's so hard to get Traction in the bear Market is what you're saying I think the communities that survive will Thrive yes in the next right bull cycle which is happening when starting out uh we are in Schrodinger's market now okay next year is the bull market it's scheduled good book I scheduled it full circle it's on my calendar it's my new calendar no mountain climbing next year David oh no I don't want to hear that yeah Mountain climbed during the bear works yeah that's right all right ready for meme of the week yeah meme of the week what are we looking at here we go this doesn't exactly meme but this is funny I thought it was funny so okay so Ryan was co-working at my place in Brooklyn and so he was over there just like in my kitchen counter Island thing and instead of like turning around and speaking to me he would just send me messages in Discord you're like hey what do you think about this it look it has the context you know you had your headphones in I didn't want to disrupt you that's how we always speak I'm not used to actually talking to you personally the one time you can just turn around and like speak words you're like not Discord bro thanks for the coffee though it was fun guys we'll end with this of course gotta let you know none of this has been Financial advice it never is on Bank lists it's not even Frontier technology advice so David got gave us a lot of content from suzala this week crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the Bangles Journey thanks a lot [Music] thank you [Music]
