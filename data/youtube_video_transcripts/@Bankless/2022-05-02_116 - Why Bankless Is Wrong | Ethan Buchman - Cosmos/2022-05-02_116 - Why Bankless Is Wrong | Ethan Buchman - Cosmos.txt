let's answer this question for us if you could why is bankless wrong about just about everything welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless all right guys special podcast episode for you today you've been listening to bank list for a while probably and that's good but are you in a silo of information where is the bankless thesis actually wrong is the question we posed today we brought on someone who shares many of the same values that we do at bank list but has an alternate view of how to get there a few things that we talk about today as ethan buckman tells us why we're wrong number one are we gonna live in a many chain future or a few power law winning chain future number two can a chain win without actually being money bangles doesn't think so ethan seems to number three uh ethereum shared security we can have that model of the world or an app chain model that's what cosmos is driving towards and what are the trade-offs of both and fourthly i think this is the big question of the episode what is the best way to build this crypto world without turning it into a dystopia either an anarchy dystopia or an empire dystopia that was the setting for the conversation david what were some of your thoughts uh as listeners go into this episode yeah ethan does the same thing that we do where we look towards history and extrapolate models and lessons from history into the future for crypto networks so it's interesting when we are we're both watching the same story we're both looking at the same data but we interpret this data differently as it relates to the future of crypto networks uh so you know ethan sees a world of city states and says like oh the the future of of crypto will be a bunch of app chains city state like app chains and ryan you and i we see a world of nation states and and empires that have come to dominate the globe and we think that that means that the future of crypto will be dominated by a few chains that can uh create just a network of networks because that's what an empire is it's a network of networks empire is kind of like the wrong word uh it's got a negative connotation we talk about that in the show but basically listeners in their heads should be thinking about just what is the long-term equilibrium of the topology of networks is this going to be a concentric circle model where network effects begets network effects capital begins capital liquidity gets liquidity and all these find a center gravitational pull to a center point or will there be pockets of value all over this this topology some big some small but no one real center point that is kind of the meta question being asked here and so ethan uh like i said just does a fantastic job of also looking the history uh looking towards previous governance structures previous pockets of value in the world uh and tries to extrapolate these things out into the future uh really good episode really good episode ryan yeah i think the the reason this is relevant for everyone is because uh you gotta kind of place your bets right place your bets as a builder place your bets as an investor place your bets as someone on the bankless journey as to which of these visions is more true and probably the truth is it's going to be somewhat in the middle there's elements of truth to both of these ideas but um i do think one will win out over the other in time so we get into all of this we're going to get right into the conversation with ethan buckman but first i want to tell you about these awesome tools for going bankless if you're trying to grow

ethan buckman he is a fantastic human being he's also an internet biophysicist which is kind of cool a monetary localist that's from his twitter profile and the co-founder of the cosmos ecosystem as well as the president of the interchain foundation ethan thanks for joining us we're going to talk about city states versus empires today and i think this is going to be fun it's great to have you on man thanks so much for having me yeah it's good to be here so i want to set the context uh for listeners here i um i think the goal of this conversation is not necessarily to like have you change our minds or for us to change your mind right that would be over ambitious we're not going to accomplish anything like that in the podcast i think the goal is really understanding so we want to thoroughly understand your perspective how you see this this whole blockchain thing uh shape shaking out because i know many of our core values the reasons that we're in crypto are the same but you have a different vision for the future than probably bankless does and let me just go i hope this goes without saying uh we bankless have have a tremendous amount of respect for everything that you guys have built in the cosmo ecosystem we think it's net accretive it's added a lot of value uh to crypto and we're aligned on on so many of the values um that that we both share but with that said let's dive right into the question at hand so um this is kind of the the title of this episode but i think it's probably something that you believe maybe it's a bit tongue-in-cheek but let's answer this question for us if you could why is bankless wrong about just about everything ethan all right well well thanks for that i mean let me say um you know um uh i think we do probably have a lot in common and obviously we're coming from from similar places and uh you know i think the the starting from the title of the show bankless like you know we obviously agree there's um a lot fundamentally wrong with the banking system and that's why so many of us you know so many of us are here and and i think you guys do a great job of like exploring exploring the space there's a lot of good um you know good technical and philosophical content on the show so i'm happy to to be here and be able to add to that i think at the end you know what it really comes down to you know and claiming you guys are basically wrong about everything that's just you know twitter diplomacy um so here we have some podcast diplomacy which allows us to be a little bit more nuanced yeah we're trying to hype the views here um so you know i think uh i i think it's really a matter of emphasis and you know i've seen um you know on the show and in some writings a lot of focus on things like okay going bankless uh things like monetary premium things like um uh you know this empire model and uh and what's another one defy right uh and and what i prefer is to emphasize um something a little bit different for each of those things right so rather than bankless i would rather think about being co-op full uh rather than monetary premium i would rather think about monetary clearing rather than empires i prefer to think about city-states and rather than decentralize finance i prefer to think about regenerative and or collaborative finance right so it's it's a little bit of a shift in in emphasis um it's not so much that you're wrong about everything per se it's just that maybe uh maybe you're incomplete or you know maybe we're not going far enough and so you know we can unpack all those things and and talk about um what they mean and yeah and ethan just to set the stage and put an image into our listeners heads i think a great way to uh frame this context is or a conversation is to how we differ on what the whole like network topology of crypto networks looks like i think the bankless thesis is that there's general some sort of center there's some sort of like epicenter there's some sort of gravitational center to the industry uh and that's kind of summarized in the concept that liquidity begets liquidity capital big i guess capital network effects begets network effects and at some point there's this concentric circles that all come to a convergence point and that is a little bit illustration of like the empire model where uh one center blockchain with many many layer twos kind of feels like all all roads lead to rome right all layer twos lead back to the layer one uh and that's kind of our model for for the topology of network effects it's concentric circles with a focal point uh and so do you like this like topology uh illustration and if you had to illustrate what the topology of networks looks like at maturity how would it look in your brain yeah i think it's uh it's it's definitely multiscaler and i i think there are hierarchies uh you know necessary hierarchies within it uh i don't know that there's one thing at the root i think there will probably be a few at least um and and i'm happy for you know ethereum to be up there i certainly think they're you know i'm long bitcoin and and ether uh adam of course but um you know so i think i think there's room for for a few things at the root and that they do they do serve different purposes and you know there certainly could be more um but what's most important to me is you know when we use this analogy of empires like they're they're they're critical issues in the world with sort of how we've structured society and and using a model of domination and oppression as like the way we want to structure how we're how we're building next to address these critical issues uh it doesn't seem like like the best approach and and maybe there are aspects to it that are you know you talk about capital but gets capital liquidity against liquidity there are there's certainly uh there's certainly truth to this but i question whether it's um whether it's right or whether it's always good or what what generates that and and and the challenge for me with the kind of empire model is one of representation of of stakeholders and of information in the structure uh of the empire in the state machine of the empire we could say right and and the sort of broader you go and the bigger you go um the less able you are to represent the actual needs and interests and values of human beings on the ground and of um and of nature in some sense and so you know the cosmos thesis has really been that it's really you know this technology we've built is really important it's really important to have these big bad public blockchains that are you know dedicated to the pursuit of like a small set of ideals like you know bitcoin and ether let's say or ethereum but it's also extremely important to move this thing forward that we develop software and technology that makes it easy for every community to have their own uh computer essentially right so i think about this as like the community computer revolution and and what i hear you know about empires and blockchains that are supposed to be empires it's like talking about mainframes right it sounds like some ibm exec in the 40s that's like nobody needs a personal computer uh we just need like you know one or a couple mainframes uh and they can run in ibm's basement and okay we can compete with dell or whoever mainframe and and that's it and all the world's you know compute needs can be kind of based on that or derived from that and obviously that's ridiculous that's not what um that's not what happened it's certainly what a lot of people thought back in the day you know that we'd never need more than i don't know a few hundred kilobytes of ram or that no one would have devices in their pocket or or at home and and instead these forces of of sovereignty and interoperability took hold over the structure of the internet and the evolution of computing in that now we have you know billions of devices everyone has their own computer they're sovereign over it they can i mean maybe not as sovereign as we'd like in in a variety of important ways but um you know they can install whatever software they want generally speaking they can swap out pieces of hardware they can decide who to connect to and and and so on what programs they run and yet they're still all interoperable with each other and and you know that was the kind of personal computer revolution connected up over the internet and what i think cosmos is about is really bringing the community computer revolution to light so that every community can develop um its own computer that represents their values their needs uh and and their interests and is still interoperable with all the others and you know the sort of empire model of security it may have a role to play in that uh but i'm not sure the empire analogy is is is the best one for it i sort of prefer i prefer ecological um analogies and and i look at um you know the cycles uh that we depend on right the the sunlight the water cycle nitrogen cycle things like that right and so i would sort of look at these um maybe some of these root block chains like like bitcoin and and ethereum maybe as more akin to you know sunlight and um and the water cycle or something like that in the scheme of of life and you know ecological blockchain systems that they're trying to develop rather than you know empires that are going to go dominate the whole world and and secure everyone with their armies and you know force you to pay rent yeah and certainly the the empire metaphor breaks down at some point uh there's a much huge difference between the actual physical empires of history and uh using that model to ex uh understand crypto networks all these crypto networks are inherently opt in which has a huge check on the network themselves but from what i think i've gathered from you is like rather than just like the concentric circles model where there's something at the at the focal point they're just like pockets just pockets of value all around this like you know uh landscape uh and some are big some are small some are very big some are tiny and then there's like this connective tissue this like fabric that interweaves all of these things is that is that like the right illustration to put in listeners heads that's right yeah it's a more emergent topology um and you know the best place to see this actually emerging is on mapazones.com where you can actually see the different cosmos blockchains and see their connections with each other and no one you know no one conspired to uh to construct that topology it's fully emergent and each chain chooses who it wants to connect to and you know right now there's like i don't know 45 chains on there um and you know someday there will be hundreds if not if not thousands or you know millions or if celestia has its way billions so um uh yeah so that's uh i think that that's really important yeah that's really cool and uh we'll include a link to uh to that website in the show notes so people can get a flavor but um you're essentially talking about cosmos has always talked about this world of many chains mother many interoperable almost like you know in kind of the ethereum world you call these a whole bunch of side chains where app chains has been or city states is maybe the the the analog um we'll talk about some of that and some of the maybe the pushback from bankless but first we want to understand it fully so you mentioned four things uh as well that you believe rather than kind of the the main bankless thesis and the first thing you said is rather than think about bankless you you think about co-optful what does that mean co-op like cooperatives right um so uh i think the the the history of banking and the problem with banks are in a deep way actually tied up with problems with with corporate structure and corporate governance and shareholder primacy and and all these kinds of things um and i think uh you know the the structure of capitalism owes a lot to its you know the challenges with it it's not just about the banks it's also about our corporations and our corporate structures and you know just uh just getting rid of the banks but keeping all the all the sort of corporate structuring um might not solve our our problems as deeply and i think you know banks in in a certain way they're they're there to play an important role obviously they've gone you know completely um completely off the cliff and and are not actually serving people the way uh you know a healthy system system might but you know big a big part of that is um is the nature of corporations and and the sort of shareholder primacy and so what i'm especially interested in addressing some of these issues are cooperatives and in particular worker cooperatives right uh where they very directly within the you know within the state machine of the organization of the corporation represent directly the interest the ownership rights the governance rights of the workers right and if we just go bankless and we don't actually fix corporate structures and roll out cooperatives um then i think uh i i think we won't actually achieve our aims and we'll have all kinds of you know various various perversions and so so for instance our our company i think you might have missed this in the intro i'm also the ceo of informal systems which is structured as a workers cooperative right so every every member of the of the company um every employee is a is a uh one-person one-vote owner you know uh uh member and and we're sort of starting to explore this with dows and stuff in in the crypto ecosystem but there's still very much you know uh token voting going on there and i expect we'll talk about token voting a little bit later in sort of critiques of you know cosmos proof of stake which is you know totally valid but um so i so i think there's an emphasis you know distinction there on not just going bank list but also going co-op full and there are banks that are structured as co-ops they're they're consumer co-ops they're called credit unions right and so you know we can do a lot to go you know to push back against the big banks by supporting our local credit unions right um and i think they have an important role to play and we should be looking at how our technology you know can actually help them and and people love their credit unions i mean they're there to serve their members right um they're not there to screw you they're not there to siphon out profits to some foreign shareholders um they are you know they are they are really there for for for membership and that's the kind of way we should be thinking about things not just in this like oh self-sovereign opt-out screw the banks you know you know have a swiss bank account in your pocket kind of thing but more like okay how do we reconstitute something in a um you know more positive looking uh you know so rather than bankless co-op full that's cool that's cool so so we're seeing a distinction and distinction and emphasis because bankless would certainly agree with the the vision of more co-ops but but our emphasis you're right ethan is um on not needing governance system not needing banks at all whereas maybe your emphasis is let's turn the existing banking services into co-ops where individuals in a community might own it our emphasis is a bit more like uh be your own bank like if we have something like uniswap then we don't actually need an intermediary at all whether it's a co-op like governance governance less is better than having some element of governance i do agree with you though like um credit unions are better than banks so um our first business account we actually got kicked out of bank of america okay because we had a crypto transaction from coinbase to like our uh bank of america so they booted us they sent us a dear john letter and so where where are we banking now because uh you know show secret bankless cannot actually be fully bankless right now we have real world bills to pay so we get our services from a credit union they've not they almost kicked us out last week but they didn't so uh we are still bank to the credit union credit unions uh serve our needs so we are believers in in the the co-op vision but those are that's expressed a bit more on the dow level ideally under that level is our governanceless protocols that don't even have a co-op member vote model because humans are fickle and prone to like uh plutocracy and so if you can remove all of the governance styles from the system that's a little bit better how would you react to that do you see that distinction yeah i mean i i i see it obviously there are there are vowel you know there is value in um you know governance minimization at certain layers but not at every layer and i think um you know humans are inherently political animals um and and and it's important to give voice to that right and it's not just about exit it's also about voice and and obviously about loyalty um and and and we need our systems to actually be able to represent that kind of that that kind of function and and coordination ability you know governance is is a coordination protocol and yes there are ways it gets um corrupted and that's why important that it's important that it remains local and accessible um and but but to say that you know it has no rule i think is uh is missing something very important and a lot of my a lot of my philosophy i mean i call you know i don't like to get put into boxes so i won't like sign up for anyone else's label i invent my own labels um one i what i really like is sustainability existentialism which is sort of derived from my background in biophysics and studying the theory of organisms and you know theoretical ecology and like you know what makes a sustainable system right that's what that's what i'm here for like how do we you know how do we structure society to actually be sustainable right um and and my understanding of what that takes is effective multi-scale representation of the environment of the things that drive you within the system right and so if you don't make way for some form of politics and governance you are going to insufficiently represent the stakeholders represent the system and that will lead to some kind of you know issue down the road some kind of on sustainability but you know i think it it it's a multi-scale issue and so at different scales you need uh you need different protocols right and at some scales generally at larger scales you you do want some level of governance minimization i mean no one has control over the sun right that's probably a good thing if like we could block out the sun that would probably be bad you know so okay it's good elon elon musk is putting a bit on the sun i wouldn't put it past him but [Laughter] yeah whereas you know at other scales it is important to be able to intervene and um and you know as as as humans sort of um decide what we want right and and i think uh that's important yeah and i think elements of this conversation are going to uh reoccur throughout this podcast is at what layer in the stack does governance should governance exist and uh at what layer in the stack is complete sovereignty exists and how do those things intermingle i think that's going to be a core theme of this podcast and so moving into one of the the next things that you said ethan earlier in the show is the difference between monetary premium and monetary clearing and so i think that means uh correct me if i'm wrong but the difference between a single asset accruing a bunch of monetary premiums just because it's really useful and then market a marketplace that is really really good at clearing itself is that the right distinction and how would you add to these uh these two elements yeah sort of and i think it builds on the uh you know the function of banks and stuff um and and what is the nature of money and and you guys have put a lot of emphasis on this monetary premium idea this store value idea which is you know another way of saying uh liquidity or or sort of monetary demand um and i have become a lot more interested in its inverse which is velocity right so you know what makes good money is it is it stuff that that sits tight and just like a cruise value under your mattress or is it stuff that's always on the move and and helps people get what they want and get what they need right and there there is a there is a sense in which when the velocity mechanisms the clearing mechanisms the ability to actually exchange and clear and and you know engage and trade and so on when that stuff breaks down there the importance of the store value and the monetary premium just kind of skyrockets right it's like a hedge against the failure of the exchange network right and so from that perspective okay this monetary premium thing is very important but that's not the be all end all of money and it's certainly not the case that good money is money which just accrues value indefinitely and and no one can use it or no one wants to use it because it's too expensive and you know it'll be worth more tomorrow like that's not what makes good money uh you know that that's a piece of it and it's especially important piece when your whole banking system has broken down and when it's gone you know completely corrupt and and no one except for you know the biggest corporations in the world can access credit then yes okay then maybe the store value thing is um is super important so i agree that it's important but i think we have to go much much further beyond it and not just focus on you know i think we agree that um money is the killer app here right but we we have to have a more i think nuanced and detailed conversation about what makes good money and what kind of money we're trying to design and if if the only input to that is like deflation and you know ultrasoundness um which is uh something i kind of hate then then i think uh i i think we're gonna mess the whole thing up and uh you know i think uh to some extent you know i blame the sort of austrian tradition for having been um i think they their like development was arrested early on and they became reactionary because of the war and you know the the totalitarian fascist regimes and and whatever that's all that's a whole separate conversation but i think we need to go a lot deeper into the into the nature and history of money to understand um you know how we build systems that enable clearing in local communities that enable people to actually engage uh more in trade and and um and and you know build actually more sustainable production chains and it's not just about you know holding money and having its its value go up and having it be the most demanded thing and having this like infinite liquidity it's actually about making sure the money moves and if the money's not moving uh it's probably not good money it's it's sitting still it's making certain people rich and other people not and i'm not sure that that's exactly what makes um what makes good money and so what we've been starting to focus on especially at informal is studying this problem of of credit clearing uh and and of focusing on you know how do we how can we start to engineer systems that enable businesses that trade with each other or or even people uh to actually clear their debts clear their trade credits without introducing uh external liquidity or by introducing the minimal amount of external liquidity right and so you know the simplest way to think about this is you know david if i owe you money and you orion and ryan owes me we can clear all those debts without any liquidity right just by servicing the fact that we have this close loop of obligations right now that's that's good money i mean that money didn't even materialize and yet we were able to have a whole you know cycle of exchange and and it's not sitting under anyone's mattress it's not accruing you know value or premium or anything like that it's just the actual network of obligations and i think that's actually the root of money is um you know is this sort of like mutualism in in a sense and you know altruism and gift economies and all this sort of stuff but uh trying to trying to bring that back into the modern world i think it's really important because we've lost it and so much of our economics has been structured to be kind of linear right and something comes in and goes out and usually ends in in some rich person's pocket and then it stays there and you know you look at measures of monetary velocity and they're collapsing and money doesn't move through the economy and people can't get access to it right and so focusing on this monetary premium aspect kind of devalues this actually super important thing which is that we make sure that that money circulates that people can can clear their obligations that they can enter into obligate you know into uh trade obligations without feeling like they have to go into debt to a bank and pay high interest rates just to be able to participate in the economy right and so you know by looking at at that kind of approach to clearing you can actually clear significant fractions of debt in an in an economy without any liquidity without changing the structure of the obligation graph like without changing who you know without introducing a clearinghouse just by surfacing the information about who owes what and looking and looking for cycles right and any time you find a cycle you can you can clear those cycles right and that uh is an incredibly powerful tool for especially for small and medium-sized businesses whose you know primary constraint really is uh liquidity right it's like how do i you know maybe you're solvent maybe your your receivables exceed your payables but if you're not receiving in time and your payable is due you know you're out of business right and so by by actually uh looking at the network of obligations and and enabling this kind of clearing we can build much better monies that serve much greater uh you know fractions of the population than just you know some dumb thing that you know has has a significant sink and is you know deflationary and is accruing value and and making people the whole that hold it really rich you know uh yeah i actually think this is really really interesting and ethan i think from what i've gathered hints you you and i have read the same book uh debt the first five thousand years um if if that book uh draws your memory i'll come back to that in a second um but the the spectrum that i'm getting here is that on on and money there's a lot of monies out there in the world and what money is isn't actually one thing but we just have a bunch of things that have money properties and they exhibit different properties on the money spectrum and i think what you just illustrated is that you're looking for a money system that has uh extremely high velocity and in contrast with like the ultrasound money of that we described ether to be which would be very much almost trying to get to as low as velocity as possible right like exclusively a store of value uh and much less emphasis on a medium of exchange but what you're trying to go i think what you're saying is that if you go so far on the medium of exchange side of things we could do we might actually be able to lose the denominator so if i owe you money you owe ryan money and rhinos me money but they're all these are all obligations of a certain type uh and so like maybe maybe those types are different currencies like maybe ryan owes me die i owe you bitcoin and you orion cosmos maybe we could get even more esoteric and be like ryan owes me a favor and i owe you an item and and it's like some other like weird thing but like the the vision of of uh what you're you're trying to articulate is that the network between the network of obligations where money was formed out of a network of obligations for people and then we just use this denominator to settle settle the trade so i think what you're illustrating is that if there's this network of obligations cosmos the technology or this this uh yeah cosmos of the technology can actually settle these obligations independently and agnostically from the other commitments from other parts of the network and so the velocity is actually so fast that the currency doesn't actually manifest did i did i hear that correct i mean that i think that's a major goal is that to have velocity so high basically infinite that the currency doesn't actually even have to manifest i mean it's in you know simultaneously everywhere at once that is that is sound money i mean you want sound money you can't even see it i mean it's it's traveled at the speed of sound right i mean i mean that's not that's not sound money the problem with that ethan is that if that's true and then we've like the velocity has gone so fast that we've eliminated uh the need for it for money then what do people buy people like people like buying things with number go up if there's no number go up then how do you inject attention onto that thing that's a really interesting and profound question for our species because i think that you know i think this is associated with so you know i think monetary premium has a religious origin and and maybe private property does as well and a lot of what we are reeling from um you know in the last couple of decades or something or 100 years is is the collapse of the kind of religious substrate of our lives uh and what we're sort of refining it in the mimetics of you know internet culture which is you know giving us new kinds of mythologies and new new kinds of salvation stories like oh if i if i hold the token you know its value will go up and then i will be saved or whatever right and i think we need to get real with ourselves about that and um i'm you know not necessarily just trying to play a game of make number go up because i think there's there's more to life than you know watching numbers on the screen um yeah i'm interested in in sustainability and it's true that you know telling that story it's a little bit maybe it's a little bit less catchy uh maybe we need to work on our memes a little a little more and a little harder and you know take seriously the the religious nature of all this and and what it takes to attract people um but i think we do need we do need to question the games we're playing and and what we're in it for and if we're just in it for number go up then like you know that's what the banks were in it for so like what makes us better than bankers you know i uh there's a lot of comments here which is interesting i i do think that um like humans i've come to accept that humans are you know religious creatures in general and talk about biology like we're probably hardwired towards this so it's going to be hard to collectively uh make a change here and also like somewhat when we get into the kind of the the more the pushback section when you talk a little bit about like the world that you are envisioning sounds amazing like i would sign up for that world that would be fantastic like please yes let's do monetary clearing instead of monetary premium yeah but some level some of the times i've been wrong in crypto have been times where i was a bit too idealistic and i was like searching for this kind of like this perfection uh hoping that humans wouldn't be greedy about things and not accepting the world as it is and so maybe we'll get into that conversation as we as we go through in some of our uh our questions about your thesis uh ethan well let's get to the next one first which is this idea of uh empires versus city-states okay so and you know david has said look the world the the word empires is kind of troublesome because it sounds like the the imperial roman empire yeah it's like darth vader and like you know crucify you behead you if you disagree and don't get in the path of the the roman war machine that sort of thing but when we're talking about empire it's like an opt-in empire it's it's sort of like every individual every chain has the ability to kind of opt in and exit at any point in time so i want to clarify that the empire uses its resources to fight for the love of its users yes so empire of love maybe but let's still use that let's still use that analogy here all right all right is that what vader said i mean that's what yeah the american imperialists have always said you know we're protecting freedom and whatever about that showing you let's let's still use this let's still use this uh analogy though you know maybe the empire thinks it's an empire of love but you use the city-state analogy and tell us about the distinction from the bankless thesis yeah i mean again for me it's a it's a question of sovereignty it's a question of um representing stakeholders in the state machine right and and i think that the empire model is important at a certain you know the empire model it's important that a certain layer um maybe high up high up the stack to have a sort of low resolution uh representation of the world but to actually cater to the needs of of humans and our ecosystems we need much higher resolution uh machines state machines that better represent stakeholder interests right and and the city state is is kind of a um a form of doing that that's a much more local smaller scale um you know polity that represents the people that are part of the city rather than trying to be you know an and oppressive dominating empire that's sort of conquering and expanding and trying to cover the whole globe right and usually what happens with with those empires is at some point they get too good for them they're too big for themselves um and they break down because they're they they you know stew political unrest because they are found to insufficiently represent the interests of their citizenry right and and so people rebel and and what do they do well instead of you know they form nation states they say to hell with your empires we want uh we want a state that represents our culture our language our interests we still want to you know cooperate with everyone um but we don't want to do it on these sort of imperial imperial terms right and and so you get this progression from from empires to to the nation states uh and i think the same we're seeing the same kind of problem the same kind of challenge face the nation and it's a it's an information theoretic problem right it's a problem of bandwidth i mean how much bandwidth does the state machine of the nation have to represent the interests of of its citizens right and it's not much i mean the the nation states are these massive entities uh they're they're so big that by the time they sort of accumulate and process information like it's it's stale right and and we all know this kind of you know motivation for decentralized information and you know markets or or whatever and this isn't like a market fundamentalist um kind of view that that i'm espousing here it's more uh information theoretic and sort of localist kind of kind of perspective that you know arguably now now that we have most people living in cities right and so this is from a geopolitical standpoint the cities don't actually have any constitutional representation in most of their most of their nation safe they're like you know they're effectively corporations like owned by their province or something i don't know the specifics but it's something like that right and that is a big problem for the people that live within cities that basically don't have sufficient representation in the structures of government right and so i actually see a big part of the sort of next next stage of political evolution to be greater sovereignty and representation for cities right and i think something similar is kind of happening in in the blockchain space where these big you know big bad public blockchains that are trying to be empires uh they're they're too big and their citizenry is too diverse for them to adequately represent their interests depending on what they're trying to do and we've seen this play out already in the in in the sense that you know some of these chains have forked themselves i mean bitcoin forked because its citizenry was too too diverse to you know uh to be served by a single platform and some people wanted you know cash or whatever and others wanted this you know more secure censorship resistant layer right and ethereum fork because of the the dow maybe it'll fork again you know with the merge i don't know but in in any case i don't think having um you know a singular world computer is sufficient to represent everyone's everyone's interests right and i mean there are lots of people that probably just don't want to use the evm i mean uh you know why should we be stuck with this one sort of virtual machine that was you know conjured up um kind of out of nowhere and now and now we're stuck with it because it's like trying to be an empire right and and again i'm you know i'm i'm bullish eth i'm i'm long on um on the ethereum project i think it's an incredible project but i think some of the philosophy around you know the world computer and it being an empire and sort of the dominant thing i think it's inhibiting a lot of important uh innovation and representation for people that we actually need to to achieve this sort of larger um you know larger crypto blockchain vision of decentralized you know more sovereign communities one thing i'd say about the empire model is um you know like you could call some a protocol standard that's governanceless like uh tcpip to be and communication empire for the internet and really it's sort of like a governanceless standard that everyone opts into and everyone just agrees but there are clearly network effects at play but maybe my question is is more like um you're not gonna pay for that yes true in the real world we don't see a uh a setup of like we see kind of like if you've read anything by ray dalio and you know charts through history right often on bank list we like to compare chains to kind of like nation states and that sort of thing because there's useful analogs but it's fun everything you were saying about empires is true because we see the rise and fall of empires like throughout history and they reach a peak and then they do something with their monetary system or they don't represent their citizenry effectively and there's a revolt there's a revolution and then some other empire takes charge we've not really seen a world at least in the modern world in the last thousand years or so of many different city-states and you know peak decentralization we've always seen this like network effect uh reigning empire let's say in history and i'm wondering like and so the bankless uh i guess thesis is just like hey this will continue this is a society organizational construct and what are we doing we're actually paying for securities with these chains in the same way uh empires have to pay for military and defense and you know implement like tax codes and all of these things and that's what chains are actually doing and so we haven't seen a world full of many decentralized um city-states in the real world my question to you ethan is why do what do you think is different in the world of blockchains in general and in that and like the the digital world yeah so there's a few things there so so first i'm not sure actually if that's true um and i'm you know trying to study a little bit more sort of medieval history to understand you know how things went basically before the rise of the the the dutch um empires um or spanish even but um there were you know it certainly does see you know you see these amazing maps of like the holy roman empire and it sounds like okay there's an empire there right but if you actually look at like the political constitution of the thing it's incredibly decentralized and diverse and not to say that you know feudalism is like a good model for for what we should be uh working towards i mean we're uh you know just just trying to understand understand the history but i think there is probably a lot uh especially in in medieval ages if not um if not older uh about political structures that uh are gonna be informative today and and one way i think about this i know you know some it's still kind of new to me and i'm reading a lot and a lot of sort of uh you know changing my uh understanding of the world especially the more i read about history and the more you know some some things i took for granted are sort of sort of overturned about money and politics and and all these kinds of things so maybe we'll find out i'm wrong about everything and you know at least then we'll know but um is uh so sorry i lost my train of thought with that caveat what was i saying medieval um politics yeah oh this holy roman empire thing right so um you know in in my understanding of this thing this was like a um you know something that operated above the politics uh you know that was sort of on the ground and on the ground you know there was a lot of kind of decentralization between different you know minor kingdoms or whatever and there was this like unifying ethos that bound everyone and that was the church essentially right and in uh you know in uh with with the peace to west this is sort of my rough understanding of kind of the history with the peace of westphalia and 1648 um the church the church's power kind of collapsed and was replaced by this like balance of power ruled over by a hegemon right which which was initially uh uh um the dutch and then the british and then you know uh america right and there was nothing about you know that was the hegemon that sort of imperial you know um uh ruler was the thing that kind of bound the whole world system together right and there was nothing above it um and it was the thing that that was above and what i think is happening is that um the internet is the new church and and that you know there is something now that is above the ruling nation states uh and that can kind of cross between them and that's the internet uh and and it does have this kind of religious quality because it connects us to each other in this kind of instantaneous way that is reminiscent of how we used to be connected through our sort of more oral cultures you know before um for vision and reading and literature kind of took over our lives and made us all you know very private people and and whatever but um and so i i think what what you know part of what we're seeing is potentially that kind of uh you know a throwback to that that kind of um you know political substrate where there is something that rules above all the nations which is essentially the internet and and protocols that can be built at the internet layer and and there's a new you know um opportunity for politics to kind of emerge under that and new balance powers to emerge and and so on and so that's part of why you know i don't think we're locked into this deterministic well there can only be you know a single world hegemon and and you know they're the imperial army and they protect all the trade routes and and and all that i mean obviously we need we need coordination for you know safety and and security but you know that that's part of what um what makes me optimistic about about kind of the future and about these sorts of changes and and the and so i think there have there have been city states and certainly um you know the you know i mean capitalism in some sense got its origin with the italian city-states which were you know not ruled over by a single a single empire they were all sort of fighting with each other and maybe that's not a great model either um because you know they were fighting quite a bit but maybe we also need to need to appreciate the extent to which you know some amount of fighting is just sort of inherent and um yeah so so that's a little bit why i think that that um you know there's more in future and that by looking to the past we can actually learn a little bit about about what the future is going to be like and there have been changes in technology that suggest our modes of relating to each other might start to become more like they were in the past than like they have been you know the last few hundred years it might be more like a thousand years ago or you know 700 years ago or whenever it was but i'm still learning and putting putting my thoughts together on this there's a lot here but i think you know we you know a lot of like political economics it really just focuses on the last few hundred years and kind of dismisses a lot that came before that and um i think we have a lot to learn from especially medieval times if not if not lots of other times as well and i certainly think this is an example of because because we also just love looking back into history to to help project us into the future and that we're all so we're all looking at the same data right there we're all coming to consensus about what was true back then but we're just projecting it out i think a little bit differently as as it goes into the frontier right into the unknown the next 10 to 20 years of crypto networks and ethan you talked about um how you know at the center of the the roman empire was the empire but as you went further away from rome it started to get into more independent city-states uh and the this this same model i think definitely exists in what we kind of think of ethereum uh where you have this l1 blockchain that is supposed to be completely credibly neutral something that the center of an empire a physical empire was it could not be because it's always up to like human corruption at the end of the day uh and so if we can code in anti-corruption anti-governance at the l1 and have it be very very unopinionated each layer two represents its own city state each layer two represents its own community with its own governance gets to determine with a a lot more fidelity what the what the values of that community each represents on the layer two and the beautiful beautiful thing is it's it's free to spin up a layer two and it's also free to be secured by the ethereum layer one and so the the only thing that is the ethereum layer one the two things that ethereum the ethereum layer one does force upon its layer twos is opinionated about how these things work is that you need to settle to the ethereum with a with a transaction that you pay for in eth and you need to adhere to the rules of the evm and if those are the only two rules and the complete the rest of the governance spectrum like what eips we want to implement uh how fast our blockchains want we go where the fees of this blockchain go is completely determined by the periphery uh by the city-states it's just that these city-states are anchored down to the central security force uh and and so like the the whole um uh like totalitarian or top down control command and conquer type of the of a empire is completely nulled because of cryptography right we've we've removed governance from the base layer to push governance to the layer twos and allowing these communities to govern themselves and i think that's what i'm hearing from you as to what you value and we value these same things we just think that again the topology of where these things actually exist are just different how would you what would you say to that yeah i mean i i agree with a lot of that and i think the l2 model is is great for scaling ethereum but you know what if you don't want to pay an eth and be beholden to you know ridiculous ultrasound monetary policy that that serves the interest of the creditor class and what if you don't want to use the ev app which has all sorts of problems and all kinds of limitations and severely uh restricts your ability to represent how you want to you know structure computations uh and i mean that's that's a deal breaker for me and and and for many others right and so uh that's not it's not a knock against ethereum i mean ethereum is great there's a lot of amazing things and a lot of people will want to settle against it and use the evm and you know inherit all the benefits that come from that but a lot of people won't and it's it's important that they don't be you know hit over the head and told they're stupid if they don't use the evm or eth because that's the only thing that has monetary premium and you know oh whatever we can we can uh you know forgive the the sins of the evm because the monetary premium that's accruing to eth is sort of sufficient uh and so you know don't worry about that don't look too closely that you know it's fine i mean it's not fine there's uh there are a lot of needs for for greater sovereignty and and some people want more more more control and i think it's really important that we that we have that and ethereum's important again you know i think um it will it will play a major role in our future um uh it may break itself with these you know positive feedback loops on its uh on its so-called monetary premium i think that could eventually be uh be a problem for it um like it has been historically uh you know over the years people rulers have had to interfere intervene in the monetary system when they have been quote unquote too sound because everyone ends up in debt and then they can't afford to pay things because the the money is uh too expensive in the future and so they're just trapped um and so you know all your l2s may end up in in some form of uh you know debt servitude to ethereum or something which probably wouldn't be good but that that's the sovereignty thing right so i think there's uh there are elements of sovereignty to l2s but it's not the sort of full-fledged sovereignty that i think is important and what we've really focused on in cosmos is you know um modular pieces i mean i think we're pretty much the inventors of this kind of modular thesis and it's been taken a lot further and improved upon significantly but what we have built over the years are modular pieces that work at a certain layer of the stack that people can take and do what they want with and sort of maximize the opportunities for people to use these tools to express themselves to build their own community computers right and that was that was the ethos behind tendermint it was like let's build robust byzantine fault tolerance that's simple easy to understand and on top of which people can build arbitrary applications right and then we build the cosmos sdk and we say okay people want to build public group estate cryptocurrencies well let's make it easy for them to do that with all these modules and stuff and in the cosmos sdk right and then okay now we have all these sovereign blockchains there's you know tons of them out there they need to be able to interoperate with each other so we focus on idc and ibc the inter blockchain communication protocol is very much like tcp it's a general purpose uh protocol for communicating for sending messages between machines in this case you know those machines are generally blockchains but they actually don't have to be you can actually you know on the in the internet of blockchains nobody knows your fridge right you can just have a private key or and uh and participate in ibc it's actually actually pretty cool um and and you know and and that thing has taken off and now you look at mapping zones and you see all these chains connecting with each other it's like looking at the the arpanet in the early days you know you have new york connecting to california and the birth of a new internet and that's that's kind of what's happening in cosmos and you don't you don't get that kind of self-emergent um you know experimentation and and innovation and expressions new expressions of sovereignty and sort of curiosity if you're locked in to using eth and using the evm and as much as you know using those things give you all kinds of benefits just like being under any imperial army gives you all kinds of benefits it you know you're you're paying rent you're paying taxes and uh not everyone wants to do that there's going to be rebellions and people want their sovereignty they want to worship a different you know a different lord uh and and structure their lives differently and that's uh that's totally good and and should be you know nurtured and promoted and that's what that's what cosmos is here for yeah i i i actually agree with a lot of those takes ethan like i i do think that um i do think that the evm does enshrine some things ethereum certainly does entry in some things is a little bit different than tcpip in that way which is maybe governanceless in the way that ethereum is governanceless but doesn't actually surround uh enshrine in economic policy the way that ethereum does and so i do think if you are later too you you do sign up for the economic policy of ethereum and you do receive the benefits of the the ethereum network uh let's call it i i do wonder and we'll get to some of this when we get to the like you know kind of the pushbacks are my main objectives whether um a internet of of side chains of app chains can actually stand up against the economic pressures uh and like the benefits of aligning yourself with with an empire and we'll talk about some of those things um one thing i just want to say before i get to your last point on d5 versus refi though everything you've you've said about like monetary premium against being sort of you know austrian i'm just thinking ethan you must piss off a lot of bitcoin max ones too like how would you like uh how would you uh identify with the bitcoiner community which is very much about monetary premium very much does not believe that that was the only type of bitcoinization right and like i would say yeah what do you what well i i react well yeah i don't um i spend a lot of time defending bitcoin and i i play an interesting game where i'm sort of playing all sides in some sense right so to people that are deep in crypto i'm telling them that you know mmt is important and and you know um forget about your store value stuff and to the mmt crowd and you know people outside crypto i'm saying hey bitcoin is maybe the most important invention ever like get your head out of your ass and pay attention to this freaking thing right uh and so you know depends who i'm talking to i sort of have to adjust my um my my arguments i think i think bitcoin is incredibly important um i write i write articles about it all the time i think bitcoin's proof of work is a very very significant meaningful thing um you know i was listening to the the episode you did with with justin drake and lynn alden i thought that was really good captured you know just the the constant back and forth um about about both sides i i thought was was amazing but at the end of the day i think there is something proof of work provides and i sort of grounding in the real world you know my my intuitions about it you know lynn was making a ton of great arguments um but at the end of the day a lot of them are just grounded in the fact that that bitcoin is grounded in in something you know thermodynamically real in a way that you know proof of stake is not and and it's funny for me to say that i mean i you know i might have i think i said this in chat i might have like the highest ratio of like pro proof of stake to anti-proof of work like in the world like as as far as people that are you know have um help make proof of stake happen but are also like very pro bitcoin and it's and it's use of proof of work um i seem uh kind of kind of in a world of my own so which is interesting because maybe it means i'm i'm wrong but hopefully means everyone else is wrong um so with the bitcoin what about yeah yeah what about ethan if like bitcoin took over as store of value like uh do you go that far because you seem to indicate that hey you the best the best money money has the highest velocity that is not at all what bitcoiners want yeah the world they want everything to hyper bitcoin eyes yeah i mean that's ridiculous i mean i think you know if bitcoin became the unit of account we would be in big trouble um for all the reasons i've been talking about but that's not to say bitcoin can't i mean this is the thing like um you know gold gold isn't money uh a unit of account of gold is money right gold on its own is just is just a commodity uh it's just a metal that you know has some people have interest in but it's it's coined gold it's gold stamped by the sovereign uh you know with a unit of account that is money and it's important that there's gold in that coin no doubt about it but if you if you just try to use the gold itself and you fixate on the like you know on on the um on the weight of gold purely the pure weight being you know the you know 100 back whatever uh money you have a lot of problems and you know historically if we look at you know the nature of of the coinage system uh it it it wasn't really like that until i don't know the 17th century or late 17th century or something and actually kind of ironically is you know happened at the same time the bank of england was created that we sort of went on this like you know idea of a gold standard right where it was like a fixed amount of gold and it was like super hard uh super hard currency or or whatever so but i think i think uh systems using bitcoin as a substrate maybe with uh their own units of account will be um will be really important and interesting i think this is a this is the topic that i think is the big open research question for us in the 21st century is like how do we conceive of units of account and where do they come from and what do they represent right and and you know i'm just beginning to start actually having any idea how to even think about or talk about this so i i think it's a really important a really important problem and we sort of have to go back in history and understand where they came from but um i think bitcoin is is super important um technology i think if we hyper bitcoin eyes and everyone uses bitcoin as a unit of account that would be a a complete disaster um and so you know there's there's a subtlety there uh but i think bitcoin as a substrate and a sort of backing to monetary systems um will be important but we also need a huge diversity of monies as well and bitcoin will have a role in that so you know i think about bitcoin sort of like to say bitcoin is like the sun you know it's like the shining of the sun is this sort of constant constant cycle that you can lean on that you can rely on uh but you know if you get too close on it you depend on it too much you get burnt right um but it's a major input to two other systems that sort of capture the energy from the sun and recycle it internally you know before dissipating and so i think bitcoin is is something like that okay ethan let's talk about just your last point when you when you went through those four which was um you know bankless tends to emphasize defy uh and you're talking about refi i will say we do talk a lot about regenerative finance you know public goods and that sort of thing but maybe you have a different uh definition what is the distinction between defy and refi refi i also like kofi which is what a collaborative finance which is what we're calling our our project at informal to work on credit clearing and and stuff like that um you know i think the the problem is really in the finance part of things um and you know this this obsession with like financial value and and trading and speculation and all this stuff at the expense of the real world and what we're actually trying to do is like you know build a sustainable society uh which we don't have and it's not clear that you know this uh obsession with defy and and and d5 you know products and systems is really helping us there um and so you know if we're talking about you know what's the best system for for building defy on top of okay great you know maybe maybe your monetary premium and ethereum structure and all that is is the answer but if we're talking about you know what are the best systems for actually building a sustainable you know human society um though you might get different answers right and so um and again i actually don't fully know and i struggle a lot with even with refi with um you know are we just like financializing um you know carbon credits and all these things like i think there's there's probably some good there but there's also risk that we're just like applying market forces in all kinds of places where they don't belong um and uh you know so i'm certainly not a market fundamentalist and by just like giving making everything accessible to finance and this focus on like oh everything you know we should have like uh you know super liquid markets and and liquidity gets liquidity and everything should have you know be have low slippage and be easy to trade like i'm not actually sure all those things are uh are good um and in the same way and i think this relates to this this um you know uh insight i have that actually the network effect is not monotonic like you know everyone thinks like oh the network effect is this like infinitely growing thing you keep adding people the value keeps going up well the value can actually not be measured in a single unit right this is the problem of the units of account and you know once the networks get too big actually they start to cause problems right and so you know facebook is like a great example initially everyone's like great like yeah you're getting on facebook like network effect you know and then it takes over the whole world and it's like it destroys democracy it's like okay how's that for network effect right and so i worry that the the same kinds of of things are at play in in the monetary systems where you know you get like too big to fail and and and just by like financializing everything uh we neglect the actual the actual structure and and values that we that we need to put in place and even you know even with refi there are potentially those issues with with kofi i'm sure we're going to have it have it as well but that's why we're really trying to focus on real world patterns of trade and activity and you know payments are you know money what is money it's it's about payments right money is where the payments are um and if you're just locking up your your your as collateral like i'm not sure that's money maybe it's a store of value but if you're not making payments um you know what are you doing and and you know payments are the inverse of the supply chain right and if we care about sustainability we need local sustainable supply chains and so by really focusing in on the sort of payments graph on finding ways to incentivize more local supply chains more local payments you know being able to make payments without having to inject liquidity right the best money is the friends you make along the way kind of thing um that's uh that's sort of kofi you know kofi collaborative finance to me and and i think you know uh regenerative finance is a way to sort of get us towards that by thinking about okay how can we create incentives um you know take better care of the land and steward our ecology and all that's really important but there's always this risk that we sort of get carried away with finance that the sort of capitalist interest can take over that you know wall street will use super everything that will price everything in u.s dollars like these are all these are all big big problems and and concerns for me okay so ethan those were the the four themes that you discussed uh at the beginning of the show about the the main differences that you have with uh with the the ethan thought and the versus the bankless thought rather than bankless co-optful uh monet instead of a monetary premium markets that can clear extremely liquid in a an extremely liquid fashion uh instead of empires there's many many city-states and instead of defy there's refi uh and and before we completely transition into where me and ryan will will argue with some of these things we'll push back on some of these things i just want to uh start with this much more broad question where we have network effects in the world we have capital begins capital we have liquidity that begins liquidity uh network effects begets network effects and i think a lot of the the themes that i've i've heard you say is that uh or my first pushback would be like there's a lot uh between the is ought gap of what you are saying there is uh a lot of things that you think should exist uh yet they don't exist and and i think that uh there's there's a gap there that i think is going to be difficult to transcend and we've talked about well the old model the old models for empires the physical empires of the world they come and go right well look at the network effects of facebook it's gotten so big that it's bad for the world like oh the the new empire is america and it's completely misaligned with its users and uh and so i'm seeing we're seeing all these same patterns and i think the difference between our ideology about the the world our thesis about the future world of crypto networks and yours is that you're saying look at all these similar structures that have come and gone because they haven't worked we should use crypto networks to go in a different direction and i think ryan and i are saying look at all these models that have come and gone throughout the world providing some utility a lot of utility at some points in time and then eventually they came down and broke and crumbled but look at the crypto networks they're going to exhibit similar patterns into the future and they're going to be better in the same way that just like the american democracy was way more uh just peaceful and advanced and technologically innovative than like the roman democracy or the roman empire like these things do progress and so sure like no there's nothing about the crypto network uh the future of crypto networks that's going to fix everything but they still will exhibit the same patterns that we've seen before for better or for worse but they will be better than the ones that came previously and so i think you you point towards history and you say look at all these examples of the times it didn't work and i think we point to history and we say look at all these examples of these patterns that have come and gone but been significant improvements from their predecessors and now we are going to see these same patterns exhibit themselves in the future and they are also going to be uh better than the predecessors better than what we have today and maybe in like uh you know a generation 80 years 100 200 years hopefully as long as possible that they do crumble because they do are finally misaligned with society but for now they are fantastic models that are strong extrapolations from what we've seen previously and maybe in the future that they they crumble in the same way that we're seeing facebook crumble or the roman empire crumble but not today but not now what would you say to that yeah i mean there's there's that's certainly um that's certainly one way to to approach this thing um i'm i'm interested in long-term sustainability and that doesn't necessarily mean that you know any singular system is going to last forever i think part of what we need to understand is that no single system can last forever and that there are there are cycles um but the uh the sort of imperial imperialist empire model i think tries to pretend that there aren't that they are going to be the one you know empire to rule them all and that they won't end and so when the end does inevitably come it's chaos it's destruction you know uh and so i think what i'm what i'm proposing is a way of internalizing within the model of the empire that the empire will end and that the end of the empire isn't doesn't need to be chaos doesn't need to be destruction and the only way that i i think or i know that could be possible is if there are a plurality of of you know polities that can sort of pick up the slack and that you can start to move between so if one goes down it's sort of okay it's not it's not the end of the world right and so um you know i think we we are lying somewhat there but you know and going back to the is off thing i mean i i agree you know i i don't want to sit here on a moral as a moral list and just be like oh you're all you're all bad because you know you want to get rich and you want you want to make money i mean you know that's it's fine that's the way it is but we have made changes in our um culture through you know um through discourse through writing through the spread of ideas that have like dramatically changed human behavior and the way we approach things and and this like the nature of accumulation and civilization is in some sense just like a um you know a means of accumulation and all we're doing is like accumulating more and more and there are inflection points where like the accumulation just ramps up um and i i you know it's one thing to say okay well we ought not to accumulate so much right um and and at some level okay that's what i'm saying but at another level it's like well we can actually intervene in material ways in these like accumulistic tendencies um and and potentially reverse them or or change the way we approach them right change the way we think about growth and you know we could get into like a whole discussion about you know growth and and degrowth and i'm not a de-growther per se i'm a sustainable growther right i prefer patterns of growth that are circular in nature right and that grow in in a sustainable way and i do think there are there are ways of sort of moving us towards that but it does require you know talking about these ideas not you know not uh sort of adhering to some kind of like um historical determinism that's like wow this is the way it is and this is the way empires are and so you know how could you how could you change that i mean things change all the time all the time throughout history uh because passionate people you know push things through and and and a lot of times uh it's it's for the worst and maybe my interventions are going to be for the worst and you know uh some kind of chaotic anarchy will ensue if people listen to me i mean i i hope not but um you know that's i think that's how i that's how i think about it that you know on the one hand we do have to be playing the current game but on the other hand we have to be shaping a new game and and that's a really hard thing to do right um that's something i struggle with all the time you know because uh yeah in order to stay alive to play your new game you have to keep playing the old game right and uh that's a really interesting challenge that's that you know that's worth thinking about and talking about more well you you do sort of wonder if ethan's view of the world leads to some sort of like the the dystopian uh like element would be warring feudal city-states that can't get along and the you know the bankless version of things is like this super evil empire that's just like everyone hates but they're forced to everyone behave you must behave yeah and so there are dark versions of everything and so like what we would say ethan is we super respect the fight on the social layer to actually try to create the ott world and i think that is very much what bankless also wants so we're in full alignment

portion and our main main pushback on on one of uh your thesis points is um back to what david was saying how do you fight the network effect of this thing uh the network effect of of money for example um if bitcoin had a lot of people you know talk about hey the best monetary system is actually inflationary right because you know you're distributing some it's not all going to existing holders that sort of thing but if bitcoin had like say what cosmos has which is i don't know seven eight percent inflation something like this correct me if i'm wrong right some inflation per year then it would lose to a monetary system that had no inflation or minimal inflation why by virtue of the fact that people want to store their money in the thing that is most deflationary right and has most certainty of that deflation in the future and so you're up against these network effects with you the ought vision of things and so one of the bankless thesis has been as a result of how we're perceiving how the world is is a blockchain has to be money in order to win and what we mean is a blockchain has to in order to accrue the the most secure chain status it has to have the highest degree of monetary premium and you see this very much with what bitcoin is is trying to achieve it has achieved its security through proof of work by having moneyness people want to store bitcoin as valuable and increases the overall security of the bitcain the the bitcoin network and that is where all chains ultimately drive their their securities from the value of its asset and when you have a chain that has this magic monetary premium energy you probably heard this in our in our ultrasound money podcast you're essentially you get security budget uh for free and so our view of the world is all of these chains ultimately if you're if you're fighting to be a settlement lair if you're fighting to be if you're playing the empire game which we say all chains kind of are playing the empire game because if your city state against an empire probably going to lose then that means all chains are playing the monetary premium game what would you say to that do you think that that is that is off basis and if so how does a app chain ecosystem fight against a chain that is playing the monetary premium game very well there's a lot to unpack there um one thing that jumps out is it's actually i don't think it's true that the city states struggle against the empires um at least you know the italian city-states had had as much uh revenue and wealth flowing through them as some of the largest empires at the time uh and and went on to actually be critical to some of those empires growing um and i don't think everyone is you know and going back to my my understanding about money and the sort of monetary premium and stored value that is important when the clearing system breaks down right so when when um when money doesn't move well then everyone wants to hoard it right uh and and then it's important that you actually stock up on liquidity on something that you know everyone will accept because the clearing network is broken the trade network is broken you can't actually um you know you can't actually get what you need through what you produce right and that's what money is supposed to be for supposed to be enabling you know some level of specialization to still allow everyone to get to get what they need i think and so if we if we focus on you know this monetary premium thing and the store value thing that's important in a world where the clearing system is completely broken down and and the banks are broken and no one can can get access to the stuff but if we only focus on that i think we miss the actual important thing which is like making payments at the end of the day and if your system is hostile to making payments because the cost is is massive because you're using a depletionary currency and you know the price is always going up and and so on well you know at some point every positive feedback loop you know runs into a wall um and so you know i think uh we actually need to take that aspect of money the payments aspect uh uh and the clearing aspect a little bit more a little bit more seriously and i think there's a role in an important uh you know element that this sort of store value monetary premium thing plays but i don't think um i don't think it's the be all end-all and i don't think it's the only thing that all these blockchains are are competing to provide the blockchains are competing to i mean they're community computers they're competing to represent the interests of their communities right and and you know that's not necessarily a zero-sum game because there are so many different communities so many different interests and people who want different things and it's not necessarily all of them wanting to be the global reserve currency uh i don't know that global reserve currency is a good idea or that it's a stable thing or or or should last so um you know from that perspective um no i you know i don't uh i don't agree that that's the game we're all playing and you know i do think it's important that some some chains play that game but not all of them and i don't think it's true that you know i think there was a line in david's empire post like if you're not playing for the number one spot you're not playing uh you know that's not true a lot a lot of teams are playing and and and and their play is very important and they're not playing for the number one spot and and still that's okay um because it's not just about monetary premiums it's about much more than that yeah and and i really think that there's actually these aren't mutually exclusive visions and i think the future of this world is actually how do we include these how do we integrate these two visions because i think they're very very integratable uh something you said ethan was that uh the the italian city-states had more money flowing through them than than the empire itself and that actually helped the empire grow just because of the power of the city-state well when you say that to me that means that these things are actually integrated and if the value of the city-state helps the value of the empire in my mind there there is a relationship between the empire and the city-state where the city-state is a part of the empire and and uh we'll we'll go into that i'll illustrate that and like what i'm what i'm thinking is you have this like topology of many many networks and we have this uh vision of a many many uh many many roll up ecosystem on ethereum that settles down to the empire right and the value in each one is given its sovereignty and this this uh this market clearing effort can be the bridges around all the layer twos especially zk roll-ups because of how atomic transactions can be across one two five ten roll-ups all at once and so we have this mesh network of a clearing house but it's fundamentally secured by the incentive that ryan was talking about earlier with the money the monetary effects the monetary aggregation liquidity because liquidity at the base layer that's how i i think these things just completely integrate with each other what we're really going at is we're playing a thumb war as like who's on the bottom like who who who who who who pinned the other one and this one is inverse right because you i think the whole city space i think your vision is the layer above the security layer uh and i think yours what you're saying is like no no no my vision is at below and that is the new that's the new paradigm that's the new sustainable field i think i think they're very parallel no i think they're in parallel uh parallel yeah cause you know i depending on who i'm arguing with we'll we'll determine you know what uh what i'm gonna emphasize right um and you know if like i'll argue with cosmos people that bitcoin and ethereum are important and they have you know an important role to play in in our future and i'll argue with ethereum and bitcoin people that you know that's not the the be all end all and we also need this cosmos so i think it's actually um there are there's a parallelism here and and that's that's the kind of idea behind sovereignty that you do need this you know plurality um of of systems that sort of have their own have their own rules and govern themselves and that they're all interoperable with each other and it's that emergent mesh it's that connective tissue i think was the term you used before which i really love actually um connective tissue i think that's the most important thing and you know just to make a you know connection to human health like everyone ignores the connection connective tissue right everyone thinks about the organs and the heart and the lungs and the you know the bones and whatever but the thing that actually holds the human being together is the connective tissue and the health impacts of you know unhealthy connective tissue and fascia and you know knots and all these things like that's where chronic stress is held that's where you know longevity is it's in it's in healthy connective tissue right and so rather than focusing on you know the one empire and how the empire secures itself or you know the heart and what keeps the heart beating it's actually how do all the pieces connect and it's that connective tissue that that is um i think so important to to to healthy societies as well and that's why you know part of why cosmos has focused so much on ibc and building this general purpose standard for an internet of blockchain so that all these chains can communicate with each other on sort of common standard grounds and i don't think we've even begun to see the the potential of that there's all kinds of new new functionality and sort of application layer protocols coming over ivc that are just going to completely change the landscape of um of the sort of internet of blockchains and and produce new forms of political alignment and and new approaches to security and and new ways to mesh the security of different chains together and so you know this this model of like oh there's this one empire you know security thing at the center and it will provide security to everything else uh i i think it's a i think it's very limited and there's a you know we don't need to constrain ourselves to that there's a lot more that we can do one thing i'll just say just so it's clear to everyone is like the bankless thesis is also um super glad and happy that all of these different visions of the world exist right i think that there is a strong bitcoin maximalist position that all other non-bitcoin chains are evil that is definitely not the bankless thesis our thesis is more like let the best chain win yeah and have the words that the the best chain is not a particular chain but like uh decentralization maximum decentralization and competition is very good it also keeps empire models like ethereum on their toes and allows people to defect when the empire doesn't serve them very well so i'll just say that but let's get into some specifics here because uh i want to talk about maybe maybe layer two economics versus kind of a cosmos app chain economics for for for a minute and so one of the thesis of like in bankless as to why layer twos will actually dominate is because they get security uh not for free but at massively reduced cost right so in the cosmos ecosystem if you're booting up your own chain an app chain or a side chain you have to essentially fund all of your security budget through validators uh and so you have to pay for these validators and the primary way every chain ethereum right now included pays for its validators is by issuing more of its currency so block rewards so for atoms to pay for the security budget of um all of its validators in the cosmos network it has to issue some atom tokens on an annual basis transaction fees are not nearly enough to pay for validator costs and so what we see in layer two is not yet what we see in layer twos is that um you get kind of that security for free the only thing you have to pay for is uh ethereum block space because you can settle your transactions on ethereum and so we're seeing layer twos um starting to issue tokens like optimism for example and the nice thing about the optimism token is optimism doesn't actually have to fund its security through subsidies it doesn't actually have to issue more op tokens in order to fund its security in fact it can pay its ethereum security budget can purchase the blockchain uh space from ethereum as as a fraction of its transaction fees essentially so how does a sidechain compete against a layer two that gets its security at massively reduced cost when when a sidechain or an app chain has to boot up its validator set and boot up its economics from the base layer uh what are your thoughts on this i mean so that the whole point is sovereignty right and uh and not inheriting security from someone else if you don't want to right and and being able to provide it for yourself and um you know security isn't necessarily just denominated in um in dollars and i think when we do that we discount other aspects of of the system which are that you know in in a cosmos chain you know part of the ideal is that the entities running the chain they care specifically about that application they are there you know to serve that community and and to be part of that um that community and there's more to it than just you know the the sort of crypto economic um security that that's on the line and so it's there's definitely a cost obviously um to putting up your own your own security and that you know that's been a common critique against cosmos since the beginning is like oh no one's going to be able to put their own validator sets together or too expensive and of course you know that doesn't seem to be the case there's a proliferation of these app chains and it seems like this the app chain thesis was actually you know um very much uh correct to a significant extent but the opportune thesis alone is uh is is insufficient and part of part of what cosmos is looking at now is sort of filling in the spectrum of sovereignty right from a fully independent application specific blockchain secured by its own token and validator set to you know a smart contract on an existing blockchain or an l2 or you know what we're building right now this um shared security solution for the cosmos hub will allow uh other chains to launch using the security of the staked atoms on the cosmos hub to run their own chance you know similar to to sort of l2 designs but we do that over ibc right and so we can use i you know so we've sort of built from the bottom up and said okay let's do sovereignty first prioritize sovereignty every community can run their own computer and and can secure it in the way that's appropriate for that whether it's issuing a token whether it's using reputation whether it's using their legal system whatever they want right um and then let's build a general purpose interoperability protocol so that different different chains can can communicate in arbitrary ways and then we can start to think about okay now let's fill in the spectrum of sovereignty using that interoperability protocol and using those pieces we have so that we can offer people you know the the ability to have l2s and to inherit their security from a parent chain and things like that so um it's more a uh you know a difference in the sort of approach we take into sort of more bottom up than the kind of top down well let's build the most secure global you know base chain first and then everyone can inherit security from there you know we're sort of going kind of the other way well let's make it easy for everyone to build their own chain not the most secure in the world but you know at least in in in the terms you might denominate if you're looking just purely in usd like attack costs or something there are lots of other factors to attacking a chain but let's do that first and then sort of build our way up to you know more more global uh security and being able to inherit that security for uh more application specific uh use cases you said uh that chains will be able to choose whether or not they want to be uh just have their own security right like if you don't have to fall under the empire model you can just you can just make your own security right yeah and i will say that the only way that ethereum grows as an empire model is that it actually incents chains to adopt it for whatever purposes for whatever incentives to become a part of the empire right like so become a part of the network so no every network is completely sovereign but it's ethereum's job to convince every sovereign networks like hey you will actually have advantages if you use us for security and the the kind of the image i have is like you know you know water just like water droplets congregate and then they get bigger and then like a new one comes and then it gets bigger and another one comes and then the center gets bigger and this is what really if vitalik was uh working towards when he made ethereum in the first place right he was working on like this master coin thing and every single chain it was like a swiss army knife he was like okay well this chain has like a screwdriver uh a knife and like a can opener but this chain over here has like these components what if i just make like a generalizable chain where like all these other things can just be built on right and so it it it seems to be a very similar uh thing where we there there's all these different use cases back then he was thinking about apps but now we're thinking about chains uh and so every single chain has complete sovereignty over what to do with itself um but you illustrated ethereum as like this top down thing like we'll just be hyper secure and then we'll just make all the chains but i think there's an equal and opposite way to view this where ethereum is hyper secure and all of the crypto networks on ethereum or not on ethereum look at that hyper security and be like i want some of that and so ethereum just has a really good product that the sovereignty that every single chain sees is like hey if we go on to ethereum we get to retain like 95 percent of our sovereignty and so we will just choose to give up five percent of the sovereignty using the eth to make an l1 chain and adhering to the evm and then it's still this bottom-up organic structure yeah yeah i mean all you have to do is accept jesus christ as your lord and savior and then you can do whatever else you want in your life right okay and one thing i'll say on to that and this will get into like the last section that we have in this in this little bit is like security right where if every single chain is its own independent security mechanism and there's this many multi-chain ecosystem uh probably going to be proof of stake because that's just what i think the industry has converged upon in this many many proof-of-stake chain world like you're you're baking in uh just proof of stake risk layered on top of proof-of-stake risk later on you have a proof of stake risk right like every single chain requires two-thirds honest majority and when you fracture one central pool of security which is the ethereum model into 50 100 a thousand different blockchains each with their own two-thirds honest majority assumption you stack these things on top of each other rather than converging it into one shared security pool which is ethereum you have many many many micro pools and the network the there's this thing called a gestalt psychology where like the sum of the part the the sum of the parts is greater the whole is the sum greater than the sum of the parts that in my mind that's ethereum security when you align all of these chains together you get something greater than just the sum of the parts but when you break everything up you have all these two-thirds honest majority assumptions then we need to do a two-thirds honest proof-of-stake bridge to be to have all these bridging ecosystems and we were just on a technical level on a security level like the the aggregate security of the entire industry of the entire ecosystem is just not comparable to what happens when you aggregate security so yes we have this very modular world where these some chains can fail some parts of the organism can die they can be replaced by other things but over over like net net you will see more dying of chains because they didn't share their security because they didn't become cooperative with their security so instead of like an empire model polynya somebody i was talking to when doing some research for this talked about like well no empire isn't the right terminology it's more about cooperative democracies that all share security um that's my pushback on that yeah i mean i like the ideal of of cooperative democracies um and i like the idea of shared securities at certain layers um and and you know i've i've said repeatedly i think bitcoin and ether and and the kind of settlement guarantees they provide are important things to lean on but they're not the only things that that matter and um you know the the ability for communities to determine what security means to them and to provide it on on terms that are appropriate to them i think is is arguably more important than everyone pooling into a sort of singular common security pool um not least because well what if there's something wrong with that singular common security pool what if it you know what if lido takes over because of the you know the way the staking system works right and so there's a you know inherently if we actually care about decentralization like shouldn't we care about decentralization of decentralization itself right um and so you know if there's only one true wholly decentralized solution is that decentralization i mean these are these are interesting um interesting dilemmas to that that we have to deal with right um and so the so you know i'm not i'm not saying it's it's definitely one or the other i think we do need both we do need this multi-scale reality we need these sort of emergent topologies um i would say i am very concerned about proof of stake as an economic mechanism and the sort of um centralizing forces the the rich get richer forces the like lack of grounding in sort of real world thermodynamics all of these things concern me and i see proof of stake as a stepping stone and that there is a lot more work to do on civil resistance mechanisms on um you know organizing governance on introducing randomness into these systems like uh grounding them providing more accountability integrating with um with legal systems or or constructing you know sort of new forms of of judicial and legal systems that draw on you know a thousand years of tradition in this respect we don't have to sort of invent everything from scratch discover everything from scratch there's a there's a lot of work to do here and we're just at the beginning i mean this is this is a stepping stone right so i sort of see this trajectory of moving from uh you know global anonymous low resolution systems for for you know um for identifying let's say individuals like like proof of work you know or anti-symbol uh like proof of work and progressively moving towards more and more locally attuned uh systems right and that's you know so you step towards proof of stake and maybe from there it's on to like proof of bandwidth or you know the holy grail is like proof of care proof of plan right like we should be issuing money to the people that keep society alive right like that is you know the the whole economic system needs to be flipped and what's super interesting about what bitcoin did and what the blockchains are doing is they say hey what's important security okay we think security is the only important thing so we're going to issue our tokens to the people that provide security and and you know that's all that matters okay that's great for building you know a secure blockchain but we have a lot more to do as a society than just provide some security we have to actually keep ourselves alive and unfortunately you can't eat you know bitcoin you can't eat ether you can't eat you know you're asic or your uh or your you know validator key or whatever right and so so finding ways to actually ground this stuff in in more real world productive work and and labor and care and you know growing plants and all this stuff is going to be really important and there's no way to pool security on that we can't share you know a global uh food system because you know we're doing that right now and it's it's crisis and we're you know we're probably on the verge of famine with you know the wars and and the supply chain um you know issues and and all this stuff so um if we don't attend to this need for much more local representation and capacity uh and we try to do everything on this like global shared security settlement layer uh then we're gonna have the same kind of problems and that's not to say the global shared security settlement layer isn't important or doesn't have a role but it's not sort of the only thing right so i think um you know like i was saying they're in parallel you sort of need both and we don't know exactly what the right emergent topology is but that's that's what we're discovering so ethan uh one of our other i guess critiques or one of my other critiques uh on this is about side chains and app chains and how they can uh become plutocracies and maybe we'll talk about this because we've echoed some themes of this right so you know imagine the city-state but unfortunately the city-state is controlled by kind of a validating elite plutocracy and i know you're talking about a co-op where it's sort of one worker one vote but we are so far removed from that in like all chain ecosystems but in particular like ton coin vote chain ecosystems that are controlled by a very small uh subset of validators and so calling these things plutocracies is actually not incorrect at least the stage of governance that that we're in today and so i tweeted this out it was somewhat of a of a spicy tweet and i think this is part of the original prompting for a call and it wasn't actually against cosmos my my critique is is more about like uh cosmos types of of chains being sort of the base layer of our economic system and our money system and i saw this very much reflected in uh ust and tara for example tara being a base money my critique was basically like a very small set of validators actually control if you look at binance smart chain or like the terra network it's a very small subset of individuals and these sort of look like the plutocrats or the the neo banks if you will um i actually uh used to be a validator in the cosmos ecosystem as well and it's fantastic like the ecosystem builds like hell a bunch of talented engineers but i was kind of looking for something that was a bit more like i guess credibly neutral at the at the at the monetary level in scaling of money and i didn't see that in a network like cosmos it was because a lot of when you distribute via um dpos in an ico sale and that sort of thing you have a lot of insiders employees whales plutocrats who actually get to control the system and then when you add on-chain governance to that that means the same plutocrats with token vote actually get to make the decisions in the system so you've got on-chain governance you've got a small validator set which is capped to like you know 100 120 validators and then you have because you're doing proof of stake right from the get-go and you don't have like uh years of doing proof-of-work you have a very difficult to distribute token set that is that is unsolved right now and so i'm less concerned about like a system like cosmos but i'd be more concerned like a network of chains like cosmos i would be more concerned if we relied on this structure as kind of an empire right it'd almost be like putting kind of the united states governance system and constitution in the hands of like facebook shareholders right something like this or a corporate structure where it's it's basically like one share one vote sort of systems and why do we not do that because we need stronger governance governance layers at the public uh layer where citizens get representation so the answer to this in my mind is just you try to remove governance altogether and you try to make the chain maximally uh credibly neutral that's where we are in the cycle how would you respond to some of those critiques about plutocracy yeah i mean it's something that that concerns me deeply um it seems like to some extent this is um this is part of the package with proof of stake and one of the one of the challenges with it and you know i don't think ethereum is going to be immune to this issue either um i think there's there's a lot of work that needs to be done on proof of stake systems to address this there are already you know i mean i would caveat a lot of the things you say you know there are um it's not like the the validators completely control things there are delegators and the delegators can override the votes of their validators and we see massive amounts of delegated participation on on on cosmos and and cosmos chains and um so there's sort of you know there's always more more to the story there's still the ability for you know social consensus and and hard forks to deal with things and um you know we had this uh sucking in game mistakes right i don't know were you in game mistakes with uh yeah right so they discovered that there was you know one of the validators was like actually sibling or something and they kicked them out right and that hasn't happened on a main net yet but it's only a matter of time before we decide to kick finance out of the validator set i mean um you know that would be uh that'd be pretty interesting to see and and i don't know if you're following what's happening in juneau there's like this crazy um you know effort to steal the money of uh someone who who basically you know unfairly benefited from from the airdrop let's say right um and that's a bit of a mess but but governance is um is messy and it's i certainly agree that there is a layer at which we we want to minimize governance uh but there are also areas where we want to um you know support it and enable it and not necessarily maximize it i don't know if that's you know spend all our time politicking but um certainly some level of governance control but right now we're sort of in this you know intermediate period where we're trying to you know uh we're trying to experiment with new with new cryptography uh cryptocurrency systems and obviously we can't just use proof of work so we've had to invent this this proof of stake thing so that we can proliferate and not just you know use insane amounts of energy uh and there are there are challenges with with the economics and they're being you know captured in various ways and all the proof-of-stake systems and i don't think ethereum is um excluded from this uh are are gonna struggle with these things and and we will need more you know better mechanisms and and more research and there's a lot to be done here um to improve the situation um but i don't think it's um you know it's not the end of the world yet this is like just the beginning of a whole new class of systems and there are risks of them being captured absolutely and we have to be diligent and do a lot of work to um to improve them but again they're not you know they're not just about you know it's not like each system is trying to be the global um global reserve money they're trying to build communities and represent those communities and and serve them and do things for them and and in that respect having you know maybe somewhat more concentrated validator sets are uh are appropriate right and i mean the other thing i would say about it is like cosmos has taken a very uh practical approach to uh to its go to market right it's sort of at each at each stage we wanted to have something that works and that could like provide value to people rather than embarking on just this like grand you know five ten year project to like come up with a whole new proof of stake system and then deploy it all at once sort of more more the um more what ethereum's trying to do and not to knock that approach i mean i i think both are actually it's important to really have both and they they um you know they complement each other and they feed back on each other and i think we've both learned you know both cosmos taken from ethereum and and vice versa um but you know it's not like the current proof of stake of cosmos is stuck where it is i mean it's an evolving developing thing right so you know the cosmos hub now has a 175 validators you know we just voted to to increase that and so a lot of smaller validators were able to get in and you know it it won't be long before we're able to introduce um you know aggregator threshold signatures into the validator system to allow that number to increase to thousands right and then it's a question of well how do we actually then start to force decentralization of the stake and there are various ways that we can do that i mean one one thing is to try to get get people off of the centralized exchanges so that the exchanges kind of don't have so much um so much capital to stake and sort of lose their lose their spot and you know one approach to that is is going to be introduce liquid staking natively into the chain because one of the things that tracks people to centralized exchanges are the you know the derivatives the off chain derivatives they can provide that allow you know their stake to be um to be liquid and so if we you know if we could provide that natively on chain well then maybe that that can sort of bring people over and reduce their stakes so there's all kinds of but this is just the beginning right there's all kinds of things we can be doing and working on to um you know to better democratize and you know i agree you know ethereum is is really unique and interesting because it has this it'll have had this history of proof of work which is you know probably remains the most effective the most fair let's say quote unquote fair distribution system known to man for a global anonymous cryptocurrency i mean there's like no doubt about that and so i'm almost jealous of ethereum that it's sort of able to have this like proof of work beginning and you know i've always kind of wished we could do something um something like that and and maybe still will i mean one of the cool things about about um cosmos chains is you can build whatever you want at the application layer right you can you can use proof of work to distribute the coin even though the system is proof of stake or or you know using a tendermint or whatever right so there's there's a huge uh you know landscape of possibilities and possible experiments and innovation to happen and and even moving beyond proof of stake so there's a system now that the um confio team who built a cosmos has been working on called proof of engagement where they're actually trying to you know have the anti-symbol mechanism require you to be more engaged and they you know try to measure that in different ways and but again all this requires being willing to move away from this like fully global anonymous objective you know fully verifiable if you've been a cave you've been in a cave for a month uh kind of approach two more local you know accountable somewhat subjective um aspects and and to say that money only exists at the one layer and not the other is i think to miss a huge spectrum of aspects of money that are actually critical to money working right and and part of money is yes this like reliable you know sort of don't have to trust anyone you know gold bars kind of kind of mindset but the other is this very much um you know credit based aspect of money i mean money is you know i mean people in in monetary theory arguing to the to the end of time about whether money is a means of exchange or a unit of account whether it's a commodity or uh credit right whether it's um you know comes from comes from the state or comes from metal things like this right and both of them are obviously right i mean it's crazy they think it's just one or the other and so we need to fill in all the pieces of that and uh and you know cosmos is trying to fill in i think a lot of that of that spectrum in where other people have focused on one piece you know we're focusing on the others and it's going to take both to actually um to actually create the money of the future ethan just just one thing i want to add because the whole distribution of steak i think is definitely going to be the big problem of crypto networks over the next decades or so uh and just like all the other proof of stake networks ethereum as it turns to proof of stake will also have this problem but it also has one big uh very very important difference which i didn't i didn't hear you voice so i want to voice it here is that there's actually formal governance stripping out of proof of stake and so the the the states how transactions get updated in proof of stake uh is verifiable and and about throughout the whole network right so there is no on-chain governance and there's only so much power that a validator has over the rest of the network when it is time for that thing to that validated to propose a block and if it doesn't propose the correct block in the correct way it gets penalized by the rest of the the proof of stake validator network and so uh like social capital and governance value has been completely stripped away from ethereum's proof of stake and it really only has the returns on capital rather than any sort of other like governance powers that that we would find with any on-chain voting and so yes like while there is like a centralization of power into the ether asset the the how that powers expressed is purely financial rather than being able to impart its values upon the the rest of the ecosystem uh and so while like in this this whole empire model this convergence of stake into this one asset which we think is going to be really really valuable might seem a little dystopian to a lot of people the cool thing about cryptography is that we get to strip away the dystopian elements out of it and so this is the new the new structure of of like uh these these empires or new structure of these democracies that i think will come up into the future so i just wanted to add that that element i mean there's there's two sides to dystopia there's there's chaos in order um and you know to uh it can be dystopian to be able to arbitrarily change the system and it can be dystopian to not be able to change the system um and so you know there's there's both sides so i think the thing is we'll see i mean we'll see where the power lies when there's when there's a real conflict and i think you know a lot of people are are suggesting hey actually you know who controls the ethereum network is the custodial stable coin issuers and wherever those things are that's going to determine what the you know what the upgrade is what the what the fork outcome is and so on and so you know part of the cosmos thesis has been like well rather than let power lie implicitly where it will um and we only find out who has the power in in in a conflict when they actually have to rise up and and you know assert themselves why don't we try to uh make the power more explicit and surface it right and and maybe we haven't done it in the best way yet absolutely i mean there's a you know making power explicit is like the grand in some way the grand challenge of you know the history of human civilization how do we give voice to people and find out what it is and and actually act on it um effectively and so that's a big sort of experimental thing but again to just to just say well all this kind of governance is uh you know we need to absolutely minimize it there are there are areas where that's true and that's important and there are areas where that's not true and and where we need to do the opposite and so cosmos is partially uh you know uh significantly an experiment on how to give more voice to stakeholders within the state machine and that's important in blockchains it's important in society and i think we need a better really better political theory i mean in some sense we're all you know aspiring political theorists to really um you know understand how do we how do humans organize themselves what's the right way to organize and secure you know economies and so on and i think this is a process of discovery and experimentation and we we all have a tremendous amount to learn so um yeah i appreciate being able to sort of come on here and and talk about all these ideas uh so it's a lot of fun i think we've covered a lot of great last question for you before we uh we close this out um importance of of individuals being able to uh be become validators in the network um you know so uh cosmos has been limited by that but uh the the promise of ethereum the next gen of ethereum is actually anyone can be a validator if you have 32 eth and spin it up i know that is the promise and you were alluding to like uh you know centralization around uh staking and collateral with lido and other other uh crypto banks let's call them but uh how important is that in the cosmos most ethos and do you believe that that is an ingredient to decentralization here yeah i do i think it's important um i think there are always um there are always trade-offs and at the moment we've we've um you know for a variety of reasons we we selected a point in the trade-off space where you know beyond a certain point of a chain success it will be harder for individual validators to join because there's you know a limit on on the number of validators and um you know and we've sort of taken a position that okay that's actually maybe sufficient maybe this long tail of validators doesn't necessarily help that much or doesn't add that much and what you really want are you know highly available committed validators that are sort of upholding upholding the system and you sort of have this you know tighter uh integration between who's running it and what the actual application is but i mean that's uh that's just a current limitation it's not it's not like set in stone it's not something that we're necessarily committed to defending that you know the validator sets can never increase i mean we see them increase somewhat steadily all the networks are kind of increasing at their own pace and there is work in the in the tendermint code base now um to dramatically increase the size of the validator set by you know similar mechanisms that um that ethereum is using right and so we can see that you know uh i would love to see it be more accessible um for individual validators to um to come in i do think that's that's important um and and there is work uh to that effect so hopefully you know in the next i don't know year a couple years uh at the latest it will be uh much more validator sets will be much more accessible and there'll be you know a long tail of individuals participating so ethan this has been super fun maybe let's just uh close with kind of summarizing arguments here and i'll start so so to allow you to finish with with your thoughts here i guess my tl dr on the back and forth is like there's so many points of alignment and we're you know uh all super excited and happy that there are these other approaches to uh to crypto right if we had one monolithic approach that would be a recipe for disaster and failure um definitely the bankless thesis does think that there are certain network advantages monetary influence these sorts of things that make sort of a an empire of love maybe let's call it uh probably result in the dominant or one of the the most dominant power law winning uh chains and that's why we're we're probably more excited about the ethereum version of things the other point of distinction i would say is uh we're in the app layer you know you you mentioned kind of these things would be sort of in the similar place in the app layer i think the the maximally decentralized version of that we see at bankless is you have something like ethereum which maximizes security and decentralization at the very bottom and then you have layer twos on top of that that are much more expressive these are these co-op type communities of the type you're talking about they handle execution composability they are also permissionless these are the city-states that essentially uh are are part of the defense network of the credibly neutral settlement layer and then you have something above that which is which is maybe more of the app chains as kind of a layer three so in my mind that is very much compatible with the cosmos vision of things and uh our most likely outcome thesis for how this space might evolve and again could be totally wrong and i am super excited to see all of the the cosmos visions play out certainly for people that aren't aware like tendermint is core to so many chains i mean tendermint is part of you know matic which i'm sure many ethereum users uh use today it's just fantastic technology uh it's it's also part of terra which has certainly taken a chunk out of the d5 story and the defy narrative so we're certainly seeing the the cosmos app chain layer like flex its muscles these days but that would be how i would summarize the bankless thesis how would you summarize your pushback on that and uh what you think even yeah i mean i think there's obviously a lot a lot good there and probably a lot i would agree with um for for us and for me it's it's really about um you know sovereignty and and the community computer and and that sort of you know analogy to well ethereum being this base layer um that is sort of like a mainframe right and and mainframes kind of you know don't govern the world today the way the way people maybe once thought for various reasons and everyone has their own computer and in a similar way we expect that it will be very important to people to communities to have their own computers community computers application specific blockchains we could say that they they can govern and and use in the way that's appropriate to them with the technology that's appropriate to them the you know virtual machines or languages that are appropriate to them the economics that are appropriate to them and and to not necessarily be beholden to um to the the political economy of of ethereum uh regardless of the kinds of sovereignty that you know l2's on ethereum can still offer there's there's a whole spectrum of greater sovereignty that that people will want and demand and we're seeing that uh play out so there's you know in my view an essential role for ethereum in in the future but i don't think it's as simple as you know ethereum's at the center and we just have concentric circles coming out to me it's more of like a fractal hierarchy uh and sort of a web of um of of different blockchains and applications and then and then the other key piece you know just to summarize on is uh on this money aspect i think monetary premium is important especially in a world where our clearing systems uh have broken down but it's not the only thing and if we're actually going to fix money which i think many people here are interested in doing we have to go a lot further than just store value and monetary premium we have to you know figure out how to construct units of account how to make them you know represent things that that matter to the world that are that are sustainable um and actually enable clearing and local communities to um to engage with each other and to build more robust uh say community economies well excellent summary ethan and i think bankless listeners uh you heard both sides and probably understand both sides of the story a lot better than when they came in and as always in bankless podcast we don't just talk technical i mean this is philosophy this is you know biophysics uh this is history this is just about everything which makes crypto uh the best place to be in if you are looking for the future of of humanity and to spend your career so thanks for joining us ethan this has been a super awesome conversation we appreciate so much for having me it was it was a great time hope to do it again bankless nation a couple action items for you uh one we have a link that ethan was talking about the map of zones where you can see what the cosmos architecture looks like what the ecosystem looks like across all of the various cosmos chains also cosmos just released and i believe it was this week an evm compatible version of a chain called evmos this was formerly called intermittent i believe uh evmost okay uh this was formerly called ethernet uh excuse me back in the day so um take a peek at that we'll include a link in the show notes as well as always risks and disclaimers all this stuff is risky side chains eth the whole gamut defi is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is
