[Music] hello everyone welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and as i mentioned on a previous episode of this show i really want 2022 to be the year that we explore nfts beyond pfps no shade on pfps not to say there aren't amazing communities coming out of what are traditional pfp projects not to say there isn't amazing art coming out of traditional pfp projects but it is to say that i want to explore some of the the further depths of what nft technology is and can do and what kinds of projects and categories of projects i think are really here to stay nothing could fit this categorization let me say more than my guests today and their project which is the get protocol an nft blockchain ticketing protocol that is just what it sounds like it allows concert venues it allows ticket issuers to issue nfts as their tickets i've been talking about this for quite a while i think this is one of the if not the biggest way that nfts ultimately end up going mainstream so i was so excited to get to talk to colby and oliver biggs who comprise the marketing team at get protocol and really dig into how their product works they have a couple of different products we break it down what their technology is how they're thinking about it what the obstacles are for this to really become mainstream and i hope you find it as interesting and really exciting as i do i will say of course not financial advice do your own research but by the end of this episode i i was very bullish on the get token so i would say if you're if you're looking for potential investments around every corner i would say listen to this whole episode and decide for yourself by the end if you think it's worth maybe buying some get tokens again seriously please please please not financial advice do your own research i'm just telling you that i ended this podcast in this conversation quite bullish i think many of you will as well and with that i want to say thank you so so much to the team who edits this show my mom has been calling me out for not saying thank you enough she's right i mean i usually say like some kind of casual thing i think but thank you so much to dave to luke to matt all of you at bankless michael who make all of this possible really really grateful to you all and with that award from our sponsors polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant

nft and blockchain ticketing anybody who has listened to this show with any regularity knows that i think tickets are really the way that nfts go mainstream so this is a conversation i'm very excited for very eager to get into to understand better what get is doing and what this really all looks like for the future of nfts and tickets so thank you both so much for being here welcome to overpriced jpegs thanks so much great to be here yeah thanks for having us on colleen no prob so let's start with just each of your backgrounds kind of briefly and then we'll get into awesome work you guys are doing go ahead oliver kick it off all right i'll do it uh so i come from a little bit of a commercial background so i used to work at an advertising agency did that for about four or five years creating concepts and strategies and copywriting and before that i was uh into screenwriting that's actually my educational background so all over the place and during my time at the advertising agency i got kind of uh yeah retailed into the potential of crypto at that time it's like 2016 2017 and that's when i got interested into it and now i actually ended up at get protocol eventually from screenwriting to blockchain not your uh typical story yeah i know colby how about you yeah so i actually got into uh crypto in 2016. uh i was working at an i.t company uh called cgi and i remember it was actually an ethereum podcast it was a negative ethereum podcast it was basically after the dow hack and there was kind of this debate what was like you know is this going to be a prevalent thing and i kind of got hooked from that i ended up researching it i made some connections in the space i kind of loved the idea that this was a global uh technology and uh got in from there and discovered get in mid 2017 was always interested really in trying to bring blockchain into like a real world usage case and at the time where there were a lot of icos kind of promising lots of transactions per second i was kind of interested in in how fundamental get protocol was and the team quite down to earth so that's how i got into it and i've been on the get protocol team now since march 2021 and it's gone from there really so i want to talk about get but i want you to help make a distinction for the audience perhaps first which is there's get protocol and then there's something called guts tickets which if i'm not mistaken guts is really what came first is that is that correct so tell folks what these each are and and how they relate to one another yeah so there was a bit of an ethos there where um essentially it was 2016 you know blockchain was a very low to the ground thing i mean if you brought it to the events industry for example not many people knew about it so what we wanted to do was really showcase it and bring the benefits to people so we basically set up guts tickets and it's essentially a showcase of the protocol but it's also a ticketing company so since 2016 it's done like over 500 000 tickets for a bunch of different events and yeah it's basically uh used in the netherlands but also have done worldwide events and it's yeah it's about bringing the benefits of blockchain and creating a package that uh that's then used uh for yeah events around the world so guts tickets is a ticketing company would you say like ticketmaster would that be a a comparable similar idea yeah so gus tickets is uh is several things it's also kind of our proving ground of course we had a lot of yeah philosophy uh in mind in terms of how does what is what's the potential of applying blockchain to the ticketing industry this goes back to our origin story a little bit okay what are the problems in the industry one of the major ones is lack of transparency and this huge black box nature of ticketing where there's immense distrust between all the actors involved so promoters don't trust the artists artists don't trust the venue everyone doesn't really trust each other which is of course terrible and here comes blockchain with its uh huge promise of transparency so that's how our founders actually got first got into the the idea of it of what how about you take this new technology that promises transparency and accountability and merge it with this industry this huge industry that is suffering from you know lack of trust and is actually you know it's there's so many stories about people getting ripped off or scammed or yeah there's uh endless amounts of topics to go into there and see if it fixes stuff so i heard a conversation with martin who's one of the co-founders and it sounds like he'd become sort of enamored with blockchain technology back in 2016 then he heard this radio show or this like you know documentary on the radio or something talking about how you had this problem in the ticketing industry where you would have scalpers buy up tickets and then resell one ticket to multiple different people to make a bunch of money and so you would have people showing up for a concert being turned away because it turned out they'd been double sold a ticket and he looked at this problem and said okay blockchain can solve this and that that's when he set up guts tickets where you basically have i'm sure it wasn't called this at the time but nft tickets right tickets that are connected to the blockchain so you can verify them you can't double sell them etc so is that is that the the kind of basic premise origin story i see this problem here's the solve for guts tickets pretty much yeah it's it's even i think uh more basic than that he was listening to a podcast indeed he was like a lawyer at the dutch central bank so pretty far off from from the blockchain world and he listened to all these problems they were having and then i think he googled blockchain tickets and no one was doing it so then he was like oh crap now i gotta go do this uh apparently this is my game yeah i'll do it and and uh off we win okay so that i think gives people the basic sense of guts tickets which we'll talk a whole lot more about explain where get protocol which is where you all say you work like how does what what is that how does that fit into this this puzzle yeah so gap protocol is essentially the underlying infrastructure right so whereas gut stickers is kind of the show piece for the protocol the get protocol is the infrastructure right so as it's evolved we've kind of built i mean what we would call kind of great ticketing infrastructure and that it covers like the blockchain side of things the nft side of things the complete digital ticketing solution uh and and wrapped it all into a into a protocol that has grown over the years so where where has it started out with blockchain ticketing for the transparency for being able to verify things on chain that's kind of grown now into two specific products our white label and our digital twin and those are kind of like not owned but sort of yeah created under the get protocol name i'm struggling to wrap my head around this so let's let's do a specific example unless oliver do you have something you want to you want to say further to draw that distinction on the guts ticket side and the get protocol side definitely so a way to look at it i think is is the get protocol is the backbone and guts tickets is is the application so get protocol is is the full product suite essentially of everything that's possible with uh in terms of blockchain ticketing that we offer and then guts tickets is our basically our own iteration on this and yeah proof of concept in a way and also our sandbox in a way for trying out our theories about how does blockchain ticketing work in the real world we surface yeah hundreds of clients uh every day non-covet of course and um it really gives us a sense of okay what are real world users looking for and how do we um translate the innovation that we have in our mind and that we find by uh applying yeah the latest nft deck or or whatsoever to real world users at the end of the day let's do this which i think would be helpful because i'm trying to understand like do you have clients that use guts tickets and not the protocol or is that that's an impossibility is my sense or you're you're nodding as if that's true so let's do this walk me through give me a like real world scenario of how this works let's start from the client perspective so my understanding is your clients are musical artists or comedians i think the first big client you all had was a famous comedian in in the netherlands or in is that right yeah so to tell me how it works if i'm uh if i'm going to put on a concert walk me through what this would look like yeah so basically the short answer to that is exactly like what you're used to right now so we put a lot of time into really making the system very user friendly to the end user mostly because they just want to buy a ticket and go see the show and you don't want to bother them with all sorts of you know evangelical uh blockchain wisdom even though we're sure it's gonna make their lives better but basically the event organizer that works with us just puts on the show so they uh set up a ticket shop through our system they have a dashboard they set up a shop fill in the ticket types that they want to sell they embed their ticket shop onto their website they share that link to their socials and they have a ticket sale going nothing more complex than that and what happens under the hood is that as soon as a ticket is sold it is registered on chain uh so this was one of our first big challenges in uh you know creating transparency within the ticketing flow is we wanted to have all our tickets on chain now there's a big learning curve there because initially we registered every ticket transaction directly on chain i wouldn't recommend doing that it costs a lot of money and especially in 2017 we had a famous incident around like one of our first big clients we had a first really big sale and i believe it was around the crypto kitty time so uh the same time as this big sale the eath chain was pretty congested uh which led to us having to wait like four days for all these tickets to be registered on chain we paid tens of thousands of dollars to er in gas fees not a super scalable business model of course uh those damn cats i know i joke because max lavelle who conceived of cryptokitties was on this show and talked about how much hate he got around that time basically for this reason for like breaking ethereum and clogging the network and he's still getting it yeah no but you learn from there and and you have to iterate on on the concept and uh you have to figure out a way how is this going to scale with your business and of course we're servicing real world clients and you can't really go to them and say oh sorry it was a huge crypto kitty thing this weekend uh you need to really get them their tickets and and make sure it works especially with our ambitions of going globally and we have real users around the world so you iterate on that and yeah that's how we got to today we're using polygon uh for scaling efficiency and cost efficiency and here we are now we're at a position where we can easily sell tens of thousands of tickets a day thankfully and uh much more uh in the time to come okay let me let me see if this is a correct articulation of different the different products and how they use because i think i want to make sure that's really like clear and nailed down for folks so we can dive into the guts of this pun intended as we move forward so if i'm an artist i'm a comedian and i come to y'all i can use the protocol kind of makes this run the gut token is sort of like the transaction fee that keeps the network moving forward i'll set up using sort of y'all's tech a website work through which i'll sell my tickets i then embed that site through you know into my website and ultimately what i'm selling you is a guts ticket is a carly riley guts ticket and sort of the back end of that is using the the get proto so that's one use case it sounds like is that correct yeah roughly yeah so that's uh that's one use case so guts is essentially one of our white labelers so we design guts yeah this is what i want to explain for folks alternatively i could be ticket master and i could come and say i don't want guts tickets because i already issue tickets i am a ticket issuer but i want to take your technology and your blockchain technology that you've created via get protocol and i want to buy or lease that in like a white label capacity so that i as ticketmaster can leverage the same technology for my customers and my clients as you all do and so now ticketmaster and guts are sort of competitors both using the get protocol is that the relationship boom i think we got there hopefully the audience finds that as sort of confusing out the gate as i do and it's helpful to kind of really break it down okay so with that clear let's now talk about from consumer's standpoint what this looks like in terms of buying a ticket and so i go i have to go through you know maybe i'm just going through my favorite comedian's website or you know i go to katy perry's website and that's typical but but they're the the key here is i'm not using probably the usual workflow for myself which is i'm not going to a ticketmaster i'm not going to one of the big ticketing sites in order to to do this correct to tell me sort of what that process looks like from a from a consumer standpoint and why this is maybe where this is a better experience and maybe where this has some shortcomings for from a consumer standpoint yeah so we really wanted to make sure that this was as accessible to everyone so the way it works is if i was an event organizer i had an event and i create my ticket shop i can basically a bed embed that ticket shop into my website or i have just a a url they go to that and they just get a normal ticket shop now what we wanted to make sure was of course that everyone could use this right so if i'm a an attendee and i see i want this ticket i buy it with fiat it's completely as normal as as possible right like exactly a completely normal ticketing uh process and if i'm the the ticketing company so say as you said like guts or if you wanted to sell a ticket you have your own ticket shop that's embedded and it's yeah a normal process okay but so this is different obviously because the ticket i'm buying now is an nft let's talk about like reselling these tickets and talking about you know how this sort of works so i go onto my ticket shop i buy it i can use fiat now where does my nft ticket live now that i've bought this thing that's a ticket but it's not the usual ticket i'm used to that's a pdf that shows up in my inbox yeah so this is actually so it's mobile application right so at this point in time in the ticketing process the nft ticket is kind of the underlying um technology but as an as a buyer all i see really is a is a ticket on a mobile application so they go on they buy their ticket they basically download say the guts ticket app they have their ticket and it just looks like a completely normal mobile ticket but this is a bespoke app that i have to have downloaded as part of this process and do all guts tickets live on the same app or like if i'm taylor swift and i'm issuing a guts ticket or i'm justin bieber and i'm issuing a guts ticket are those are those different apps or it's like all guts ticket one app i can get all of the tickets that use guts so yeah it's all all gets tickets on one app so every white labeler has their own application and that's yeah they all live on there okay and is there a cool piece of art like do all of your all of the the artists you work with do they you know artists as in comedian singer do they then pick visual artists to make their ticket look like an nft is is that part of the appeal to them or are they really just doing this for what we'll get into later which is like royalty secondary sales security yeah so they can do and actually that's something that's been a recent thing so basically these nft tickets uh they can have bespoke artwork right so until recently those nfe tickets lived on the mobile application and now those can be claimed by the end user distributed to the end user's wallet and that's where that visual side of it comes into play it's kind of like a collectible so any event organizer can really create some bespoke artwork that lives as the nft as the collectible so everyone has that kind of memento then when they do claim their nft ticket and that's perhaps something we we could uh discuss the whole nft claiming functionality yeah i i definitely think we should so but and so this is a new recent the kind of the this is a recent development it sounds like the fact that these tickets are now accessible and sort of an open wallet or can be moved to sort of an open wallet where everyone can see which is interesting to me and because i think the social signaling piece of ticketing i think is part of why i think it's such a no-brainer that eventually all tickets will be nfts because people want to socially signal that they went to their beyonce concert beyond just like the drunk selfie they took there right like you can show this ticket and it's a cool piece of work and it's some artists that beyonce found that's like amazing so yeah let's let's talk about that claiming function if that's sort of the new piece that has allowed for this social signaling component yeah 100 it goes it goes way beyond that of course but the the initial part is is proving that you were there so proof of attendance is an obvious one uh imagine how cool it could be if you could have you know tickets in your wallet from the last nirvana concert or whatever in the past those things would have inherent value personally but also even economically i would argue um you see these tickets from like the mets world series 1969 like sell on ebay for a bunch of money i know yeah so that's that's a super valuable um side of it uh which i think relates to a lot of people and it's we're in an interesting position where we are dealing with you know traditional folks who are already organizing events for many many years uh and artists who have been doing the same uh and are integrators around the world who are also dealing with these people there's a part of education around this topic that lies with us where we're showing these artists and event organizers saying hey there's a whole new world kind of that you can tap into by uh just putting a little bit more effort into this and thinking further than this cycle of okay someone buys a ticket shows up at the venue then throws a ticket right into the trash but instead it stays with you and it becomes as collectible you know for definition because it's in your wallet and if the artwork is cool because you thought about it beforehand that's going to create even more of a connection and it becomes this you know collector's item and then beyond that there's a whole plethora of sort of web 3 applications that you can get into in terms of community building and and interaction beyond that that can then eventually even lead to a new sales cycle so you kind of get this 360 never-ending kind of continuous uh sales cycle and and that i want to get into as well the way this can extend fan experiences and you know part of a pitch of this being the way it can improve the fan experience but on this claimable side because this ties into all of this in some ways it's the way you verify right that the person was actually at the concert it's explain what this claim function is and how it interacts with for example resales and updating people like what is the benefit of this claim function how does it work yeah so this this really comes into a combination of the mobile ticketing and like the fully digital ticketing and then the nft ticketing and when it's claimed so with the secondary sale with the uh ending ticket scalping that's kind of a part of the fully digital ticketing mobile application so we have for example a rotating qr code that cannot be screenshot there's a kind of a validation system there where it's tied to the mobile sim and then when in combination with the nft ticketing and the transparency side of thing where i can go on to the nft ticket explorer we have validated that ticket was legitimate the price that it was purchased for even the price of resale you've got that combination then and i think it's really that that yeah that that meld of of the fully digital ticking and the nfc ticketing that makes that unique and then when you have the nft claim functionality which is basically if i if that ticket when it's checked in at an event when i enter my ethereum address it is then distributed over polygon to that ethereum address when it's checked in at the event and that's kind of this claim functionality okay yeah i was thinking the check in i guess i was sort of using interchangeably with claim so it's sort of like checking in for a flight where like up to the point where you check into your flight in theory you could change your flight and you can you can't exchange it for you can't sell it to somebody else but you can like you can back out of it or move it or you know cancel it or whatever but once you've checked in that's it and it's locked so what i what i understand here and i think what you guys are saying is you you buy this ticket through this either online or through this app you then ultimately have this ticket on this app that ticket you can resell or not i guess those are really the two options and up until the point when you check in and that happens does it happen once you're at the event or you can do it at any point or you're nodding so it's at the event yeah yeah so first scan okay so you're at the event now you've now you check in and so now that's locked you can no longer resell that ticket and what's great for an event organizer it sounds like is now they have proof positive like who it exactly was who attended their event you have their phone number or their email address and it's not like in other ticketing scenarios where maybe i bought it but i then sold it to you oliver and you went to the concert and the event organizer has no idea that it wasn't actually me who attended and has no way to kind of track who was actually at their show that is that true is that part of this benefit 100 yeah 100 and uh so outside of also having their phone number in the email address you have their eth wallet now so you can go into all sorts of like loyalty rewards and yeah all sorts of exciting engagement stuff that never before was possible so we really see that collecting of that eth wallet as like a new way of collecting an email address as well where you know this is a a new way to reward like your biggest fans and and uh with all sorts of new web3 uh goodies essentially what are some of the coolest like goodies you've seen some of the folks you've worked with issue to their fans yeah so this is a big one where we're spending a lot of time on like in in terms of education uh like i just said like we're really showing people like this goes far and beyond what you're used to and that's basically not that much cool has happened yet but that's part of your jobs is to get people to start doing cool things yeah yeah so we're part of like some people already get it like some people come from the nft space like we have some people who are using their nft tickets to a previous event uh it was actually a metaverse event that then is used as a mint pass for a uh i think it's a game in the future so that's super awesome like we love that stuff uh and then we're also in the meantime explaining to the bigger artists like okay you can create it like a private discord for like anyone that's attended your events here and they have to prove that they had a ticket to the show and you can do like one-on-one interactions with your actual fans you can like show some unique content there or you know preview a song in in that environment uh so we're talking to a bunch of a bunch of artists about this and it's it's cool to see most of the younger artists are very receptive to it and and see the added value the the boomers uh takes a little bit of sway but uh we'll get there let's do a like a crisp run through in y'all's opinion what are like the three or four big reasons to go with nft blockchain ticketing over traditional ticketing or five reasons whatever you think it is but like boom boom boom here they are here's the pitch we give somebody if we're if we're really laying it all out for them yeah sure thing uh so i would first of all say the transparency of knowing exactly these are the tickets i've issued these are the ticket prices everyone can look everyone can verify that's one of the biggest ones the second one i think is honestly unlocking web3 it's like we say get protocol is kind of the bridge to web 3. and it's it's about using your nft tickets as a self-sovereign community building tool right like any nft ticket i issue now brings someone closer to me so any fan that has that nft ticket has a link to me i can then reward them i can foster that community that that doesn't live on one specific social media platform it lives in in the web 3 world and whatever i as an artist or event organizer want to plug into those people who have those nfc tickets now have access to that and i think that's a there's a massive point really that we want to sort of showcase especially in 2022 all these benefits and i think the third is like no ticket scalping right like that's a that's a massive one like why are we in an age with all of this technology still allowing third-party platforms that have not really put in the effort and haven't built that community to profit from it and that's something that we've been able to eradicate with the the fully digital ticketing uh so yeah those would be my top three so i want to push on the scalping piece of this because when i think of what scalping is i think of it as somebody buys tickets and then in my head it's somebody who's like at the stadium like reselling them right like i think about going to to use the mets example again mets games with my dad as a kid and we'd be like oh we're gonna like scalp tickets or whatever right they're always way overpriced but you're at the stadium and you're buying them for whatever you can get them for from people who are selling them there and to me that usa eradicating scalping but that and maybe i'm misunderstanding technically what scalping is i don't necessarily have a problem with that to me the flaw in that is that the artist or the sports team or whoever like isn't the one who's get that doesn't get a cut of that resale so it seems like it's not the elimination of scalping again unless i'm misinterpreting what scalping means it's the it's the lack of i guess transparency or the inability for the original artist to see any of those gains on the resale side is that true or how do you guys see that yeah similar yeah yeah so it's basically it's as you can see scalping as like tickets being taken out of the ecosystem of people adding value right so there was a big one of our biggest proponents initially really clicked we pitched the idea to him and he really became a huge ambassador it was like a huge comedian in the netherlands because people were coming up to him on the streets he's really like a man of the people he's like open to anyone after every show he stays he goes into the lobby and he stays and takes selfie with everyone until until they're gone and uh he was having issues where people would come up to the street in the streets and say uh hey i really want to go through a show but why is it 80 bucks for a ticket and he said it's not 80 bucks it's 20 bucks i'm consciously like suppress surprise and they're saying no it's 80 but i paid 80. so he was getting a lot of backlash on this because people weren't able to differentiate basically the pricing that they were getting on a third party site and they were seeing it as coming directly from him so that's a very clear instance of something that's troubling the artist not just monetary and not just about you know missing out on funds which is very valid and i think that's what makes it click for a lot of people because they look at the bottom line but there's also an image thing that comes into play there where they just want to take care of their fans and they put a lot of effort into it and then if someone comes in and buys up a bulk of the tickets and kind of extracts them from it from the from the ecosystem and puts them up for five times the original price that kind of ruins it for a lot of people uh and a lot of people aren't able to pay the money anymore and you kind of yeah you get a different audience and that's not what they want to do so that side of it i think is kind of maybe a little less sexy because it's not about like in insanely sexy i was being the crappy capitalist like where's the money and you guys were like well it's also about like being more inclusive and making sure that everybody can come to the show yeah and that's a valid thing that we also had to learn along the way like he this was a big problem for him just on a daily basis so that's what he was doing it for not just money because he's got enough money that's not the issue and so it's it and one of the features y'all allow for in your platform is that the artist then or the principal gets to set maximum resale values so resales are allowed and i'm assuming that the original artist can take a cut of those resales but they can also say you can't sell it for more than the base price of 20 or you can't sell it for more than 2x the original price they they have those kinds of price controls is that is that part of how this has been handled yeah yeah yeah and that and that like as a platform like for guts well because guts start in 2016 like way back it's like a crypto dinosaur age uh but for them we really focused on scalping because that was a problem to solve and and we did that by creating a closed loop and and adding all those features and making it really um yeah ux friendly but in terms of get protocol of course now we're offering this this suite of products and like people can integrate and and apply to their local markets like we've got teams in in the us in the uk we had an integrator in in south korea they might have different market situations or different plans for it and uh i mean it's definitely not like it has to be within a certain bandwidth they say we're fully okay with resale uh go for it that's up to them we're unlimited resale right where they say it can be at any price you can resell it you're saying again that's up to them yeah yeah yeah yeah well is it up to the artist selling the ticket or you're saying it's up to the if i'm a tick if i'm ticket master i can also i can i can determine that is that what you're saying so as a as a white label integrator you can set those rules and then you can discuss with your respective clients then who come on board to use your system uh their wishes and and uh meet those needs so it can be it's it can be individualized to the artist as well as the you know the ticket issuer can make those determinations yeah yeah and what if i were to list out what i see from my perspective as like the benefits and the selling points for nft ticketing my list would probably be fan experience the way you're able to prolong and improve the fan experience this way which is tied to being able to verify who was actually at your show as opposed to not really having any idea who rebought tickets that sort of fan experience being able to verify who was their piece to me the idea of being able to collect royalties as an artist on secondary sales of tickets and then third is this social signaling this sort of marketing benefit which is that now people can show off that they went to your concert so on this resale piece artists can can artists set royalties and say hey i want 10 20 50 of any resale value of this ticket or more to go directly into my pocket so the resaler isn't benefiting or you know is that something they can set those royalty rules yeah so all the resale value does go back to the event organizer of the artist the ticketing company because of the fact it is within that mobile application that none of the resale goes to any third-party platform so it does go directly back to the yeah the legitimate parties well but so so i guess what i'm asking is maybe a misunderstanding so if i'm a concert goer i buy a katy perry ticket for 100 bucks and now it's set up so that i can resell that for up to 200 and i'm still within the get protocol system i understand right so like if i'm going to resell it it has to be within the website set up for this or the guts tickets site for example or git protocol site and i now resell that ticket for 200. that 100 profit i made does any of that go to me or you're saying it's set up so that automatically all of that 100 profit goes to like if i'm reselling it it's because i can't go anymore and i want to recoup my money and maybe make a little money on it so can the artist set that they get 10 of that dollar profit or how does that work yeah so that's uh that's definitely able uh artists are event organizers are able to set the percentage uh of the of the resale to the secondary market so indeed you as a ticket seller if you're able to do it up to a certain percentage then you can do so and then the event organizer or the the ticket issuer takes the percentage cut that they choose or and disclose call okay currently that percentage royalty that say i collect as katy perry on my ticket is that embedded within the smart contract or that's embedded within the platform so that's the question and hopefully that's clear enough but i can elaborate if it's not yeah so that's part of the fully digital ticketing so that's that's less on the contract and the blockchain side of it that's more on the mobile ticketing the the fully digital ticketing uh because a lot of that comes down to you know like the the psp the payment service provider that they're using and baked into the fiat system that's available do you would it be ideal if it was something that was more smart contracts algorithmic automatic where in theory that ticket could move off of you know a get protocol platform and anywhere like would that be the ideal but we're just kind of not there yet for any number of reasons or or might not be able to get there for any number of reasons so i i think that's where we're headed uh indeed in terms of so it's two phases kind of right so you can see it as like an internal phase where it's within the the system uh before it gets checked in and then you have the collectible phase and then depending on how much uh effort i guess the artist or the event organizer puts into uh ascribing value to the collectible in terms of utility or visual art it becomes more and more interesting also to then monitor that that secondary market and profit off of that eventually if they want to do that so that's something that's definitely on our radar in terms of the smart contract element and royalty division of it and of course it's totally doable as we all know so it's like uh yeah it's two steps basically and this is kind of inherent with our kind of hybrid nature of approaching nft ticketing comes again from kind of our legacy of you know doing this for over six years and uh kind of being really uh with our ear to the ground in terms of what do uh the normies want what do the real people want at the end of the day and how do we service them and how do we bring all this cool stuff that we are seeing and that we have actually discovered or thought of into their world in a kind of frictionless way because you don't want to lose clients by kind of over complicating things but you do want to differentiate yourself and and the service that we offer with all this uh cool innovation that that we see and and are developing so it's a hybrid approach on that front and uh it's only going to get better now because more and more people also in the mainstream event industry are of course seeing the light in terms of nfts and what they can mean initially that'll rely heavily on the collectible nature of it but as kind of web 3 grows and as you can see as we can kind of excavate some more really cool use cases for it in terms of interaction engagement and sort of rewards i guess it's definitely gonna keep moving in that direction and and those use cases will grow and will become more mainstream no doubt where do you all primarily operate right now like are you are you internet international but mostly in europe where where are your clients where do you tend to operate yeah so it's it's honestly global and that's something that 2021 that was the mission right scaling it globally making sure the underlying infrastructure was available to handle a high throughput of tickets from across the globe by a number of integrators by a number of people buying tickets so we have you know we have white labelers we have one in america we've got one in korea we've got a digital twinner being integrated i believe in colombia so it's yeah it's about bringing it to everyone and making it as accessible as possible axe infinity is a game universe filled

actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index

polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse what are the biggest obstacles like this is such a no-brainer to me and again i laid out the three big benefits i see but i think a fourth which we can dive into is the ability to automatically update things about the event to people in a way that you can't currently because again you don't know technically who holds the ticket anymore once you know somebody resells it dive into that but there's so many benefits to this it's such a no-brainer like why why isn't taylor swift katy perry justin bieber beyonce like why aren't they all doing this already yeah they should check their email no it's uh i think it's a gradual process i think you have to be realistic about this also in terms of translating i see us where i see our task really as also translating the world of nfts and the benefits of nfts and web3 features to these mainstream artists and their management who understandably have got a lot going on already and if you bring them stuff that sounds kind of cool but maybe kind of confusing or complex they'll just wait until it's easier and i think there's a big opportunity for us which we're doing and that's showing results in just kind of taking uh what we see uh really kind of deep into the weeds of the yeah blockchain space and comfortably translating that into uh you know normiespeak and kind of bringing that in into their world in terms of very clear added value meaning brand engagement or offense fan loyalty rewards the bottom line of course unfortunately a lot of it is about money so your capitalistic instinct is very correct i think that's that's very fair but you need to kind of slowly introduce them to it and and um take the time to welcome them into it and kind of bridge that gap by being very clear and very showing some tangible added value i will i obviously asked the question about the obstacles but i'll i can share a story that i think backs up why this is a little bit of a struggle some people know i was the finance director for andrew yang's presidential campaign man run for president here in the states and dave chappelle this was back in 2019 i guess wanted to was it was an is yang supporter and was going to do a show and ticket sale proceeds go to the campaign which was like as people could probably imagine a huge deal for us we were this underdog candidate you know hustling for money and now dave chappelle's gonna do basically a fundraiser for you the only problem was that we we couldn't sell tickets through ticketmaster because as a campaign we needed all sorts of additional verification like kyc on the people who donate to us it had to be you had to be a us citizen we needed to get like your occupation like silly things like that that we couldn't verify or do via ticketmaster so we we're selling these tickets through like a bespoke act blue page that's where you know that's like the fundraising platform for democratic candidates here and we're like whatever it's a dave chappelle concert like not going to be a problem it was a nightmare we could not sell these tickets out and this was a show for like charleston south carolina or something like you know people love dave and his manager called me like freaking out at one point being like this is a dave chappelle show like dave doesn't not sell out concerts like like this has to sell out this is dave chappelle this crazy and we couldn't sell it out and it was i think the it being just a different experience than fans were used to it was very confusing to people people are used to just going on ticketmaster like and so we ultimately had to switch back to ticketmaster we weren't able to make as much money on it as we should have as the campaign like it it's so much more frictious i think than people realize to get the masses to change their typical system yeah right i guess i'm curious sort of off of that story because it sounds like the experience you're giving to the the concert goer or to the fan does mirror a ticketmaster experience it's fiat you're not asking them their occupation in order to buy you have to verify that they're a u.s citizen you have to do those sort of extraneous steps that we had to do but have you found that ticket buyers have hesitations here or is it only in ural's case really the the musician or or star themselves who's hesitant to switch up their systems yeah so no it's it's really we spent a lot of time on making sure that the ux is totally user-friendly like we started out like in the beginning it was a lot of dutch theater folks who are like 60 plus you know you know just definition boomer boomer folks who are gonna have a tough time a few complicated stuff for them so we really thought all right this is a great benchmark set these people need to get in the door and like we averaged about a transaction time of like 40 seconds uh early on just getting through buying a ticket so it's not on that side for sure it's it's really on on the event organizers side and it's not that huge of a blocker i would say it's just a matter of time so it's also in terms of like a lot of ticketing deals are set for a certain amount of years so especially in the bigger venues or sports teams they have deals for yeah five plus years uh sometimes so that's just gonna take some time to decouple and and then kind of seize that opportunity in terms of the creator because that's really who we're speaking to the most uh i think that it makes the most sense to them directly so we've had several instances where once we speak to the actual creator themselves the artist they see the value in having the direct connection with the fan they're able to like text their ticket holders directly it's 100 sure these people are holding their tickets currently on their mobile phone that makes sense to them they want that that's when they start uh thinking about the possibilities and then when you compound that with like the collectible potential in terms of just like uh extending basically the the connection to these uh to these fans beyond them buying a ticket and showing up to the show and then losing them afterwards because like you said before in traditional tickets you don't even know who shows up actually because it could have been resold eight times and the email address that you got from the initial buyer is in no way relevant at that point so if you want to change venue if you wanna do any type of after sale or or follow-up it's impossible and with the system it's not so those tangible those tangible benefits are really what's going to make the difference and so through our white labeling we've got the dutch market kind of knows about us and and uh yeah they're annoyed about us like here come the the the blockchain guys who know everything better and are changing the world and yeah it's happening that way and it's going actually super well in holland and now our integrators across the globe are doing the same thing in their respective markets so uh the us is next we've got a really great integrator with like relic tickets coming up and we've it's it's gonna take kind of slightly different approaches in in different markets because yeah no country's the same and no markets the same but it's just a matter of time honestly uh the benefits are there it's just a matter of tweaking it for for every user in every market yeah in a couple years it'll be everywhere so y'all were the first to really do this like get protocol or guts tickets was like as far as i can see sort of like the first nft blockchain ticketer but now there have been there are competitors that have sprung up can you talk about some of your biggest competitors and not to make you talk somebody else's book but but maybe so talk yourselves up in in comparison or like how how are you guys approaching this differently than others or is it all operating this way what's like the broader landscape for for nft ticketing look like yeah sure thing so first of all i think 2021 has honestly seen a fantastic number of of uh new players in the nft ticketing space as a space as a whole it's grown massively there's a lot more interest in it which is fantastic i mean i'm of the opinion that a rising tide lifts all boats you know and um what what we're we're really interested in is it come back it comes back to accessibility right it's like everyone should be able to use this everyone should be able to benefit from it we don't want to put the complexity on the attendee right so you want to keep the complexity under the hood i think there are some nft ticket projects that have gone from more of the bespoke route where it's like you do need a metamask wallet to start with uh it will you know be web 3 from the beginning which i i think is cool i think it's cool it's a bit different from our ethos which is like if my mom wants to attend an event i want my mom to be able to attend the event and not have to you know ask a bazillion questions and be really confused about it but yeah i think that i think it's a really promising space in general and i think it's going to benefit as more and more people understand the the benefits of nfts and the access into web3 and that's what we're seeing now so which is great uh on the like on the scaling side of things i mean obviously we use polygon and we've done that for a number of reasons like be it the throughput rate of how many nft tickets if there's like a massive sell on one day can it handle say a hundred thousand mints you know uh can it handle like a consequent like rising of protocol usage uh is it evm compatible are there like a bunch of different high highly established projects already on there that's kind of why we chose polygon and that's really worked out well for us i'd say so it is the scaling side of things i think that sets like get protocol apart from other nft ticking projects so the the ethereum address that you're that that's interesting the idea that a lot of these other companies are going the route of starting with metamask but we talked about earlier how one of the benefits here is that as a ticket issuer you do have people's ethereum addresses for follow-up afterwards so it sounds like you do ultimately need to input an address or have an eth address it just doesn't come at that first stage where you buy with fiat is that the way it goes or how does how do you reconcile that yeah so exactly it's it's everyone should be able to attend the event if people want to access the web 3 that's the optionality there right so it's like if i've checked in my ticket i've then got the option of do i want to claim that nft ticket do i want that distributed to my address and then to access that web three so that's when the user enters their ethereum address the nfc ticket is distributed that's kind of the web three angle and then we've kind of got that web to front that anyone can use so that web three piece is sort of the the optional side of this and it at that point is when it's become sort of on on chain and a token yeah so do you guys have the percentages of for the people who have used your system thus far what percent end up claiming it and and using the nft web3 piece of it yeah i don't have the don't have the percentages just yet i think this will vary greatly for uh event organizer and eventually per integrator because we can also see really big difference between our white labelers like some are really crypto native and are totally forward about this and and want to go for it and maximize the potential there and totally see it then we have some kind of traditional ticketeers who just want to improve on their ux and ticketing service and focus on that part and not so much just yet on the nft extras and so you'll see a great discrepancy there i think initially between the the claims uh between those two and the same goes for event organizer and it also really depends on how much how much effort they put into it and how much added value they insert into the nfte kind of before it goes on sale essentially uh and and what type of utility and and art they are ascribing to it so no numbers just yet but uh it's gonna be really uh oscillating for a while in terms of like okay this artist has eighty percent this one has maybe two percent and then as we also as a company kind of are able to publicly show these use cases for what it adds and how we can actually include this uh within ticket sales uh i think we'll start to see you grow more and more across the board you guys mentioned when we talked before this that the ultimate goal here is for this to be a dow and and sort of dow owned and run can you explain why you think that what that would actually look like you know between now and there what what is the evolution that's making that possible yeah so this is the long-term goal of the protocol right so it's it's full dow governance and that the users of the dao would be like the ticketing integrator the event organizer the artist a get community member so it's aligning all of those people to run the protocol as a dao and we are slowly transitioning towards a doubt for example last year we have the unchained tokenomics we've got the nfc tickets which are fully transparent and on chain as well so it's building that infrastructure up so that everything is transparent and accessible on chain and now it's the case of over the years and we think it's probably you know it's a five to ten year long term transition but it is giving more ownership and governance to the integrators into the the parties using the protocol and did the reason to delay that the reason that you've described for all of these obstacles which is simply education and and that the people you're working with aren't necessarily an ft and blockchain native from the get so giving them power to vote here on things they don't understand wouldn't be productive is that what the delay is about or are there other reasons to to take that long timeline yeah so i think education is a big part of it i also think it you know it's because you've got so many complex business deals that are in existing in the uh events industry that's another big part of it and you know when you're trying to educate people on the blockchain and the nft ticket side of things if you all of a sudden throw in and hang on a second when you integrate then you know you need to figure out what kind of fee structures there are straight from the get-go it's a bit too much complexity um so i think it is the case of breaking it down making it more accessible aligning all of the integrators i think that's another big part the alignment around it so yeah that's why we kind of think it is a long-term transition and tell me about how y'all do monetize this as of right now yeah sure uh so we have the get token so the get token can kind of be thought of as the fuel and accounting system every single ticket that is sold and issued through the protocol is fueled by get the benefit of this of course is the fact that it is a transparent on-chain tokenomic structure which gives a clear and concise pricing it's also accountability and the benefit is because it's global ticketing you don't need to then worry about having the payment systems be through fiat for a ticketing company instead it can be all on chain so whereas maybe you may have like some smaller countries and the ps visa would be a bit of a nightmare to integrate you can actually like top up the get fuel tickets done all on the blockchain and so maybe to break that down for folks get is the fuel that allows transactions to go through when you issue somebody a ticket you sell a ticket any all of that is fueled via this get token anybody who's listening to the show is probably relatively familiar with how this all works you've used you eat as your fuel before any number of other tokens and that get needs to be purchased essentially by the ticket issuers who are fully responsible for paying the get gas fees essentially anytime there are interactions on the network and so y'all earn money on the buying of that get is that basically how this works so that's how the protocol makes money in terms of like the government structure there are then off chain fees for the sort of like the ticketing and business side of things just how like a normal ticketing company would operate but yeah all of the the fees and the the uh expenses necessary to run the protocol are done with on-chain accounting via get and then guts tickets being sort of a client almost of the get protocol has its own set of fees that get issued back to guts tickets essentially yep got it okay so i want to close here with going back to sort of the history of this a little bit and and i don't like to over focus on prices of things but i think they are interesting so we're kind of two moments i wanted to ask you about one some initial funding for this whole project happened via an ico back i guess probably was it when when the end of 2017. and i heard martin one of your co-founders describe how they did this this ico for forget during like the ico craze and they raised about six million dollars through it which was less than they had wanted to and sort of his frustration because he was like we actually have a product so many of these other icos are launching and have nothing it reminds me of nft things going on today right like have no real clear vision and they're raising 50 million dollars why do you think get sort of ico fell below the kind of original goal what was the obstacle there yeah so uh honestly a lot of it was timing um if you look at when it actually happened it was like right at the peak of the craze of the 2017 ico bull run and when it actually did then occur we had that kind of the whole meltdown so i think a lot of it was timing another thing was honestly the fact that at that time we were aware that this was a thing we were going to build this was very much early doors and we didn't want to sort of i guess we had a bit of a dutch mentality which was like you know okay we'll promote what we have build build build promote then what we have whereas at the time that kind of gets drowned out a bit i don't want to pinpoint any specific projects but i think it gets drowned out a bit by people who are promising the long-term vision unless so what is actually available right now so you didn't over promise and you think that was your problem it could have been yeah okay okay i i believe that y'all are very earnest people that i could see that hurting you from a like you know when there's all this hype kind of era standpoint and then also speaking of prices this year i know get hit this sort of huge peak in march of this year i think the token skyrocketed to like nine dollars a token and it has since sort of seen a kind of steady decline back down to around two dollars a token what do you attribute that to like tell us the story of the last whatever year and and sort of what that has all represented yeah yeah it's pretty crazy it's i think you need to zoom out a little bit further than that to get the full story so we were at cents for what seemed like ages multiple years there was a joke amongst our community members that we were stablecoin and uh of course we weren't uh and then we caught yeah of course a lucky break because we were working on nft ticketing and of course the nft boom then happened and we were like whoa well we're actually extremely well positioned to catch this wave so we got caught up in that and i think a lot of people started to see the use case started to see utility for it and we yeah saw a huge uptick in terms of interest in our services and also just in social chatter reddit stuff like that so that's when it showed up to i think it touched ten dollars briefly which uh we had a promise that we would get get tattoos at ten dollars so i think we did that not yet but uh but you made the promise so you the promise is out there yeah oh yeah we need to do it at some point what's the tattoo yeah like the number 10 or what's the it's going to be the get logo i think which i could live with i could tell my grandchildren that yeah so then it was at 10 which is yeah like briefly then it went down and went back down uh gradually and then it kind of it's now at around two bucks it was at three for a while i would really describe that to also we have a very clear and transparent tokenomics system that directly relates to the amount of events that we do and of course with covid the amount of physical events that you can do around the world is quite limited so we spent the whole pandemic basically onboarding new integrators and getting everyone kind of ready and set up around the world but then the actual number of events and ticket sales that you can put on is quite limited so that kind of dampened the continuation of the the the price rise uh just because the daily needs like you we can we have sub graphs of like you know where people can query kind of like the daily usage of the get token in terms of the ticketing activity that's super low now at least it's way lower than what we were expecting and now with kind of like the end of lockdown sort of coming around around the corner like in october 21 uh in holland everything was opened back up again and we immediately saw like a huge uptick in terms of usage of the ticketing and i believe we're going to see the same let's say hopefully in a couple months or at least later this year when things start to uh restrictions start to ease around the world and i do believe the way we position it which i personally with as a as a dutchman i'm quite happy about this kind of like honest direct correlation with our token price to the tickets that we're selling because that's really the way we designed it so that also means that once covert restrictions die down we should see a huge uptick in terms of usage and hopefully who knows also the the token price so not financial advice but suggesting that folks might want to go get some get yeah where do folks go to query that number of you know tickets being sold yeah so we've got two platforms really so for the tickets it's our nft ticket explorer which is explorer.getprotocol.org have you sent that to me we're going to put that in the show notes absolutely absolutely and that basically gives a real-time transparent overview of all the ticketing activity what i really like about it is our our product designer he really made it kind of feel alive so when you're on there you actually do see new tickets just sort of pop up in real time and so you get this like broad overview of the all the nft ticketing activity happening but you can also select each and every ticket so if i just want to i can click a ticket i can see yeah the the image design i can see when it was sold i can see like the resale price you can see the steps of it basically it's tickets life cycle and the nice thing is then that also gives a link to the blockchain so if i want to get the technical background i click the blockchain link i've got polygon scan up then i can really dive into it so that's the ticketing side of it and we've got the tokenomics side of it so as all of you mentioned there's a sub graph so the graph is a project they basically allow you to query an api you can then see all of like the get tokenomic usage across a number of different queries awesome we will link to those so that folks can go check it out for themselves okay where do you all see dream scenario where is guts tickets and get protocol in 2 five ten years so in my dream scenario i would say it is get protocol is this decentralized protocol that provides full accessibility to not only a beautiful ticketing solution but also to web three right is the web3 bridge for the event industry if i'm an event organizer and i want to foster my web3 community i issue about a bunch of nfc tickets for a bunch of different events it all connects back to my community and from then i can plug into a number of web3 platforms and really foster that community and just like have it as a self-fulfilling cycle right that brings people back to more events so yeah and i would say having a bunch of different integrators then all doing that kind of thing how many years away are we from that i said two five or ten what are you putting your money on where are you putting your smart get tokens on i'm saying too honestly because i think um i think the the functionality is there it's now making it super frictionless super seamless that's kind of the onus and i don't think we're too far away from it oliver what's your bet how far away yeah go yeah i definitely go with two i think we spent the last year kind of getting us ready for scaling and and really making sure that we can offer these services at a massive level which is a bigger task than it might uh seem from the outside because you have to deal with a lot of real world stuff and demands and reliability it's the biggest one so i think we're ready for it i think within two years we're gonna have some real kick-ass uh integrators on the books and we're gonna see all sorts of uh yeah real mainstream integrations and and usage of of the tech because everyone sees it the benefits are there uh so it's kind of time to uh time to put it in practice and really uh see how far this horse can run and how far away are we from all tickets every time anybody sports music etc issues a ticket it is an nft i'd say five years on that one when people are fully like when there are a lot of different non-custodial custodial solutions a fully scalable blockchain that's maybe an l2 roll-up for example um yeah i would say five years yeah yeah i always agree with colby so uh it doesn't change here hell yeah five years five years makes sense yeah for sure agreed well thank you both so much i really appreciate you joining me today this is awesome i'm so excited like i said it at the beginning of the show i'm so bullish on nft ticketing and it was so great for both of you to walk walk this through walk us through all this and uh really taking it step by step with me i know i have a lot of tell me exactly how this works types questions so i appreciate y'all and uh can't wait to have you back on in a couple years and see where we are
