2.5 million people just created crypto wallets using Reddit and no one noticed 40 000 nfts were sold at various price ranges from 10 to 100 and they sold out they never used the word nft they just used digital collectible and they sold it with a credit card so not nfts that are actually nfts were sold with credit cards and 30 artists released 40 000 avatars and they all sold out and so what's the lesson here don't call them nfts don't make them use crypto and just charge them credit cards and that worked there's now perhaps like millions of people who don't know that they just bought an nft on a blockchained with a real crypto wallet yes
