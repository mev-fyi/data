what is volt and how have you applied all these principles that we've talked about so far in the podcast to building full there was a time when volt was actually going to be a fork of rye focused on long tail defy asset lending and thinking that that would be a very effective way to do an inflation resistant stable coin with a floating price but targeting the inflation rate return so offering a lower borrow rate than maybe people were already paying it for those long tail assets but more return to the users we ended up moving away from that just because of kind of the complexity of the ry implementation and it's really made to be immutable and just be so we moved away from that to uh the dye like model right with the psm and also you know thinking that blending would be this major component of it directly issuing vault through fuse the bad part about this model is the magic numbers you know and i had always intended to make it more market-based in various ways but as the market conditions have changed i think we've come to understand that it's not necessarily destiny that unchained yields will always be super high and while there are those higher yields out there they require you to move significantly farther on the risk curve
