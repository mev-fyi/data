[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david i felt like this was a master class a master class in web 3 a master class in crypto we had chris dixon on the podcast we went through five mental models that are essential listening material essential understanding i think if you're on the crypto journey and you're trying to understand everything that's going on in this new era of transformation what were some of your thoughts and takeaways uh from this episode i particularly enjoyed how all these mental models bled into one and you can definitely hear chris's just uh stream of consciousness his train of thought as to how he came about these mental models and each one of these mental models is both a tweet thread and also a post on chris's website so you can follow along on his website as well if you want to do that uh and uh we we go through just the gamut of why web3 actually gets the designation of three the primitives behind the establishment of web 3 tokens as a digital primitive as a digital version of a new website also the difference between what chris calls the take rate or basically the fees that platforms charge and how the lowering of a take weight rate in web 3 turns from revenue into economies and extrapolation on that and then of course his uh the famous um everything kind of starts out all innovations start out as a toy and how the early blockchain just mimics the same sort of early innovations that we've seen across other investment paradigms that we've seen in the past and so really just a comprehensive lesson on both what is web3 why is it why is it valuable and also how to invest as well yeah it really covered everything and chris is like um well let's see i mean he's he knows what he's doing in this space like he knows what he's doing when it comes to venture and he's seen so many of these patterns play out before and now he's like applying these patterns to crypto i gotta say there are different lenses through which you can view crypto you know one popular lens is some people only see crypto as sort of a money solution right um kind of the money lens of crypto others uh think about like you know the bank list being like defy sort of movement others think that this is a web three big disruption to um to tech incumbents you know still others think about the metaverse i think like we probably view it as all of those things simultaneously at once and i do think that the the term web 3 has um increasingly had validation over the past year or so i think some people were jaded myself included were a little bit jaded with the term coming out of 2017 2018 where it seemed like all of these nebulous ico concepts and startups that were going to create a new decentralized internet were emerging but actually didn't really deliver much and so the money narrative i think at that time seemed strongest and firmest and that's why i think we we saw d5 sort of arise out of that and i was a proponent of that i mean if someone asked me in 2018 2019 what is web 3 and be like i don't really know what you mean by web 3 because it hasn't been developed i like the ideas of of self-sovereignty and um you know obviously that i think there's potential in disrupting some but people were talking about like yeah let's create a decentralized social media platform on the 15 transactions per second ethereum instance and it's just like no that's not going to happen right now that's not going to happen first so all of this to say chris has a very web 3 centric lens but that lens on the world and how it's going to impact both tech music industries gaming industries all sorts of consumer product industries all of these different industries has received a massive amount of validation over the past 12 months ago and even since we last spoke which is really cool we bring all of that into the conversation today at the tail end of the the bear market there was definitely that difference between like there's defy and then there's web 3 and these things are not the same and i think the way that chris frames what web 3 is really i think vindicate some of the early ideas of what defy was defy is really about lowering the costs of performing financial transactions with other people but chris would say this is it's it's creating a platform a network with a lower take rate and so he's really just talking about the extrapolation from web 1 to web 2 to web 3 as who is providing the services and who gets to capture the wealth and chris's version of web 3 is much more in line with web one in that individuals and communities crop up make value and share value amongst themselves and then also the difference now is that these web 3 platforms can also provide services towards the rest of the whole entire world without having a central operator take what chris says is upwards of larger than 50 percent of the value that's created instead we have something like zero to ten percent of the value that's created is collected by these web three protocols so guys we go through that we go through the five mental models it's just a toy web three tokens are the new websites your take rate is my opportunity networks become economies and then we conclude with what a16z is doing this in the space a look at regulatory and then chris gives us some fantastic parting wisdom so make sure you stay tuned to the end super cycle does he believe in that or maybe something a little bit different maybe a riff on that and of course if you are a premium subscriber make sure you tune in to the debrief that david and i will do with our thoughts and reflections on this episode we record those after the episode for all of our bankless premium subscribers available on the premium feed so without further ado we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uni swap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access baking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lydo.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your stake go to lydo.fi to get started bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest he needs no introduction he's been on bank list before this is chris dixon he's a partner at a16z where he leads crypto investing last time we spoke to chris was january 2021 if i'm recalling correctly so that's like roughly 10 years ago i think in crypto times how are you doing chris it's great to have you guys great thanks for having me thanks good to see you guys david yeah yeah it's been a while but you haven't aged a day even though it's been like a very long time in crypto years was that meme it's like the interstellar meme where it's like you know it's like four hours down here it's not the gravity or something yeah fantastic movie by the way all right so um i actually thought it was wasn't it defy summer i thought it was over a year ago anyway it was yeah it was twice just at the end of defy summer i feel like i was here at defy summer but it was it was before nft mania let's see if we're doing charting this encrypted just after d5 summer things were in kind of a lull before eath went on a tear and bitcoin had just done okay nfts were barely a thing there was no such thing as crypto gaming right let's see what else happened so many other things it's been such an eventful year all right well let's talk about this because actually for for the listeners um we wanted to start this episode maybe a little bit differently than our others we wanted to make this kind of a canonical bankless episode um i mean we're going to discuss a16z and what you're doing crypto because we can't not you guys just raised a casual you know 2.2 billion dollars i think back in june so we're definitely going to discuss that it's probably going to be near the end but really where we wanted to turn your brain at first is um for the listener chris is not only a brilliant investor he's a master of mental models dave and i love mental models on bank lists we think these are like shortcuts for understanding how to approach the space it's a way to connect the dots it's the fastest way possible to connect the dots and like for for those of you who aren't familiar with mental models first of all i bet i bet you are familiar with mental models because you use them all the time your day life but it's just a framework that you can carry with you to help explain something help explain how the world works and in crypto we think this is the fastest way to get you from like 0 to 60 on a subject because it's like compressed information okay this is like a zk roll up for your mind so so we love mental models and we're actually going to spend the first part of this going through a number of mental models that chris has helped develop for this industry to help individuals understand it david you look like you want to say something about mental bottles i know you love them too yeah absolutely just in time for thanksgiving and christmas for you to sharpen your sticks and take them home to your families to explain what the hell this whole crypto thing is yeah they're going to be asking you at the thanksgiving get together what what's going on in crypto these days you know that so we're going to dive into five mental models today i'm just gonna list them off and then we're getting chris's brain on each of the um the first is a mental model that that i call it's just a toy okay why new technologies are dismissed so we'll touch on that the second is web three how do crypto people have the audacity to call this thing web three we just like created a whole new era of the internet we gotta talk about that as a mental model the third is tokens as the new websites um interesting the fourth is this is a bezos quote your take rate is my opportunity what do we mean about that in the context of the transition from web 2 to web 3 the fifth is networks becoming economies that is a paradigm shift so those are the five models uh but before we get into the models chris you're a master of mental models why do you like them so much what's the value of a mental model yeah i think i think that um i think it's a little bit sort of like all all of what scientists do for example or anyone trying to anyone trying to predict the future right you need to the world is so complex you know eight billion people uh you know economics physics biology it's way too complex for anyone to understand and so what you do i think when you try to predict the future and this this would apply if you were a scientist so it applies if you're an investor it implies applies if you're an entrepreneur or anyone who's sort of concerned with you know thinking about how do these really complex systems evolve um you need simplifications you need ways you need ways to kind of take very complex things and distill them and find patterns and so to me that's what these mental models are and they come from you know they come from as with anyone who works full-time and working you know in the space for eight years and basically full-time in in crypto for five years um and my whole career in technology and this is sort of you know these are the models i've sort of i've developed to help to help my own thinking and my own investing and and also you know i think as part of kind of our philosophy of investing and working with entrepreneurs we'd like to also share these with the with the world um and look it's partly i think it's partly to hopefully it's a resource for people but i also think you know it in the end our job is to be the place that entrepreneurs want to go to work with and i think a lot of entrepreneurs appreciate that if you kind of help them along in their entrepreneurial journey they think they think that's valuable [Music] yeah so i think it's fundamentally about [Music] about understanding and predicting the world and one of the things i find so fascinating about the the space that we work in web 3 crypto is it's just sort of endlessly interesting like you know that meme where the the guy is lying in bed and he's like she's like what are you thinking about him this is the one topic in my life where i have never run out of interesting things to think about like i'm i'm never bored wait really like more so than like i mean you were here for the early days of the internet too or like the early days of web yeah i don't know i think it's more i think it's more interesting maybe because i'm in the middle of it more but i think that this this you know because this like think about it you think about like for example like we have different practice areas in our in our in our crypto group right i think like at least three different areas so we have infrastructure defy and sort of nfts in gaming and then maybe a fourth area of sort of emerging areas and you know in the infrastructure one like you get all of computer science in there it's a fascinating area my partner ali kind of leads that effort but i i sort of you know moonlight doing that and it's just endlessly interesting like now we're getting deep into kind of zk stuff and cryptography and you know spent years on kind of the various kind of scaling kind of concerns so that's just endlessly interesting it's computer science but you're also reasoning about you know what application what people use these things for and and then you have the whole community aspect right of like a blockchain is not just a computer it is a computer in the sense that it runs code and stores information but it's also a community and a network right so you have this human aspect to it you have economics you have game theory i don't think and then you go to nfts and you have all of that plus culture plus media plus gaming right and then you go to d5 and you have all that plus finance and you know yield farming and degens and just all this like fascinating kind of cultural stuff so i i just think it like there's like 10 for me at least it's feel i feel like the 10 things i've been interested in my life like programming economics game theory culture you know it all kind of comes together and this is like the this is like the great big most fascinating thing ever yeah that's my view i mean that's that's why i'm so fired up about it i'm sure you i i expect them to be preaching to the choir here but but uh and so yeah so i spent a lot of time you know i spend most of my time meeting with entrepreneurs and and learning from them and then i spend sort of the rest of my time beyond i mean i do have a personal life and everything else but like so i don't make sound like i only work but i do work a lot but but i spend the rest of my time kind of processing all that information and trying to come up with ways to understand it and that's i think that's where a lot of these mental models come from chris how has your relationship with mental models progressed throughout your time unpacking the internet you are an internet veteran you've kind of seen it blossoming from all of its forms how has you how have you used mental models and how have your mental models developed uh from one web one to web two and then also how has web 3 really changed the game with like needing mental models yeah a great question i mean i think the la like the last time i was really excited about the internet was was 2009 to 11 i'd say which to me was the golden period of mobile um and that was a really exciting time i think one of the fascinating things about that there were a bunch of interesting things um it was a you know it's interesting first of all it was really underestimated it it seems like today you know the iphone came out in 2007 the app store in 2008 and it's very easy to tell a story that it was just sort of okay mobile's the thing and that's it it wasn't the case so like a very important moment was facebook's mobile pivot in 2012. so 2012 was really in my mind 2012 was the year that the world real the tech world realized that mobile is not the secondary computing platform it's the primary computing platform so people knew it was a thing and it was important and it was growing but the to the extent to it specifically touch-based smartphones like you know there were many many cell phones but there was a lot of controversy as to whether they were look they were really expensive go look at that steve but it's the infamous steve ballmer video about the iphone and no one's going to buy it it's so expensive the idea of people paying a thousand dollars for a phone just seemed kind of crazy of course what they weren't thinking through was i think what they underestimated is first it's not a phone it's a super computer internet connects a super computer right which is worth a thousand dollars and secondly this is this is the hardest this is the most important thing with computing new computing waves is is there there was this exponential improvement curve that it went on okay and and it it was partly the phone itself if you take a phone today an iphone today and compare it to an iphone 2011 it's gotten much much better right just in terms of the performance and the camera but what's really gotten better are the applications right now you go on and you have just an endless stream of entertainment you have the smartest people in the world on twitter you have you know tick-tock dance videos you have ephemeral messaging you've got a million games it's a it's a you know it's a giant rich ecosystem right and so it just got and those two things this is one of the things that happens in computing waves and by the way i'll get back to crypto i believe we might be in that golden period now that's one reason i'm so in in blockchain crypto web 3. um in the really good golden period you get this you get this feedback loop so you've got the application developers coming in and doing cool new stuff which in turn drives more users and money into the infrastructure layer meaning like the phone or the blockchain and that gets better and as that gets better that unlocks so we're you know that unlocks new applications we're already seeing this i'm sure like for example in the l2 world right now that you've got real ethereum l2s you're now going to have a new class of applications now that you've got other l1 that are built for for like gaming use cases an example that's going to unlock a whole nother range of kind of games as an example or nft use cases anyways so that you know so going back that was a very exciting time and what was so fun about it is you had this new thing in your pocket is this gps connected smartphone with a camera what are you going to do with it right that's the creative thing so you know travis says hey i think that the cool thing to do would be to build a worldwide network of you know uber network and ride sharing and you can click a button and this thing magically shows up right um instagram says you know i think that now this is going to change there were photo sharing sites before but they were like these snap fish like get your family photos printed kind of thing this is going to change kind of the way that people consume create and consume photography media video and so forth right so new this very creative period of people thinking of new use cases um and so and the early web had this kind of thing too what the the internet i think is kind of had four important distinct phases there was web one where you know there's sort of this explosion of stuff in the 90s and and the key feature there it was governed by open protocols which meant that because sergey and larry and other entrepreneur you know that all the kind of me you know pierre omidar ebay google amazon because they're open protocols they knew they could build internet services that they would truly own and control that no one could kind of rug pull them the way that you get rug pulled on the platform on on the iphone or on facebook or something but that first wave those applications were what i call skeuomorphic they were they took kind of things that were from the offline world like magazines and put them on the internet and so a lot of the websites were just kind of one way you were just reading stuff and then there was this next period in the 2000s where a new wave of entrepreneurs came along and they said wait a second no these are computers and you can read and write and put code and do all sorts of other things and that's when you had first this kind of early phase where you had you have to you probably never heard of them but like things like flickr and delicious and the whole and six degrees early social networking and there was kind of people you know they were kind of the they were building kind of the early primitives and the early ideas and then you had mark zuckerberg and eva williams and jack dorsey and other people take those and package them up really beautifully and boom that was web 2. and then web 2 got accelerated by mobile which was sort of another layer of interesting stuff that happened on top and then i think we had a period of just kind of incumbent domination between 2012 and 20 or something you know where apple and google is out of these companies get bigger and bigger and the internet is now at a precarious point where it could turn into kind of tv where you have like four channels like cbs and npc like tv in the 70s or something which i think we'd all agree with well that's that's what the that's what the great the the great cause that we're all fighting for here is to keep the internet open and interesting and not like that right um but then yeah and then you had this as you you both well know you had this kind of counter trend that's began to develop obviously originally with with satoshi and then i think very importantly with vitalik and ethereum and then i think that's led to really kind of a explosion and these feedback loops that i've described before an explosion of innovation and and now i think you know i think that i think we could be in that moment that golden period moment i remember very much in mobile like i was there we knew mobile was a big deal but it's very hard to know when you're in a process is it linear or exponential because you're sitting on one point and you don't really know how fast it's going have there been some things chris where like you thought they were exponential they turned out to be linear yeah that's a good point that's um i mean look i i started a machine learning company in 2008 and i was clearly too early on that it was called hunch it was acquired by ebay in 2011. um and i and i if you'd asked me and i you know in 2008 i said this is going to be the thing it's going to change the world ai is finally at a point where it's going to it's going to it's really going to happen ai had like a 50-year period of kind of false start you know going back to alan turing who predicted that i forget exactly but someone would pass would you know pass a turing test would trick would be able to simulate act like a human i think he said within 30 years or something way overly optimistic the field was seen as kind of a disappointment and i believed that people were underestimating and so i created this company and we had this recommendation technology ai stuff and i think i was right i just unfortunately was too early and you know that's as they say in venture too early is the same as being wrong so i guess i was wrong but um i think i think that look there's certainly technology kind of trends that people get excited about that don't fully pan out a lot of times though i think it's too early i think vr is a good example where i think you know we invested i led our investment in oculus in 2013 and i thought it was three years away i think it's actually right around the corner right now i think it's about to really kind of get really big and it's finally there and people are underestimating it but it took longer so usually my this is my mistake like before i went and started a crypto fund i did a kind of full personal audit of all of the things i've believed and whether i've been right or wrong to really kind of see if i'm if i you know how highly convicted i am and i came to the conclusion that along the thread of software and computer science which is what i've always been interested in like internet and software pretty much everything that a lot of smart people got excited about has happened it's only been a question of time um i have this blog post what the smartest people do on the weekend everyone else will do in 10 years and i think it's i think that's been universally true for the last 50 years in software that the things that you know the steve jobs and the wozniak going to the homebrew computer club and like all the all the smartest computer science nerds in 1970s were right and the people at the big companies who bet against pcs were wrong um that's happened over and over um it happened with the internet it happened with open source software and i think it's going to happen here as well and chris i think that's that's one of the big mental models that you've communicated is this whole web one web two web three and all these uh denominations of the web are just mental models right each one is its own mental model and you talked about like well wouldn't that just be terrible if the internet just collapsed onto like four channels the youtube channel the facebook channel the instagram channel and the twitter channel which is kind of where we're getting close to it absolutely right yeah and so as a veteran of the web one era how do you see web three re-instantiating some of the cool things and that we that we liked about web one yeah well i think a big part is having credibly neutral platforms upon which to build right so if you build an application on top of ethereum and whether it be a game or something nft experience or a d5 protocol you do not have to worry about the protocol deciding to kick you off later or charge you thirty percent of your date rate or whatever you know happens on these other kinds of platforms um and so you know that you can invest and spend your life as an entrepreneur betting on that platform and building around it in the same way in the web one you knew that you could do that around http and smtp it's very very different to i i think a very formative moment in my experience you i don't know if you were both in tech then was the facebook twitter uh api uh massacre essentially which is there were all of these there was a huge wave of people that built startups on facebook and twitter and they were all just summarily kind of shut off um i had a lot of friends who had startups that were built on the twitter api twitter was a twitter was an ecos it was a developer platform for many years yes it had users using it directly but it actually didn't even have an app for a long time it was all third-party apps and those were all companies those were people who spent their lives on it and twitter did by the way i don't blame i'm friends with some a lot of these people at these web 2 companies i don't think they have any ill intent i think i think the problem is the model right um the model importantly to put these into crypto terms the lack of immutability of the web 2 model and the lack of immunity meaning they can change the like i like to say in in web 3 it's can't be evil in web 2 it's don't be evil so web 2 you're depending on the kind of the the you know the good intentions of the of the founders and part of it's architectural right you don't have a blockchain you don't have like a code that this locks them into it and if you build an ethereum the code is locking you into certain commitments if you build a smart contract it's there it's immutable everything else but it's also just the model of like if you're if you're yeah maybe if you're an ultra founder jack dorsey or something you can resist this but for almost everybody else you ultimately report to shareholders and those shareholders want you to maximize profits and that i believe is fundamentally inconsistent with maximizing the health of the networks built on top i think the network i think that corporations and networks are fundamentally misaligned the corporation is going to want to grab more and more of the money and close off the network when the network what the what the network wants what the people on the network want is they want openness and low take rates and open permissionless access okay and those two things are fundamentally misaligned in the last 10 years we've seen how that misalignment plays out and i think a lot of the reason people are unhappy on these networks is they they feel this viscerally a lot of these creators who are early to build youtube up are now you know at the whims of the algorithm at the whims of the company they get demonetized they get the take rates changed and they feel viscerally they were part of this network creation and they should have been part of the of now of the governance and economics of the network but they aren't and as you know web3 using tokens and all of these other kinds of new primitives that we have with web3 we can now fix that and we can build networks where there isn't a corporation that needs to increase the take rate and shut down access where the network can flourish where the the users and the on the network and the developers on the network can participate in the value creation and the governance of those networks i my friend brad burnham he's the co-founder of unit square ventures has a phrase that we finally he finally discovered the native asset class of information networks tokens wow we were mismatching this other asset class the you know delaware c corp with networks and that created all this endless strife and we now have a way to fix that this is super cool and i think this is basically what we've been getting into if listeners aren't aware is your first mental model which is the mental model of of web 3 and like the question of yeah how do these crypto people have the audacity to like label this new crypto thing that they're working on an entirely new era of the internet right like some people don't understand that um how because it's so early in the journey right so but but you're saying web3 is basically it's this internet that's owned uh by the builder and users and it's orchestrated with with tokens and it's a less predatory relationship between the platform and users right because you know in the web 2 model the platform the users with with growth comes this extraction from the users of an individual platform or network and web3 i guess it's more of a symbiotic type relationship do you think it's still audacious to call this thing web3 or do you feel like this is right on still i i think it's right on i think in terms of the audacity of it you know time will tell i i very publicly have put these out there and if we put a lot of money on the line and i you know if we're wrong we'll lose a lot of money and we'll be you know we'll be look silly and so i you know we definitely have skin in the game and i definitely believe this i'm 100 sure we won't be wrong this is definitely right and look at this there's a descriptive aspect to this i think there's a real movement going on but there's also a prescriptive aspect which is i i want to put up the bat signal i want to put up the bat signal and say if you're at google or at amazon and you believe the internet can be a better better better place than it is today and you don't want to spend your life you know on ad targeting there's an alternative and you can come you can come start a company uh and you know we're always wanting to meet entrepreneurs and potentially fund them or you can come join a company we have hundreds probably thousands of openings in our portfolio and so you know these things i remember the web toothing thing it's not it's not just you know it's it's a it's a participatory process and the key thing now i believe is getting more talented people into the space um most of the discussions i do why i'm you know sort of the audience i'm imagining today when i'm speaking to you are people who are curious about the space could contribute something whether it be design engineering some other you know business operations function whatever it might be i want them to to hear this and know that we want you to come join us we're welcoming and and we need you this is not going to happen with you know my blog posts right and it's going to happen because thousands of entrepreneurs and tens of thousands of people working with them build great products that billions of people want to use would you go so far chris is to say web 2 has peaked like it's it's it's kind of done now it's now it's on the decline and now this is all about web3 that's a that's a great question um look so i think it's nuanced so web 2 defined as the big companies their their market caps are high they're doing very well economically uh i don't i don't know i don't know anyone who works i do know people work these companies none of them seem very inspired they all seem you know they've gotten very corporate only one of the big companies is led by a founder anymore i don't think i have trouble thinking of i guess i would ask you is there a product that let's say google has launched in the last 10 years that you find exciting um no i i use many of their products right sure i use that but they're all but they're all from the 2000s like right now they're not exciting search what was in the last decade i mean apple i would say i get air pods you know i like air pods airpods are great but i mean this is a company that had a run of literally in its eight year period the ipod the iphone the ipad that was whatever two thousand i don't know one to nine and since then it's been the airpods uh this this they have two trillion dollars like what's going on like bell labs when they when they had a monopoly like they created the transistor unix the c programming language you know i had probably a whole long list of things i don't remember so i you know are they doing like i know zuckerberg is controversial that thing yesterday they're spending 10 billion dollars on vr like okay that you know he's doing my mind like i know he's controversial everything else yeah it's what else would you do if you're like a billionaire tech founder like you should be making big bold bets right um so i don't know how much innovation i don't feel like they're doing much innovation i i i just i mean just literally count up the products like are there so let's assume that's true like so let's assume there's no innovation let's assume web 2 has i mean it's not no interview it's but it's top of the s curve it's yeah okay it's incredible like the phones do get a little bit better i just got the new iphone like i use these products i think they make very good hardware cameras but it feels very incremental like i used to watch every apple keynote like it was like the super bowl right like i haven't now i i haven't watched one in seven years it's like it's okay they have another cat another fourth camera or whatever better camera better battery faster chip that's about it well so i'm just where are the best like where are the bold bets with all that money and all those resources let's let's say for a minute that many web 2 companies become sort of uh maybe incumbents or they they sort of miss this web 3 phrase do you think it's likely that they'll miss this web three things like what i'm actually wondering is do you think that web 2 will see web3 as competitors do you think they'll be completely asleep at the wheel and miss it or do you think they'll start to collaborate what's been interesting since last time we spoke is like even like little glimpses you know twitter talking about adding nft features is really cool that's what we want i want a verified blue check mark for my nft twitter thank you very much it sounds like that's what they're building tick tock doing some things in the nft minting space so like they're but do you think that's going to that trend is going to continue the web 3 starts to web 2 starts to work with web 3 or do you think they're just going to get their their lunch eaten i hope so i mean like i hope so um i think my guess is it'll be different with founder-led companies that the founder-led companies they've seen this pattern before they've seen these things people have dismissed as a toy they come from below that seems silly that get called a scam and they realize it's not and so i you know it doesn't surprise me that twitter and square and facebook and you know instagram which of course is done by facebook are on the leading edge of this i think we'll see a lot of those folks at things like those nft features i think we'll it'll get really interesting so the soft underbelly of web 2 is not i don't i think the adoption pattern like if for web 2 the adoption pattern was get a whole bunch of users this is sort of ben thompson's kind of theory aggregation theory get 100 million users and then layer on monetization i i think web 3 is going to be the opposite which is the way that it's going to start with the creators um and the soft underbelly of web 2 is that the the off the take rates are anywhere from zero to you know like 50 so if you are a and by the way this forget about put it putting crypto aside for a second you're familiar with sub stack so sub stack right it's a newsletter platform uh that it's very interesting because you have these writers so every all the writers have been told for 20 years the internet is bad for you the internet destroys your business you can't make money as a writer online you have to go do all this other stuff and maybe you'll scrape by maybe if you're really lucky you get to work at you know the new york times or something but in general it's you know it's just it's not a real career and you have to do something else and these writers go on substance and there's a whole bunch of writers making a million dollars a year and this is like whoa narrative violation we were told you can't do that right it's not the problem is not the internet the problem is web too the problem is we we put in between the writers and their audience algorithmic feeds and you know and and ads and that was not a good and and companies that decided to take almost all the money right so spotify the statistic i just i like is that they i think they it's on their website they have eight million artists and of that only fourteen thousand and fifty thousand dollars a year or more so make sort of the average american living so fourteen thousand out of eight million they put that on their website they think it's a good thing like think about how engaged people are with music how much they love music right a lot of what's going on with nfts it's the sub stack effect it's now i can finally you know blou does an nft drop and makes 11 million dollars it's because now as a as a music fan i'm sure music people are incredibly passionate about music i i would guess that you each have musicians that you love and you would love to patronize and you'd love to support you'd love to join their community or maybe you are in their community but you'd love to do you wouldn't you would add into your participation various monetary things we see this effect offline by the way musicians make a lot of money on offline merchandise this is just sort of you know this is just a way to sell direct nfts in many ways you can see it's just digital merchandise right at least for musicians it's one way to look at it it's finally you have to have something to sell on the internet that doesn't require going through an intermediary and having banner ads and all sorts of other things um so i lost the original question i mean this could be like the native tokens you said it's sort of the the native asset of like networks this could be the native asset of you know tokens could be the native asset for creators too and for people yeah i think they will be i think they will be and i think what we'll start to see is more and more creators realize this and realize they can opt out of the web 2 monetization they may still use web 2 as a way to kind of aggregate fans but as they start to opt out and they say hey you know what i don't need youtube's you know advertising banner ads i can just use youtube as a way to kind of get a bunch of this what happens with substance you know these these authors they get they get their audience on twitter and then they put a link that says you know if you want to support me go to subtech and what that that in ad based models that never worked because you needed to get like the entire audience to move over in these kind of cream skimming models which is nfts and substack where you just try to get sort of the the the biggest fans the thousand truest fans to pay you money in the cream skimming model you can just you can use twitter to aggregate a million people and if a thousand come over and sign up for your sub stack and pay you whatever ten dollars a month you've got a living right and that's going to happen more and more with nfts yeah so meanwhile thankless listeners can go over to our sub stack and sign up for bank lists we would greatly appreciate it chris you'll love this actually so um i think subtac is a perfect example because it's one of these bridge companies it's a bridge in the creator economy between like web 2 and web 3 right but it's like not fully tokenized but like bagless got its start on substance in uh 2020. we started with just like uh actually 2020 2019 for two years ago and and we started with like just a handful at on twitter as you said right we just hit a hundred thousand subscribers uh just like in the past week and what's interesting we love sub stack because it's a direct relationship with our community and it also strikes me that that you know the substance model is not kind of the it's like the bridge company it's still in the old world imagine if you could like supercharge a substance what does a sub stack look like that's a bit more decentralized and a bit more tokenized you know like something like a like a mirror is interesting in in doing things like this it's like these bridge companies are going to be very important as well and uh yeah go ahead no i think that's right i think that's right i think sub stack patreon kickstarter back in the day are all kind of early precursors and but the strong form as you say would be to have the subscription maybe it was an nft or some other kind of thing and you give governance rights and economic rights and a whole bunch of other kind of things but i think yeah i think they're right i think these bridging companies are very important culturally because they kind of provide a easier on-ramp for understanding the the effects here um and so yeah you were asking i mean so just to answer your question from before will web 2 respond to web3 i think when they start to see the creators taper off and opt out of some of their programs because that's their soft underbelly they're very good they're very strong on the network effects on the user side right like i talk about web3 all the time it would be hard for me to leave twitter because i have a lot of followers there i spent a lot of years doing it right it's hard and they don't let you leave subtech by the way very importantly lets you leave you can export first thing i check when i sign up for subscribe can i export my email list right you can take your network with you right and that's a very important thing i wouldn't use any trust starting in your site unless you can take your network with you but um anyway so i think that'll be interesting if that starts to happen and you start to see um because these the web 2 models are all built around this kind of everyone's locked in and we have these permanent network effects and so if you start to see any chips of that armor that's going to be alarming to them and how they respond you know the right way to respond hopefully is embrace the future it's you know the way that bill gates finally did a you know five alarm fire and built internet explorer right when the internet was coming along he missed it at first but due to his credit recovered very quickly um and so i think that's the right way to do it but we'll see i think that i think you'll see a big difference with the founder-led companies is my guess because the ones that aren't found allowed it's very hard they form a committee they study the issue they have to go kind of get consensus it's very hard for a non-founder-led company to do non non-consensus big bets chris in your article you talk about the role of tokens when it comes to these web 3 networks and you say this line tokens push ownership and control to the margins which should come with a lot of contrast to these web 2 worlds where it's very very top-down updates to the way that this platform works and then we've also seen this like revolution in air drops and also earning by using how as an instrument a tool how do these tokens actually allow us to build this web3 world yeah yeah i think tokens so the way i define web3 is an internet owned by users and builders orchestrated by tokens so tokens to me are the kind of the key new concept a new primitive as we say there's two basic types of tokens there's fungible and non-fungible nfts so when i say token it could be one of the other tokens are beside besides domain names which is sort of the one thing you could own in web one they're the first thing on the internet that you where a user can actually own something and like truly own it in the sense that no one can take it away right if you the key idea with a token it's in your wallet and your wallet is a private key in a public key by the way by this definition bitcoin is a token of course as well and of course it was the pioneer of this model um and those tokens are it's a very general concept this is one of the mental models you mentioned the the tweets storms i've written we're on to mental model number two for the listeners by the way so yeah well so it's uh tokens are like web pages in the sense that they're they're they're very very general um general primitive so when the web the first websites came along they you know they had certain personality they had pictures on them they had they had uh text and people said oh i see it's like a magazine right but then over time and the other thing by the way the web page can happen have pictures and text you can have code right and over time developers iterated and built new more and more new ideas and new kind of types of things types of websites and so today you have you know social networking you have very elaborate sas software you have spreadsheets google docs and today we can see we can appreciate kind of when we use the web how general concept the um the token is so when we talk sorry the general concept website is so when we talk about tokens when they start off for example with nfts people see board apes and crypto punks and they say oh it's sort of like art or something or sort of like j you know right click and save jpeg i believe instead it's a much more general concept and we're going to see people iterate on it and so for example in gaming we're seeing a lot of crypto web 3 gaming now you're going to see tokens represent game objects as an example which have real utility and so maybe it's a magical sword but it has certain properties and the user can take that sword and take it out of the game into another game and i think over time used gamers are going to expect that they have their kind of permanent inventory right today you go and you play a game i i play clash royale a lot if you play games i've spent probably too much money on the game and then when i stop playing it it's all gone right um and we just sort of get used to this idea that you're basically going and renting the renting the goods and then giving them up people will i think over time say why is that like when i in the real world that's not how it works like you don't go to uh you know when i go to a restaurant i don't have to put on a new set of clothing and then give it back at the end or something right like you have your permanent stuff in the real world people that's a very popular concept in the real world to own stuff we just never had it until tokens on on the internet now we have a notion of owning stuff that's what tokens are and so they can be fungible tend to be corner money-like things like ether bitcoin or something and non-fungible or sort of everything else and as a friend rohan our friend adapter labs likes to say most of the world is non-fungible so he you know you can debate this but he believes sort of non-fungible will be in the end be sort of 95 of the tokens in the world just simply because it'll look like the real world where you have you know i'm sitting here i have a computer that's an object i have a pepsi that's an object and we have money too i have fungible stuff too but it's not the kind of majority of the world so what tokens allow it's just this concept of digital ownership and it can be a thing it can be a piece of media it could be a game utility it could be something fashionable it can be an avatar it can be code i think we're about to see a whole bunch of new iteration on the idea of like having programmable nft as an example could be a ticket it could be access to something in the real world it could be a behind-the-scenes you know pass for a discord it can be anything the key thing is you can now own it it's not the user it flips the model where the user has the object and the application or website is asked to interact with that object as opposed to the application or website creating the whole world and expecting the user to adapt to it it's a user-centric new way to think about the internet i i want to double click on that right there so uh i have trustless date as my twitter handle but i don't own that jack dorsey just lets me borrow that and he can like pull it back for me whenever i want and but he may i think at some point i would not be surprised to see web 2 start d platforming web 3. uh oh jack dorsey please don't de-platform me from twitter they just just one day it'll just disappear just beyond it's like oh no okay so but that i want to unpack about how this actually changes the relationship between a user and a website when i go to twitter i'm not bringing along my personal belongings i don't even own my own twitter account twitter just lets me borrow this trustless state twitter account from them meanwhile in web3 i have a bunch of these objects in my inventory and i go to these websites and i bring along my objects and say hey website look at these objects that i have how does this change the relationship between website and user it significantly uh it shifts power towards the user right so i if i go and you you know this as you as an active user so i have i'm sure you have yours youth name ifcdx.ethan i have an avatar associated with it and when i go first of all the login experience most you know login experience is magical i think you need to really try it to see it but i go to openc and then i go to rainbow and i see my name and my my you know my eath handle and all my other inventory and they're just providing kind of a view for it like a way to view it but they don't own the they don't own the actual data right and what that means is they have to they have to play much more nicely because they don't have that much twitter doesn't care they can do whatever they want no they don't it just weakens it it weakens the so you will have centralized services in the mix and look it'll be reflected in take rates like openc like we're big investors in openc full disclosure um and i know there's some controversy in the decentralized world but look it's it i do think there's a role for centralized services and they charge two and a half percent right which is in stark con i mean the lowest web to take rate is apple at thirty percent youtube is fifty percent and instagram twitter and facebook give zero i.e they charge a hundred percent chris can you just define takers really quick sure take great in any kind of marketplace there's just what does the house take what percentage does the does the service provider this the intermediary what percentage do they take and like i i believe that like i'm capitalist i think there's a role for marketplaces in the world and marketplaces should get paid i think a healthy take rate is something like two and a half percent right i think an unhealthy take rate is you know when you have 100 which is twitter instagram facebook and 50 youtube and 30 apple for doing very little in the case of apple like that to me is a is a sign of a basically a monopoly like it's not that's not a healthy take right now what's super interesting about open seas like a very low take rate yeah at the same times like uh you know your capitalists you're investing obviously with the expectation of future returns it's like with open seas got to be one of the fastest growing companies like in existence and certainly is been the breakout of the year right so that that take rate has not impacted their ability to grow there just seems to be something about this web 3 world where you get such like accelerated growth that i don't know that i've ever seen maybe this happened in the the mobile world uh in that era maybe it happened early days facebook but like we haven't seen it since those two previous eras of the internet i completely agree and look go go i don't know if you ever read s1 so when you know when a company files to go public there's the s1 which is the financial statement go look at the last two years of tech s ones and look at the look at the budget for sales and marketing it is in most cases the the by far the biggest expense we basically all of the the entire tech world today is it spends the majority of their money on sales and marketing and that could be everything from if your consumer company you're buying facebook ads if your enterprise company you're buying you know you have a big expensive sales force to my knowledge like coin no almost no crypto company has ever spent money on marketing actually they by the way the web 2 platforms banned all crypto ads which is probably actually a favor but so they wouldn't get on the sugar high but so but to but to my knowledge think about bitcoin this is bitcoin's economical example right bitcoin of course doesn't spend there is no bitcoin company they don't spend money on marketing but they've got an army of how many hundred million people who write millions of you know medium posts and tweets and you know all of these evangelists it's it's a religion okay and so i think the the so why why has crypto grown so quickly without any marketing because people feel skin in the game they feel ownership and that that causes them to go evangelize and it's a very very powerful force and so i think the trade as an investor yes we will get lower take rates but we will have much bigger markets and and that will i think those two will balance out and it's a perfectly you know it'll be it'll be it's a perfectly good place to invest in but we can do it in a way that's that is a much much broader bigger market and have platforms that that have far smaller take rates i it's sort of what happened with you know craigslist is a good example i think which is just a giant market uh you know huge amount of volume goes through there they take very little i think they only charge in certain categories and relatively low percentage and they made that calculation they said you know what let's just make it so popular and so good and it'll grow so fast and they spend no money on marketing and it's just all profit because that's it just like it's that website that's what they do like they literally i don't think they have any staff hardly outside the website so it's just a different way to run one of these things right whereas google i think is up to 120 000 people um it's just a different it's just a different way to think about the world right so i think i think in this world you you have two kind of things you have the the protocols or the nfts and then you have i think you'll have things like i believe there is a role for coinbases and open seas kind of a layer of some centralized services with low take rates that provide kind of an on-ramp because it's you do need sort of the you need these sort of on-ramp experiences right it's very hard if you don't have some kind of website and things for new people to come on and you know kind of join chris you've already unpacked this a little bit but i want to approach this subject a little bit more directly in this mental model you talked about how some of the early websites were just like digital internet versions of a magazine or a newspaper so you you could read the newspaper or you could go onto the website and read the same newspaper there before they really learned to be a little bit more interactive and engaging and actually have like an actual like what we know as a website today and today in the world of nfts we have like comically known as jpeg nfts do you kind of you kind of think that's following the same pattern as like this whole this whole jpeg nft phenomenon is the internet trying to just replicate a magazine on a website i think i think it's probably i mean like i i'm a fan of you know of a lot of these nfts and the crypto punks and and board apes and things like that um so i'm a fan of them i do think it's probably we're probably very early in the evolution right most most of the stuff now is either kind of one of one crypto art um so for examples and founded investors and foundation which does that super rare does that um or it's the pfp the avatar kind of stuff but we're seeing some really interesting new things i'm sure you followed the loot loot stuff that dom hoffman did i think is fascinating and that you know a couple of interesting things he does you know one is the you know sort of the composability it's the the first loot drop is just the inventories of these imagined characters and he's it's almost like my analogy i use is if you know ernest hemingway just released the first page of his book and then had the audience write the rest or something right it's very it's very um provocative to to like leave the rest undone yeah really emphasize you guys ever read that book stone soup it's like a kid's book oh yeah yeah he keeps putting stuff in the like stuff yeah basically he gets this entire town it starts with a stone and everyone contributes like carrots and vegetables and pretty soon like he created soup out of a stone but he only brought the stone yeah that's what it reminds me of that that's good that's a good idea that's a good analogy um the um well i think i think you know my partner eddie lazarin he's got this great framework where he says that when you create make something into an nft you do two things you financialize it can now be traded but you also make it composable um and the financialization has gotten all the attention but the compo i think one of the cool things about loot is it's trying to emphasize this other aspect of it which is the composability and then if you follow the synthetic loot more loot which are both attempts so synthetic loot is another version of loot where every single public key wallet gets a synthetic loot and then more loot is one where the supply is is by design huge and the idea with those two is to kind of tear it so loot is rare looks rare is you know and uh and the price goes up but then it makes it less accessible and so then synthetic loot and more loot are meant to be for for new people to come in and be able to play the game right so dom's doing part of that also is a very interesting experiment between kind of the trade-offs of financialization accessibility top shot has a similar thing where there's these um there's rare cards that are sort of meant to be collectibles and hopefully you know go up in value and then there's uh common cards where you know so kids can come on and get a card for five dollars and play games and do other things so i think i'm just giving you an example of like we're so early in the design space i think one like one of the negatives of crypto punks is they're so expensive like we want and it's it's neat and it it creates a culture and you know i'm a big fan but we also want to figure out how do we scale this to a billion people and make sure it's accessible and make sure you know people are enjoying themselves and feeling skin in the game and ownership and so i think that for example is a very interesting problem that people are working on one of the things that really gives me a lot of encouragement so we have a i tweeted about this yesterday but we have a games group at our firm that's not you know they're not crypto they're just sort of traditional games like and they invest in really top game developers who come out of places like riot and valve and epic which are kind of the best game companies talent companies in the world and i think it was about four months ago as after asking blew up just every single meeting they have now involves nfts and in fact i was gonna say i'm betting they have some crazy fomo right now but also but they do but they also these are these people are really good designers i've seen the stuff and it's a it's another level like it's going to be awesome i think people don't even i think people that yeah i think that it's kind of like when i was describing the web and web 2 and how it took 10 years for people to really iterate and go beyond the magazine phase i think it might be happening a lot faster now um and and that's one of the indicators is seeing how how talented these people are and how sufficient they by the way games people get crypto very quickly like a dow oh it's a guild you know oh token they're they're used to in-game economies like they get they get it instantly it's not it's not a big learning curve and so that's very exciting this is sort of the next you know the mind virus is now has now left out of out of containment into the next i mean think about this too it's like um you know it's speaking of how fast this could happen like web 2 didn't have web 2 to propagate itself did it that's right that's right krista has web 2. it says propagate on twitter and discord and like all of these youtube all of these various channels that's a great point that's a great point that's why these by the way these analogies these historical analogies are always imperfect because it's just different right and by the way a big thing with web one is is the band it was broadband but you literally had to have companies like verizon and comcast like dig holes and everything else to get to the point where you could have youtube right we don't have that issue now we have the interest the hardware is all built out the wireless you know phones and we have web too gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto bison cells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their earn program

assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com so we've gotten through two models mental models so we can start accelerating i think you go faster if you will this is great so so we talked about web3 how crypto has the audacity to call it web3 we talked about tokens as the new websites this is the new digital primitive this is like the website of web3 these things called tokens just touch really briefly i know we touched upon it but like the the idea of your take rate is my opportunity okay this is this is a bezos quote and he was talking in terms of like i guess web web one amazon how he was going to like beat his uh e-commerce uh competitors in the brick and mortars of the world how does that apply to web 3 versus like web 2. you wrote a whole thread on that yeah so bezos's insight right was that he had a different cost structure than the his competitors who were who had physical retail locations and other kinds of things and he could take that that different cost structure and lower his prices and and you know and take their market from them and so his famous quote yeah your your your take rate your um your margin your market yeah you say he said your margin yeah so my version of it was your take rate which is sort of the marketplace version of that um and it's to say you know so uh actually infinity we're investors in actually infinity they have this giant economy i think they're at something in the order of 1.8 million users and i think i forgot they i tweeted i think it was two billion three billion in total gmv volume in the last you know whatever it's been since launch um and they but it's very different right so when epics when fortnite makes three million it means people spent three million and sent it to fortnite send it to epic the company when axi does it they don't they they take a tax i don't know what it's like three percent or something it's about some low take rate four point seven percent is that right yes so i don't i'm my partner ariana's on the board i'm so she knows the details i'm not as close to it but um but um uh yes they take let's say four what is it four point seven percent um and but but the other 95 goes from one player to another player and that of course for the for the recipient is awesome and so you have um this this huge community i think a lot of it's in the philippines um that is making a living playing this game and so the the kind of the insight is that that the actually founders had is we can instead of having the be sort of a command economy where everything is coming to us we'll make it peer-to-peer and one set of users can be can kind of who have more time than money can do this kind of work to earn money and the other set of users who have more money than time can pay for it so we actually recently just had a conversation with uh ariana simpson from from a16z yeah and we talked about how all economies ultimately or excuse me all gaming platforms all games ultimately become economies and it's this the existence of an economy where so much value can be shared peer-to-peer generates this flywheel of economic resources that actually a low take rate if it was 100 of a take rate you would just kill the economy but if it's a low take rate you actually encourage the economy to grow that's right and and and you get these secondary effects right which is so one of the really fascinating things about axi is it's not available in the app stores because they ban all the web 3 stuff and so they have grown to that level that quickly because people is what i was talking about before skin in the game it's feeling like true owners it's feeling like they you know they can really participate in it um and and that that low the low take rate is a key part of that right is that they they are making most of the money um apparently slp the you know the token has become i had uh dinner with gabby the other day kind of gabby from ygg is amazing yeah yeah he said that his slp is so prevalent in the philippines now that it's like you'll see uh i think he tweeted one out today it's like craigslist ads priced in slp my god it's become a medium of exchange it's actually literally become a local money it's incredible so so what do you think is going to happen here one of the one of the quotes in that thread you said this trend continues as web 3 startups begin to eat into the margin of web 2 incumbents the higher the take rate the more more vulnerable the incumbent right and so this applies to like web 2 companies it also applies to the gaming industry it also probably applies to to the music industry but like so how does this shake out does does web 3 go and start to disrupt all of these various industries i think i think so i think it will i think that the most vulnerable will be the ones that monetize the worst today so i think music's a great example and in fact we we had never i had never in my career i think invested a music startup and i think i can say this we haven't announced which ones but we've invested in two uh crypto music related things in the last two months um wow and that's because so the reason i never invested before i had friends who did so far for example i had a friend uh who started if you remember turntable turntable fm if you guys remember i remember it was really it was a really cool app that was um kind of music avatar experience anyone can get up on stage and dj and you'd listen to in the background just be kind of a little community um and he i saw him years later and it uh you know he he'd given up because the music labels just wouldn't they just wouldn't give him the licensing he tried to pay them he tried to cut deals they just don't want to they're just they're basically law firms at this point and they don't want to do anything new or creative they just want to kind of extract money from their catalog and so as a vc and an entrepreneur you just sort of you know this is death valley like you can't go that you can't go there because they just won't you just need the music rights and they won't give them to you and it's just not gonna work and of course spotify did well and they were the one exception but but what's what's beautiful now is the musicians can go direct so like when blau did his drop his nft drop and made 11 million dollars you don't need the labels or spotify or anything else it's just it's just it's just the musician and their fans it's a direct it's the sub stack thing we were talking about earlier and there's all sorts of interesting new ways so i think the way i believe the way it's going to shake out is music will be free there will not be people charging for in the same way that games are free today the games industry figured this out a long time ago so in the games industry the dominant model is what fortnite does what league of legends does right the game is completely free you can play every feature of the game for free they charge by they they realize it's better to give that away let people mod it let them stream it let them do whatever they want the internet is a giant copy machine let the internet do what it's good at it's good at propagating cool stuff right among other things let it let it let it do its thing on my game and then monetize something else and in the case of those games they monetize cosmetic goods mostly virtual goods i i think it's the same thing's going to hap i'm pretty sure it's going to happen with music music will just be free let it spread let it get remixed let it get modded do whatever you want and i'm going to complement the adjacency which is the the adjacent layer of the stack which is the ownership of the nfts and all the kind of status flexing and behind the scenes access and a whole bunch of other kind of cool things that people will design around the music in the same way that that was a dominant model in gaming and if you look actually i did that in one of the tweet storms gaming has consistently grown every year every time the new tech gaming has grown gaming is 140 billion dollar industry music has shrunk it's been flat and now it's like 20 billion so it's a seventh of the size of gaming which doesn't make any sense when you think about how popular it is and how much people love music the reason it's been it's been stuck there is if there's been no innovation and once the music industry is allowed to embrace new technology as i think they may be about to be they will grow along with gaming and they will embrace the same things you know nintendo for a long time nintendo had a very kind of retro view of the internet and they they fought streaming for a very long time because they said that's illegal copyright infringement and eventually they realized yeah it sounds funny but it's like hey you know you gotta pay to see mario jump you can't just get it for free and so um they they uh they fought it and then eventually they realized wait why we shouldn't fight it just makes our games more popular and we sell more games right and i think people will realize that with with all other forms of media that it's not the model is not to like create fake scarcity on this giant you know meme propagation machine i.e the internet but the model is let the internet do its thing and charge for something else that's scarce like nfts yeah this is so incredible because of course with the nft space non-fudgible space this is all net new functionality that like just wasn't previously possible that's what this new token primitive provides so let's get to maybe the the fourth mental model here uh which i think relates to everything we've talked about so far and this is the idea of networks becoming economies and just like my teeing up of this is i feel like in the web 2 era we really learned about the power of networks right this is like the social network era okay so we had mental models reid hoffman talked about blitz scaling right uh we got to understand growth via metcalfe's law right sort of this this network uh virality type of growth model but but now what you're talking about in this thread is we're not just we don't just have networks we can actually upgrade those networks and turn them into economies so networks become economies what did you what do you mean by that yeah so um so i would start by saying that the internet is a network of networks so on top of the internet we have an other network such as facebook twitter uh you know every discord server every subreddit there are millions of networks and we've basically spent this is a little bit to your point you said we already have web 2 we can build web 3 on top of it right we spent the last 20 years we the world building millions of networks airbnb visa network uber's a network right these are all networks so they've got all these networks built out and we're nodes in these networks and maybe you've got your you know your your twitter account and you've got your followers and you've got tiktok and you've got youtube or whatever you have sub stack um but you know the only business model that we had layered on top of that for the most part we're advertising and and some with a few other exceptions um we now have a way to take those networks which and and let value flow through them freely and that value is our tokens right and what that means is that instead of uh you know it's the things we talked about before the creator can who has built this audience on twitter and is used to only being able to make money by maybe tweeting out a link to you know her her show or spotify account can now let this thing that was previously an information network only her twitter following become also a value network right it'll be also a network and through which nfts and tokens and other things can flow so i think of it as yeah i mean i i think of a marketplace is a is a certain type of network where in addition to information flowing through it there's also value flowing through it i think if the listener kind of uses their imagination you can really start to feel the econom the the economy side of even the web 2 platforms these days like uh facebook and the way that it you know information flows and energy flows through facebook well what happens if all of the all that information flow that is being routed through facebook also has a value layer that can go along inside of it and same thing with like spotify you see all of your friends and the music rises to the top there can be value associated with these information networks that already exist yeah you're right you see some of it today you'll see people on their facebook account or on some other you know hey i'm tweeting out something i'm trying to sell you know my old sofa right so people will use them somewhat as marketplaces but it's not a native experience right you click on it and you gotta go to another website and you got to put your credit card and your social security number and all this like kind of legacy stuff and it's not a closed loop and it's not and so and as a result like the conversion rates are really low and this is why the industry kind of settled on advertising because advertising is digitally native at least right it's the full closed loop the advertiser comes on there's an auction it's targeted the whole kind of money flow is done in a purely digital way and so it's just it just works a lot better than then when you have these non-digitally native payment systems which i consider the kind of the whole existing legacy payment system that way just the numbers don't end up working and so you get very little value flowing through it as a result there are exceptions um you know the the uh even then like i was the exception i was going to say is like somebody who built their business on instagram you know linking to their shopify account it's sort of an exception but you know the way instagram's built is you will build up an organic audience and then they'll start to uh they'll start to throttle you reach right you hear this all the time and they do that deliberately so that they can get you to buy ads to get back to the reach you had and so that's their very clever way of just of kind of increasing their take rate even on the organic side so there is value through it but it's also to the extent even if there is value it's just the the web 2 companies have gotten so good at extraction either direct extraction through paid ads or indirect through throttling organic reach and forcing you to get paid ads to get back to that audience that you know yeah so i mean it's it's like it's a complicated nuance nuanced topic and i you know trying to distill it into a tweetstorm but there's a lot of aspects to it you know what's super striking to me is like that when you're thinking about um you think about economies very differently than networks right networks you might think about um you know revenue for example but like economies like the the axi economy you think in different metrics you think it may be gdp right how many people am i employing this economy and i think that's the paradigm shift i think another paradigm shift is in your tweet thread you talked about the way this would develop and there's two kind of analogies that jumped out uh this idea of a real world bazaar rather than maybe like a department store that's kind of the example or the idea that this would develop more like a city yeah rather than rather than a theme park and why do you think that these networks i suppose these economic networks will be structured in those ways will they'll start to resemble things that are a bit more i guess organic bottom-up bazaar-like rather than cathedral-like no that's a great that's a great and i was thinking of the cathedral in the bazaar if you're familiar with that i am a big fan of open source and that community that culture and have tracked it for a long time and that was of course a famous it was about eric raymond's essay about the difference between kind of the open source bottoms up method and the top down method i think by the way there are places in life where you want top down so for example probably you needed a company like apple to build the iphone uh it's very hard for a community to come together and do you know that that type of high capex factories supply chains all these other kinds of things the um in in software and i think particularly the internet i believe the bottoms up approach is going to be um lead to a much richer more interesting more diverse and more equitable internet um and the analogy i would use is to like new york city versus disneyland or something right so disneyland is a command centralized economy and new york city is much more kind of organically developed and so in new york you think about there's a great um some crypto people like jane jacobs she's a just amazing author who wrote about kind of the life of cities and has this amazing first chapter in this book where she's talking about just a city block and all the different things you have on a on a healthy block and a healthy block you have a sidewalk you have restaurants you have residences you have barber shops she has this concept that like you feel like it's a better block when there's more eyes on the street when you feel like you're you feel safe to walk if you're a tourist and like tourists instantly know that feels like a good block and then more people come and then more people come and they want to walk on the block and then more restaurants open up and more barber shops open up and the real estate values go up right and it's this kind of network effect of the city block it's a really beautiful passage because that's also like that's a microcosm of the broader city right the broader city that's what you do to create a healthy city and but the interesting thing she talked about it was it was this first of all it's a bottoms up process right there wasn't somebody who was like the commissioner saying we need more eyes on that street right there are commissioners in there but what they do is they they say okay we need some public space here you know the sidewalk is public this part is private and this part has a park and and and then you and then you let the bottoms up kind of this this ecosystem develop and in a healthy city you have you have different things you have you have private businesses and you have public resources if it weren't for the public sidewalk the the restaurant if the sidewalk were owned by some company the restaurant wouldn't feel comfortable opening their business behind that sidewalk knowing someone could charge a toll or something right you need that to be public in the same way you need the open protocols to be public to have the business build on top of it right and so you want the two and if everything was privately controlled it would end up being like disneyland and sterile and boring if everything was publicly controlled i don't think you'd have the kind of diverse innovation that entrepreneurs bring so there's a balance and i believe the internet has fallen out of balance and it's now the sort of for disneyland and we need to bring it back ethereum on the other hand is a great example where to me it feels like a city it's a very kind of beautiful community the people are building interesting things on top many different layers um a lot of the blockchain world is like that ethereum's probably the most the the healthiest network by the way if you're going to pick a place to live you've got to actually live your life you'd rather live in a in a real city than in disneyland i'm in new york right now and i'm here for a reason which is like i love new york and like it's endlessly by the way one thing i love in new york is i love walking around the streets it's just like it's it's just i like seeing people i like seeing stuff i like seeing and i feel like that that and i used to like the internet in the same way it was like let me just go you know this used to be this phrase surf the web right it sounds kind of silly now or something but like it was it was called that because you'd sort of like bounce around and find all this weird stuff yahoo yeah they had like they had like cool it's great now like on my twitter uh mentions it's all like crazy avatars i'm like finally the internet's like interesting and weird again it's like all these add-ons you totally agree it's just like fun and interesting again too i mean like that's that's not like a scientific statement obviously but just my anecdotal experience is it's like i actually like enjoy going on the internet and seeing like weird interesting stuff again in a way i didn't in the same way that i do when i walk around new york and i'm you know i don't go to disneyland i don't want to go i want to be in new york the vibe is is cool once again chris i want to pull out two previous aspects from other mental models and bring them into this whole networks become economies conversations two things that you said is that tokens inside of a user's inventory pushes power towards the user uh and and for me the user is the person you know walking around the streets with a bunch of tokens in their pockets and a bunch of businesses claiming to get their hands on some of the users tokens so i want to put that frame of reference into your mind but also this whole concept of like bazaars not not department stores and um you know uh uh take rates that aren't top down determined there's a there's an interaction there between behind all these companies that are and that are that are lining the streets of this city that have this free market capitalism trying to get the tokens that the users the pedestrians are walking around uh that that they have contained so how when this this economy actually blossoms and we have power in the control of the user how do you think that develops like going forward you mean how so sorry can you so how do the other businesses differentiate businesses today or so we have all these businesses that we have all these users that have their their own property rights in these networks and now we have these you know instead of web 2 companies that are have top down uh controls as to what the prices should be we have these infinite economies that can create any sort of uh business mechanism unleashed from the control of these web 2 platforms uh just when it comes to just innovation business development and also consumer protections how do you how do you think all these dynamics kind of play into one another um that's a good question so it's very very open-ended so go ahead and take with that what you will well look i think i mean look i think yeah so i think um i think ideally we end up with a world where the user has significantly more power than today because the switching costs are much lower the user the switching costs are going to from openc to whatever some other competitor they're much lower because you can take your wallet and your identity with you versus twitter where you can you're stuck there right um and so i think that we're going to see a massive shift kind of towards the edges of the network vitalik has this great quote which is you know all of so many technology innovations shift power to the center including i think ai ai is going to make kind of big incumbent companies more powerful and workers of the edges kind of disenfranchise blockchains are the opposite they hollow out the middle and they push stuff out to the outside right um so you know your show is not called new bank it's called bankless right like you're getting rid of the bank and you still get the functionality of a bank but the users you know now have control and power right but and you don't have that thing in the middle with taking stuff so i hope that's number one i hope that the other thing and i'm not it's not this is not obvious this is we have work to do i hope it's all interoperable all right i hope these are not islands these economies and i think this is people talk about the metaverse and you know facebook working on their version of it and i i think to me the probably the big question if you know when this kind of metaverse develops which i sort of think of is this interconnected virtual world where you work and you play and maybe there's three-dimensional vr interfaces and who knows what is it controlled by ioi you know the ready player one company and they have everything or is it uh is it you know is it uh more like the web where there's just anyone can add on another world or room and they all interoperate and the powers and the users you know and that's a big open question i think that we're trending in the right way but um uh you know it's it's it's still early um in terms of like consumer protections and things i mean i think i know if you want to talk about kind of regulatory stuff but the i i think we have very extensive consumer protection commodities laws a whole bunch of other things in this you know in the in the u.s and most of the investing we do is in the us and we'd like to see most of this innovation happen in the u.s and companies pay taxes and hire people and everything else i was mainly referring to consumer protections by free market competition as in if somebody's guessing i think that's i think that's a big thing i think that there's two ways to control kind of big companies that act in predatory ways one is to try to regulate them directly through monopoly law and things like that which i think we're about to see some of that happen i don't think that will work very well um if you've sliced up facebook into four different social networks or three different or however it is i don't think that's going to change the power dynamics um you might i think smarter in a regulation like forcing them to externalize the network to really let you leave the network and take your followers with you and and support open protocols maybe could work i don't know i don't see the head in that way the other way to control these companies is to is to provide competition and to provide a new model where the user is has power and has lower switching costs and don't let it happen again that users are locked in that they're locked in and that they're you know that they're dependent on these intermediaries and that's obviously what we're trying to work towards do you know what's the i feel like has been the common thread throughout all these mental models and all this discussion is as the threat of property rights self-sovereign property rights what what's super interesting to me is like uh of course if we live in this world of four disneylands on the internet like of course we can't get something organic like a new york city out of it why i mean because i can't go set up a marketplace in disneyland i don't own it if i go to disneyland i'm just renting the space and it's all disneyland material it's like so i'm not going to set up a shop i'm not going to build my home i'm not going to build any property on disneyland because i don't own it i don't have property rights that it appears to me as the common thread through this whole thing is like somehow in this web 3 experience that we've just we've just created we've unleashed property rights it's a very it's it's exactly right and it's very interesting it's like it's a kind of mind-bending thing to imagine but imagine we lived in the real world forget about the internet and we had no concept of property rights everything was rented from four you know big and large ioi pick your four dystopian companies and then one day somebody came along and you know threw the sledgehammer through the apple ad in 1984 and we had property rights you know at the beginning you suddenly could own something and at the beginning you would probably have some of the behavior we're seeing now like in the nft world like of speculation and sort of degens and all this other stuff right oh my god i can own something oh well i'm gonna own that you want to own that like i own the better thing or something you know this could be kind of a little bit we're in that phase now right where it's like people are like yeah it's very reflexive you know there's some silliness going on as there always is but it's but that's not lose sight of the big picture which is like yes we just took the most important invention of the 20th 21st century the internet and added property rights to it it's a big deal and it's going to take a long time to really kind of play out and and there will be you know there will be bad ideas there'll be abuses but overall i think it's going to be a fantastically positive positive it is it is a big deal and uh dave and i have argued that it's actually fundamental if we're going to create something like the metaverse which again no one thinks like no one wants a disneyland version of the metaverse where it's just like facebook or whatever right there's a risk of it but like if we have property rights then maybe we won't fall prey to that i want to i want to end with maybe the yeah we'll talk about a16z as well but like the last mental model to cover is maybe this idea that a lot of people get tripped up on i think is one of your core mental models where they just dismiss crypto far too early the it's just a toy uh you know mental model or trap let's say that they fall into so uh you wrote this tweet thread i thought was brilliant and it really covers what um people say about a new technology and i think people are still saying this about crypto right now when it's janky when the ux sucks when it's all brand new they say three things number one they say it's just a toy number two they say it's too expensive and number three they say it doesn't solve any real problem so can you talk about those traps and why do people always fall into them yeah it's a good it's a great question so the the um the and i think each is probably a different pattern and it depends on the technology so as an example it's too expensive tends to apply to hardware and so you know tesla would be an obvious example where you just it's just simply the nature of hardware i've been involved with a few hardware companies is when you're at subscale you just pay a lot more for supplies and assembly and everything else and so as you sell more units the price can can drop dramatically i mean you go to the best buy now and you look at the tvs it's incredible right the the cost of tvs and how good they've gotten is a good example what do you think about block space though do you think that's an example like some people are like gas fees are too high um yes for sure for sure we're going to see a lot of we can talk about that more but i think we're going to see a lot of um you know the optimism arbitram polygon phantom other l1 that said i think that i would predict that block space is going to be uh that that demand is going to outstrip supply for a very long time uh i think the prices the more supply coming on will be great and we'll moderate it but i think block space is the best product to be selling in in the 2020s it's like it's a great product people forget it's a product people forget that that's why blockchains exist is actually you'll see i'll do a lot of block space investment i i believe people will tell you i believe block space is a good business in 20 to 20 20. so we will make we will be investing a lot but look obviously we want the supply to grow and we want the price to go down we want this to be an accessible technology it's not accessible right now some of the gas fees so you know we want to be inclusive but i think it'll probably also be a thing where you pay different levels for different levels of security maybe maybe there's other l ones where you know you're paying lower prices and then you say hey i got a lot of i got a lot here i want to take it over to ethereum which is sort of ethereum l1 is sort of the premium thing anyway so that's too expensive then there's stuff that starts at the toys this is really this is really clay christensen so he has a great book um called innovator's dilemma where he talks about this this this common pattern where a new technology will come out and it will just be kind of crappy like the pc early on the pc when it first came out and i guess it was the late 70s but the like city i think the apple 2 was like 83 or something you know i had no very few apps a couple of games i don't even think they had a word processor then and the device it was like you had to assemble it and just the whole just it was kind of a ridiculous product yet it sold like crazy it was five thousand dollars in today's dollars when it came out incredibly also expensive and a toy both the double whammy um but what happened is you know first moore's law right just all the hardware got exponentially better so they were riding moore's law and they were riding another another exponential growth curve which is application developers came on and they invented the spreadsheet and the word processor and desktop publishing and games and just all the things that happened right and all of a sudden buying an apple ii in 1987 was a very very different value proposition than buying one in 1983. and so yeah so that's that's what what things that look like toy i think you know skype when skype first came out um it was this thing that you had to have a microphone people didn't have mics built into the pcs back then and it was janky and dropped calls and but it was free and you could call your family in india and talk for free right so it's sort of amazing but you go back and read that kind of stuff around it uh the telephone is the most canonical example so the telephone so when a telephone came out was alexander graham bell invented the telephone that the time the telegraph business was income and business in the telegraph business basically they served the railroad so they were they would a railroad come railroads were the enterprise their enterprise customers of that era they paid a lot of money and they said we want to say hey this you know this we have this much lumber at this depot send that over telegraph over here and we'll pay you a lot of money to do it because it helps us manage our inventory telephone comes along it can only go like 500 feet sounds like crap and like why would you want voice when you want to send lumber prices and so western union because they were thinking like what are but this is a clever thing with clay christensen's framework is it he's not saying these managers are idiots he's saying the opposite they're very smart they go they talk to their customers and that time the customers were the where the where the railroads they asked them what they want and they said we don't want voice this short distance voice we want to know how much lumber to send right and so but what they underestimated was first of all the phone got much much better very very quickly right you could go long distances and everything else the quality got better and then you know app developers quote unquote people came along and said hey i want to talk to someone i wanted like the consumer market opened up it was a business market before that it suddenly was consumer and so it came from below and so western union very famously passed on all the path they could have bought the patents for very cheaply the phone they did said it wasn't had no value and they passed on it that's probably the most famous kind of example of that pattern um i think we're gonna i think we're seeing it now to some extent also in crypto where you know you have these like web3 you know metamask everything else and it's you know if if you're a google facebook product manager and you're used to these ultra slick mobile experiences two clicks you know it looks janky what is this it's developed i mean actually i would argue that's an amazing the positive signal for us the fact that it is so janky and yet there's 10 million people you know active usual metamask people are sort of clamoring you know and willing to go through all the pain to get it but but i think that's happening to some extent here and then yeah the last of the three kind of mistakes we'll make about technology is what problem does it solve and i think that what problems to solve is a very it's just a very to think that a new technology needs to immediately solve a problem i mean what what what problem did facebook solve at first the creating a giant social group they didn't solve a problem it created a new set of behaviors and opportunities computing computers the most obvious example like no computer by itself solves any problem the computer creates a design canvas upon which entrepreneurs and developers can create applications which then then can sometimes solve problems although did the spreadsheet solve a problem kind of but at the time people didn't really have it was more that they just enabled them to do kind of more advanced business calculations right like the businesses were running perfectly fine before that um and they were doing accounting before that long before that it you know so the computer unlocked a new design space but it was a two it's like a multi-step process right not all innovation is sort of a direct short line the the thing that bugs me about the what problems to solve it assumes innovation is just like one direct simple thing right as opposed to a multi-step kind of community process which the biggest things follow these kind of much more kind of circuitous routes i would argue so yeah that tweets are just meant to show that look i've made all these mistakes myself i'm just by the way i mean i'm not saying this to say that i think they're all very natural mistakes um and i've made them myself i think i've learned over time having gotten you know my kind of my ass kicked a bunch of times on bad decisions and investing in other things like that that i take a closer look like hey when i say it's a toy or hey it's too expensive like what's the price curve and it's too expensive hey it's a toy what's the improvement curve the toy will get better too expensive what's the price period will it go down uh it doesn't solve a problem okay but does it inspire other people to build things on top of it that in turn could solve problems so ask that next question that's kind of my take away that that's what i've learned dig deeper ask the next question and don't kind of write things off too soon the the this is one of my favorite mental models of all time because it applies just to every new technology so you'll use it in crypto but then you'll use it in every subclass of crypto right whether it's crypto gaming whether it's anything in crypto you'll continue to use it and people say the same thing like nfts d5s just like a toy it's toy finance and they say it's too expensive they ask you what problems it solves and they don't realize that this is just an unlock for developers and others in the ecosystem to build new things uh so let's maybe end by talking about um you know a16 so as i said it's been about 10 years since we last spoke at least in the crypto timeline right um how is 2021 playing out is it playing out the way you expected like what's changed in the world of a16z i know you guys raised a a big fund um has has the crypto fund eaten any of the other uh groups within a16 so what's happening there yeah i think that um i think my sense is throughout the sort of venture world that uh people are taking web3 crypto more seriously there's i've seen our news articles that some of our competitors for example who have previously shunned crypto have now gotten religion so that's good i think that's good i you know we welcome competition and also frankly like that's i always knew like the path to victory of course would involve like more people participating in this and so and that includes both entrepreneurs and investors that's good um and yeah there's definitely been more interest throughout our firm i think uh particularly on like fintech consumer and gaming um i think people you know i think people start to see i think look i think nfts i think that the kind of evolution i think of it is so we had the kind of early history bitcoin ethereum and then we had a lot of infrastructure stuff a lot of our investments in like 2017-18 were infrastructure and then and then d5 of course right we're investors in uni swap and compound and maker and all that and that was great too but you know d5 it's finance is just a narrower set of there's a smaller set of people that are interested in finance versus nfts which is in gaming which is kind of all of culture by the way i think they're all going to reinforce each other like i think of the way that we get d5 to the next level is by bringing 100 million people in through gaming and nfts and those people are going to naturally want to save their money in d5 and so i think they're all like kind of closely connected and reinforcing um but i do think that when you sort of talk to an average person you know walking down the street in new york city something like an nft or a game is kind of more accessible to them and so that that's affected the venture world for sure yeah we raised a new fund we hired we've hired a bunch of people to become a meme on twitter we actually only have i think we have 30 or so full-time people on the crypto team so it is larger uh the meme's a little overblown maybe but uh but what's what's the meme i'm curious i haven't seen it's like everyone's joking they joined a16z i'm gonna tweet that out right after this recording we uh we had like a week i think where we hired someone like every day and then i think it sort of turned into a meme it was funny um so i think we're about 30 something we have like about 10 or so advisors and others so there's i have to count it up exactly but um it's a great team um and uh you know we really try to kind of cover different practice areas i mentioned before of like nfts gaming d5 you know this last week we announced element finance which is a d5 protocol and so we're still trying to you know be very active that we're doing like i mentioned before a bunch of infrastructure stuff um i think we've got to continue to kind of invest at all layers so um i think you know as i mentioned before like i think zk stuff for example might be a really interesting kind of future infrastructure area um chris uh and then yeah your partner came on ariana simpson we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show and she gave a take that i wanted to see if you agree with or not she said that uh uh all crypto all crypto funds will just become funds and all non-crypto funds are just going to turn into crypto funds eventually kind of in the same way that once upon a time we had internet funds and now all of a sudden we just have like what it what is now the s p 500 how do you feel about that i think that's right well i think look i think the way i think about it is that if we're right if i think the three of us probably agree on this if we all if we're right that future internet products are created in the web3 mold and they and the value accrual happens through tokens um then the rest of the world is going to want to they're they're going to want to follow that they're going to want to follow where that value on the internet is created and if it's i believe most of the value in the future of the internet will be created through tokens and and i think again a correlate to that would be most financial institutions interested in internet value creation will want to buy tokens and so i think it will spread not only from the venture side but i think that that's how also the you know the broader institutional side um the banks and the hedge funds and all sorts of other other folks like that um so yeah i mean look i think i do think i think there's probably i think it'll be a much slower to affect enterprise software and i mean enterprise software i think it's like 15 of enterprises use sas software today and the rest is still on premise so it's just a slower moving area um we have a bio fund i think that's you know i think they actually did do one crypto bio thing it's kind of a folding at home incentivized um mining thing it's cool um but i think you know some of that stuff will be kind of slower but i think in the kind of mainstream consumer world i think it's going to all i think it's going to all blend together i agree honestly so par part with uh a16z then like what's changed do you think from a regulatory landscape perspective i know a16z has been involved like you guys put out a policy agenda a couple weeks ago which like i i do feel like our lawmakers and those in in government at least in the us they do need some guidance on this um because i haven't seen much um coherence and like a framework coming out of that area but like what's uh what's changed do you think in the past year or so since we talked well i mean the big thing is the administration change and this administration seems to be less friendly to to uh crypto and blockchain stuff um you know i think i think there's the way i kind of think about this there's many many kind of layers to this um there's specific kind of you know legal and regulatory kind of tactical level stuff and we have now at our at a c crypto 10 people who work on that like we very heavily invest in that area you know the first thing we do when we make an investment we help them find a general counsel and kind of help them with legal stuff so there's that layer and then i think there's another layer which is kind of the broader i think the comms is called the cons layer or something which is explaining this to the world because i think a lot of these regulatory kinds of questions are tied up with this other question which is it you know i think a lot of people don't believe that there's positive societal benefit in crypto they they see this this idea that it's about making money and tech bros and you know a lot and that's due to a lot of the coverage which i don't think was fair coverage i don't think it's accurate it's not my experience at all in the space i doubt it's your experience um but that's the impression people have and you know it's kind of number go up culture not innovation culture i believe that that i believe it's innovation culture i believe is the things we talked about today that this will provide for example a new and important way for creators to monetize on the internet and i think you know i think when we can show i think it's very important that we show that because it's one thing for me to sit here on a podcast and say that it's another thing if we can go and point to 20 musicians or a thousand musicians or ideally a million musicians whose lives have been changed um so i see that as fundamentally the the key question here is we it's incumbent i i think we need to help we need to explain things better i i try to do my part with these twitter threads and podcasts and things like that you guys do a big part of it um and so as a community we need to just explain i think these concepts better and why it's good for society to have to have this technology and then i think we need to prove it we need to put we need to we need to prove it by having examples to point to where it's people are being helped right um and so that's what i'm very focused on from that you know i think ultimately there were regulatory questions around ride sharing there were regulatory questions around airbnb i think what ultimately convinced people that that there should be regulation of course but there should be regulation that allows those those companies to exist is they saw the value they saw they saw the value as a rider and you know you could click a button and ride an uber they saw the value they knew a driver who made a living that way and so that's the ultimate path to acceptance of technology is to prove to the world it has societal value and that we have to do that we the community i think um and and we need to do it you know i think the sooner the better i think it's something that needs to happen in the next probably year or two and i think the good news is i think it's happening very rapidly well said i mean as we've always said on bank list this is a battle for hearts and minds we have to build it like we have to prove the utility and and they'll come after this chris this has been a fantastic discussion thanks so much for joining us thank you both for having me and all the work you do last question for you too is like leave us with one thing what do you think people should be ready for in in 2022 do you think this is you know do you think we're headed for another bear market do you think we're you know going to continue to explode up do you have like any any ideas to leave us so i would i would say so eddie and i wrote this blog post about this if folks are interested but i think that's a very important distinction to make is between a product winter and financial winter the prices could go down 90 they could go who knows i have no idea i don't know i've done it before exactly yeah and that like and i have no idea and i i would act as if that would were the case if you know i don't give financial advice i disclosure this is not financial advice but if i did i would say like act as if everything's gonna go down 90 there's a different i think much more important cycle is the product cycle okay and these are these are kind of independent um and on the product cycle i'm very very bullish because i see the products in the pipeline and yet it's two things i see the products in the pipeline and there's a lot of really good people entering like the level has gone way way up of entrepreneurs the kind of quality number one and number two the because so much infrastructure is built out the kind of clock speed now is much much faster you know like people on twitter they're like you know nfts are over and they're boring and then three days later a great new project launches right and you're gonna see that like every week now and i remember 2019 there was a financial winter in crypto you guys were there um but the thing that bugged me was not that it was the product winter i mean there weren't there were just so few product launches right there's like a product launch every three days now that that i don't think is stopping like i think that would take a lot to stop and that's the really important one i think the other one look the other stuff will go up and down and who knows and you know global macro economics inflation i i have no idea i'm not that's not my job like i don't i don't try to predict that but the product cycle i do try to predict in the product cycle i'm feeling i've never felt better i think the quality of people coming in i get an email i said this in the truth and it's true i get an email like a day from a very high quality entrepreneur saying i went down the rabbit hole and i you know i used to think you were crazy chris and now i'm like oh my god this is like the greatest thing ever this happens a lot and i think a lot of those people will stay you know regardless of prices we uh have talked a lot in the crypto space uh about the super cycle maybe this is the the site the cycle where crypto prices just go up twice without going down uh tbd on whether that's even financially possible or not sometimes it's just too hard to make that much money that quickly but it sounds like what you're saying chris is that you definitely believe in the super cycle in terms of product development yeah i think the product cycle is a key thing i think that if you go back i wrote a blog post about actually this would be a good tweet storm but i wrote a blog post once where i analyzed it kind of when companies were founded when iconic companies were founded in correlation to nasdaq and it's just uncorrelated wow it's just yeah so it's just like that'd be actually a good tweet storm i should do that but um it's just not correlated and so like there there will be i guarantee you the so what keeps me up at night is like look at my job is like i want to make sure we have the next open seat we have like what will it be and how do we stay close to the i what i try to do i don't look at the prices i stay close to the entrepreneurs i'm like where's the energy moving you know where is like the the world spirit moving what's the new area and how do we kind of make sure we're in there and if we do that and it i think this is generally true in innovative in kind of innovative markets if you follow that energy like and you have a long-term perspective i think it generally works out that's super cool well uh folks we're gonna have to leave it here chris it has been an absolute pleasure we've covered so much five mental models for you and i got an update on a16z regulatory environment you left us with some words of wisdom thank you so much for joining us today thank you both thank you both for having me and for all the great work you do for the community absolutely wouldn't be anywhere else everything else is boring once you see crypto as we discussed earlier action items for you guys i know bankless listeners are right along with us uh in in feeling that as well uh we'll throw up some links to the five mental models we discussed those will be linked in the show notes also of course if you like this episode if you like bankless don't forget to do something about it like the podcast subscribe five star reviews on apple itunes pick one this is like this is not the scalability trilemma you can pick more than two you can do all three at once if you'd like of course risks and disclaimers none of this has been financial advice eth is risky d5 is risky so our nfts this entire web 3 thing we're embarking on is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on the bankless journey
