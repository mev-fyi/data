apes buy punks i'm gonna talk i'm gonna interview a punk holder and see uh how he feels about that one on today's episode sure i'm talking about youtube all right and then they released a coin too so i don't know what that means we're gonna talk about the apecoin as well here's the biggest acquisition in nft history i don't know how you feel about that i'm looking at a punk in your background right now but hugo labs purchased all of the intellectual property i believe from um from the crypto punx holders uh larva labs yuga and larva they purchased all the intellectual property from larval labs tell us what this means so what is this purchase what's the significance of it and uh what does it mean for the nft ecosystem and for the the the punks and the board apes community yeah carly riley over at overpriced jpegs tweeted out a few months ago i wonder when uh nft companies or nft studios are going to start buying the ip from other nft companies or other nft studios and i'm pretty sure when she tweeted that she meant like you know some of the b-list nfts not necessarily the board ape yacht club founders buying crypto punks the og nft so the magnitude of this is absolutely crazy uh and not not just crypto punks but also me bits which also came out of larva labs and so for every nft project there is ip associated with it uh there's the licenses uh and the crypto punks again the one i have in the back my back my living room here the the ip for crypto punk was now actually not owned by the owners of the crypto punks it was still owned by larval lab so like commercial licenses was not something that you could do with crypto punks that was actually one of the reasons there's always always been the case behind board apes is that the board ape holders had the rights to use their own board ape commercially if they so choose this is this is creative commons open or cco i believe is what that's called dc investor take what is he saying here david i am done building identities and brands which corporations can buy and sell without paying me and for me to go to be expected to go along with the ride because my identity is attached to them from now on will only future art by independent artists and create cco pfps on this account so this is in reaction to yuga labs buying the crypto punk's ip from larva labs and dc investor is saying he only likes nfts where he is the the sole owner of the ip and because he doesn't want you know uh centralized companies buying the ip of an nft profile picture that he he rocks so i will note point out that dc investor now has an mfr as his profile picture because sartoshi and the mfers are cco and they give complete ownership rights of the ip towards the owners of the nft so that's pretty so is is dc an uh example of somebody who is maybe not so happy a punk holder is not so happy about this yoga labs initiative he is cautiously pessimistic i will say where i'm cautiously optimistic are there are there some people in the crypto punk community who are just like ballistic angry i'm selling all my punks kind of thing um i saw you see about that uh but no i haven't seen more than that interesting i'm really you know enjoying seeing that uh that play out uh you know it's just interesting to see that play out he says more on the cco thing should we read that too yeah clarifying my thoughts on cco cco doesn't mean it's a better nft there's lots of garbage cco nfts it's also possible some corporate administered nfts outperforms for many reasons i simply put to prefer to participate in communities where they can't sell my participation to others so thanks dc and so now yuga labs which are the founders behind board apes and mutant apes and that whole ecosystem uh struck a deal with larva labs to acquire the ip and when they did they gave the punk holders the rights to their own commercial licenses for their punk so i can start start going out and making merch and branding out of my crypto punk if i so choose like i already have a brand around me and my crypto punk because i put my crypto punk as my profile picture on twitter but now i could go and start making like i don't know a movie where my crypto punk is featured if i so choose and i would have my own rights to that why didn't larval labs do that larval they've been holding it that's a good question i don't larval labs has always been uh builders and not necessarily marketers they like on-chain experiments they like fooling around on the blockchain doing cool innovative new things like i said they weren't just the founders of crypto punks they also did me bits they also did autoglyphs they are tinkerers and innovators at the chain level where yoga labs are brand experts and and just like experts in growing the the value of an ecosystem and that's just something that larval labs was never really interested in so some punk holders are a little bit concerned because the climate and culture in board apes is nothing like the culture around crypto punks uh the crypto punks kind of think the board apes are kind of cringe and i'm definitely one of those people um but uh but and so like people are worried that yuka labs is gonna give crypto punks the same treatment that they gave the board apes like you know yachts and things of that nature that are kind of against the crypto punk ethos like it's really actually hard to tie down crypto punks they're very very decentralized different cultures different cultures yeah uh and so the some of the punk holders are concerned about that as in we don't need this company to promote the brand of the crypto punks the crypto punk's brand has always been about promoting itself uh like we don't need help we're crypto punks and we don't even want help um but but can i but can i ask you this this this part doesn't make sense to me it's like it feels look i'm a kind of outsider not part of either of these communities i'm just looking at it but it feels a little bit like larva labs is just doing this as a cash grab like why couldn't they have just given crypto punk uh owners creative common license and like be done with it why do they have to sell to eucalabs all of this ip and all of these punks like i'm wondering if some members of the the crypto punk community feel a little bit um i don't know betrayed is the the right word but maybe rug bold um well so it wasn't the acquisition of the ip that i think was that's only one part of the story i think actually the bigger part of the acquisition is actually buying the treasury assets of larva labs which was 423 crypto punks and you know with a 60 eighth floor that's a lot of value and seven over 1700 me bits uh and so i it was a package deal right like we'll buy your crypto punks we'll buy your me bits and give us the ip and we'll we'll make a deal i don't know how much like i think i think the larva labs just wants to kind of sunset their responsibility over the crypto punx because they weren't really using that to do anything to begin with uh and so i don't know i don't i don't think rugpole is the right to scripture i think it was just like a passing of the baton passing of the torch onto a new a new steward of the brand um and that's kind of where the crypto punk side of the community kind of is like fearful like they don't want a steward of the brand the brand is its own steward it does itself as a headless brand and so putting a head on the brand is kind of anti crypto punk culture i'm optimistic in the mirror post from yuga labs they definitely addressed how they have no intention of just giving the crypto punks the the board apes treatment uh and that they will listen to the community before they take any action so i'm optimistic about the outcome of this i kind of think that the crypto punks get the best of both worlds they both get to have their headless brand that many many crypto punks will just give the middle finger finger to yuka labs and hugo labs will still have the incentive to promote the crypto punk brand so long as they don't do it in any cringe way like in my like how they kind of did with board apes in my opinion then i think we're good here i think we're good here we respect the culture but as a punk holder you feel you're cautiously optimistic about it cautiously optimistic i think that's a great way to put it yeah um there are some takeaways from william pister you guys over now yuga labs now has five of the top 20 nft projects crazy so they are absolutely massive player and brand holder in the nft space um larva labs is going to continue on with web 3 projects you said they're kind of a builder hacker house and looks like they're going to spin up more uh web 3 projects in the future um it it does beg the question of whether you what they do next will they launch an nft marketplace for instance right then they have the brands do they go like start being vertically integrated and become sort of an open c type of offering get into the exchange business um there's also some chatter about uh acquisitions right so like if you go labs board apes can basically buy crypto punks then that also means somebody can buy board apes right buy all of that ip so who's next do the corporate behemoths enter the fray does like disney go and buy an nft project maybe they are the future owners of yooka labs uh they they don't think the board apes is the right culture for disney [Laughter] uh so but maybe it's someone else right it's like like the idea of these things being acquired and purchased is sort of entered the conversation uh as well um when token that's what we'll get to in a second it feels like there's a token conversation a play to earn games some other things as well but let's talk about the token really quick so there was talk there's an ape token get me up to speed on that david i haven't honestly been paying attention too much to uh to the apecoin what's going on there yeah so yugo labs minted and airdropped apecoin i believe as of this mo as of this morning and apecoin is according to them a token for culture gaming and commerce used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web 3. uh some people have the the negative take on this is like a token for culture gaming and commerce like these things that are supposed to be unlocked by having the token wasn't that what like the apes themselves were supposed to be uh uh but you know to each their own this is putting a currency into an nft world so now we have the fungible money currency that's paired with the holders of the ape tokens that got all the money so what they're going to be doing with the erc20 token i don't know but you would imagine some sort of just like economy is growing this is now like the nation of the apes um the world the planet of the apes if you will they have their own identity and their own currency and now they have to build out their world and this is just for ape holders this isn't across all yuca labs properties just for the apes themselves board apes mutant names and kennel uh kennel dog doggy dog club i don't know the name of that one the dogs that go with the apes so those three projects got the apecoin airdrop in different proportions even more critiques came from the supply of of the ape token that was given to you larp yuga lab founders because some amount of was reserved for yugo lab founders which is which is typical but then some amount was also reserved for board ape founders which they're the same thing so like a little bit of a double dip right there um but uh we'll see we'll see it's still in early days there's some takes here's one from alexis ohanian who's uh coming on the podcast on monday by the way um what's his take despite how bored my ape looks i'm excited to share that apecoin dao is adopting apecoin and that i'm serving on special counsel that will oversee the decisions of the community so alexis looks like is getting in the fray as a a governor of some sorts um the exchanges are listing apecoin as well they've been very quick to list ftx i got a email from gemini saying we are now listing apecoin so d good b d from yeah yeah they can they can execute these brands can execute and what is this tweet that we're looking at here david oh yeah so this was interesting this has less to do with the actual like airdrop out of hugo labs and more with nftx and nftx is like an index for various um uh nft projects and so nftax has a bunch of board apes in their vaults and all of the board apes that nftx has is claimed they're able to claim the the tokens they're able to claim the air dropped but no one actually owns them because it's owned by a pool so what someone did is they took a flash loan to buy the entire vault of all board apes and then since they owned every single board ape they claimed every single board apes from nftx airdrop uh and then and then resupplied and sold back to nfc the nfc vault all of the apes and then paid back their flash loan and was able to claim basically a million dollars of the ape token so i didn't even know if i'm mad about that one no this is clever yeah like if nfts didn't think about that then that's on them yeah that's that's pretty clever in some of the downstream effects of these things uh so summarize this for us overall what do you think about the acquisition of punks by the apes and you go labs moving forward acquisition of punks by apes i am neutral to slightly positive on that there's a decent chance that it just becomes a nothing burger and crypto punks or crypto punks forever and nothing can really change that um so that's my opinion on that with regards to the airdrop of the issuance of new tokens to generate excitement and to make money goes back to my thesis of how we are in a 2018 part of the crypto cycle where people are just issuing tokens because it's the last last gasp of opportunity to pocket some money before we go into
