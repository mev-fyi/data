Gary Gensler and the SEC are charging Gemini and Genesis charging them with unregistered Securities was selling those and they're doing all of this after the fact David this is a total Mall Cop move isn't it Bagless Nation it is the third week of January David tell them what time it is Ryan it is the Friday bankless weekly roll-up where we covered the entire Weekly News in crypto which continues to be Fiasco after Fiasco although entertainment value does increase uh lately uh and so if you are not drinking your coffee what are you doing go grab your coffee because it's going to be a pretty good roll-up might be might be kind of long we'll see we'll try and speed this up it's gonna be a long one but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about this week I mean it's quality though it's really cute stuff all these Roll-Ups it's just quality and I'm drinking my uh I think this is my fourth I want to say cup of coffee wow nothing like the fourth right what do you want number one number two first the number it's always downhill after number one true till tomorrow you gotta sleep it off yeah you have to wake up and yeah your eight isn't tasting as as good as your cups seriously you drink eight cups of coffee sometimes I'm not gonna say I don't okay I'm not gonna say I don't know I would literally die someday we'll have uh we'll do flights of coffee together dude no I would can we do a slice of beer both first to copy then the beer we'll do that at permissionless how about that sounds good uh all right topics of the week we gotta discuss the bankruptcy of Genesis that might actually be happening some news broke this week and also the unbundling of digital currency group it's all wrapped together what else we talking about yeah if anyone is interested in buying coindesk you might be in luck uh following that Gary Gensler the mall cop coming in hot you know Mall copy uh on that Segway Segway and then the big news of the week uh crypto Twitter just struck by fear when rumors of the Department of Justice was going after an international crypto exchange that starts with the letter b a massive takedown so hold on to your seats because we got to cover that one it was absolutely gargantuan news gonna talk about that too all right guys if you're listening on YouTube We're watching on YouTube make sure you like And subscribe if you are listening to this on the podcast of course uh subscribe to that podcast too David before we get in gotta talk about our friends and sponsors over at the crypto tax calculator because David you know what seasoned it is oh God it is tax prep season my friend you guys could hear how does bubolent Ryan is right now do you know I'm only excited because the tools have gotten better it used to be so much more painful to do this kind of thing and that's why we're talking about crypto tax calculator because this is probably the best tool I've seen for those complicated train trades uh there's complicated D5 transactions you know the stuff where you're like on a layer two and then you're interacting with this weird D5 protocol and derivative token instead of another app yeah blah blah blah blah blah yeah and you'll just volatile yeah you're a liquidity farmer somewhere anyway um wouldn't it be nice if you just plug in your ether address and we just calculate what you owe yeah this this is previously what I do but I do it to a human but I'm it makes sense that the AI is stoked about the calculator that you can give it to you don't give it to you humans aren't as good as as robots David how many times we have to talk about this that's why I keep you around all right so this will will sort out your tax nightmare so um that's why I'm a little excited a little a little jubilant because this is the best tool I've seen for those uh complicated transactions they've got L ones and l2s 600 Integrations coverage for about 300 000 cryptocurrencies thank you all you got to do is connect your wallet and it spits out uh what you owe and so this is a way for degen's to actually do their taxes if you're Degen thinking about not doing your taxes I would advise against that uh not a good idea you either do it now or you do it later and it's worse if you do it later let me tell you I haven't turned into that one yeah do not procrastinate these things anyway you guys can go to bank us.cc slash crypto tax calculator and sign up also if you sign up with the code Bank 30. do you hear that bank 30 you get a 30 discount on this puppy uh so go check that out in the show notes yeah but if you are in the bankless nation Discord there is a different code for even more percentage off so if you are a bankless Nation member go into the Discord if you are interested in getting that more than 30 discount even better even better okay let's get to the markets David what are we talking about on the Bitcoin prices are we up we down we are up big on the week starting the week at 18 900 up double digits in Bitcoin to where we are currently at twenty thousand nine hundred dollars ten percent of things for Bitcoin double digits you mean percentage-wise double digits percentage-wise oh that's big because last week I remember we were up to and now we're above 20K which is a big milestone uh that's feeling pretty good I mean what are the Bears doing right now are they out of the bottom right now that's what basically the theme of the last 10 days I'd say is short squeeze off the Box usually usually Trader Bears have a little denial phase for a while and I think I've seen some of that on Twitter as well okay how about eth what's that doing for user probably started the week last week at fourteen hundred twenty dollars eight percent uh where we are currently at 15 35 we touched sixteen hundred and twenty dollars for the high of the intro week high uh this whole like Department of Justice fear-mongering uh caused the market to jump down a bunch uh We've recovered a little bit but not too much uh so we are currently at fifteen hundred thirty five dollars so up eight percent on the week for ether it's kind to be painful for Bears that's a that's a that's a big week for eth as well how about uh on the Bitcoin ratio up or down yeah uh retrace a little bit because of last week's was extremely green I think last week was something like four or five percent green I can't remember uh two and a half percent we are down two and a half percent we are down to 0.0735 on the race bitcoin's back baby it's back never left it's not dead yet uh this is look global cryptocurrency market cap David I can read these charts too we are above a trillion this week one trillion dollars it's been three months since a trillion maybe two definitely since since probably I think FTX caused us to absolutely nuke below a trillion and now we are at Point 1.01 trillion you guys will remember at the at the top of the market in 2021 we hit 3 trillion so back above a trillion the uh the trillionaires Club I guess for uh for crypto we've reached it I remember uh in 2017 if you go to that Peak back in 2017 I remember sending a message in my like crypto chat to all my friends it was like baby thing yeah we were at 900 000 we were about to hit one trillion for the first time and so I I like sent out a message like all right guys how many months after we hit one trillion will we hit 3 trillion and it was like and this was December of 2017. I was like all right is it gonna be February or April or June of 2018 when we hit like 3 trillion and turns out it was four more years later it was for those 48 months rather than four months right or whatever six months something like that off by a smidge yeah not bad though not bad uh so we've got to feeling good this week we did get there uh eventually now now we've of course retraced down below a trillion but uh we're back all right let's talk about some other Market metrics here David um one is conversation about the fed maybe the FED cutting interest rates which is pretty big the fed's set to cut interest rates by the end of 2023. this is not the FED of course saying this this is not Jerome Powell this is KPMG so this is an analyst saying this uh that the FED might cut interest rates amid a U.S recession think the exact prediction is this that in the first half of 2023 that's the half that we're in right now we will enter a recession and uh do you recall what a recession actually is like the technical definition yeah it's like three quarters in a row of declining growth or something like that it's like it's time boxed too yeah it's two consecutive quarters of negative growth domestic product and of course GDP is the value of all the goods and services that a country produces so that would be two quarters of negative GDP so KPMG is saying we'll we'll go into a recession this quarter and that will cause the FED to stop cutting interest rates that's not already in a recession I thought we were not technically right okay it's uh we haven't actually technically hit that r word so the idea being that the FED might start cutting interest rates at the end of the year this is sort of what analysts are saying and what the market is saying um that said what is this tweet telling us yeah the this this tweet in the next tweet I think contrasts really well with each other this is Watcher Guru one of these like breaking Twitter accounts US national debt reaches an all-time high of 31.4 trillion dollars 31.4 trillion dollars of collective debt uh all-time highs I mean it's always reaching all-time highs and it reached an all-time high again yeah I mean that that's to tell us that the money supply keeps increasing no matter what the economy is doing uh bear or bull it's always increasing it seems like and in stark contrast the eth burn is burning we are at negative 2170 eth so I think these things to these like all-time high of U.S debt versus uh burning ether the rate of Youth burn being pretty pretty close to all-time highs uh is like nicely contrasting with each other when debt reaches all-time high it is like it's like future dollars that need to be burnt in order to come back to an equilibrium and we have a debt of 31 trillion dollars that we need to like collectively like burn in order to come back to like zero to net out and ether is just burn and ether right right it's so interesting to watch kind of the you know we've talked about ethereum like at GDP basically you know ethereum being sort of a digital Nation ethereum also has ether and a monetary schedule for an ether and rather than hitting debt all-time highs as you said it actually went deflationary since the merge so that happened on Sunday by the way David I was kind of looking at these numbers you know it's dipped into a deflationary territory ultrasound money territory before but then when block space demand decreased of course issue issuance net issuance goes up now it dropped back down so uh eth is once again ultrasound money since the merge the the bank list analyst team put together a state of ethereum and comparing a quarter last quarter so Q4 of 2022 with Q4 of 2021 and we do this every quarter uh Ben from our team puts this together I think it's a fantastic post a lot of takeaways from this report but you could see sort of what the the GDP P what the economy of ethereum looks like in a bear Market because ethereum in last quarter was definitely in a bear Market as compared to the the fourth quarter of 2021 when it was kind of up only and it was pure bull market so a few metrics to look at net revenue Network Revenue that is was down by 93 oh ouch what does what does the ethereum economy kind of like I guess produce or what what is its tax base maybe that's a better way to say it uh what is it selling is blocks and so Network Revenue was down from about 4 billion in 2021 Q4 to 267 million and so this is saying just like uh gas fees are down by 93.8 percent that's synonymous right and so like Network Revenue block space sales gas fees these are all different things yeah four percent yeah now this is interesting so is eth burned and you would sort of expect that so in q1 of last year we were burning a lot more EIP 1559 was already implemented uh so the burn was down as compared to the previous quarter 2021 Q4 versus 2022 Q4 it was down 94 as well now this next metric yeah I think is so awesome okay so we are we have 94 less ether being burned because we have 94 less block space demand for ethereum yes yet the eth inflation rate is down it I think it's a broken metric because it went from positive to negative so even with a 94 reduction in uh ether block ethereum blocks base demand ether inflation is down like over a hundred percent it was one percent it was at .364 yearly inflation rates well actually for the quarter that was for the entire quarter it increased 0.364 percent ah excuse me okay so yes the Q4 of 2021 ether inflated the issuance grew by 0.364 in this quarter even with 94 of block space demand leaving the ecosystem in ether inflation with to negative point zero zero four percent uh and why did this happen of course because of the merge the merge happened I mean that's the First a full quarter ethereum's ever had of uh being deflationary ultrasound money that happened last quarter net deflationary in Q4 of 2022 so that is a very bullish metric I think and then we have daily active addresses just down 20 actually not down too much considering it was it's been a bear market and then read this one each staked what is that done in uh almost doubled it was uh 8.8 million ether staked uh last year 2021 Q4 15.8 million we were actually at this time of uh because this uh this concluded this was last quarter we have like 19 days of January since then and we're over 16 million staked so we were almost double since Q4 2021 of east eight you can look at the other aspects of the economy you can look at uh kind of defy on ethereum of course uh D5 tvl is down 75 percent um stablecoin Supply is only down five percent wow which is impressive so that stayed pretty steady people are rotating back into stable coins they're not exiting to uh to Fiat in a bank yeah that makes sense uh D5 tvl ether price down like 60 70 stable coin Supply gets a boost as a result of that because like where does that value go it goes into stable coins so that's probably why stable coins are only down five percent liquid staking uh deposits also doubled so that's been huge and this is why we're seeing kind of the LSD tokens we were talking about last week increase a whole bunch uh nft volumes is an interesting metric as well so nft daily nft Traders is only down 14 percent which is interesting uh based on based on last year um and the ltu ecosystem of course is sort of a Marvel to behold you know Arboretum monthly active addresses is up 730 percent optimism is up 740 so even though arbitrary Network revenue and optimism Network Revenue they sell block space too is down the active addresses are just up and to the right but also it's it's important to know that arbitrum Network revenue and optimism Network Revenue okay down 86 down 63 like we want the ethereum revenue layer one Revenue to be up but actually we want Layer Two Revenue to be down because when Layer Two revenue is down that means layer 2 transaction fees are also down and so when arbitrum released arbitrum Nitro when optimism released uh bedrock and all like all their other updates they were actually making their layer one footprint smaller and so Network Revenue going down is actually a sign of success for these things because that means fees are going down yeah it this is but this is really cool this is what the ethereum economy looks like in a recession and you could see a bunch of the markets are a bunch of the metrics are down um but one thing that's very interesting is uh Supply also goes down that does not happen during the recessions of nation state usually debt increases during recessions that nation states have uh whereas in ethereum it's um you know money supply has decreased uh so pretty interesting to see David why don't you talk about this too I know we've been we've been tracking prices of other alternative layer ones I think the Solana price uh maybe weren't some discussion what's this tweet saying I think this is coming out of the announcement last uh week where FTX found a bunch of like uh crypto assets into the cushions uh and so we've discovered how much FTX owns of Solana the soul Network FTX owns 11 of Soul tokens of the market cap of Solana uh which is a dubious place to be in 700 billion dollars worth 700 billion dollars like you can't sell that amount into the market and it would send it to zero uh and so like there's this precarious position where this entity that's going through bankruptcy owns 11 of the market cap of salons to be liquidated needs to be liquidated yeah I don't know how that happens that's bad right that is bad yes so this this could be obviously a negative price Catalyst uh Catalyst on Soul tokens ensuring had Anatoly on the podcast recording that just last week we're gonna release that episode too uh he definitely thinks Solana has a bright future ahead so uh stay tuned for that episode and you'll catch his take there um this was interesting too why did the ftt Pres this is ftx's native token why did that Spike randomly on Tuesday today we're looking we're looking at two the two-week price action and actually this bike on the very far right just happened since we started recording we are back above two dollars and 30 cents I mean djans and crypto will trade absolutely anything like some people just think this thing is a goddamn Casino which it totally is uh but yeah ftt price the token of FTX is pumping for some goddamn reason is relative uh fully diluted valuation 600 million dollars what the hell dude I don't understand it's we should start in exchange news on that coming later David what do we have coming up next time somebody else is shutting down in exchange uh but that'll be the third thing uh the third big news of the week that we talk about first we've got to talk about dcg the dcg fire cell we got the Genesis bankruptcy so the bankruptcy is probably starting I don't think it's official but it's looking pretty nice rumors uh and then also rumors have surfaced that coindesk is looking for a buyer coindesk of course uh is a subsidiary of dcg so the unbundling of dcg is underway uh and then uh beep beep Gary Gensler Mall Cop coming through now that he's arrived on the scene now that dcg and crypto are are weak uh Gary Gensler comes with his traffic ticket save the day and then save in the day and then an exchange that starts with the letter b gets charged with the Department by the Department of Justice oh no everyone run and hold on so we're gonna get to all of those subjects and more but first a moment to talk about some of these

should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop to plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop Gary Gensler and the SEC are charging Gemini and Genesis calling them charging them with unregistered Securities was selling those and they're doing all of this after the fact David this is a total Mall Cop move isn't it this is ridiculous dude I um can we actually read what the charges are from this CNBC article yeah so according to the SEC and Gary Gensler uh Gemini and Gemini the Gemini earned program and Genesis were selling unregistered Securities with a high yield product offered to depositors uh Genesis lone Gemini users crypto kept a portion of the yield that profit with Gemini and a quote from the SEC Genesis should have registered that product as a Securities offering okay yes okay that's great that that we know this now that they should have done that that we are being informed of this and this is that they are bankrupt I'm sure there's a way for this to help retail that has 900 million dollars stuck in Gemini earned accounts this is Tyler Winklevoss uh tweeting about this saying it's disappointing that the SEC chose to file an action today what is he saying in this tweet thread he's basically saying like yo WTF this doesn't do anything to help further our efforts this isn't helping uh like us with the proceedings between Gemini earn and Genesis and he says this action does nothing to further earn users and get their assets back it's totally counterproductive uh and and also the earned program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services uh and they've been already in discussions with the SEC about the earn program for more than 17 months and that's Gemini house Gemini has always engaged with Regulators that's been part of their thing that's been their brands like we are the compliant crypto exchange and so Tyler says that even after in discussions with SEC for 17 months they never raise the prospect of an enforcement action until after after Genesis was bankrupt and they paused withdrawals which is counterproductive right after after it's too late that's called like some major uh cya type move cover your ass yeah by against an SEC here big time and uh doesn't help earn retail get its money back actually it's gonna cost both Genesis and Gemini money which they're already like running on fumes on and any money that they have to go to deal with this from the SEC is coming out of future depositors like returns like they're already gonna get like deposits are already going to get like less than 50 cents on the dollar now it's gonna be like now the SEC is coming in with fines and depositor is going to get 45 cents on the dollar 30 cents on the dollar like less as a result of the SEC this is a take from Doge Toshi the SEC charging Gemini and Genesis after users lose their funds is like open C Blacklist in an nft after a hacker sells it like it doesn't do any good why are you what are you doing I will carve out openc uh that is just a thing that their lawyers force them to do it's not like what they want to do it's not like they have a bad policy where they still doesn't help do this it doesn't it doesn't help that's the thing but but both coming are coming back to regulation like they are forced to do that because of Regulation and then the SEC is doing this because again regulate regulation did you see David uh Gary gensler's video he made a little influencer video advertising it did you see office hours with Gary uh actually let's play some the sound behind this oh God we do that we have to office hours with Gary all right let's do it what do seat belts have to do with crypto Lending [Music] chinchillas so influencer video about this from Gary Gensler this is the reply I got a lot of likes I don't know if uh he was ratioed here he was almost ratioed here from uh crypto Wendy you charge them after the fact Gary this impacts retail less money to go around legal fees and fines it's like running a stop sign that wasn't there and giving someone a ticket please give clear guidelines that bolster Positive Growth yes please do that that's what we've been hoping for uh not more of this not more gumming up the works David here's a meme on this too I love this you know I'm a big sucker for SpongeBob memes uh again this is the episode uh I can't remember they're trying to save Bikini Bottom from something man I'm actually sad that I can't remember the details but it's at the end of the episode they've totally destroyed the city and it's SpongeBob turning to Patrick and said we did it Gary we saved investors from crypto after like the cities just totally destroyed very disappointing uh so that's what's going on there meanwhile the big question on everyone's mind is Genesis going bankrupt this came out on Wednesday Today a post from Frank Japan of the block Genesis Global Capital creditors are negotiating a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan with the firm pre-packaged bankruptcy plan that's interesting terminology apparently this would allow for Swifter process to go through bankruptcy if you do this kind of pre-packaged deal before you actually enter the bankruptcy proceedings so it could happen a lot faster than say something like FTX where you're you're kind of forced uh is negotiated I guess yeah and so these are still rumors I think but this was actually reported by Bloomberg as well that the headline of this says crypto firm Genesis is preparing to file for bankruptcy so maybe Bloomberg has a closer Source says the the crypto lending unit of dcg could file as soon as this week and I guess David that impacts um all of dcdg which is digital currency grip could you just refresh people on the structure of digital currency group and like the things that it owns digital currency group of course Barry silper is the CEO they own Genesis which is this asset that is preparing to to file bankruptcy this entire institutional lending and borrowing company what else is in their portfolio yeah so Genesis The Lending desk grayscale and the gbtc eth E trusts which are kind of actually the source of all the contagion also something that got uh basically knee capped by the SEC by not being able to be turned into an ETF so like the SEC is just really just just punching us at every single moment anyways sorry uh the dcg also owns coindesk which we're about to talk about and just a few other things this thing called Foundry luno trade block and also just a bunch of private Equity Investments Venture Capital Investments throughout the space you have to take like pretty pretty big pretty big like uh what do you call these things consortiums of subsidiaries pretty big organization it's a giant organization right many billions of dollars kind of a long-standing crypto institutional organization too yeah David do you think all this is priced in or do you think that this is going to cause some more uh tumultuous times in crypto markets yeah you said that this is really just rumors at this point we actually don't know if this is true but I think everyone is chalking this up just like yeah this is going to happen this is going to totally happen like something's got to happen and it looks like uh there's not really too many paths forwards so uh Genesis preparing for bankruptcy uh dcg will probably keep um we'll keep grayscale because that thing is an absolute Cash Cow uh but uh I think everyone the fact that markets didn't really nuke when we got this bad bad news because this it perhaps implies a bunch of sailing pressure uh implies that this was already priced in now and so this the market is like I don't care about any more bad news like I'm not selling at this point because we're already so down bad in a way it's good news because we do have to clean this up right and it's been in limbo for a period of time and markets hate uncertainty this is maybe more more certainty what happens to coindesk David yeah so this is another rumor but crypto publication coindesk has hired uh Lazard which is a private Equity Investment Bank I believe to help facilitate the sale of coinda so coindesk is a valuable product a valuable company and so they are looking for a buyer because dcg needs the money so coincidence coin desk is up for sale who wants to buy coindesk do you think traditional media will buy it like somebody like CNBC or do you think this will come internal to the crypto no I think I think outside I my bet is somebody outside of crypto something like a Bloomberg or something like that yeah is that do you have any preference is that more bullish what if someone like CZ buys it Finance bias coin desk how'd that make you feel that would be not great okay I would like that to keep that in the states please Bloomberg uh buys coin desk what do you think that'd be great that'd be awesome okay that'd be awesome how about um blockworks group buys coindesk that would be Chad as [ __ ] that'd be so Chad uh yeah we'll see what happens um but the fire sell of assets right in order to uh the unbundling of dcg they're they're basically probably gonna sell everything except for grayscale because grayscale is the cash cow uh I mean there's like a whole conversation there about like how they're they just like jettisoned Genesis they let three arrows Capital Genesis let three hours Capital do the grayscale trade and it was the facilitating mechanism to put a bunch of tvl into grayscale which is the CasCal for basically all of dcg and now they're just selling the wreckage uh yeah there's a bunch of like bad takes negative takes about that also dcg has a pretty strong Venture arm too with a lot of uh assets that is appreciated massively in value and you wonder if some of that's going to be up for auction as well so before we move on there's some irony here to pull out so coindesk is for sale right uh because uh the parent company dcg is under underwater because of the Genesis insolvency because are you going to say they broke the original story of FTX so coindesk broke the original story of FTX about the Alameda balance sheet which caused CZ to tweet about that which caused the ftt to dump which caused Alameda to get liquidated which caused the insolvency of FTX which uh created and that was also triggered by three arrows Capital uh like all of this like contagious this is what contagion is and so at the end of this Loop of contagion is Genesis going under which is a dcg product which that whole thing got pinpricked by another dcg product so coindesk picked pricked the bubble that ultimately led to the unbundling and sale of the apparent company what are you going to do though it's just good reporting it's a good job honestly like a great job Great Well Done coin desk wait that is just good journalism well done but also we're sorry yeah I'm sorry about that one yeah uh yeah it's not your fault but not your right thing for crypto thank you it's crazy right look I I just think I mean I think in some ways every industry is like this except just crypto is like every other industry but more so and it's like more open in the debates and like things happen on Twitter and it's yeah it's very open speaking of open and crazy uh there was a massive threat almost gave crypto a heart attack earlier this week but it seemed like a bunch of government organizations were banding together to announce something it was like a pre-announced started like simmering throughout crypto sphere so here's an a tweet update not only is the doj announcing at 12 p.m Eastern there's there's rumors of an announcement came out of the doj but they will be joined by the FBI the U.S treasury ofac and the state of New York wow Wednesday morning Wednesday morning yeah so rumors got circulated that and ex the doj was going after an exchange that started with the letter B I don't know how that letter B rumor out there but it definitely did here's another tweet one of my good friends told me the doj will sue binance this year and the fine will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars oh God this guy's good friend sources sources all right let's keep on going as guys the fear the fear just like hit all-time highs and so here is a press release out of the Department of Justice media advisory Department attorney uh General Lisa Monaco will lead a press conference to announce a major International cryptocurrency enforcement action the U.S department of the treasury will announce an action in The Space TV coverage will be provided by the network pool uh people people were there was so much speculation there was so much for your Twitter that morning I can't even keep up with it um some people were talking about um validating uh anyone who has an ofac compliant and a validator would basically be net band in the US like there was there was talk of this fear off the charts oh yeah there was talk of like every major crypto company you can imagine you know could have been a Target for this like as you know super scary and honestly every single one of my discords and telegrams were all like okay guys all right so what was it what did it end up being uh crypto exchange bit Lazo uh the founder was arrested and who was charged by do you even know what this exchange is bits Lotto is that how you say this I have no clue I have no clue that was the Big B that they were going after it wasn't financing I don't even know man okay so this is a Russian founder of a uh centralized exchange bits Lotto yes for uh for laundering and crypto asset crimes uh I think uh laundered allegedly laundered more than 700 and million funds the founder Anatoly Lega domov was arrested in Miami this is it this is it this is the big announcement I had no I had never heard of this exchange before I have never either this is uh someone named Haley uh she's a lawyer yeah she says dog enforcement action against Russian exchange bits Lotto I've worked in the space since 2013 never heard of it never heard of it honestly I've never heard of this uh exchange who knows so this showed up in the chart so this is what caused ether to go from sixteen hundred dollars down to like 1490 and then this news came out and it just like pumped right back up to like 15.50 and we're like I don't care I don't care about bits Lotto so of course you gotta appreciate the memes uh coming out about this the sense of the relief of course but uh this classic meme what are you looking at this is the army man protecting the sleeping the sleeping child uh nice missiles yeah and so we got Celsius Voyager block fly knives and grenades is raining down on this child by the Department of Justice is protecting the child from a feather a feather is bit slotto this is another one I love this this is uh a picture of the police drug bust and there's three police officers at the end of a drug bust and they drive serious face is a is a single marijuana pipe wow marijuana pipe that there's like five stores around me in New York that I could buy this is funny do you think that okay so with the SEC um you know announcing going going after uh Gemini and Genesis and then also the doj coming up with this announcement uh do you think that this is all sort of PR of these government agencies to be just like look we're doing things and we're doing things fast in crypto see we're doing something right and so they're just picking the kind of the lowest hanging fruit they can find and making a much bigger deal out of this because then yeah because they can uh it just seems like a sort of a theater type game not it's not actually protecting retail it's not actually helping us moving this industry forward it's not actually doing their jobs yeah they're hoping maybe to score some points with I think like uh crypto natives that are listening to this podcast probably need to put themselves in the shoes of their their parents uh their cousins I don't know and they and they're going to read the headline the doj charges crypto exchange for for 700 million dollars of money laundering and the guys are now going to jail and they're probably going to be like nice job well done and then they're going to hear about like FTX Genesis Gemini earned customers in solving SEC charge them and they're like nice job yeah nice well done government like that's exactly what it is that's and they don't know the difference they don't know how much of an absolute farce this is they may have never even heard of uh binance uh for example and so they can't tell you the difference between the word finance and bits Lotto is not a lot to an outside you're absolutely right that's exactly what's going on and actually Theo asked in the bankless Discord this week um does this change anything uh so what's your answer to that the bitslotto news does it change anything I mean what even is it this isn't even a thing there's nothing so nothing's changing because this isn't even a thing this is a nothing Burger I think so change is nothing fundamentally I think what we might see is more of the trend if more agencies coming out with kind of these these theatrical performances of um who they're going to kind of go after next and I don't anticipate anything uh useful coming out of that for uh for investors in retail and crypto anyway that's what's going on right now but we're not done yet we got a lot more to cover David what's coming up next there's even more so the three arrows Capital Founders Ryan would like you to give them money for their brand new Venture called GTX wow and so we are going to talk exciting well this amazing investment opportunity uh that you must invest in right now we'll talk about the details uh of course I'm I'm joking do not do that uh and then also we're gonna I Want You The bankless Listener to

it back from some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you

investment opportunity they'd like you to consider oh oh boy yeah I'm so excited get this David they are uh raising 25 million dollars for a new crypto exchange and they're calling this GTX why why they are calling it GTX I don't know no the answer Ryan is because the this is the actual real answer I am not making this up this is not a joke the reason why they are calling it GTX is because G comes after F that is literally a slide in their pitch deck after FTX comes GTX it reminds me of their classic artwork purchase of art blocks right at the top it looks like a goose it looks like we like the goose we like the goose do you remember this yeah uh how how is how is anybody considering investing in this thing so this isn't actually just a normal crypto exchange this is an exchange that is meant to be able to trade claims uh so uh cell Celsius claims FTX claims Genesis Capital claims yeah probably I mean that is not specifically in the deck but you can only imagine that they are trying to create an exchange to trade claims on all of the in-solving companies of 2022. I'm getting suddenly very bullish because who has better experience with insolvent companies right here demands for this stupid exchange that they're trying to get it you got to build what you know come on David this is actually pretty bullish I didn't know that so it's for distressed assets specifically it is for claims on future like rewards of whatever people would get and so uh the idea is that FTX imploded leaving more than one million creditors out of pocket and so here's here's a total addressable Market the the one million creditors of the of 2022 crypto the exchange offers depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX and receive immediate Credit in a token called usdg the pitch deck says so we're we're back to printing funny moments yes and uh that's the deal man like if you have a claim you can go to GTX and get your FTX claimed here's someone who's actually seen some of the slides giving a commentary on it uh Garland thanks for uh thanks for finding this um I just love the their numbers they're getting from 1 million uh crypto creditors that are owed money plus the two billion dollars of collective insolvency as a result of 2022 so like we know the address of the audacity of this I I The Audacity Of This pitch deck okay let's go let's go on our roadmap what's the road map looking like oh you first look it's a multi-step roadmap so they're just starting with claims of course okay after that there's another Circle which is they're just starting with G with FTX claims and then and then that three three errors Capital claims come on the market and then they can sell more [ __ ] coins yeah and then they go into stocks and trading they become bigger than Robin Hood and then they go into FX markets and more it's you know uh easy so how much are you investing right oh my God I'm in for half my net worth I I I can't believe anyone is investing in this this is like the odds that it that works are like decently above zero for at least them to get like liquidity and being able to exit and start leverage trading Bitcoin again do you know what um if there was another team launching this it could actually be somewhat interesting to you but I mean like again like you to your point like they they know that market and so like if you think that this is a viable product like they are actually kind of are the right people from the Department job I hate to say it why anyone would give these guys money after this is uh Beyond me but look um people think they can just come back from massive scams in crypto I mean if they have any other choice this is still what I I believe SBF is trying to do right just it's kind of a comeback story and uh new SPF article drop this week we'll talk about that and we'll talk about that too all right let's let's move on uh ethereum good news here hits 500 000 validators ahead of the scheduled Shanghai upgrade that's a lot of validators David half a million validators of course multiply that by that number by 32 and you have the amount of ether deposited into the beacon chain so congrats to the beacon chain for half a million validators I got good news for you too David the devs are still here there are now uh 23 000 monthly active developers in crypto and if you look at this chart here I'm gonna zoom in a little bit this is coming from a report out of the election capital and I remember this I think they do this report every single year so this is not just some like Rando report from saying this is a great report the link in the show notes to definitely go and dive deeper they're scanning all the public githubs I mean this is a thorough report yep uh and basically it has doubled from uh 2020 but what's interesting here is do you see that Flat Line like big price appreciation a whole bunch of developers come into crypto yeah uh in 2017 at the end of 2018 and then it flattens out we're again we're at the leveling outface 2022 where we're not going to go down very much but we're probably going to keep Pace with the amount of developers we have we'll build price appreciates whole new it's like a cycle this happens in fact you can just see the accumulation period so like in 2017 developers go from like it does a 100x and then like prices go down 95 while the developers get heads down busy for like 18 months and then they create the next bull market and now we're back into that accumulation phase I remember seeing like members like this uh in 2018 and it was one of the big like reasons like okay I'm not crazy even though my bags were down 95 my net worth is basically at zero all the developers are still here so something's happening uh and you'll notice that this this chart never goes down developers are always up only in crypto Chris Dixon calls this The Innovation cycle if you want to Google that you can read an article about this this very effective this is why you know we say sometimes like crypto investing is not hard yeah like like look at this the numbers like it's telling the story yeah you know the area under the curve of that chart is also the rate of progress of crypto and which is why I'm so bullish on this particular bull market or bear Market versus last it's because League area under the curve magnitude of building happening is the most it's ever been in crypto ever 100 100 uh cool news from arbitrum the Norwegian government is testing a cap table platform on ethereum using arbitrum Layer Two scaling uh I know you've explored this a little bit but uh what are they doing yeah so this is a uh the Norwegian government has announced the development of Brock Brock I don't know how to in in Norwegian yeah no region yeah oh with the line through it the the Viking language uh and so there is a bunch of just like private shareholder cap table information for unlisted companies companies that are not publicly trading but the Norwegian government's Brock platform allows these companies to manage their cap table on arbitrum uh and so it's a cap table management for not yet public companies uh just to help them make the process more faster more efficient more secure this is a great use of a blockchain 100 we have a global permissionless uh you know settlement layer that anyone can program against why wouldn't you want to put stocks on this thing of course the Newark Stock Exchange is never going to do it why because they're the incumbent but Norway is happy to say oh look at this technology it's promising let's check that out moving on to some other big news metamask enables staking right from the metamask wallet you can now deposit your ether straight into Lido or rocket pull straight through the metamask UI they also report the apis that each of these protocols give you nice decentralized staking as well rocket pool is a much more decentralized option than going to your local exchange so pretty cool to see this also shout out to all the rocket pool homies uh rocket RPL got listed on binance this week immediately jumped like 25 yes also retrace a little bit but it's exciting yeah um what's this about an nft world you wanted to highlight this Discord message this is from mullet one of my favorite crypto Punk nfts Discord screenshot this was in 2017. yeah so this is a the crypto Punk Discord of course uh this account named cyborg says in the Discord I'm about to do something either extremely stupid or wonderfully smart wish me luck and then not just a few moments later the crypto Punk bot that reports all the sales shows up and goes uh a zombie punk was sold for a whopping 1.89 9 ether for 564 dollars and some other person in the Discord goes whoa because that was a big sale for a JPEG for a JPEG 560 for a JPEG who's spending this much money in 2017 on jpegs uh of course that zombie punk is probably worth uh 1 000 times more in ether terms uh and yeah can I just shout out the value of being contrarian right um do you know Ben from our team dug this tweet out was from an old archive as we're migrating from sub stack to our new website it was like surfacing all of these old articles uh this was a tweet from 2019 uh where I said 10x investors know it's not enough to be contrarian it's not enough to be right you have to be contrarian right eth is contrarian now even in crypto circles I think it's contrarian right we'll see this was like depth of the bear Market where ether was real bad 2019. the only people talking about eth were you me Anthony Zano DC investor Eric Connor uh Cyrus unassi had like a few other people it's a pretty small group it was a contrarian bet it was always like yeah Bitcoin might come back and probably will come back and I mean bet in crypto circles but so this is also the key similar to to punks right um a lot of people make contrarian bets a lot of those contrary bets are contrarian wrong yeah they're contributing for good reasons not bad reasons yeah and then most people make bets that aren't contrarian and so you have sort of average performance and average Returns on those sorts of bets the thing you want to find in crypto is the contrarian right bets because that's what gives you kind of the the 10x returns and the 30X returns and the 50x returns and this of course eth is up even now in the bear Market 10x from the time this tweet this tweet eth was floating at 170. uh and uh you know we're 10x from that I'll say that the last time I felt that ether was contrarian was like in the second half of 2021 when it was Solana Avalanche Luna season it was like ethereum was contrarian locally yeah on a relative basis yeah for sure yeah it could be contrarian price to other assets as well um David we got to answer that question about um how many members of Congress got cash from Sam bakeman freed what is the answer to that question one in three uh I guess the article that you're looking at is uh not showing up but one in three members of Congress which comes out to 196 U.S lawmakers took direct contributions from FTX and other FTX Executives 196. I told my wife this and she was like blown away yeah like that's a third I a third and now they're trying to unwind all of that but FDX was just everywhere and Sam begman freed was just everywhere trying to uh trying to infect our government bodies in the United States of America is pretty scary actually yeah the cancer was definitely spreading and cancer cancer is really the way to explain how that corruption is it was corruption yes exactly uh it's a a line from this article was that most of the politicians responded to uh uh questions from coindesk said that they handed it over to Charities to remove the taint of contributions uh can you give it back to the customers why didn't you do that ah it's messy I guess you just gave customer money to charity like I would also love to see what the Charities were that would be nice if that was transplant Foundation like air quotes Charities who knows right right um this is interesting uh digital dollar project warns on the US's cautious approach to see uh cdbc's I think you have a take this is a white paper that a project called digital dollar project came out with and what's the what's the tldr of this white paper I I think the subtext is that the Chinese cbdc has been moving ahead full seam ahead for years now with real progress meanwhile you and I have made fun of whatever like banking Senate Finance banking whoever the Federal Reserve they're just doing research reports about perhaps doing um a digital currency for the United States so this digital dollar project says Hey guys like do something do something and so they call the US's approach to cbdc's an unsustainable position and they are advocating for either doing a cbtc or allowing the stablecoin market to be that it's like pick one and and make forward progress in one of these two directions but the current situation is unsustainable which is something we've been trying to say on the weekly roll up since I think bankless was incepted this is an idea that's been around in business circles for a long time from um Christensen which is kind of the idea that the incumbent always gets disrupted because they're on top they don't think they have to innovate of course um you know Jerome Powell and the dollars on top it is the world's Reserve currency they don't think they have to do anything new but uh you know competitors are nipping at their heels and they're out innovating and this is one key way they're oh innovating interestingly the digital dollar project Ryan is actually led by Chris Giancarlo uh who we've had on the podcast a former member of the cftc so the guy knows a thing or two yeah he was the uh the head of the cftc um for sure um also crypto dad I got his book sitting right back there good book yeah great guy SPF new post on sub stack this guy is now a blogger his weekly reminder that FDX us is totally solvent and always has been uh just yet another you know excel math blog post from SPF not validated just YouTube to read this like don't waste your time uh but this is just your semi-regular reminder that Sam bankman free thing thinks that FTX us is totally solvent and you should too do you know what I still got them on uh notifications I need to stop him from all of the craziness in November uh but uh yeah I'm just sick of it I'm sick of hearing from SPF but he's still posting he's still posting this is some legislation in the EO it's called Micah all right this is sweeping European Union crypto legislation and David I think we really need to dive in on this legislation I'm bankless because it's actually happening uh now it's been delayed that's the news this week it's been delayed until April which gives EU crypto firms some breathing room but David we are having a panel with some experts on Micah it's happening in the next couple weeks uh so that we can get informed you know uh we're based in the US obviously and so uh we often we see you know U.S regulations yeah yeah we just see that's the information that comes closest to us and affects us that we understand I think we want to dive into Micah and fully understand that so that is coming down the pike um I've heard that Mike is you know so so some good some bad so some win some some losses yeah not absolutely terrible for crypto but also not great so we'll dive into that uh in the next couple of weeks and just a word that that's actually been delayed until April so some more breathing room there got a handful of releases to talk about one inch the decked aggregator which is across many many networks is coming in into the world of Hardware wallets so a little little turn of uh development here it's very cool spiffy new hardware wallet expected to go on sale later this year no buttons it's a touch screen it's one of those e-ink grayscale touch displays the whole entire thing looks like a screen so 2.7 inch screen uh touch screen no buttons uh grayscale screen uh looks kind of like a size of a credit card-ish um cool one inch coming into the hardware world of Hardware wallets also coming out is this thing called Den which is something that's built on top of gnosis safe and so I think what this really is is just like a ux layer on top of gnosis safe which can be kind of clunky if you're not used to it but Den is a brand new way to access gnosis safe and they're working with over 180 teams they've set and secured over 80 million dollars and so a new layer on top of den and also coming out of an integration between mean finance and Aztec mean as in the average not mean as in the emotion but average mean Finance uh this was actually raised in the bankless nation Discord because somebody was asking for a way to do on-chain dollar cost averaging that is the simple way to explain what mean Finance is if you have stable coins or assets and you just want to have this system do auto DCA for you mean Finance is where it's at they are doing a connection integration with Aztec Network Aztec is a zero knowledge roll up it's actually a0 knowledge zero knowledge roll up so one layer zero knowledge recursions that's how they get extra scale and also privacy which has let mean Finance do some extra cool new features like flexible swap periods uh privacy gases trading and actual private defy foreign I also have some races this week David uh a few that are notable um the first is Diva it just closes a 3.1 million dollar seed investment this is another 3.5 million dollar seed investment this is another distributed liquid staking protocol so up there try to compete with uh Lido and Rocket pool and uh just know David and I are Angel Investors and this one uh very supportive of decentralized staking uh protocols uh anything this one's uh this one's unique though in that it is uh coming with DVT right out of the gate this is what really attracted me to it is like they were emphasizing uh distributed validated technology right out of the gate and so what is distributed validator technology it's you and a bunch of buddies can come together and create a virtual node with all of your computers uh that make sure that the node is always online online without any risk of redundant signing uh so that's that's why that's why I really like that one Labs opal raised 12.5 million dollars in a series a led by by Pantera opal is the Pioneer of DVT so uh diva is using DVT opal has been pioneering DVD for many many many protocols to use uh I guess this is a DVT raise week this week but opal is just announcing their series a for raise 12.5 million dollars undisclosed valuation but also disclaimer Ryan I are also investors in Opel labs in their seed round because again DVT gets me hot and bothered also on the raise list this week flashbots is Seeking a 50 million dollar investment at billion dollar valuation that's a pretty steep valuation for the bear Market but flashbots is just I mean they pretty much own the Mev uh market share on ethereum right now and and uh maybe it's worth that to some investors yeah plus there's a bunch of just absolute Giga brains at flashbots so it's definitely some exposure to some Frontier level uh thinkers uh last one David this is a a sleep to earn protocol called Sleep agaci Collective for your sleepy do you get paid while you sleep is this the idea I don't know the the title here is uh 3.5 seed round to continue building a mobile application with gamification to improve improve uh sleep Health social elements and gamification for Sleep Health uh I think the the sleep to earn is not the official branding but that is what is like kind of what you get when you read through the uh the lines whatever happened to just work to earn remember those days I I don't know why we need a Ponzi game for every single thing I mean I feel like when I do get good sleep I feel rewarded because of how good that that feels I guarantee you to add money on top of that but hey if you can sleep better yeah turn all of my behaviors into finals [Music] if you are doing a coffee to earn investment I want you to DM me we'll talk about that every single weekly roll up coffee drink your coffee to earn you know and get coffee Reward Points coffee the more we talk about it right now you've got a new Venture I might want to go explore all we need is uh suzu and Kyle Davies to be uh leads in this also we have some questions from the nation coming up David uh we also have a meet-up coming up at East Denver so each Denver happens in February and there is going to be a meet-up of the bankless nation so what's going to be happening at this event and who can attend yeah so we got a nice little Brewery uh that we've reserved for three hours four to seven on a day that is disclosed inside of the bank list Nation Discord so again if you are a bankless nation citizen uh there are details in the bank location Discord Discord for our Meetup uh free beer free beer yeah yeah and there's gonna be a stage uh we're gonna figure out how to do some sort of show maybe a q a session really know but beer and content beer and content who doesn't like that so live yeah live content yeah so if you are a member of the bankless nation definitely don't miss that if you want to go and if you're going to go to eat them or definitely come hang out with us because we're gonna all hang out in real life and drink beer David's gonna do that David's Gonna Get Loose oh this will not be recorded then we know that for sure it's uh you know unrecorded cut um all right question from the nation David yeah we got a few what's the uh the first one here who are we looking at yeah this is a Spartan Solutions uh of course who's got I think the best pfp inside of the bank location Discord uh I saw somewhere someone explaining that the eth deflationary threshold isn't set isn't a set Gatsby but changes with the amount of validators there are on the network is that correct and that is correct that is correct and so I'm actually going to take this moment to show the article that's coming out next week uh I haven't finished the title but there are two charts in this title that will that in this article that will show you if you keep on scrolling down they will show you the actual issuance curve of ether and so this is the amount of ether that is issued versus with the total amount of yeast staked on the horizontal axis so when there is more ether staked issuance goes up and so the more ether that is stated to the network the higher the gas fee is it's needed to become ultrasound because there's more issuance and so that is the answer it's not a fixed number as more ether is staked more higher gas fees are needed in order to be net deflationary interesting um these are good charts where'd you get these charts uh that is from Colin Myers who is actually the founder of opal very cool yeah that's I'm looking forward to that post David I haven't read that yet um here's another question from Luth Luke eathwalker why does Bank list measure whether ether's deflationary a deflationary acid against the supply that existed at the merge that's right we do do that in fact we just did that in the market section shouldn't we analyze whether it is deflationary in comparison to its peak Supply Li according to ultrasound.money Peak Supply happened on October 7 2022 and eth has been deflationary therefore and and therefore in my mind an ultrasound asset since then so I think he's making the point that hey uh the entire last quarter eth has basically been deflationary but whenever I see you guys talk about it you're always pointing to this ultrasound money chart uh which you know there's there's a dial on this where you can see like even this this is um since merge each Supply since merge uh and that's what eth uh Luke eth Walker is asking yeah so this is uh unpacking revealing the Dirty Little Secret of ultrasound money is that it's actually not clearly defined what it is uh so is ether has been Ultra ultra sound sense and depending like ether has been deflationary since the merge yeah you can pick a date you can pick a date right and actually like this specific supply of ether at the day of the merge is just an arbitrary number that doesn't really mean anything uh I think there's a number of different different ways to Define ultrasound I think the correct way to define what ultrasound money is is the theoretically maximum amount of Supply reduction that is safe for a crypto economic protocol which is a mouthful of a definition but even when ether inflates as in when the supply is going up under that definition it's still ultrasound because you ether between the combination of eip1559 and proof of stake is the theoretically maximum amount of Supply reduction that you could get in that environment even though it is still inflating well I I think you can measure on time periods too though right to this point this is just arbitrarily to supply but at the beginning of the episode we also talked about eth Supply in Q4 of last year of 2022. and it was uh deflationary by negative .004 actually so in that time period it was deflationary I I think the eth supply since the merge date will become less less relevant over time and still might be a fact but still happen relatively quickly we might start looking at this on the monthly quarterly and annual basis instead I think that's right but yeah the com the interaction between the words deflationary and ultrasound is like an unknown science that we're just kind of loosely talking about oh you're saying we're making this up as we go absolutely dude that's that's how all language and all memes work actually at the basement level breaking bankless is making it up as they go uh here's another take from uh necrosis or a question rather I see a lot of fun about l2s being very centralized how centralized are layer twos and what are their plans to become more decentralized and trustless as they grow this was asked in the bankless Discord uh of course uh what's your answer for necrosis here yeah so this is a very good question uh how centralized layer twos are is it's not an easy thing to say in one sentence but you are on the mark that layer twos have various degrees of centralization many layer twos are just a multi-sig arboretum and optimism just multi-cigs uh I believe that's true uh but there are other things as well to increase the security of these things and vitalik actually at roll up day in Bogota did a talk on this uh and so yes to say uh Layer Two Roll-Ups are decently centralized in their current form today we do have the path to uncentralize them to decentralize them and vitalik talks about that in this uh video that I've linked time stamp the link in the show notes if you want to get that question answered the tldr is there are multiple like layers of redundancy that are able to be built uh where like you could have a multi-sig but you could also have the actual fraud proof we're worried about fraud proofs and bugs and so we need to have a multi-sig like there's a bunch of nuances there it's not enough to go into but if you want to learn more about this topic there is a vitalik talk in the show notes and layer 2B is doing a great job kind of covering this right yeah um they have sort of the the level of centralization the decentralization of each of these layer twos and I think that the point that vitalik is making in his presentation did today is that almost all roll ups are still on training wheels right um but the idea of training wheels is training wheels can be taken off right and then it's a real bike a real decentralized roll-up if you're a side chain you're always going to have those trains yeah like you are yeah you are training whales or you're a tricycle you're not even a bike or something else so that that is the point um and I don't know the timeline on some of these things but every single day or two has got their own timeline yeah they're all in race exactly uh David let's go to fight about how far they are on the race though that is that's true let him fight that's why I'm fighting about that yeah more decentralizations better David let's get to some takes here's one from Ryan selkis he's talking about Gensler our favorite uh our star of this episode against our attacked coinbase he cozies up to SPF biggest fraud since Madoff spit in the face of retail investors by rejecting spot ETFs and spent more time finding bankrupt entities and Kardashians than fixing problems he's a crooked cop on the beat not a public servant Ryan selfies always drop in the fire on Gensler uh he's been doing it for a long time I don't know like this is the probably the most critical interpretation of what gensler's doing but David honestly check it out dude I can't say he's wrong about this super right yeah I really wouldn't want to drive the point home Gensler attacks coinbase coinbase had their own version of Gemini urn which was not going to get plugged into Genesis it was going to be their own yield Source it was going to be native to them and the SEC says if you guys ship this product we're going to sue you for for selling on registered Securities and then coinbase was like oh scared I'm not going to offer that and so we had the safe we had the safe outcome and the SEC was like no you can't have that and then it's so dumb dude uh The Departed have you ever seen that with like Leonardo Dicaprio and everyone do you know how it's like um there really were no good guys in that movie it was like all the cops were bad too it's like not to say that um crypto doesn't have its share of bad guys and Villages it totally does right but that also doesn't mean all of the cops trying to kind of regulate this industry are good and doing the right thing I think we have some uh bad guys in uh in those circles as well uh here's another take what's this one from Voorhees so air for he says Wild West is not a term of disparagement but the embracing of the frontier and a celebration of permissionless individualism God all of those words just yeah warm myself yeah so I gave this a retweet because I wanted to add this was this was hot on the heels of Gary Gensler calling crypto a wild west right oh he said that yeah yeah he says the crypto is a wild west that needs to get reigned in so Eric Voorhees tweeted that I retweeted veric Voorhees and I say I'm in crypto because it's the wild west that's why I'm here Gary gensler's labeling of crypto as a wild west that needs to be reigned in is the same mindset that motivated frontiersmen to go west in the first place to get free from tyranny and oppression so like the irony here is that Gary gensler's the dude that motivated people to go west in the first place that's why we're doing this that's why we're doing banks the frontier it's not for everyone but we're headed west that's everything for me it's definitely for me from inception uh yeah I agree with that before he sees it too uh suzu how did it take this week I'm gonna read out that take owning crypto in Cold Storage when done properly is one of the most anti-fragile Financial acts one can take trading crypto aggressively is one of the most fragile Financial acts one can take he would know I've learned the hard way as many others have this past cycle stay humble and stack SATs baby just stay humble and stack say that's humble uh I mean this is just an uh Susu take that is it was celebrated look at all these likes David yeah yeah okay but the only reason why we're putting this take in here is because of a prediction that was made by Eric Wall where suzu and Kyle Davies miraculously become influential Bitcoin maximalist I did not expect this to happen this quickly but this is that this is this is that and so uh Hunter psyops works like he's not wrong in this stake but he's obviously uh playing an influential game why is anyone listening to this guy right now okay well bitcoiners are listening to them to him because he's saying the Bitcoin are words he's saying stay humble stack chat stats and the Bitcoin is like yeah those are our words so if you say the thing the tribe wants you to in social media the tribe will celebrate you no matter what the reason that you're saying them or if you actually believe them so then you can just manipulate the mob by saying things that the mob likes to hear is that what you're telling me yeah that's right well that really sucks David anyways let's burn a bunch of ether right Ryan I mean like geez if we re-prop up these uh influencers again as influencers like um must deserve it don't we this is your take I'm gonna read it out Bitcoin will hit its Supply cap in the year 20 140. that's when issuance finally goes out right it approaches zero and it kind of hits zero I guess at that point these Supply uh the eth supply hit its cap last year wow uh tell me about that first of all justify that how explain that one how does that work yeah so this is there's a prediction there's a claim being made here but uh the Bitcoin Supply we know the Bitcoin supply curve around 2140 it will stop issuing Bitcoin and it'll be a year that's the year 21. 120 years roughly in 120 years zero more Bitcoin will be issued uh and then I follow up and say the supply cap for ether what hit its cap last year which I'm claiming is like the supply of ethers down only because now it's ultrasound uh that in theory could not be true we could technically stop having so much gas fees and then uh and then we would issue more but I'm claiming that that's not gonna happen but I'm saying let's let's contrast these things Bitcoin Supply stops inflating in the year 2140 ether Supply stopped inflating last year that was my spicy take of the week wow uh you might be wrong a little bit on that like in that maybe it Peaks this year but like I think you'll be mostly right yeah which is like the thesis of I'm placing money on that I'm right and so that means about 120 million so that means what you're saying is eth will never hit 121 million in terms of Supply well yeah I mean go up to the peak of uh issuance right after the merge like whatever that Peak is I'm saying that supply of ether will not be greater than 120 million 533 000 which is this peak which happened I hit last year that's a very uh precise estimate yeah exactly and I've got like uh 15 000 ether yeah 15 000 ether of a wiggle room so we need to not issue 15 000 ether and I will be right there you go um from this point from this moment tell me what your bullish on and it can't be eat I'm bullish on an article about ether [Laughter] and so I've got an article that's going out a week from today uh which is uh will be Thursday for bankless listeners uh we're just using that same article right empty yeah we teased the article uh and so you can start to like read a little bit about it but it goes out next week I was just hit with a whiff of inspiration and this last weekend and I just banged out an article and I was I'm actually pretty proud of it uh it's about how ethereum automatically balances itself uh gas fees the eat steak rate this is a self uh this is a loop of signaling that allows the ethereum economy to self-manage itself and what is the process what is the project of crypto economics it's about making making self-governing Financial systems and so there is a system that has been created between gas fees between the East stake rate between the supply of staked eat the the heat of the defy economy and all of these things create an equilibrium that allows ethereum to induce economic activity during cold seasons and pull back economic activity when things get too hot and it does it automatically where the FED tries and does this manually ethereum does this automatically and the thing about the FED is that the FED is actually its own source of chaos and so the FED is trying to maintain stability in the economy but then the economy is looking at the fed and being like oh they're raising interest rates trade trade trade and so like the FED is actually a source of chaos into the system uh ethereum does not have that source of chaos and so it is a magically Auto balancing Financial system that article comes out on Thursday next week along with a video as well if you are a video-minded person and then inside of the bankless nation there's going to be a q a session uh discussion a book club if you if you will for anyone that has any questions so that will happen on Friday a week from the time you are listening to this at 3 pm Eastern uh I'll go into the little water cooler video voice chat inside of the bank listening Discord and we'll have a little q a so if you read this article and you want to ask questions and talk about it and unpack it a little bit more with me I will be there on Friday 3 P.M eastern time so I will see you there it really is a an algorithmic monetary policy which is kind of cool and also what sort of Bitcoin has promised from inception right except Bitcoin does not have a balanced algorithm it's too fragile in other words yeah Supply decreases and then uh security goes out the window I mean transaction like if if a Bitcoin was solely dependent on transaction fees um I saw the stat the other day it'd be about 2.5 million dollars in Bitcoin uh security spent per day the cost of attack is just like minuscule in the millions of dollars uh just not sustainable and um yeah I think that's a still a much underappreciated aspect of ethereum and the ethereum economy well that's what I'm bullish on Ryan what are you bullish on uh another underappreciated aspect of what we're doing here in crypto and the ethereum economy and that is New Frontiers and really the inspiration for this David was that episode we had with arbitrum where this is my first time to really talk to some of the participants in the arbitrim community that was an episode that came out earlier this week if you want to learn about arbitrary and what people are doing go check that out and I guess I had um two observations under the kind of this motif of New Frontiers um the first is this allows for much more diversity like rather than monoculture so what I struck with is the arbitrum community is so very very different from ethereum mainnet and from the applications ecosystems and players on ethereum mainnet and I know we're going to talk to optimism in the coming weeks that community and polygon as well I think optimism is going to be more different still and like polygon that's a whole nother variation it reminds me um before crypto David believe it or not I used to travel a lot like a whole lot and I've probably visited almost every every state in the U.S at least the continental US sounds awful um yeah it was it was a lot of travel but you get like airports and that sort of thing but you have the ability to kind of experience each state in the US and you realize how diverse the US actually is like you know going to somewhere like um Alabama is much different than going to somewhere like um you know Washington State uh you know two totally different experiences of the US which is very different from New York and there's a different feeling in the west coast versus the East Coast versus the Midwest and so culturally it's different there are also different laws for every every kind of state and every geography um but it's interesting because somehow this diverse set of jurisdictions and States as they're called with borders uh all works right because they have the same set of shared values what makes them American if you go down to kind of the shared values as you know that the founders kind of put together it's in the Constitution a decentralized protocol right layer one protocol yeah and um that's what's so cool is what I'm seeing in arbitrum is it's not similar it's not the same as ethereum but it's kind of an echo of the value system yet it's its own independent uh culture and set of applications and also set of New Frontiers too like we've just opened up and layered to these vast new uh lands to basically settle and so entrepreneurs can go out there and set build new things uh users can go out there and use new products Governors can go out there and kind of uh figure out how to uh govern these ecosystems as well uh and yet it's it's someone like the United States as well which is like this shared experiment of all of these different states right where um if one state develops an innovation it can pass it on to another state and they all sort of level up together and so leveling up together while retaining their cultural differences yeah exactly so if the arbitrum community uh you know the game five really takes off there let's say in sort of treasure an ecosystem they develop some sort of groundbreaking uh wallet type application that is super easy to use that can be exported to every other state every other Layer Two in ethereum it's just so exciting to me to see all of this come together and to realize here's here's the net of it is to realize we are just like not even one percent through this journey here like I was almost you know part of me was sort of lack of imagination really it's just like oh the set of applications that we have in ethereum in in 2019 in 2020 they are going to be the like the big pockets of of culture and inspiration for their no like there's going to be all of this Innovation across all of these layer twos and we are just getting started and so that means there's a far more opportunity 99 of the opportunity is still ahead of us in the crypto economy and we're just like a few steps on that on that road so New Frontiers is what's really exciting to me and seeing these layer 2's Blossom is really nailed that home for me yeah and I think the angle you're really uh touching on is like the social scalability of the layer 2 system which is like what what's what's your Vibe are you like does arbitrum fit your Vibe or does optimism fit your Vibe like what what vibe do you want because there's a layer two for you uh like are you trying to like reorchestrate oh like human governance and create like a new digital like digital State because that's what optimism is trying to do with their two-tier token model are you in the Big World of defying in gaming because that's what that's what arbitrum is all about like what do you want on polygon you got magic Eden over there and like abagachi uh so like what's your Vibe because we got a layer two for you uh and the cool thing is this is also true outside of crypto because of the cultural differences are all across all layer ones but when you do the same thing the social scalability on ethereum like you're all in the same ecosystem so you have composable communities because you can it exists both on arbitrum and on optimism at the same time and you can't do that on the layer ones and so this is all about like social scalability like how can the layer 2 ecosystem map onto the values and cultures that we find out in the real world yeah it's it's really cool and uh it's it's I think one of the most exciting times to be in crypto honestly is uh January 2023 because we're just uh we're just starting this journey all right David we got one meme of the week it's amazing meme what are we looking at here this is a Cyrus unesi uh this is the meme uh it's kind of an esoteric meme of the uh two people at the gate lowering or raising the gates one guy says to the other rampant money printing caused the worst inflation in 40 years raise the interest rates uh and then the next panel is the government is going to default on debt this Thursday lower the interest rates and then following eggs are twelve dollars a carton raise the interest rates just a little bit just a little bit I love the image of it's just like one guy through raw human strength just like cranking this thing and it's it's just medieval and it kind of doesn't work it's non-automated that's that's really what's happening right now with the economy isn't it exactly sadly no uh no moment I've done this week well we got to end it there guys uh we will end with our usual risks and disclaimers of course and just to remind you crypto is risky we always say that at the end of every bankless episode you could definitely lose
