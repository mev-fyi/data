david if i owe you money and you orion and ryan owes me we can clear all those debts without any liquidity just by servicing the fact that we have this close loop of obligation that's good money i mean that money didn't even materialize and yet we were able to have a whole you know cycle of exchange and it's not sitting under anyone's mattress it's not accruing you know value or premium or anything like that and i think that's actually the root of money is this sort of like mutualism in a sense and you know altruism and gift economies and all this sort of stuff but trying to bring that back into the modern world i think is really important because we've lost it and so much of our economics has been structured to be kind of linear right and something comes in and goes out and usually ends in in some rich person's pocket and then it stays there and and you know you look at measures of monetary velocity and they're collapsing and money doesn't move through the economy and people can't get access to it right and so focusing on this monetary premium aspect kind of devalues this actually super important thing which is that we make sure that that money circulates that people can can clear their obligations that they can enter into obligate you know into uh trade obligations without feeling like they have to go into debt to a bank and pay high interest rates just to be able to participate in the economy right
