why do you think brands struggle so much when they enter the space or at some point in their lifespan of being in the space i mean i think it's the nature that they're massive these are huge companies that when you're running a multi-billion dollar business you can't like pivot and be like oh well free mints are popular now like we're going to just drop everything we've been working on for the last 12 months and just do a free mint i think when you're a startup and you know you have a team of three to five people you can pivot overnight as much as like some of these companies are moving at the speed of light for their company it's still really really slow in the world of crypto and nfts right so i think that that's part of it and it's also like an entirely new business model a year ago at this time if you were to walk into a room full of cmos they probably would have laughed at you if you were talking to them about the metaverse but i think now at this point every company has to have some sort of metaverse strategy what is their part look like in a digital future
