why is bankless wrong about just about everything it's really a matter of emphasis and you know i've seen um you know on the show and in some writings a lot of focus on things like okay going bankless things like monetary premium things like you know this empire model and uh and what's another one defy right and what i prefer is to emphasize something a little bit different for each of those things right so rather than bankless i would rather think about being co-op full rather than monetary premium i would rather think about monetary clearance rather than empires i prefer to think about city-states and rather than decentralize finance i prefer to think about regenerative and or collaborative finance right so it's it's a little bit of a shift in in emphasis it's not so much that you're wrong about everything per se it's just that maybe uh maybe you're incomplete or you know maybe we're not going far enough
