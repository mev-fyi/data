as a creator i'm really excited to see a new technology that's based around community and i think you know the world's in a weird place right now just culturally no one knows what the is going on in music right now no one knows how to break a song everyone points to tick-tock but like you can't make a song go viral on tick-tock the artists that i really look up to right now that are winning the most are not focused on having big hit songs they're not focused on just like the flex of it all ticket sales is where you really see how much people love an artist and the people that are winning in that space are the ones that have focused on community and i think what web 3 empowers is it's a whole toolbox that empowers artists like that to bolden their community
