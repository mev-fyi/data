somebody came up to me was like hey you know blockchain gaming you know it's starting to happen and this thing's pretty interesting and as ahead of gaming at youtube i was like this is like a complete blind spot you know i took a lot of pride in knowing the gaming industry well as part of my you know my role and so it was like oh okay um can you elaborate on that and so just started having more conversations particularly with people in venture right and how allocation was starting to go towards blockchain games you were starting to see pretty prominent talent leaving some of the established studios to come into the space and so it really just started as i need to learn about it right like i don't want to have this blind spot of this emerging category within gaming and let me tell you uh i think like the red pill thing is a very real thing because uh i i think of the whole space is like a great page turner of a book and you just can't stop and so as i spent more time learning and meeting people in the space it became very difficult for me to not want to do it you know as a full-time thing
