foreign [Music] ation to this episode of alpha leak alphalique episodes are where we go and dive into a specific project in the crypto space and just go from 0 to 60 about what it's doing uh what it's up to why it's different and why you might be interested in diving down the rabbit hole even further today on this episode of Alpha League we're talking to Michael Bentley from the oiler and Euler is a money market much like compound and Ave also much like fuse as well rari's fuse pools and Euler is trying to do the best of both worlds of these two different models for producing a money market we have the shared liquidity model of aveen compound and then we have the long tail long tail of assets model with very fuse pools and we're trying to find out how it can have the best of both worlds to both enable the long tail of assets but also maximize Capital efficiency they also have some other things that they've tinkered with they've messed around with like the liquidation mechanism and innovated on that as well as the interest rates uh mechanism as well all in the name of preserving Capital efficiency see and making Euler a highly utilized money market in the world of defy they launched their Dow in their token just a couple months ago the the first application of Euler came online I think in December is when Michael said it said it came online and which is like a hairy time for a market a money market to go online and D5 because since December we've had like six seven straight red months so really getting stress tested in its first Genesis on defy and it has held up very very well so I hope you guys enjoy this episode of alpha leak and if you want other shows if you want me to dive into other projects other shows other tokens whatever let me know on Twitter and I'll

to this edition of alpha leak today on the show I have Michael Bentley the founder of Euler uh you probably when you read it you probably read Euler but it's Euler uh Michael welcome to the show hi David thank you very much for having me cheers so let's go ahead and get right into it what is Euler Euler is a permissionless lending protocol on ethereum uh some of your listeners might be familiar with compound and are they two of the probably the most popular lending protocols on ethereum uh Euler is similar to those protocols but with a whole bunch of Innovations and things kept built in that we've been developing uh over the past couple of years so we can dive into a couple of those uh in the show I'm sure but more or less that's it it's a lending protocol users come and lend their assets other users borrow assets from those lenders and pay them an interest right so this is you know defy Basics right people put collateral in they borrow against their collateral people do this all the time with compound and Ave which is a competitive market to try and penetrate so we're going to talk about some of the strategies that that Oiler has to penetrate what is already like a pretty saturated Market with compound and Ave um what would you say is like the main differentiator between compound Ave uh and and Euler uh I would say it's the risk framework that oil has implemented uh that in the Mis framework which we'll dive into um is a consequence of the fact that we're permissionless from from the outset and permissionless by permissionless we mean that anybody can create their own lending and borrowing markets on this protocol and that creates a whole host of problems and a whole whole host of attack vectors and that leads you from the outset to have to really think about risk in very different ways and really to consider a much bigger scope of possibilities and so our risk framework I think is extremely comprehensive yeah let's talk about why why can't a money market like Ave or compound just list every single token Under the Sun like why can't we have every single asset inside of Lobby or compound yeah great question there's a a range of possibility like yeah possible answers to this I think probably one of the biggest reasons is comes from oracles so an oracle is a place where you go to to get the price of an asset and you need to know the prices of assets on a lending protocol so you can say how much can a lender uh you know how much can I use a borrow um when they put in a thousand dollars of class well you want them to be able to borrow less than a thousand dollars of assets otherwise if they could borrow more than that they would just keep the difference and walk away right so you have to really know the prices of assets and uh getting the price of assets is really difficult uh both compound and are they rely on chain link oracles chain Link's a third party that um Aggregates prices from contributors and puts those prices from centralized exchanges at a variety of other places on on chain for users um unfortunately it's very difficult to establish a chain link comical it's often quite expensive to put prices on chain like that over the year over the course of a year and uh and so you can't just have training comicals winning for every asset it just wouldn't be economic to to run that kind of system so because of the gas fees right like every single Oracle for like every single price feed and like there's thousands and thousands of assets on ethereum and if we want to put all of these assets into a money market like Ave or compound every single one needs to have their own price feed and the way that chain link works is it publishes that price feed on a transaction on chain which costs gas and so like you have to multiply the number of transactions by the number of assets and so like assets like uh I mean usdc wbtc ether like the main the big assets like there's enough demand to borrow these things that it's economically viable to put these price feeds on chain like we can pay those those gas fees a chain they can afford it but for like the long tail of assets the many many thousands of other assets like there's not enough utility in borrowing these things that to justify the on-chain price feeds so that's like one one restriction right is that a good way to summarize it perfect yeah it's it's I mean it's extremely costly as you mentioned I saw some estimate that in in March 2020 when there was this big um you know volatile period black Thursday in in the crypto ecosystem uh for a single price feed it might have cost a million dollars in gas fees just to maintain One Price feed so um yeah you can see that in volatile periods it's expensive to take this approach so what in in volatile periods are when the price feeds are required the most like that's when you need that's when D5 needs these prices to be accurate or else if I will fall apart absolutely yeah so so what's the alternative uh the the approach to Euler uses is uh it uses decentralized price feeds that are read from the uniswap uh decentralized exchange unit swap version three uh and what's what's cool about this is that unit swap runs um all the time it's never offline and the prices are generated by Traders themselves we don't need specialized third parties or Keepers or any any other third party to come and put those prices on train they're just on chain because people are trading using uniswap uh so units using these pythonicals has some some challenges which we can maybe dive into later as well but ultimately uh what what anything that's listed on uniswap is a decentralized uh comes equipped with a decentralized pythonical and Euler can then use that to establish prices for assets and then and then build upon that to to allow people to let them borrow assets okay yes we'll put a pin in the game ability of a uniswap market as a price feed we'll talk about that later because that's definitely something to discuss um but like that's this is like the big in my mind the big of two reasons uh the how uh Oiler can allow every single asset in ethereum to become part of its uh in part of its vaults right and part of its uh money market because it uses uniswap for a price feed instead of chain link and so like uniswap it has in proxy unitop is an oracle right like what is the price of this token on uniswap Euler consumes that data for Price feeds and allowing uh Oiler to have more assets inside of its Ace application so that's like one main difference I think the other one though as to like why why can't Ave or compound just list every single asset under this under the sun is like collateral risk uh and if and so in my mind these are the two big things that prevent a money market from being able to list every single asset can you talk about Euler's strategy with like a collateral risk yeah sure so we've got the the state of oil as it is today and then where it's going in the future as well so I can give you a little bit of a sort of an alpha leak about about that as well but uh you're absolutely right if you allowed everything to be used as collateral uh to borrow even you could borrow against any old any old asset um any old you know the latest dog coin or whatever that people are kind of vaping into uh things would go wrong extremely quickly um and that's because these assets are extremely volatile and the essentially the collateral backing all these loans would quickly evaporate in periods of volatility and that would affect lots of assets at once in fact it would lead to what people often refer to as contagion where one loan fails to get repaid that kind of drives the you know I think a process called liquidation happens which drives prices down further which means more loans are then under collateralized which means you know more liquidations prices fall and so on um yeah this is really bad uh and is most assets generally aren't suitable for use as collateral the way that Euler addresses this is through risk isolate like Risk various mechanisms around risk isolation on Euler there are three tiers of assets there are those assets that can be borrowed against they're called they they fund the collateral tier you can lend uh you can borrow and you can use those assets as collateral and the currently only seven assets on Euler that can be used as collateral which include the usual candidates like stable coins but also uh you know Big Blue Chips like Ethan and Bitcoin um yeah beyond that we have these other asset tears and uh where things can't be used as collateral and furthermore there are some restrictions on what you can do to in uh sort of a margin trading environment and by default when people create new lending markets on order they end they they begin life in this kind of restrictive uh restricted um kind of mode where they can't be used as collateral um and so that allows this permissionless aspect essentially risk isolation things by default can't be used as collateral and then through governance you can actually promote things to business collateral so that's the state of oil as it is today um a lot of people do want to borrow against longer tail assets though and that is a huge you know legitimate function that the market can potentially service a few other protocols have tried to enable this in the past um with varying degrees of success people might know about cream and rare fuse pools and so on I think the way that Euler will develop in the long run is uh that there will be a kind of main Euler protocol and then beneath it something akin to like a rare refuse type pool system where they have these little baby Oilers that essentially get established below the main protocol and liquidity will flow in through the main protocol into these baby oils and that will enable people to borrow against a whole load of assets without posing additional risks that the main protocol yeah so the way I've explained this to some people is that yeah Euler is really going trying to go after the Best of Both Worlds between Rari and compound compounder Ave the compound and away are interchangeable for these purposes where uh you have what you what you call like baby Oilers where uh you have the highest risk assets like the isolation assets that are allowed to um be borrowed against in isolation and it's not connected to their main Hub of Euler but it's just like this one market it's like one rawi fuse pool and then Euler governance can allow these assets to like go up into like a more a more premium tier right and so you have like um isolation tiers which is like the riskiest assets then you have cross tiers which is like the medium assets and then you have collateral tiers which is like the things that like behave like money basically Bitcoin ether stable coins uh and so the in these isolation tiers that's like a that's like a very fuse pool and then like the collateral tier is something like Ave or compound where like it's a shared liquidity model and the the beautiful thing about avian compound is that when you uh like borrow or when you lend usdc to the protocol you lend it out to simultaneously people who are putting up a Bitcoin collateral ether collateral uh like you know uni collateral inside of compound and so it's very like capitalally efficient because the same amount of usdc supplied to compound is shared behind a variety of borrowers because these borrowers have all put up good collateral like Bitcoin ether like these money-like assets but you can't do the same thing for something like extremely risky like like if you did it for every single token that was just and permissionlessly allowed any token to uh become collateral you would have like the event of somebody would like uh you know mint a bunch of tokens start providing liquidity and uniswap to create a price uh and then that that token could just be borrowed against inside of like Euler but then because this person made the token they could like infinitely mint a bunch more and then that token in as collateral inside of Euler would go to zero and then they borrowed all that uscc and ran off with it uh and so like this is what uh while there is this need inside of D5 to have these like one-off marketplaces like Raleigh fuse pools you can't have this connected to the main Hub because you need to like prevent that contagion right and so so this is in my mind this is where Euler is trying to get Oilers trying to get the best of both worlds where it has these isolation tiers but it allows governance allows to these things to elevate uh into better and better collaterals I I think you might have uh mentioned crosstiers but can you go into like crosstier like the middle tier and how what assets what assets go into cost here and like how are those are different from the other two yeah so the um the the first here ISO is isolation mode where you can only borrow that asset in isolation uh the cost here although we kind of column it in this orange color and it looks kind of like a middle tier it's probably still quite close to the lower to close to the lower tier than it is to the class we'll see essentially crosstair just allows you to cross margin trade um you can put up collateral borrow multiple assets at once and your whole collateral will be at risk at this point you could be borrowing say shib and Link in uni all from the same account and uh essentially all your whole pool of collateral will be at risk if one of those loans goes wrong in the isolation tier you would put up some collateral and you'd borrow a ship and that would be it if you want to borrow a link then tough you have to go and set up a new account um that would be a real pain of course and if you had to you know fund multiple ethereum addresses and so on and people don't like doing this on compound and are they so another Innovation that I'll mention very briefly is that to enable this because we're isolated forcing this isolation on people for riskier assets uh we we do also provide this this uh feature called the Sub sub accounts and these are accounts that actually belong to an ethereum address but within the context of Euler and its protocol can be used as like an entirely new account and so you can fund like multiple multiple positions at once from a single ethereum address or inside Euler beautiful beautiful okay so just to go through it one more time to make it like crystal clear you have isolation tiers which if you want to um use these assets as or if you want to borrow these this particular isolation to your asset you put up collateral and that collateral is then locked into that one position as in that that collateral cannot also be used for another asset is just one account you put like a hundred like a thousand dollars of Ethan and then you can borrow this one token and that one thousand dollars of eat that you have this collateral can be used as collateral for another token then you have crosstiers where like you have a thousand dollars of ease and that can be collateral for multiple tokens uh but those tokens cannot be collateral because they are not of the collateral tier which is like the third and highest and best tier and that is preserved for like I keep on saying like money like assets and the reason why I say that is like money like assets are money is like highly decentralized it's highly liquid it's highly available like Global Marketplace like you can you know the demand for these things are there and so it's very safe for a money market to have money like assets as collateral and so again that's like the usdc stable coins wbtc uh ether itself and like I could even see like many many more D5 Blue Chips kind of elevating themselves to Collateral tier like things like uh Ave and uni that we kind of assume aren't going there I don't know if they are in the collateral tier yet but just like a comment on just how D5 works is that like the more money like your asset is whether it's whether it's like a defy token or actual money like usdc the more money like it is the more like good collateral it is and so like when Euler governance determines like what assets belong in what tiers it's like the collateral tier that's like the money tier and everyone wants to be in the collateral tier uh am I on track here yeah more or less in fact I would say um I mean my opinion on this I'm super super conservative when it comes to class holes and uh when you mention like adding new collateral Tears like D5 Blue Chips the real problem with those is that um when you use something as collateral you have to guarantee there's always a willing buyer out there to to take on board that collateral if someone's debt need to be paying now unfortunately even for D5 Blue Chips in in liquidity crises like the ones we've had in the past couple of months with 3ac and all the rest of it and Celsius happening um the the like the the number of willing buyers for those tokens has decreased dramatically so on oil we we push the governance proposal um before before the project started to decentralize to actually decrease the collateral decrease yeah the classical factors and a few assets and we actually removed Matic um the token um from the polygon project um outside of the clatal tier and that's not because we you know we don't like Matic or don't like the project or the team or whatever unfortunately if you plot the liquidity profiles for this on decentralized exchanges you can see that it was a an extremely liquid market for a long long period but in recent times it suddenly became in a liquid Market and that's really dangerous if um you know if someone if someone would say 10 million dollars worth of Matic uh could put that up as collateral and borrow say five million dollars worth of uh you know usdc what you want to be able to do at all times is guarantee that you can take that Matic and swap it for usdc and if there's no liquidity on decentralized exchanges or there's no liquid no willing buyers for that matter can willing to make that trade then unfortunately it's not suitable for users collateral so yeah I'm super conservative when it comes to collaterals I think risk first and then Capital efficiency second um and like I say I think in the long run we'll have this this additional functionality which isn't isn't uh there yet I know I love it which has these kind of siled pools where people can then use some of these longer tail Assets in a siled pool as collateral um in the future and borrow against them in a in a siled sort of risk managed isolated environment right and well it definitely after we've seen these drawdowns for the last six months everyone's kind of like re-pricing how repricing risk in this way it's like oh yeah like yeah let's let's be a little bit more risk aversities these days um okay so like these are the in my mind the the two features that really stand out about oil are that differentiate it from things like compound Avi and Ave and murari uh and so you have on-chain pricing articles from uniswap V3 and then you have this more flexible asset uh collateral tiers that allow for just like more higher Fidelity with what assets can do what you know inside of a money market and so these these properties these features of Euler just open up uh assets to the long tail right like we can now allow for the long tail of assets to gain access to compound and Ave styled money market features can you talk about like this as a strategy and what this can do for defy and how this is useful and overall just like why accessing and providing Financial Services to the long tail of assets is important yeah sure I mean from from the outset I mean we wanted to create a permissionless lending postcard we wanted something that was uniswap-like without these kind of Gatekeepers and I don't think you know the the chaining system is it's extremely functional as well very very well but it does end up a side consequence of the way that system works is that essentially what what the the chain link kind of uh system decides is worthwhile having an oracle for ends up being a kind of a process that also determines what you can lend them borrow and that doesn't really seem seem appropriate so philosophically I think it's aligned with the kind of vision of decentralized violence to have a system where anybody can lend them borrow any asset depending on their own risk appetite and so on so there's that as a starting point we want to kind of eliminate The Gatekeepers from the system um on a design point and what this means for actually building a protocol it's super important because when you start by assuming that everything can go wrong um you build a protocol that's far more far more robust in my opinion because you have to check every little feature um and so I'll give you an example on when other projects are Fork the compound protocol uh compound fantastic project it was the inspiration I used to to sort of uh get into a D5 with Euler um but it wasn't built with all sorts of crazy markets in mind it was built to service a smaller number of markets and that's absolutely fine from a design perspective but it meant when new projects came to Fork the code the code wasn't suitable to be used for certain types of assets on the other hand Euler assumes the absolute worst about your token if you list it on Euler we assume that you're malicious that you're a scam that you have weird functions that do stuff that they shouldn't if we ask for the name of the the token we assume it does something weird and tries to scan the protocol right every little thing we have to assume can go wrong and we assume this hostile environment from the outset and so that means that Euler was built as a protocol with a whole new defense mechanisms in place to handle malicious assets and I think in the long run that we'll put it in good stead in terms of being able to survive in the in this hostile environment the D5 often is um and then uh yeah in terms of what can be done with the assets once you have these Landing borrowing markets I think today the functionality for the long tail is somewhat limited on Euler um mostly you can borrow assets uh from the long tail and if you want to borrow us it's from the long tail what would you be using that for well mostly it's it's people hedging positions it's actually Traders essentially boring and then selling the underlying assets uh for short positions so we do see some activity on this in the ecosystem and that kind of mentality has been building through these bear markets really um one particular trade that was really uh interesting to people was shorting steak teeth for instance and hedging out that risk people already had exposure to steak teeth um may know about the you know the volatility in that particular Market recently we're using Euler to borrow and then sell steak teeth and kind of uh bet against State teeth falling against Thief um so that that was an interesting use case for for an asset that we haven't really seen on compounded are they um in the in you know that that's a limited use case though it's really just for Traders I think um it does generate some benefits for holders of these tokens if you're fundamentally long you're you're precious long tail asset you should be quite happy if you want to hold on to that asset for the long run you should be quite happy to Let somebody borrow and pay for the privilege of shorting it right you know and some interest to let some Speculator kind of bet against your project um I I I personally would be happy to do that for lots of tokens um but um in the long run people still want to be able to borrow against some of these assets and that's where these the the future of oil is you know provides some functionality there I think like they do on these wow refuse pools you can deposit the asset let's say it's a long tail asset or some kind of meme coin and then you can essentially say I'm going to use this as collateral to borrow usdc from somebody else and the the usdc depositor um you know we'll probably expect a higher interest rate right they're essentially taking on board more risk because you're you're using a riskier collateral to to service this loan but ultimately I think that's a you know a big use case as well in the long run it's allowing people to take these count these two types of Trades these long short trades against one another um yeah yeah there's a whole whole host of possibilities that that can get unlocked especially as uh that long tail gets built out if you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to

I think one of my favorite features on Euler is the the way we completely redid the way the liquidations work liquidations are one of them most important and fundamental features of a lending protocol and I think the system that was initially originally developed for compound Works relatively well at least worked quite well for the time but has has started to show cracks and so I know yeah I've totally redesigned it to have a new system so before you explain it can you kind of just explain what's the status quo of Liquidations in money markets for a compound and obvi like how does a position in our Vegas get liquidated yeah sure so you let's say you you deposit your class well you've got a thousand dollars and you borrow 500 of something now uh let's assume you're the asset you borrowed starts to increase in price so uh it might increase up to eight hundred dollars at that point the protocol starts to look at this position and go hold on if this keeps it keeps going the same way it is you're going to have more debt than you have collateral so at that point the the post call allows a liquidator which can be anybody to come in and repay the loan on your behalf and so what they will do is they'll take 800 of your collateral and they'll swap that for even the 800 of the asset you borrowed they'll repay the loan and leave you with the the difference now nobody's going to do that altruistically right we're I'm sure we're all nice people but no one's out here wanting to waste gas on paying other people's loans for them so usually the protocols need to offer some incentive for that purpose and what they do is they have a fixed discount usually five or ten percent of the collateral asset and they allow the Liquidator to to buy the asset at that discount so you can think of this as a bonus for the Liquidator on on uh you know 800 worth of collateral the Liquidator might get an 80 bonus and they get to keep that for themselves so uh and that's a 10 bonus right so this works really well it sounds quite nice right it's a really effective mechanism to make sure that the protocol stays solvent because loans get repaid when they start to look at Whiskey the big problem of course is that um if you take that loan that I just described and scale it up and now imagine that you've got somebody like Celsius or somebody borrowing you know depositing 100 million dollars worth of collateral and borrowing um 80 million dollars worth of Assets Now take 10 as a bonus for the Liquidator and it really starts to look painful mate the Celsius are going well the heck we're losing um you know millions of dollars in liquidation bonuses of course is completely unnecessary as well the light Liquidators don't need to be given you know millions of dollars worth of bonuses in order to have this incentive most people would be would happily perform a liquidation which ultimately costs you know a small amount of gas they'd probably be happy to do it for a thousand dollars for instance um and furthermore yeah when you get these big bonuses the Liquidators often don't even get to keep them you have this problem where um uh the essentially the most of the bonus ends up going to the minus through a process called a priority gas auction or through uh something called minor extractable value where the miners are able to kind of take most of the bonus away from the person doing the liquidation so that's the problem um and uh it's not good for the protocol uh because it means that more yeah more debt is repay than it's necessary or also more collateral has moved from the system than is necessary it's not good for the borrower because they end up losing more assets it's not good for the Liquidator because it goes to the miners so you've got a system that's really just there benefiting Miners and people using these Mev Bots um so what does Eula do differently we have a system whereby the the bonus that the the um Liquidator gets starts at zero and then Rises as the position changes in value so what this means is that the bonus that the percentage bonus that the Liquidator get usually depends on the size of the loan for really small loans the bonus the bonus might need to be you know 10 it might need to be that the Liquidator gets eighty dollars to cover their gas fees and make some profit but if you've got an 80 million dollar borrow um you still only need you know a few thousand dollars probably to pay to sell that loan and so the bonus will end up becoming a fraction the percentage bonus at least will end up becoming a fraction of the actual um loan taken out massively to the benefit of the borrower it also benefits the postcode because more collateral remains in the system so the protocols remains so more solvent um and the Liquidators still win um yeah we actually have a system which I won't go into as well because it's also also quite technical but which essentially kind of uh stops even even amongst the smaller bonuses actually even stops the the Mev Bots from trying to steal that smaller bonus from the from the Liquidator as well so it's we call it an Mev resistant liquidation process and this is a little bit like a Dutch auction of sorts right where the bonus starts small and then grows larger over time and as soon as that bonus becomes sufficient we wear a interested Liquidator is sufficiently interested then it gets liquidated and so it's like trying to optimize for the minimum amount of capital loss throughout the whole system where the borrower loses it pays the smallest amount of fee possible and uh there's a minimum amount sent to Mev Miners and like the the Liquidator uh just takes whatever deal that is the soonest deal the smallest deal that's that they are actually interested in in taking and so this allows for a depositor to feel more comfortable depositing more money into Euler because they know that like if I do get liquidated I'm going to be liquidated for the smallest amount possible allowing for like more Capital efficiency in the space so like it's it's kind of just like an elegant mechanism that you know that optimizes for the most efficient amount of liquidation possible um what's but what's preventing something like Ave or compound just integrating this as well like why can't they just follow this model too yeah I mean they they probably could do obviously one of the nice things about D5 is that the code can be kind of borrowed from other protocols um and so uh yeah if if it's if it does prove itself as being a resilient mechanism for liquidations I expect other protocols to do this um we have actually seen some some like uh the guys uh Angel um have also used this process in their their liquidation flow now they've kind of inspired by the older protocol designed this into their um euro-based stable coin so I think we will see more post calls adopting this type of approach to be honest I wouldn't be surprised to see future iterations of compound and are they have a new liquidation uh module that that at least borrows from these ideas um but certainly right now Euler is is more competitive on that front we've seen we've done some analysis on retrospective liquidations and you can see the liquidation bonuses um much much smaller one Euler in general uh for instance we had a million dollar die liquidation um opposition liquidated some time ago and the liquidation bonus paid was four thousand dollars which is a percentage of the the loan is really quite small um you know arguably if there was a more competitive environment for liquidation Bots this was quite early on in the in the protocols um so after its Birth really um yeah I think in the long run you'll see more competition and even that four thousand dollars might be might be brought down to an even lower lower amount so yeah it's um it's super cool right now and definitely definitely benefits moreovers yeah this the timing of Euler's release on mainnet kind of reminds me of maker Dow's release when maker maker Dao uh released on mainnet in December of 2017 at the top of the market uh and then you know minted people will go in and mention a bunch of bunch of die at like one thousand dollar each price and over the course of the year that one thousand dollar each price fell down to eighty dollars and like maker Dow was given like for for its Genesis event in ethereum just the biggest stress test ever because it launched at the top of the market and so it was just a test on like the liquidation efficiency of maker Dao turns out it survived with flying colors and and Euler is about the same like you guys launched uh uh when did you guys launch and like how has the whole like Market turbulence impacted Euler like how has Oiler uh operated during like all of these like turbine times of high volatility yeah it's um we launched in uh that we first deployed the protocol I think in uh early December uh and then uh we started with just uh to think two or three uh collateral assets and then progressively soft launched the rest of the protocol and there's still bits now that are you know still being launched um so it was a it was definitely an iterative process we wanted to do it feature by feature part by part so to kind of mitigate the risks because learning protocols do generate significant risks if not done you know done carefully but all through the process uh the protocols performed admirably and it's been as you've mentioned there's been I I would say probably um three major stress tests for the protocol since its conception um yeah which has been fantastic to see it perform you know whilst there's been drama going off elsewhere in the ecosystem uh yeah D5 protocols like oil have just been sort of taking away doing exactly what they should do um a Real Testament to the uh the way that D5 works that it can just withstand such hostile environments I don't think you'd see many Trad five sort of Institutions withstand the kind of pressures that most D5 protocols come under um and yeah Euler's performed sterlingly all the way through yeah that's definitely been the theme that we've been talking about at bank list is like all the C5 companies are breaking and all the D5 apps are doing just fine uh but usually when we say these things the defy apps people in their heads think like all right you want to swap still exchanging compound still online Ave is doing great uh but like it's also worth noting that Oiler is right there with them also didn't break and it's also brand new right and so like also has the minimum amount of Lindy and still didn't have any problems like you know granted inside of crypto like things break all the time there are rug pulls all the time but also it's worth noting that there are times when something can come to Market in like an extremely hostile Market environment and if you build it right like it works just fine that's pretty cool yeah I mean it's super yeah super exciting for me as well and there's a nerve-wracking here you know you don't you know it's not ideal circumstances to launch something new um so but yeah I mean it's even better for us though after the fact to come through that with flying colors I think is uh helps lend uh Credence to the kind of work and all the efforts that have been put into making sure that Euler is robust and secure against all these like nasty environments that it might potentially face um yeah it's a great validation of all that work that we've put in ultimately I always say that um things that survive these kind of periods you know when when everything's going up and everything's just fine you can get a lot of garbage kind of floating up as well because they just come in the no stress test whatsoever so you can have protocols that list anything as collateral that haven't like you know audited their smart contracts properly and so on um and it's only when when things turn actually that you really start to see who did their homework and who actually put in putting the efforts to make sure these things are to all environments not just you know favorable ones absolutely let's move on to another cool property of Oiler which is your guys's interest rate mechanism can you talk about the in the what the status quo for money markets is with interest rate mechanisms like compound and Ave how they charge interest based on like a particular algorithm and then how Euler is different yeah sure so I'll stop by clarifying and saying these are our interest rate mechanisms was out live today oh no that's one of the features we will progressively aiming to roll out um we can I can explain what that is but yeah I'll tell you about how interest rates are set generally in the market um on on lending protocols so usually if you take a poll that's got say a million dollars of Supply in it and um you have uh uh you have some borrowers come along uh the interest rates usually determined as how what percentage of the pool has been borrowed at any one time so if it's ten percent of the pool that's being borrowed you might get um a 10 interest rate if it's 50 being borrowed then that interest rate may go up to you know 40 or something and if it's 100 borrowed then uh the interest rate goes up yet further and it might go up to say 100 or 200 or something usually um it's an exact kind of relationship though between the percentage of the pool that's borrowed and the interest rate that you get out of the other rent that's like a one-to-one mapping there and what that means is that the The Who whoever was in charge of setting the interest rate model at the start of the process has to kind of get them the market dynamics right um they have to kind of map this um this this process onto the onto the market in a way that makes sense for that market um if you step set the interest rate uh to increase really steeply as a function of the percentage borrowed then you're kind of making the cost of borrowing more expensive um and that might inhibit the market from ever getting started like if we just have a really a really steep slope for how much the interest rate increases as a function of the borrowing then you might just never get any borrowers because everyone's just like holy this is too much so you set us a more shallow slope right you think oh well we'll just decrease the the rate and if you set a more shallow slope at the rate which interest increases then you can get too much borrowing you're basically underpriced the cost of borrowing for the market and then everyone comes in because it's super cheap to do it on on this protocol and then they they the pool gets home hundred percent uh utilize you know there's no more lending Supply left and that's a really bad knee that's really bad news for the lenders because a they're getting less interest than they really should be for the market rate and B uh you know if you own 10 of that pool if you're deposited you know a hundred thousand dollars and you want to go and withdraw it you can because that your assets are out there right now being Borrowed by somebody else so um yeah you need to get strikes on Middle Ground where you want um the pool to be somewhat borrowed from but not entirely borrowed from ideally you want something like you know maybe 60 70 80 of the pool to be borrowed from at any one time and that kind of maximizes the interest rate for lenders while still allowing most people to just withdraw so um yeah it's hard to set those functions it really is you need governance to be on top of the game and you need the markets to be kind of predictable and that's usually not the case in crypto things are very unpredictable as we know so what can you do differently this was the very first thing I started looking at when I um started working on Euler back in March 2020 I was looking at how compound worked and thinking how could you do this differently and I realized that there's a system you can use that works similar to the way that the thermostat works in your home it uses a branch of maths called control theory uh and the idea here is that the um you know if you think about thermostat in your home it's measuring the temperature outside all the time and then trying to increase or decrease the temperature inside your home to keep that the temperature inside the house fixed and with interest rates you want to do the same but you want to keep this percentage of the the pool that's being borrowed from roughly fixed you want to keep it around 70 and you can actually do that by adjusting the interest rates if the if the percentage of the pool that's being borrowed from goes above say 70 you want to increase interest rates uh to prohibit more borrowing and make it more attractive to lenders and so that brings on board more lenders it stops borrowing which then brings the interest rates back down so that the utilization stays at 70 and you can have the same post type of process happen below like if you end up having really low amounts of borrowing from the pools uh you can reduce the interest rates that prohibits more lenders coming on board and also stimulates more borrowers because it's now cheap to borrow from Oiler than you know cheaper online than it is elsewhere and that brings utilization back up to to the 70 Target so uh yeah this is this is a new type of mechanism that's similar things have have been trialled more recently as well but I think we were one of the innovators of this idea and it's something we'll be you know proposing to the Dow to roll out at some point this year um when the conditions arrive right users who are or excuse me listeners who are familiar with Rye the stable the stablecoin Rye uh this is also how Rye works as well like it uses it's a self-referential like input uh and so it uses its own data to kind of inform interest rates uh it's like a little bit of a self-referential loop to create this output and so this is it it correct me if I'm wrong but this is like one of the many strategies in Oiler to become like a more permissionless governance minimized lending market right by not having this like fixed rigid interest rate mechanism and instead having this like control theory based interest rate mechanism that's like something that we don't have to leave up to governance anymore because this thing just governed itself it's literally called a governor there's a there's like device that really allowed for um what's it called steam engines to work and it was a mechanism called a governor that when the steam engine would get too hot the governor would open up and let this exhaust out and then when it would cold when it would cool down the governor would close and keep the heat inside it was just like naturally like balancing mechanism that made the steam engine not explode and so like we see the same like self-referential like equations built into Rye the stable coin to price rye and now also you guys are using it using an Oiler to have like more stable interest rates or maybe more volatile interest rates but more stable asset utilization asset utilization being kind of like the important one from like a protocol Revenue standpoint because if you can keep that Revenue the asset utilization inside of a money market like Euler hi that means like the the system can charge fees on that more stably right that we can maintain that high utilization rate and have that be stable and not have that fluctuate all the time like the area under the curve of how many total what's like the total supply of assets to Euler will maintain uh a more efficient and higher level allowing the system to like charge more fees on it right it's just like when uniswap allows you to concentrate liquidity it generates more volume allowing unit swap to generate more fees and the same strategy here is that this this interest rate mechanism for Euler allows for more assets to be deposited and utilized so it can charge more fees to the users so it's just like an economically advantageous system would you agree with all this yeah more or less I think that's that's pretty much why I think you you can think of a pool that has zero utilization as being like liquidity on you to swap that's out of range it's just you know kind of unutilized capital and it's Capital inefficient to have that I you know really for Capital efficiency purposes you want you to station always to be in some kind of Goldilocks zone where the lenders are always earning an interest rate earning some interest you know earning yield on on their deposits um so you you really don't you really want to try to avoid low utilization or costs um so that the you know the protocol is kind of working effectively and ideally in the long run that this is how this will work it remains to be seen if this will work in practice by the way I'm really intrigued to see how this how this works when it goes live it does depend on a few factors um that should be mentioned so you really need people that Arbitrage interest rates uh for this to work most effectively so you need people that are really sensitive to these these changes in interest rates if they go up too much they kind of stop borrowing if they go down too much they start borrowing um so it's clear that we see that for some assets you know with the yield aggregators like you're in finance will Arbitrage interest rates quite effectively across protocols but um yeah will we see this for all assets for long term assets so it remains to be seen um so yeah we'll this will be something we'll be proposing to the Dow to kind of trial on an asset by assay basis and see how effective it is yeah Michael let's talk about the Dao aspect of Euler uh when did the DOW launch and can you just talk about the Dow details and the token details and all the details around these things yeah uh the Dow has now been live what are we talking a couple of weeks I was extremely ill when the Dow launched the last few weeks for me have been like a blur um but yeah the the Dow is now live people can make proposals and they can vote on the proposals of others uh there's a token uh that enables this functionality called oil I call it oil but it's actually the ticker is eul um so yeah um people uh the the users of the protocol receive oil or eul when they uh when they borrow from the protocol so if you're one of the kind of core protocols users um then you receive governance rights as a whilst you're using the protocol just as kind of passively uh and then yeah you can make proposals and vote on on how the protocol works in the long run on some of these contentious issues like uh so should something be used as collateral on various factors controlling like Risk in the protocol and on some of these bigger questions like should an ask set use um you know a reactive interest rate like the one I just described or one of the kind of old school interest rates that we see on compound and are they um yeah may may also be able to vote on things like the Oracle that an asset uses as well like uh there are some markets where it's clear that maybe an asset might be better service by a chain link comical than a unit swap one and so uh that's an integration that we think might be useful as well people can vote and say okay clearly chain Link's doing a great job for this asset so let's use let's kind of upgrade or switch out the unit swap Oracle for the chain link one in this particular case okay awesome Michael if people want to go learn more about Euler where should they go I would follow the choice of accounts of myself and uh sarahfim um so you can yeah you can find me at Euler underscore mab um I've forgotten forgotten seraphims but you can come to our website as well and check it out uh euler.finance is the one that we the main interface of the protocol and app.oiler.phylons here as well that users can begin lending and borrowing assets but uh we yeah all the documentation I would really recommend people to read the white paper that's a docs.oiler.fans well Michael of course thank you for coming on and and explaining Euler to me and the bank close
