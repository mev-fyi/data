hello everyone welcome to the bankless ama we have this special ama with kane warwick from synthetics kane how are you doing today sir uh yeah not too bad not too bad it's been an interesting week oh man it's been a crazy week this is one of the craziest weeks uh on record so um i'm just gonna go over a few of the the ground rules so kane this is an ama that means folks get to ask you anything you know feel free to pass on a question if you wish but you know we don't want the bankless nation judging you from for skipping the hard ones so hopefully you'll answer a few of our hard ones um now um as a reminder for bankless members you can ask questions in the bankless discord channel so that's open to members you can also ask on the zoom chat we are also streaming this live on youtube for everyone else uh and why don't we just get started um since i'm moderating i feel like i i get rights to maybe ask the the first question um kane what is the scariest question you could anticipate on an ama like this sir i don't know that's that's a really good question uh i think um probably the scariest question uh at the moment would be um you know what are we planning to do for uh scalability you know it's it's the most topical um and i think it's something that uh you know everyone's very eager to see solved um and we've got some plans but yeah you know it's uh it's definitely an issue at the moment well you know what that deserves a follow-up what is synthetics going to do about the issue of scalability you know gas fees of 300 grey are the new normal so how does um synthetics adapt to that yeah i when i say it's the scariest questions because i i know the answer um but if i provide the answer uh a certain person uh named jing will probably murder me so um we're we're working with the optimism team um we've been working with them very closely as you guys know we did a demo uh of their l2 solution you know a few months ago now um we're pushing very very hard to try and get uh you know some sort of pseudo main net live as quickly as possible given you know the current gas environment so i can't give a timeline um on pain of death but it's close we're we're working really hard all right excellent well i'm gonna fire off the first question this one is from bank list member uh oboshi i'm not sure if i pronounce that right but he he's asking or she's asking this question kane you seem suspiciously normal how can anyone expect to take you seriously when your nerd factor is so low i think i think the question is how are you so cool the space is full of nerds how are you so cool um i i don't know i think if you actually spend some time with me you might uh you might question uh that uh that assessment um i mean you know if you if you come into the synthetic discord we sit around playing chess most of the time and making dumb memes so um you know i think uh maybe it might just be the the surface uh appearance of coolness but uh it doesn't go too deep so what is your nerdiest habit then kane i probably uh probably sitting around playing speed chess or yield farming i would say these days all right well that leads to another question and this one is from the zoom yield on the topic of yield farming what are your thoughts on this week with yams rise all right well and then also it's demise so this is like a you know 48 hour life cycle what are your thoughts on everything yam this week so it was i think it was wednesday morning a friend of mine pinged me on telegram when i woke up it was about like seven or something like that and i was just going through messages um and he was like hey uh it was santiago from paraphrase he's like hey um you know what are you doing about uh yeah and i was like i don't know what you're talking about like this thing didn't exist when i went to sleep like like i'm doing nothing about it right and uh and i was like oh i guess i'll have a look at it so i like you know started looking at it read the blog post and i was like all right fine like all yolo in and like smash next in there started farming it uh and then you know uh the next day like it was the yeah apocalypse and you know i was trying to scramble around and like get the snx spartans to kind of help out and you know delegate to try and uh you know get that proposal over the line that obviously didn't work um so i think now you know the plan is uh from what i understand to try and work out a way of like you know launching a v2 uh have some kind of transition um but you know there's a number of proposals so it'll be interesting because you can't actually have governance now like governance has failed so it's going to need to be this like rough consensus which for me uh you know i'm probably uh preferential towards so it'll be interesting to see it play out now wait so does that mean you think uh yam 1.0 is not dead yet that there's still hope uh i mean the governance is eliminated i think i think yam the concept is not dead right like that you know the transition from yam 1.0 to 2.0 still requires the yam community to kind of like come together right so it'll be a question of how do you coordinate that when the on-chain governance component has you know exploded so this is actually a question that we're going to be putting out tomorrow in our friday open thread but it seems to me that the ethereum community is somewhat divided over yams so um there's a whole chunk of the community that's basically like in d5 community that's like um it was a complete um you know sham we shouldn't be promoting this sort of monetary experiment uh you know it was unaudited unsafe and there's another side of the community that's like hey we're all adults here and um you know this is a permissionless system and the creators of yam like uh can't be held accountable for the rapid success what side of that debate do you fall on was yams a net positive for ethereum and d5 or was it a net negative i think it was a positive right and maybe i'm a crazy person but you know my view is i like experimentation right now typically you know in in the synthetics community we talk about doing like small experiments right so you know we might do like a four week trial of like ten thousand dollars in incentives right um you know what's what i think we've seen play out uh with a lot of these um you know initial uh yield farming incentives is they start out with the intention of like okay we're gonna put you know even comp right you know i'm sure internally they were thinking you know it's gonna be a few hundred thousand dollars of incentives a week or something like that right and then i went from a few hundred thousand to tens of millions of dollars in incentives a week and everything blows up so i think you know it is really hard to kind of constrain that because there is so much irrational exuberance and excitement um but you know i still have a view that uh small-scale experiments and and you know on the grand scheme of things 750 000 was you know lost or locked uh you know it is a small uh a small amount you know collectively obviously it's not ideal um but you know you're right like everyone is an adult everyone you know makes their own decisions you know self-sovereign money is you know a double-edged sword right you know it's it's both uh you know positive in that anyone can do whatever they want and negative in that people can do dumb things if they want right they can do risky things so is it the case that um you are pro experimentation because it seems to be the case anyway that's sort of how synthetics found its product market fit anyway a series of small experiments and if somebody said hey those experiments are not allowed you shouldn't do those experiments um it seems to be the case that maybe synthetics would never have found its product market fit is that is that a right way of thinking about it yeah i mean you know it's not even if lots of people said it right lots of people yeah you're bad people you shouldn't do this like right this is a bad thing to do don't experiment like it's too crazy and high risk and everything and you know as much as we uh we're pushing uh fast and iterating you know rapidly uh we have some people um you know core contributors like justin for example who comes from uh you know a large-scale enterprise software background like mongodb um you know he's not a lunatic right like he's can't i mean he constrains me i'm probably the lunatic in the group right so you know he's constantly trying to ensure that um you know we've got as much structure around this stuff as possible but yeah if we if we weren't allowed to experiment there's no synthetics there's no question about that let's stay on the subject of yield farming for a moment so this question is from uh guintama from bagless discord so asking what your thoughts are on how yield farming is evolving so that's another kind of area that's has faced a little bit of of scrutiny uh right now i would say in some ways you know synthetics has been sort of the pioneers of yield farming right like the yams the the yam smart contracts were really a um a fork of the synthetics smart contracts but um yeah at what point could yield farming start to uh get get you know toxic or net negative for the entire space and and how do you see it evolving is it evolving in a good direction or what's like the next chapter of yield farming like the 2.0 well i think it's it's kind of multi-dimensional right like what we've seen is in in one uh dimension it's become you know more open and permissionless right like we're seeing you know these uh no pre mine no you know vc no uh team holding token uh kind of experiments right and i feel like uh the the community is much more forgiving of those sorts of things right you know if people write some software and they deploy it they don't get any you know privileged position within the system they've got to participate just like everyone else that feels sort of you know more fair right even if it's maybe less fair from a traditional startup standpoint that like the people who created things should get some stake in it um so i think that as we push in that dimension of you know more openness more uh sort of uh you know um uh permissionlessness in terms of you know who can participate it it opens up the ability to do more experimentation right because people are more forgiving of those experiments and i think that that's really exciting because when you take some of these things like you know even i was just reading uh about based this morning right another thing that like popped up last night and um you know it's i think what what it comes down to is uh you're distilling the incentives down to their essence right and that's how we really start to see like what what is effective and what is not effective um you know so i think that these experiments these uh you know crypto economic incentives experiments are really valuable um and you know we're seeing them play out and you know they're playing out in a safe-ish space i think you know the scales may be a little bit bigger than we would like but overall i'm really you know i think it's a net positive all right so on on the subject of experimentation um you know yfi and the urine protocol has been a major experiment in d5 lately so this is another question from bankless discord what are your thoughts on urine including how synthetics is being integrated with the project i'm actually not familiar in what way synthetics is being integrated in the project or if it is maybe you could comment on that yeah so you know it's an interesting uh kind of backstory to how this all came about right so um you know uh michael and i were discussing uh creating an susd pool right um and you know there was a little bit of uh tension there about how we should do it and you know what was required in terms of effort and stuff and the conversation kind of broke down right and andre you know this is how good of a guy he is right andre you know came to the rescue right and like pulled you know said you're both being idiots right like let's actually you know come to the table and discuss this like this is a good thing you know let's make it happen um and you know he talked to me he talked to michael he brought us together um and you know he got the susd pool started the incentivized that's whose depot started uh and so then i think um you know that kind of metaphor that was created the the the white pool um then you know took off and and you know grew uh huge and then obviously um you know andre kind of left uh for a while and then i think when he came back you know and he started this uh this new um uh you know the the wi-fi craze right um you know he took that same pool but he didn't actually use the susd pool because the the gas costs were too high and there was some other uh friction around it so um it's kind of it's a really interesting story about how it's kind of evolved but my view is that again you know i think it's a really interesting experiment and this idea of uh kind of you know uh i guess industrialized yield farming right of like you know really optimizing uh yield farming and ensuring that you're getting the highest yield possible is a really cool direction that we're seeing people experiment in and you know andre is the king of that by far yeah absolutely he is the king of experimentation and um uh yeah quite an interesting fellow so so check out our podcast that came out this week uh on andre it was one of the most fascinating podcast episodes i've dave and i have done on the subject of criticism though because andre has been i guess no stranger to criticism and it does seem to be the case that a lot of d5 protocols even you know ethereum itself have been criticized at the very early stage of the project um as like this experimentation is is dangerous or this will never work and that sort of thing what are your thoughts about some of the criticisms of synthetic so this is a question from dor dorica the criticism on synthetics being a bucket shop or the possibility of a cascading liquidation effect coming from traditional markets similar to make your doubt in march 2020. i guess everyone remembers the black thursday event in march and the question of um is synthetics prepared for that or are there some some risks in in the platform that aren't immediately clear if there's some sort of a black swan type event another you know black thursday march event yeah i mean you know it's it's a it's a very high risk um you know i say this all the time like synthetics is still highly experimental right um you know and it's kind of fallen into the same camp of these uh experiments that have grown very large right um you know and so when you have uh the snx market cap you know edging up towards a billion dollars that's a little bit scary there's a lot of value uh you know locked in there and one of the things that we have as a kind of offset to that i suppose is this very high buffer right the collateralization ratio buffer right so um you know it was at 850 uh you know a few months ago um yesterday interestingly there was a proposal um that passed to reduce it to 700 which i was against um but no one listens to me anymore uh in discord so you know that's just the way it goes right um so am i i still think that we should keep it uh you know as high as possible for now we need that buffer um even with liquidations uh but you know people uh you know are pushing for a lower collateralization ratio so that's one way that we kind of offset that the second way is obviously having liquidations uh but you know liquidations are dangerous because you can't have this cascading uh you know failure thankfully we've never got to a point where uh you know the the system was even close to the liquidation threshold um you know so i think that buffer is doing its job um in fact we have like weekly claims which force people to fix their ratios um but you know as we saw with yams interestingly right like so the price of snx was sitting around five dollars you know 48 hours ago whatever yams switches on a bunch of people start buying snx to farm yams because it was one of the highest uh apys right um price goes from five dollars to six dollars yams collapses the price goes from six dollars back down to five dollars again you can literally see like the truck so it's still reflexive right like it's still highly highly reflexive i've seen people call that the yamplification effect as it was going on there's so many good puns with the yam mean i i just i love it um okay so but but on that subject is there a point at which uh synthetics you you would call synthetic safe or like like reasonably safe for more retail investors you don't feel like you have to like put caution tape around the entire project and say look you know you could lose everything if you put it in here yeah i mean i don't i don't know how long it's going to take for any defy protocol to you know because we've got platform risk right like there's platform risk on top of platform risk so you've got ethereum platform risk you've got scalability you know issues you've got all of this you know inherent platformers just in being on ethereum and then you've got the actual smart contract suite itself um you know which is complex and you know yes more time helps right you know in two years time but when you're upgrading that smart contract sweet every time you upgrade it you lose a little bit of that right now some of the contracts stay the same some change but the interaction of those contracts um you know is where the complexity lies so until we get to a point where we stop upgrading the contracts or you know we we kind of lock down the core of the system uh i think there's still going to be a lot of risk there got it all right so let's talk about uh stable coins for a minute so you you guys have s usd of course which is a pretty unique stable coin that's going out there but a question came in about um i guess the other side less of a crypto native stable coin and more about central bank digital coins what's your take on central bank digital coins in general so it seems like the um you know central bank of china people's bank of china is moving really fast in creating a uh you know chinese central bank digital currency it's likely that western nations won't be too far behind what's your take in general on central bank digital coins my history of stablecoin predictions is littered with abject failure uh to predict all kinds of things so i would not listen to my prediction uh in any way like you know i was saying nothing like usdc can exist like a regulated stable coin for years right like all through like 2016 2017 i was like just can't happen why did you think that by the way i i just i you know i maybe i thought that regulators would be more skeptical of you know having something having an asset like that um you know we knew that there were issues with tether it was operating in kind of this gray regulatory environment i just thought you know if you turn up to a regulator and say hey we want to do that thing right but we want to do it you know under kind of some regulatory regime that they would laugh you out of the room you know it's it's it's amazingly impressive that um you know the sort of uh center consortium was able to get that over the line i still find it really impressive same thing with paxos true usd all the regulated stable coins i think the fact that they even exist is is pretty impressive um you know obviously a central bank stable coin has a lot of advantages in that you know it is made by the regular you know the same regime right the regulatory regime that uh you know is kind of dominating that that particular country so i think that they're more likely to happen um what the impacts of them are i don't know i mean my hope is that like the other stable coins that we've seen that you know it makes access to legacy finance easier and it creates like a you know a better bridge um but that remains to be seen do you think it's good for crypto it depends on what they're built on you know i think if they're built on like their own permissioned uh chain that's like a fork of something then like maybe tangentially um but i think if if central banks start actually issuing stable coins on ethereum uh you know that there's no question that's a net positive right that's a a big uh indicator that you know uh large entities like you know nation states believe that ethereum as like the global settlement layer is a thing um so i don't know how likely that is and i don't even want to predict it because i'll probably it up but uh yeah that's uh that's that's my sense all right so this is a question uh from crypto muniac so um crypto muniac wants to know what the vision for synthetics is for the next few years so the entire d5 space is rapidly involved evolving what's what's the place of synthetics in that space what are the aspirations of the synthetics protocol yeah so i mean this is going to be a bit of an alpha leak i guess but you know that's kind of the point of these things right um so i think you know back to your earlier question of like when do we get to a point where synthetics is not so high risk that you know a normal kind of user could feel comfortable coming in and participating uh in the ecosystem i think there's a number of things uh post synthetic futures um which is which are launching um that will help to reduce risk so one of the things that we're uh we're kind of doing some research on in the background is the idea of siloing uh the different deadpools into asset classes right so at the moment you've got this undifferentiated pool where you've got you know potentially equities crypto commodities etc um you know when we talk to large-scale market makers they think that's crazy and it is crazy right like there's no question having this undifferentiated pool um is is pretty wild um but you know it makes sense kind of for bootstrapping in the early phases so one of the things we're experimenting with is this idea of separating out these pools um the other is uh you know when when we have some kind of open interest cap on positions uh in the system to switch over to some kind of hybrid model and we're also experimenting with that with options right where you've got the bidding period where you know it's against the pool and then the the tokens are issued and then you have to go out to some other secondary uh you know exchange an amm or something like that to trade the options um so sound experiment with a number of things like that that i think you know it's going to take probably you know 12 to 18 months to see that kind of play out and get to that level of scale but at the moment still very focused on you know this core undifferentiated deadpool so we did a tactic recently on your new binary options that synthetics released how's that going it's going it's going well i think the thing that's missing right now is like the vertically integrated uh ui right so you know one thing that synthetics has kind of not touched is this idea of bilateral training right this idea of creating a venue for people to trade directly against each other um you know we've we've stuck with this amn model and so what it means is that okay people can participate in the bidding period but once it gets to trading there's actually no place for them to trade so what we're hoping to do through our um our grand style is fun so if you're listening to this and you're looking for something cool to do uh building like a fully vertically integrated uh binary options trading platform which you know hooks into the synthetics protocol during the bidding period and then switches to either you know an amm like uni swap or balancer or something like that or even uses like some kind of order book style mechanism uh we think that that's gonna be really powerful and until we have that fully vertically integrated solution i think you know it's high friction so all right sell them what's the incentive for them to build something like that kane yeah so i mean firstly funding obviously you know the grand style will help to fund it um the second thing is that we've got a program that's going to launch uh i think in the next two or three weeks i'm not 100 across all the low-level details but it will essentially provide rebates for volume that's put through the synthetics protocol so if you are an integrator or you have a dap or you have a mobile wallet or something um you can essentially apply to join this program and get paid a rebate so if you are building this options platform you can essentially get paid rebates for the volume that you put through the protocol gotcha very cool all right let's talk about um eth2 for a minute so uh do you think e2 will have a big impact on the synthetics trading volume that's a that's a question that actually came in from youtube i think it's too far away to tell i mean there's a lot of uncertainty around exactly how we will implement what the transition looks like um you know our focus is at least i would say for the next two years on you know each one x right i think that's where the vast majority of volume will happen and in order for that to be viable for the next two years we need l2 scaling so we need to be you know on on optimism uh on the obm so we're we're still getting a lot of questions from fez from others on layer two i just think it's top of mind because like we're still dealing with these high gas prices and people are like well it's not even it's not even worth withdrawing my yams if it costs more than you know what i put in um let's talk about that in the context of eth2 first and then maybe we'll pivot to to layer two and d5 so in the context of eth2 kind of my impression of the eth2 roadmap is is basically like you said like you know phase zero is not going to help with scalability at all neither is phase 1 really quite frankly maybe but phase 1.5 before we get to 2x we have sort of this this data layer that could potentially host roll-ups like optimism um is that going to start to be helpful is that where i guess some of the the eth2 scalability promises start to kick in do you think i think so but there's a there's a big but there right which is like you know the composability issue and that's still the issue that we have with all of the l2 solutions out there right um and so you know we need some sort of coordination mechanism for the existing d5 protocols to ensure that you know we don't lose composability because if you lose that you know these experiments are going to be going to become much harder right a lot of the stuff that's happening at the moment becomes much harder so let's talk about that because um you guys are are implementing your solution in sort of an ovm right kind of a roll up um what are the rest of the d5 projects doing are you coordinating with them at all i we were talking to joey krug um on the podcast recently and sort of you know used the analogy of the main chain is is a little bit like manhattan right it's getting really expensive to live there and not everyone needs to be there but a lot of people want to be there because wall street's there because you know it's got all of the perks of of being in manhattan right you've got great restaurants all of these things um so there's almost a um like a game theoretical aspect where it's just like okay maker you guys move first and then maybe we'll move you know uh so no one wants to move from the main chain how how are the d5 projects coordinating about layer two now if at all and how do you think we solve that problem of coordination to to figure out what the compose most composable layer two solution is and and sort of settle on uh you know a set of those solutions i mean you know personally i'm a big fan of brooklyn uh that's where i spend my time when i'm when i'm in new york right so um you know i think the plan is we're going to set up a you know a nice uh area in brooklyn where everyone can uh come and hang out and you know you can come willingly or you can come by force right so um you know i think that the the coordination is going to be uh getting at least a few of the projects to you know migrate across um and you know do it in a way that ideally doesn't break composability so for us what that means is minting you know the the actual issuance of debt can happen on l2 without impacting uh composability too much right it's the trading and the you know transfer since uh that needs to happen you know on l1 for now and so i think what we'll see is a phase transition to allow minting to happen you know at low gas costs right and then you'll be able to transfer those assets back to l1 and use them and then slowly edge our way out of l1 onto you know fully l2 with the the exchange and everything i think what you're saying is basically um you're okay with moving some things to brooklyn you want to invite some you know other friends to move to brooklyn too and then you're gonna make brooklyn so awesome that everyone else wants to move to brooklyn too that's the idea yeah invites a strong word though strongly suggests that they join us over there got it got it let's talk about and guys everyone who's watching this we are about 30 minutes in so that means 30 minutes left for your questions keep them coming by the bankless discord and also zoom if you're there as well let's talk a little bit more about stablecoin so this is a question from joseph i t um let's talk about susd uh when it's over a dollar how is that dealt with maker has had a lot of trouble recently maintaining its peg at a dollar um how about susd do you guys have some secret sauce for that i think there's there's kind of two levers that we can pull um you know the the strongest levers within the synthetics ecosystem um the first one is the collateralization ratio so one of the you know reasons why that uh lowering the c ratio passed was to ensure that there's more supply out there the reason why i was against it is because i think it's less about uh the the c ratio there's enough synths out there to get into the curve pool get into some of these amms and you know uh reduce the the premium um which isn't too you know i think it's uh it's less than a cent but it's been hovering you know around that mark for a while now which is not ideal um so lowering the c ratio is one way of doing it because you increase the supply um the the issue that i sort of see though is more of an educational one right there's no interface that clearly communicates to you why this is a good idea what the benefits are et cetera and so we're we're in the process of doing a bit of a brand refresh and alongside that we're going to uh migrate minter from you know the mint interface to staking.synthetics and that's staking interface is much more educational it's much clearer about you know what your role is what the trade-offs are risks etc and one of those things is going to be to try and get more supply out into the market and i think that will help to reduce the premium and get it back to the peg overall how does a susd compete against some of the other stable coin options that we were talking about like on the one you know side of things a central bank issued uh fiat coin or even a you know uh uh a um c usd or excuse me a like a usdc or a tether or something like that i think you know there's there's two broad trade-offs right you've got the the very hard pegged redeemable assets like uscc usd ish um you know uh true usd et cetera and then you've got die and susd and you know there's some new uh you know types of uh non-redeemable stable points right like crypto asset backstable coins coming out um and those just have a fuzzier peg right there's more risk around the peg um you know it's harder to kind of keep them really tightly pegged because they're not redeemable for the underlying assets so there isn't like a really tight arbitrage loop to bring them back to the peg um but they have other cool properties right so you know uh with dye um obviously it's permissionless in a way that usdc and uct aren't right um with susd it's also permissionless but you have this cool property of being able to convert it uh via synthetics exchange or via the protocol uh to you know synthetic bitcoin if you want right if you want price exposure bitcoin so i think that there are advantages to the permissionless ones that you know trade-offs right like the peg is a little less tight on the permissionless side uh you know the crypto asset backside uh but they have some interesting cool properties that um you know if you're building defy are worth looking at right and i think for most people you know they they kind of get those trade-offs so here's a question that came in via zoom um what were some of the lessons you learned from the 2017 ico boom and haven's rays maybe that's the context of thinking about like you know 2020 is starting to maybe look a little bit like 2016. um so what things did you learn in 2017 and what advice would you give for 20 to 2020 so um you know prior to haven i was uh running like a fiat uh payment gateway right and we worked with a lot of the exchanges in in australia and so we were facilitating you know even back as far as like 2016 millions of dollars with the bitcoin purchases right uh and then i think it was either late 2016 or early 2017 we enabled uh each direct purchases for the first time right um and you know we saw a lot of demand and i got really excited about eve you know i've been i've been kind of following since uh the dow you know because this idea of like decentralized capital formation to me was really interesting coming from a place in australia where we don't have a bc ecosystem there's a lot of brain drain so you don't have good founders that have been successful that are kind of like giving back to the community there's a lot of australian founders that are very successful but they live in san francisco right they don't live in sydney um and so you know so it's a it's an issue that we've been dealing with for a long time so this idea of being able to like bring capital formation the dow was like the most exciting thing that i had seen in a long time right i was i was super excited about it and when you know 2017 came uh you know i was participating in icos i was doing all that sort of stuff and you know holding eve uh and i think for me uh you know it just it really it was probably like late 2016 um i started thinking about you know how how can we solve some of the problems that we have and you know in the other business that i was running one of the problems we had was this like crypto premium um that had kind of crept up like the the kimchi premium that we saw in uh um in korea and so we were like there should be an easier way to move money around right and so this idea of stable coins i really went down the stablecoin rabbit hole and that's what got me in in terms of like lessons learned i guess you know uh certainly for us in 2018 probably is where we learned the most lessons right like that was where it was the most painful 2017 i think in a bull market you just need to you know kind of uh strap in and be along for the ride it's in the bear market where you need to kind of batten down the hatches and and really focus and keep building that's that's where most of the the hard lessons will learn so what do you think are we in a bull market are we heading towards a bull market i mean you know 8th this morning like hovering around 4 20 you know it's uh i think we're getting close to it um you know we had that that kind of false rally back in you know july of 2019 where uh things started to kind of heat up a little bit and then and then fell back um my sense is that we're getting close to that um but i think the big difference between 2017 and now and i said this a lot of the time none of the things in 2017 did anything like it would you know and even the things that were okay that's that's probably not fair but like it's pretty fair i think very few like very few right very few of the things uh you know uh were real right actually did anything uh it wasn't until you know we saw the launch of like die um you know we saw the launch of uh of a number of things in like late 2017 early 2018 where like real stuff started to you know arise that you could actually do stuff with um and you know even a lot of the tokens like okay there were tokens but there were this like you know payment uh chip that you could like use for some ecosystem that didn't exist right like it was not real right yeah and i think now what we're seeing is that and you can see it by gas prices right like you know uh we're seeing that a lot of stuff is happening there's a lot of activities a lot of demand for access to uh l1 uh and that's just a very different you know so i think uh to kind of you know to close it out like yes it feels very frothy in the way that 2017 did but it also feels more real than 2017 did by an order of magnitude i'm gonna have to agree with you on that that's exactly what uh what i think i see here's a question that um ama dio is asking in the bankless discord and he's linking an article here she's linking an article here washington post i can't open it but i think it's a story about the us seizing millions in cryptocurrency meant for terrorist groups um and the comment is they want to get minors to give assets over i've not looked at this article i don't know the news so maybe this is sort of a general question on you know what crypto calls kind of the you know the final boss back to your fear every what you were talking about earlier that um you know governments would never let stable coins get away with issuing you know stable coins that um usdc shouldn't exist or you didn't think it would ever exist um how do you think crypto can survive the final boss and do you think the final boss being the nation state will eventually crack down and turn its head our way are we just too small that you know they just haven't done it yet i mean i think it's possible right and and you know there there's certainly some component of like a race against time right like the sec is not the us government they are different beasts like completely right um you know so the sec might say well ethereum has sufficiently decentralized that like we're not going to bother it that doesn't mean that the us government or you know uh or china or the eu or you know someone doesn't you know decide that actually it is worth uh you know trying to crack down and set an example uh you know something like this but i do think that we are getting to a point where these systems are open and permissionless and shutting them down you know there were these kind of quaint theories in like 2015 2016 if like people can go after minors and like going with hammers and smash all the mining gear and stuff and like yeah okay fine but like it gets to a point where you know and this is where you eat 2.0 steak where you don't need giant mining rigs and proof of work where it becomes really really hot like unless we're talking like door-to-door sweeps of like anti-crypt like it turns into like a kind of crazy like apocalyptic uh you know scenario to really shut it down maybe we get there i don't know like crazier things have happened in the world right but um but my sense is that the cat's out of the bag it's hard to to kind of unwind this now this is back to kind of the point you know the the shirt and the movements is bankless but i actually uh don't mind the fact that banks are starting to to join the jp morgans of the world for instance they just made an investment in in consensus they're building out their you know jp morgan coin um coinbase itself you know maybe going public they'll have sort of wall street buyers uh it does seem like maybe that provides a layer of protection on the industry because crypto becomes more and more useful to the world outside of the you know self-sovereign individual crowd that that maybe we come from a little bit more do you think that's a a protection for us getting some of the banks involved and building on top of an open critical like ethereum 100 you know so banks have this interesting property where there are these regulated entities that have databases that are money right like they're they've got these you know little walled gardens where like whatever they say happens in there like that's money right um and then you know they have to talk to each other the way they talk to each other is like nonsensical right like it might as well be carrier pigeon right and so you know the question is like how do you wire these things up how do you have like an open and permissionless settlement layer and the hardest thing when you're dealing with legacy infrastructure legacy you know entities and organizations is that they can't agree on anything they can't even agree internally on what they want to do let alone externally right so you try and get these consortiums together and takes years and like millions of dollars billions of dollars and it goes nowhere and then the whole thing collapses i think if you forcibly move them on to this you know global open permissionless uh settlement layer that none of them control and and it's wired up to these you know old school databases i think you get a really really powerful uh kind of next phase in the evolution of crypto um and i think it's kind of necessary you know so if you want to live in the ether and never touch legacy financial ecosystem great right but there are people that don't want to do that or can't do that for whatever reason and having ethereum wired up to every single bank and being the settlement layer for all of those banks is i think inevitable and going to just you know usher in like even more uh you know interesting stuff there's a there's a funny story though about this uh so brian armstrong tweeted i think two or three weeks ago about how bank frick uh in in lichenstein which is a you know a regulated bank had started accepting usdc as a settlement option and i was super excited about this i was like holy  this is exactly what we were waiting it's happening right turns out not so much right so i actually i actually took the time i went and i got in touch with uh with the bank um and i got in touch with someone there and it took it was painful right um but i was able to get through it and actually what happened is they basically you know they support uh they've got a brokerage partner right it's not even the bank themselves they've got a partnership with a broker that you can send bitcoin an e and they will convert it for two percent fee right uh and they'll settle it into the bank in you know euros or usd right so it's not that exciting and all they did was add usdc as like an accepted cryptocurrency so it's not even close to what we were hoping for so like i was really excited i thought we'd like kind of bridge that gap but we're not there yet so there's still a bit of work to be done yeah you gotta sometimes you gotta dig behind the headlines and see what's really happening what's really going on but um it is interesting because i'm not sure all the banks will survive this transformation right so d5 it seems to me is disruptive to banks the way that the communication protocol of the internet was disruptive to media companies like newspapers and such and some of them adapted some of them are still around many of them are not many of them just couldn't um cross the chasm and bridge the gap and so i think many banks are just stuck with their existing models and it'll be very hard for them to see kind of this new paradigm i have a question that came in bankless discord from qaz this is a bit more specific to synthetics when can we expect limit stop-loss stop limits and other advanced order types on the synthetic exchange um so this is a story of decentralization i suppose right so we uh we put out a grand style rfp to a bunch of groups to build a limit order functionality because we just didn't have the capacity uh to work on it as a part of our core roadmap um and so a team stepped up uh and they built it but unfortunately you know the complexity of the the synthetic contracts is such that uh you know when we went to actually deploy it which was a couple weeks ago the contracts themselves worked but the actual uh infrastructure for uh for you know acting as a re-layer uh just wasn't capable of handling the through handling the throughput um that we needed and so uh we've had to put another some additional resources to kind of build that out um so you know it's one of the challenges of having these decentralized contributors uh that maybe don't have as much awareness of the core protocol um you know it does slow things down but uh i would say limitors are probably two or three weeks away and we're hoping to get them out by the end of the month um so the contracts are done the relay stuff is is still to be uh to be built sometimes uh kane in crypto in d5 we talk about one billion users right like we want to onboard that one billion users here's a question from joseph turner what do you think the weak link or the bottleneck is to getting those one billion new users into d5 into crypto so you know again coming from a fbi gateway background right uh and you know having having built a business that did that the on-ramps and off-ramps are still very poor in in a lot of places um you know we need uh either really powerful decentralized infrastructure to solve this problem or we need better integration with legacy finance or both um in order to be able to onboard you know someone uh who's in southeast asia or you know uh in south america or you know somewhere that maybe they don't have access to like a brokerage account for equities or something like that that wants to have price exposure to uh you know equities synthetics can solve that problem but you have to get them into the system first right so you know i think that having those those really uh you know frictionless and low cost critically you know it has to be low cost as well on ramps and off ramps uh is is a critical component that's not quite there yet what are you seeing is there any progress on that front you know i've seen things from ramp for example um also from from wire are those kind of the the types of solutions that we should be looking at for those fiat on-ramps for that bridge i think so but you know people forget uh you know in australia for example we've got i think the highest adoption of like tap uh but you know nfc based payments right in the world uh and like literally i don't even carry a wallet anymore i never have cash so we you know we forget that a lot of the world operates on cash like go to berlin right and everything's cash like you know you ask someone to pay with a credit card and they're like going out the back to find the credit card machine right so still you know like and that there's a lot of places in the world that are still heavily heavily cash based uh and so i think you still need cash you know actual fiat cash uh on-ramps um you know particularly in uh in emerging markets it's it's critical um so you know wire is amazing and that's great for like the us but you know there's a million different ways you can get money into crypto in in america um you know we need it for uh for you know other other markets for sure just an observation it seems to be the case though once uh money moves into crypto it tends to remain sticky in crypto so i i found myself even when you know uh crashes come or or i want to decrease my exposure to crypto native types of assets um i don't move to us dollars at a traditional bank account anymore uh traditional bank accounts kind of suck to be honest um i moved to something like you know a stable coin um it does seem to be the case that once the money does cross the chasm and bridge to the other side it tends to stay there is are you seeing that too i agree but you know again it depends on what money we're talking about right like if you're talking about you know your investable assets that you don't need for day-to-day living then sure right but you know it's not necessarily that easy um you know uh to to turn up and buy lunch with uh usdc right right um of course there's some places where you can and so again i i think you know we need uh we need ways to kind of close the loop right and and allow people to spend crypto you know there was a lot of a lot of effort and time and money invested by bitcoin maxis back in the day to try and get people to spend bitcoin which you know was a bit of a a foregone conclusion right that was not gonna work out it's just too volatile and i think we we know that now we understand that um and so you know we need that next i think a lot of people looked at that and said oh well people don't really want to spend crypto right it's all about spending crypto it's you know people want better payment mechanisms they want better payment rails right they want cheaper payment rails uh less friction etc and so i think that we can do that um and you know particularly with with l2 solutions um you know spending die uh you know is is something that i think is uh is needs to be much easier you need to be able to spend die and susd and other stable coins anywhere in the world hold your eats spend your die spend your susd but hold your eat there you go that's the mantra all right let's do some rapid fire questions because can i hop in here with a question do yeah yeah yeah so for those watching on youtube you won't be able to see my face but everyone in the webinar can uh so kane we've been talking a little bit about on-ramps and we've also been talking about fractured l2s right and so l2s are going to be not really all that interoperable there's going to be some friction there and so that's going to kind of fracture liquidity and we're also you just mentioned how we also need on-ramps and there's also plans for synthetics to migrate to l2s into the future to encourage trading volume and it sounds like that we can also talk about on-ramps directly into synthetics into their whatever l2 platform that synthetics is on so is there a potential future where there's an on-ramp that goes straight from you know the fiat world right into the synthetics platform bypassing either bypassing die bypassing uscc and just going straight from bank to susdc uh potentially um potentially but i think we're still a ways away from that right like i still have a sense that um you know most on-ramps are going to go via eth you know and and there will be versions of each on these l2 uh you know shards as well these l2 chains so um so i think that you know uh some kind of tokenized uh that's you know low cost to get access to is still pretty likely um but you know it could be die could be as usd it could be even you know usdc or one of the other stable coins um i mean one of the interesting things about synthetics is that we've got uh you know other uh denominations of uh of stable coins as well right and you can convert between them pretty frictionlessly so you know if you uh you know want to get in with euro or you know or something like that then uh you know you've got access to that so i think that that is something that again you know we need the infrastructure side as well um l2 helps um but it's the actual like on the ground infrastructure that's missing uh right now all right we've got a few rapid fire questions from the bankless nation i want to try to fit these in in the last seven minutes here uh here's one what do you think the week wait actually we asked that we asked that one already if you could snap your fingers and fix a problem in the crypto space which problem would you solve kane uh scalability okay how about the current incentive programs in synthetics um do they meet your expectations do you you plan to keep them are you going to tweak them moving forward is the community going to tweak them moving forward when this current phase ends so the next big incentive uh mechanisms coming out is around this you know rebate uh for integrations as well as direct trading volume uh so that's something that we're we're pretty excited about and i think it's gonna have a big impact how about gas fees do smaller stakers of synthetics are they them being priced out of staking claiming rewards has that had a material in fact impact to your the synthetic ecosystem so far it has a material impact to my sleep at night you know it doesn't it doesn't sit well with me um so you know i i wouldn't be surprised if you're a small staker and you're obviously civil attacks notwithstanding right if you're a small staker and have been a small staker i wouldn't be surprised once we get you on to an l2 solution that lowers your cost if you would not uh expect some kind of uh incentive or your compensation or something like that from the synthetic style uh for your troubles over the last three months who is your historical historical founder that you identify most is it a musk is it an edison is it a tesla yeah that's a really good question um i i'm a big fan of ben horowitz i i love i'm actually reading uh you know what you do is who you are right now um i'm i'm a really big fan i think just his approach to uh you know to running startups is is uh not necessarily unique but like it's it's very much his own style and it's something that you know uh the hard thing about hard things when i first read it really resonated with me i you know i enjoy doing hard things myself so that was a fantastic book i that's one of my favorites as well is argent your favorite mobile wallet uh my favorite mobile wallet um it's it's up there um i you know i like i live on desktop and i live with my trays or like i don't use my wallets that much um there's a bunch of them that i like but argent is definitely uh definitely really cool although i saw that they're not paying for gas anymore for obvious reasons so uh you know that's not ideal but it's just the world we live in maybe we should get them to move to brooklyn with you kane working on it all right this is a fun one price predictions uh give us your bull run price predictions for first bitcoin then ether then snx uh so bitcoin i think if if this is genuinely the bull run that you know we've been waiting for uh 50k plus is is definitely possible um for eth i i don't have an upper limit i don't want to look like an idiot in uh 12 months time uh i think that you know is highly reflexive and you know if we get some of the things that we're hoping to around l2 etc um you know 1400 is going to look uh laughably uh cheap in the future how about snx you want to do that one uh i mean six dollars was the was the meme right that we all like kind of laughed about back two years ago so you know i'm happy with six dollars i think we we touched six dollars yesterday i'm i'm pretty happy with that for now price prediction for susd still a dollar i hope if it's not a dollar we got bigger problems so uh yeah like a dollar plus or minus all right um do you see tokens this is a question from sid powell do you see tokens in the future more taking the form of like an equity revenue sharing in the platform or more usage utility like paying fees in mkr the comment is synthetics appears to be a hybrid between the two i guess the question is how do you see d5 tokens in the future um accruing value i mean i think you know there was a long time where there was no value being generated right like there you know there were these uh these proposed ecosystems that didn't do anything right and i think we now have a bunch of different uh systems that actually generate um you know value right like they provide a service and people are willing to pay for that service and so the question of how you accrue that whether it's a burn model whether it's you know direct payment for you know whether it's through some kind of inflationary incentive etc uh i think you know i'm just happy that tokens are not this you know black mark uh and and you know this this kind of unmentionable thing anymore right there was a period where like having a token was like the worst possible thing you could do so the fact that we're back to like understanding tokens or a coordination mechanism that you know is really powerful that's more than enough for me i'm i'm happy with that for now all right guys we have two more minutes for questions we might be able to fit in one or two this is this is one for me what is your favorite d5 collateral for synthetics besides snx i mean eth obviously but you know aside from eth uh i would say uh probably right now ran btc uh is the the thing that i'm most excited about um you know i think that that will be a thing that will happen i mean we like market forces to determine things so any permissionless uh new btc uh implementation so you know obviously tbtc being the other option uh we will definitely consider and maybe both of them will be included um but you know we need to get btc collateral i think to pull the maxis into ecland kane is eath money of course absolutely i think i think i gave it to someone but i had eat this money.eat for uh for a while as a an enos domain and then i gave it someone on twitter to you maybe even uh i can't remember who was scott or i don't know maybe you guys like i would have liked to stash that one up actually yeah i gave it to someone i gave it to someone so my money's on here they ever need it yeah probably yeah eric that makes sense yeah he tries to front run everybody on those things yeah yeah um all right we've got one minute left for so it's time for our final question and uh kane thank you so much for spending some time with the bankless nation bankwood station thank you so much for your questions this has been an absolute blast we will post the recording i think the recording actually will be auto posted on youtube thanks for all of the participation yeah immediately david says so the last question is kane how can the bankless nation help synthetics um i think what we need uh is you know more people participating in governance right so we have this rough consensus process um but you know there's a lot of things that are still open questions and and experiments that are running and so we need more people scrutinizing you know the things that we're doing and participating in that governance process to ensure that we've got you know really strong checks and balances on the direction that the project's moving fantastic uh we're getting great feedback people are saying great ama thanks to all kane we want to thank you again for spending some time with us have a great day thank you guys this is really fun take care
