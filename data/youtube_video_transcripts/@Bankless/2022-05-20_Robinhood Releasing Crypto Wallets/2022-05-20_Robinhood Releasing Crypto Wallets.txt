i think this release will probably surprise a lot of people if it surprised you guys i'm sure that not a lot of people thought that robin hood would go and embrace self-custody the way we have today but i think it makes a lot of sense i think the future of web 3 relies on this and we can really build something awesome that allows people to keep custody and and be their own bank i think that's a very very powerful vision and especially with what's happening around the world you see it's never been as important to have that security and privacy as it is right now
