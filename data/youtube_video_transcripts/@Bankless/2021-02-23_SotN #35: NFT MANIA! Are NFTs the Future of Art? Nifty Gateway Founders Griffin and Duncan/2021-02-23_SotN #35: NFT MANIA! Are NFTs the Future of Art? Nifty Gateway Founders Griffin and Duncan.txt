all right welcome everyone to another episode of state of the nation we're super excited about this we're going to dive deep into nfts which is super timely because we just had mark cuban on who is giving us the bullish case for nfts uh here's what we do every week at two o'clock on tuesdays we talk about what's happening we've related to the big picture stuff and then we drop some insights and action items for you so it comes out on youtube live and then also on the podcast david before we get to nfts well actually maybe you could tease this article tease this uh episode yeah episode i'm hearing myself in the background so i gotta shut that down but tease this episode for us what are we going to talk about yeah so uh nfts are the hot topic right and the thing the cool thing about nfts is how much possible surface area there is right we have we have uh you know the crypto punks which are a lot of very similar nfts and there's like one set of them but then there's uh other kinds of nfts which are um lots like high labor high energy like costly uh to produce nfts that are really really i would call them luxurious nfts art digital art like high quality art nfts and these are different kinds of products right and nfts can almost do anything but that's that's what we're going to be talking about on this specific episode of banquet state of the nation is high quality art nfts because that is what an uh nifty gateway really excels at um so if you guys uh the audience will likely have heard of people uh people dropping these massive drops on nifty gateway rac one of my favorite musicians uh dropping nfts on uh nifty gateway and like they're fundamentally different than some of the the crypto punks or euler beats or crypto kitties types of nfts they're they're specifically they're extremely rare and they're hard to produce right like you know art is hard to produce and that's kind of the nfts that you see on nifty gateway and so it's a different end of the spectrum that we're going to explore on this state of the nation all right awesome man let's talk about what's new david you want to talk about what just happened this morning because like i'm still wrapping my my my head around what just happened yeah and the reason why nfts are in the cycle is people like mark cuban think that they're awesome right there's a ton of people that don't really care about crypto don't really care about bitcoin don't really care about ether like they don't really care about the new monies of the world but um there there is this world of people that really care about digital art right digital art um and and natively scarce art and so that's that's that's pretty cool all right so this is almost turning into like nft week you know where we're doing some articles on nfts we're talking about nfts with cuba and now we're talking about nfts with nifty gateway and we've got some articles coming out this week too so stay tuned to the bankless program to check that out david we've also got some stuff going on in clubhouse so what is clubhouse and what are we experimenting with on that yeah clubhouse is this new social media app and it's a drop in what they call it a drop in chat room which is which is pretty fantastic um and and what that means is that uh there are these rooms that can be created and anyone can hop in and start listening to the conversations there's different ways to moderate these rooms some people are speaking some people can't speak um but there is it's i really like this quote from naval where podcasting is like the studio album but clubhouse is the live performance the live show uh and so ryan and i and the bankless nation are trying to get into clubhouse and so if you guys want if you guys are clubhouse members you can follow both ryan and i on clubhouse trustless state then my normal twitter handle twitter handle and then ryan sean adams ryan ryan's twitter handle is ryan s adams his clubhouse handle is ryan sean adams so make sure you you follow the right uh ryan sean adams there um but i i i think this is going to be a great community generation tool that we're going to leverage yeah absolutely man all right well we're going to get to the episode of course i got to ask you the question but before we do that a special shout out to lattice we're doing a lot with uh security hardware wallet security ever since we talked about hugh carp oh is that your lattice that's where your shot is look at that big big screen the big screen is cool because it allows you to double check a transaction a crypto transaction before you send it uh so lattices are back in stock we'll include a link to the show notes pick one of these up if you are interested in doubling down on your crypto security david now let me ask you the question i ask at the start of every one of these state of the nations what is the state of the nation today the state of the nation is collecting we are collecting things right uh there was a tweet that went out not too long ago where uh uh d5 people and cryptocurrency people are all about wealth and uh and nifty people nft people are all about status and nfts are the the the meme is that nfts are about like status signaling right signaling that you have these cool nfts and people like to signal their status and nfts are a way to express that desire to have status right um i have plants and those are kind of my unique nfts things that i like to signal that i think that's your status that's my status that is my plan yeah i thought it was and uh digital art and nfts are a way to for people to convey status and people like to collect them so this week in the state in the bankless state of the nation we are collecting all right awesome man well we're gonna get right to that but before we bring on duncan and griffin to talk about nft uh nifty gateway we want to tell you about those fantastic sponsors who made this possible if you are looking for a product

the bull case for nfts now we're going to talk about how they actually come to market how it gets done nfts are absolutely going to explode in popularity this year we've got duncan and griffin who are the co-founders of nifty gateway this is a marketplace for nfts in particular art nfts most noticeably as david said in the intro mainstream artists are starting to use this beeple is one rac uh you know uh fantastic musician also released there duncan griffin guys how are you doing are you bullish nfts or what i don't know is the hope of catholic uh yeah oh yeah thanks for having us on guys delighted to be here dude we gotta ask about that background like what what's going on in that background is this an nfd it looks awesome yes yes you you nailed it coincidentally it is an nft uh this is a way to express my pain so this is an nft called last stand of the nation state which originally sold on the primary market for 40 it was an open edition it was open for 24 hours and i bought 10 of them and then i gave away seven to my family and friends to like spread the good word of nfts and now they're trading at twenty thousand dollars each so oh my goodness wow i'm going to be living with a lifetime of pain on this one when did you do that when did you first like buy that and give it out yeah in october yeah and the artist who made it is named slime sunday and he's an incredibly talented artist he's one of the best artists that we work with and he you know he just came into the nfc medium and just absolutely knocked it out of the park so i think this is an nft that people will still be talking about 20 30 years from now maybe even 100 years from now and i will be living with regret the entire time thinking about what could have been so you know there's a lot of ingredients here where like we can resonate with the early bitcoin story where like we were talking before we started recording where bitcoin would not be what it was today if a lot of early people didn't give bitcoins away and there were a lot of early people that gave bitcoins away not knowing and or not thinking that the number would go up the value would go up and the similarity between this story and i've heard other stories of this nature similar to nfts the reason the the fact that these stories are similar makes me bullish right it's like well we know that this pattern exists we're seeing it we see it we saw it play out with bitcoin and now we're seeing it play out with nfts you don't even need to like really be bullish on digital art to understand and put all the pieces together that like these same patterns are existing both with nfts that we saw with bitcoin yeah totally you see it all the time like with bitcoin everybody's like wow the bitcoin the price of bitcoin is so high i guess it's a little too high to buy and then two years later it's like you know 10 times as high as it was then and i mean most of my network isn't bitcoin too and you see the exact same thing with nfts like they're scarce and they'll always be scarce and i gave away a lot to spread the word of nifty gateway just three or four months ago and i think i must have given away almost a hundred thousand dollars worth of nfts maybe even 300 000 now and it's just crazy to think about that's what's crazy is um you know bitcoin pizza was a long time ago right yeah everyone remembers that story like 2012 or something um but what you're talking about has just now happened in the last like four months like it feels like this these are this is nft's moment it's about to it's about to blow up in a big way and you've all that appreciation you're talking about that was just since october i mean guys can we start here though because some people to be honest still don't get it like they don't understand nfts maybe maybe duncan in your words how do you explain nfts why are they a thing absolutely yeah um i totally understand honestly it took me a while to grasp the concept as well i think it takes everyone a while to graph grasp the concept but if i just had to explain them really simply basically what i say would say is like nfts are digital items you can truly own you know like we there are lots of examples of of digital items it's like a fortnight skin for example but if my fortnite account goes away or if it were for night the game shuts down like that item disappears forever that's a really weird experience for me because like i'm used to say buying a pair of nike shoes imagine if you buy a pair of nike shoes and then nike shuts down and your shoes disappear that just doesn't make any sense that's not how like we we view the stuff we own because nfts are based on a blockchain that's like permissionless and decentralized for the first time it means that you know whoever made the nft could shut down or completely disappear but the nft still exists which is actually a crazy important concept for us because that's as humans that's how we understand ownership like i wouldn't pay so much for a pair of nike shoes if nike's shutting down met those shoes go away and it's partly why digital items could like never really be valuable beforehand but nfts have allowed that to happen for the first time um and that's that's really what i think the bigger picture is here duncan can i ask you a question because um some people who are kind of critics of nfts have told me that hey but here's the reality guys like users don't care they're still buying fortnite skins for a lot of money like like billions of dollars a year and fortnite is completely centralized fortnite can inflate the the value of skins there's no no concept of scarcity outside of like the what the game studio explores do users really care about having blockchain based uh your property settlement layer that enforces scarcity are they just gonna just go on to a centralized platform not really care look it really depends honestly you know like if i'm a fortnite gamer i'll buy a skin for 10 bucks 20 bucks whatever it makes my character look cool if i'm buying up a work of art for a million dollars like yeah 100 i care and you know it's actually it's really very interesting this is a very little known fact but there are competitors to nifty gateway that are essentially centralized versions of digital art ownership where they'll basically issue you a certificate of authenticity for like a work of digital art but it only exists on their platform those those platforms all failed none of them really broke out you know the idea didn't catch on at all for precisely the reason that i was talking about our collectors were our collectors said like well i i can't you know spend so much money on a digital item when your guy's platform going away means that digital item will just disappear and that's why it took a decentralized truly permissionless system like blockchain to make digital artwork um and you know it's it's really exciting we we've seen this sort of like happen slowly and now it's everyone is figuring this out all at once that's really exciting for us to see it's just very very cool and that reminds me of a article that um i i read recently about the spectrum behind nfts and that i really want to we were going to talk about this at the uh towards the end of this live stream but i want to kind of get into that now since it's topical there's a there's a different uh spectrum of trustlessness with nfts and this comes down to where the where the art is actually hosted right you can put everything you want onto ethereum but the bigger the data is the more expensive it is and nfts are media and sometimes gifs can be multiple multiple megabytes large and if you get to be larger than a single block on ethereum you can't put it on ethereum right uh and so there's a spectrum here of like how unchained some of these this art is and so maybe you guys can talk about how you think about uh the nfts on nifty gateway and like do you guys have aspirations to try and be a totally like self-sovereign on chain like a trustless centrist resistant uh nft platform or how do you guys think about about this industry and do people even care about this conversation look 100 i think people care and 100 this is like what we're what we're moving towards and we're actively we're actually like you know rebuilding our our minting and our deployment system right now the goal is like if nifty gateway shuts down then the art lives on forever period um that's why it's so important to build on top of a blockchain that like is going to live on forever i think you know like ethereum because like if your blockchain shuts down then your nft shuts down no question and then you know our our updated system is going to have as much information about the work of art on chain as as is possible you're right you really you can't store image files on chain some of the some of these artworks are 200 megabytes it's it's simply impossible to put those on a blockchain but what you can do is you can you can store a hash that you know provides like an immutable way to check that a provided image file is the correct image file for a you know for a particular nft and then what we're going to do is we're going to give the artist the ability to like to take control and to upload their own image url if nifty gateway shuts down you know there's a number of different decentralized file storage solutions we're just going to say like okay we're going to let people put images wherever they want because you're right that is the that is sort of the difficult part that you have to navigate with nft art is you can't put a 100 megabyte file on the blockchain that's that's just simply impossible so you do have to you know get creative when it comes to making it truly permissionless and like living on forever but absolutely that's our that's our goal that's our that's our north star with the nfts we create i think the nft ecosystem over the past few years has really figured out ways to to make this information better and to put more information on chain to make the nfts themselves more survivable and i think eventually excuse me eventually we'll see people start to to like really care about that as they realize that this does have an impact on the value you know like putting the name of the artist on chain is important like putting the putting the edition number et cetera et cetera like you know people as the market matures more people will wake up to that so with nfts okay like it comes with a file like a media file one megabyte half a megabyte 30 megabytes and so the thesis is that you know maybe the centralized hosting database that hosts that information goes down but there's still an nft with a hash that provably links to that file type right so the file type goes through a hashing algorithm out comes a hash that hash is very very small this is how blockchain works digital signatures and then that hash makes its way to the nft and that's what you own and so the media file can circulate as any other file does on the internet except it's the hash that can verify that this hash goes with this piece of digital art and again it's with nfts this kind i think this is kind of hard for a typical the newbies to get in and get their minds around is like the art isn't scarce it's the ownership of the art that's scarce and that and so the art can be on any any and everyone's computer but that doesn't mean you own it you own the certificate you own the legitimacy um and we could even go into the conversation of something like this decentralized storage how does decentralized storage fit into this conversation yeah well i think decentralized sorry go ahead yeah one thing i want to highlight there is like a lot of people think this this sort of like owning a certificate of authenticity concept is is new to nfts but it's actually been common in the physical art world for almost 100 years now where you know marcel duchamp he sold a he sold a work of art that was just a commercially produced urinal to make a perfect physical reproduction all you have to go do is buy the same urinal but that's still like a a very valuable work it's held in a few different muse dms the difference is the authenticity and like this kind of thing is very common in the the physical art world nfts are just taking this concept that has existed and mainstreaming it and bringing it to a much larger audience so i think a lot of people don't really understand a lot of people who are skeptical of nfts have not spent you know a ton of time in the the physical fine art world which isn't that surprising because it's a it can be kind of a very niche world but yeah this concept of sort of owning the owning the authentic one despite the fact that there are perfect reproductions out there that's like that's been around for a long time so yeah i just wanted to highlight that because i think a lot of people don't really i think they miss that when they talk about nfts and i think rac had a really good tweet on this too he was like the concept is polarizing but like of course it is some people care about owning nfts and other people don't the people who do care are gonna pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for an nft or maybe they'll pay twenty thousand dollars for an nft that i gave away seven of or something um but you know the people who don't care people who don't care don't want one so like they think it's stupid but it doesn't matter like if half the world thinks it's stupid and half the world's willing to pay a million dollars for it it'll be worth a million dollars and that's kind of why the concept is polarizing but we're also just seeing just insane growth you know i mean the growth in the nft space over the last three weeks you know between top shot between the numbers we're seeing between all the nft platforms it's just something that like it does remind me the early days of bitcoin because it you know to the early observers it almost doesn't make sense like it's mind-boggling to see they always believed in the concept but when these things hit at the scale of the internet like they take off like crazy and that's just where nfts are at right now and you know it's crazy to be a part of it's funny it goes back to a conversation david and i were having uh actually earlier today where he was like hey at first i was kind of uh bearish on nfts but then the market proved me wrong because like the ultimate validation of any idea is the open and free market and there is no there the the most open and free market in the world is defined right so the fact that nfts are going for these amounts of money doesn't matter what you think like somebody's paying for them so you can no longer deny that there's value here because what sets value for anything whether it's stock or gold or eth or bitcoin it is what the market is willing to pay i want to get back to this question because this kind of came up in our uh mark cuban conversation too which is like something that you were saying duncan and maybe griffin you can riff off of two which is like the platform that the nft is issued on actually matters and this is interesting because uh we were talking with with cuban about hey like mainstreaming nfts and he brought up flow right and what it's doing with um with with collect uh with collectibles nba top shops like it it kind of strikes me and you guys tell me but like if you're doing you know five dollar ten dollar sort of sports cards right like maybe you're fine having that in a in an essentially managed um you know solution basically chain uh that doesn't have the decentralization credible neutrality and like property rights uh guarantees that something like ethereum has but if you're doing something with uh you know million dollar art pieces plus then you have to have the strongest settlement guarantees is that kind of what you guys were were talking about and if that's the case will we uh will we see basically the big amounts of capital and the high value nfts on something like ethereum where you know we'll see lower value smaller economic transactions on all of these these centralized like side chains how do you see this this shaping up and is that mental model uh accurate i i personally think it's accurate i mean that's that's my thesis we i mean we choose to release our our nfts on ethereum largely for the reasons that you've outlined you know it's it's very credibly neutral it's extremely decentralized it's truly permissionless and uh you know if you if you have an asset that is worth a lot of money as as some of these nfts are now those attributes become really really important and certainly i i think that that would definitely be a factor in my mind where if i'm spending a millions of dollars on an nft i would really want it to be on a truly permissionless decentralized network like ethereum as opposed to some of the other you know as opposed to some of the other chains out there that that would definitely be a really important factor in in my decision making um yeah i do think you know like it might take a while for the market to figure that out and the thing about decentralization right it's like it's the sort of thing that that uh doesn't matter until it does so sometimes it takes that event where it matters before people wake up and realize they're like oh crap i i really want my nfts on like a truly permissionless network so you know they're that that's kind of the way i i think about it and yeah we it might take a while for people to figure that out as it has in the past with other like you know with other decentralized applications yeah you don't know that robin hood is centralized until they pause your like game stop trading right like griffin what would you add to that yeah exactly i would totally add to that and then what i would say is i think people don't realize this but ethereum is scaling like it is happening and it has such a lead like i'm highly confident ethereum's gonna win in the end you know it has all the network effects we've seen before and to me it seems like a no-brainer and we're you know we're releasing a new minting system on ethereum where we'll be able to cut down our gas cost to like less than one percent of what they currently are and we'll be able to make nfts on ethereum for like cheaper than they are on flow or wax or any of the other competing blockchains and that tech is happening you know it's all getting built so right and ethereum like has never compromised on like the core values of decentralization and permissionlessness and in my opinion like it's by far the best store of value and i think duncan's right the market's gonna wake up to that uh you know and it'll just happen slowly then all at once which we see all the time do you know that's what's funny david uh should we get into like explaining nifty gateway because we haven't yet or should we go down this track of layer two what do you wanna do i think nifty gateway first because then we then we can ask about how we come to cut the gas cost down by 99 percent because that that that was huge i really want to get into that but first let's talk about nifty gateway and how it differentiates itself from other nft platforms right because nifty gateways is quite unique the the nfts you find on nifty gateway are not the same kind of entities you would find elsewhere so what is nifty gateway and and what are the unique uh characteristics that it brings to the table yeah that's a great question i can talk about nifty nifty gateway yeah okay nice pulling up the website so duncan and i started nifty gateway about two years ago um and when we when we begun our mission was all about accessibility right like we wanted to build a um we wanted to build a website where people anyone could access nfts that was the idea that's why we called it nifty gateway you know like buying nfts before was a very difficult process especially on ethereum you had to get a metamask wallet you had to uh you know load ethereum into that wallet from after buying it on an exchange and it was very very difficult so one of the core tenants of nifty gateway has always been accessibility just making it really really easy yeah there's last stand in the nation state god damn it making it really easy for someone for anyone to buy an nft and then custody it and that was all built on top of ethereum so the original product was actually a credit card purchasing portal where we let other people buy nifties from other projects with a credit card but then we realized the real demand is like taking nft's mainstream it's finding people who are like already famous in the world outside of nfts and making it really really easy that for them to launch nfts to their audience and as well as market it and that's kind of like nifty gateway in its current form you want to talk about that a little bit duncan yeah for sure so we we got acquired by gemini and that that gave us access to technology that we didn't have before um and that that sort of let us realize our our full vision which was which was twofold the first part of the vision is that you never have to be onboarded into cryptocurrency to to sign up and start trading and the cool thing thing that we find is like it's a really good you know entry point into into crypto it's it's i mean we literally called it nifty gateway where people are interacting with the blockchain without even realizing it and then slowly they pick up that knowledge and they get more and more curious and they're sort of onboarded into the the way that like blockchains work without even realizing it which we think is really really powerful so that's 1081. you can sign up you can buy nfts you can sell nfts and you never have to be onboarded into cryptocurrency which just makes it so much easier for a person to get started 102 is all about you know emphasizing creators and like people who are making nfts that we think are really really strong so there's a huge curational aspect to this um you know ryan you were talking earlier about the platform that you release nfts on mattering a lot of the nft platforms including nifty gateway have a pretty strong brand behind them so when we put an artist on our platform we're basically endorsing their work we're saying like hey this we think this artist is going places where we're really proud to offer the work it's a similar value proposition as as top art galleries have with the artists they they present so that's really aspect number two where we curate we really build a lot of excitement we we put a ton of effort into marketing every single artist that we release with and you know the end result of that is i think collectors are are comfortable buying from us because they know a nifty gateway endorsed artist is like is going places they have a strong career and yeah so we sort of play a similar role to the role that galleries play in the physical art world except we play it at a much larger scale so sometimes we call ourselves like an art gallery at the scale of an internet the scale of the internet so it's really those two things it's really easy to access for new people and then there's like a curational element where we select artists we think are awesome and and endorse their work and i will add on to that sorry no go ahead yeah just quick question our tokens are nfts on nifty gateway fractional can you participate in a fractional nft if you if you can't buy all fifteen thousand dollars of a token can you get a piece of one not on nifty gateway no but other people have uh other people have created fractionalized services and you know all the nfts on nifty gateway are erc 721s and can easily be withdrawn and turned into a fractional ownership people for example this is a really cool project when he sold you know his every days as one of ones and they all went for about a hundred thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars each which is a huge event in the nft world the buyer of those took withdrew all 20 of them and has fractionalized them into something called a v20 which is now tradable as an erc20 token on uniswap and it's just like an insanely cool project because you can get ownership of like maybe the most important drop in the history of crypto art although it's also interesting like just last thursday we had an artist mad dog jones sell four million dollars in a single five minute open edition window which like past people's primary market and then we have grimes coming up on sunday which you know yeah i mean we'll see what the numbers look like we're upgrading our servers because it's just going to be an absolute bonanza so we'll see new records are getting broken like every day yeah just for the record grime we're talking about elon musk's wife right yeah yeah elon musk has a name of by herself she's a fantastic artist and she's also elon musk's wife like wow yeah i wonder if i i wonder if he's going to be pumping this a little bit yeah i wonder too i wonder what elon thinks about nfts like we don't really know yet but i feel like he would love it it's practically made for elon yeah elon loves memes and that's a great play that's a great jumping off point well it's interesting because we're talking so much with cuban like about the just the surface area of this and this being sort of the gateway to decentralized finance for for everybody um can you talk about some of these these like big things that have happened because i mean i bet two years ago when you started this this would be kind of like dream scenario you get artists like people i mean that was absolutely massive and now now beeple is um what's the big auction house um christie's confused christie's people's on he like you guys mainstreamed people to nfts essentially by extension mainstreamed him and introduced him to to defy and uh everything that we're doing in crypto can you talk about maybe some examples of this like some of the most exciting uh i guess uh artists coming on that are more mainstream accessible and and you know how that's helping crypto how that's helping d5 and nfts in general totally yeah honestly when we started last year it was it was such a such a mission to pitch artists and we'd go in there and they would just have these like blank stares on their faces and it was like what what on earth are these guys talking about like i can screenshot it but i still own it it was just like and then we look at now where we basically we have just so much inbound interest like we have the opposite problem where we need to to figure out how to like select the people who are reaching out to us it's really been like such a monumental shift over the past year honestly i think one a good example is um trevor trevor andrew he's known as gucci ghost he's like a pretty he he has like a strong following with you know some specific art collectors we pitched him in march of last year to try and get him on the platform took us seven or eight months to convince him of like you know just following up repeatedly being like hey this is the future this is really really cool and then he released his work one of his pieces sold for thirty thousand dollars on the secondary market he's about to come back next month with like a huge new release he's like posting on instagram all my friends are sending me his instagram posts where he's like i just gotta cut up my secondary market digital art sales like nfts of the future yeah it's it's really like it's honestly really crazy for for me to witness because like we've been here for for years like pushing this idea trying to tell people like how cool nfts are and now it seems like people are finally waking up to that so yeah for trevor jones if things keep going how they are you know he'll probably make millions of dollars from his next drop you know and like that's probably more than he would make in multiple years in an art world maybe the thing is sorry trevor andrew yeah trevor jones trevor jones is one of the biggest crypto artists in the world and he's actually dropping tomorrow and that one's yeah it's gonna be bonkers our core servers do you guys remember in uh do you guys remember in 2017 there was like this crypto meme that was like the institutions are coming right like yeah near the top where we're like oh you know bitcoin hit all-time highs hit all-time highs but it's probably not all-time highs because the institutions are coming and this but like it really feels like the artists are coming right yeah the you know the celebrities are coming the uh the the creators are coming in a big way to nfts and what's what's crazy about it is uh i feel like no one's still talking about it in in just general crypto right like we're all very excited about bitcoin price and eth price but like in our the non-crypto bubbles everyone's starting to talk about this nfts and it's like it's spreading it's it's going viral is this the year that the creators come to nfts and d fire are you are you feeling like we're about to be hit by a tsunami dude it's already happened yeah okay i wish i could share some of the names we have like lined up but i would just say i would just say go too you can you can if you want we'll share them just go to niftygateway.com and sign up for our mailing list or follow our twitter and like you'll see them very soon like believe me enough um but yeah like 100 like this is absolutely the year i think the comparisons of the early days of bitcoin are really poignant you know the comparisons to the early days of facebook too like what we're seeing with nfts is really remarkable and it is kind of a once-in-a-generation shift and like creators are starting to realize it and the numbers just speak for themselves and i have so many friends from college now who are just like totally into it like they never cared about crypto before like but now they're just like going gaga over nfts and buying all of our drops i i do think all the other crypto infrastructure has paved the way for nfts and this is something we continue to see happening with crypto right like first a bitcoin happens and then ethereum happens and builds on top of that and enables smart contracts and then d5 happens and then nfts happen and every time like the system just gets more and more mature and everything just grows and builds on top of it so i think that compounding is going to continue and like you know it's exactly like the internet where we're going to see steady growth for the next few decades until blockchains basically rule the world it's awesome to be a part of i'll say that much what are some of the cool stats that you guys have seen so like tell us tell us some things that'll impress us right so like you're throwing around numbers about like big sales being in the millions of dollars talk about that talk about how many people are in this space like i don't know what the metrics are that you're looking at but tell us the metric i can i can share some metrics and i'm sure duncan has some too but nifty gateway launched about 11 months ago right when covid hit incidentally and we've grown around seven we've grown around 70 month over month every single month since we've launched we've actually never had a single down month what does that mean growth in what and total sales on the platform okay volumes volume yeah yeah and then we've had some months where our total sales went up five or six x in a single month over month period from november to december our sales november our sales our total sales were about 1.4 million in december they were about um seven million i think and now like we're actually in in the midst of another like five or six x boom our total sales for uh february will probably end up at around 50 million dollars are you kidding me 50 million dollars yeah yeah i kid you not put that in context in march of 2020 when we launched we had thirty thousand dollars in sales and we were excited about that we were like oh my god people are spending thirty thousand dollars on nfts and that was a win for the one year anniversary we it's yeah okay it's not a win for our poor team there's only 15 of us trying to keep up with this so if you want to apply please come apply to nifty gateway because you definitely need help yes it just keeps growing way faster than we ever thought it would so okay so like we talked about the mainstreaming of it right as as being one maybe factor of of growth here what else explains the growth here is it is it also let me ask you is an element i don't know whether these people are coming uh whether it's kind of crypto natives jumping into nfts and like crypto natives are feeling pretty good these days with bitcoin price all-time high eth price all-time high d5 summer all of these things so they've got some cash to spend is it more them or is it are we attracting kind of a new crowd outside of crypto some combination both what are the factors that account for a 50 million dollar month honestly you know what it is a big part of it is just the fact that you've never been able to collect digital art before like this is such a concrete problem that that nfts are are solving for the world there are so many amazingly talented digital artists out there and basically what they what they do is they post their work for free on instagram and then they get hired to do contract work for like advertisements they can never sell their work in a gallery they can never like you can sell a print of a digital artwork and so there was just this like huge group of people out there who are so talented they have a they have a fan base who loves their work on social media but they had their fan base couldn't collect it and nfgs just came in and like and fit that like a glove and i think that's a big like a big aspect of what's happening here and a lot of the you know a lot of the collectors we see yes it's a lot of crypto people but it's a lot of people who are fans of these digital artists and have been following them for a long time and have been asking for a way to collect their work and all of a sudden here's a way that that actually works that where you can't actually collect digital art i think that's a huge factor in all of this and then there's people who are buying it you know as an investment and are realizing that like there's this massive shift in the world where value is shifting onto blockchains and crypto networks and like i said again we really saw it starting with bitcoin but i think that process is only accelerating and nfts are such an incredibly awesome and fun way to get exposure to that that people are just going nuts like investing money and i have some friends from college who are like very risk-averse people and like they're all texting me about how they're buying like last night's draw and then yeah like our poor servers when grimes releases on sunday and her art is just fantastic so i i don't know sometimes tomorrow are poor servers yeah and trevor jones tomorrow who's one of the biggest crypto artists in the world just you know a super talented artist so sometimes an idea just fits and like i think the the numbers really speak for themselves um and yeah like you were expecting this we would have hired more people if we were but like it's just been awesome to be a part of i also think there's a huge element of like we see a ton of musicians like musicians they like rac for example he can put his music on a streaming platform but he can't like sell he can't really sell merchandise that includes music like we had we had grammatic on over the weekend and he tokenized four or five full-length songs did over 1.5 million in sales just tokenizing those full-length songs that's a year of touring revenue for him um that he made in a 10-minute time period yeah and five so i think yeah honestly like don't underestimate how much like nfts are growing just because this is a really cool new creative medium like people can put out creative stuff that they haven't been able to before like you know imagine being there when the video camera was invented and all of a sudden someone makes a dope movie and you're like whoa that was this video camera thing actually might work that's what we're seeing with nfts like people are making really really cool stuff in this new creative medium that like just could not exist before and that's driving so much adoption this is definitely the conversation i want to turn to next because nfts have historically been like little digital little tidbits right digital images now we've kind of gotten into gifs but we recently saw our first audio nfts and then now you guys are bringing up how musicians are using nfts right and we have to remember like this cryptocurrency revolution is it's one part about revolution and how humans perceive value and it's one part revolution in technology right cryptographic money is a revolution and now we have cryptographic art and we there's nfts just like when when bitcoin was super clunky back in 2010 2011 i expected that nfts kind of are matching bitcoin in their clunkiness at their very beginning and i expect the ability for artists to uh for artistic expression to be um this only to be the beginning of the story and i wanna ask you guys about all of that uh conversation but first we gotta take a moment to pause and talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemiini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of

of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave [Music] because i have a heart stop at one so i might hop up yeah that's a great question honestly digital is like an incredibly incredibly open medium and that's maybe the coolest part about it right like we're really just scratching the surface of what can actually be done what could be tokenized with nfts um you know art is a way to capture a moment in time and like it always reflects the culture and digital is the most like open format in history does that really well we're working with comedians and they're you know they're going to be like tokenizing some of their main jokes or some of their biggest lives from stand up from their standups and like making those collectible and like that just goes to show like how like really open a concept this is when you start to think about it like when you really start to think about what nfts could be applied to like what could be made collectible in a digital world like your head kind of hurts because it's just such such a large market it and you know we're really just scratching the surface it's like point one percent of the way there i'd say yeah what i like to compare to is the invention of the video camera i mean before the video camera people would put on plays but think about how hard that was to distribute like you had to perform the play each time in front of an audience and like maybe 100 people could consume that play the video camera comes along it creates a new medium but it also it's a medium that's inherently easier to distribute because you can just like create a copy and send it all over the the country i we're seeing something really similar with nfts in my opinion where like physical art is inherently really difficult to to send to people you know the physic work of physical air can only be viewed by one person at a time as opposed to an nft which can be viewed by anybody at a time and so like yeah but we're still in the early days of people figuring out how to use that new tool set to make like really really exciting stuff but you ask people nowadays like hey what are those like what are those cultural things that define your life like they're going to talk about their favorite movies they're going to talk about like et or the movies that change their lives you know in 50 years like i think we'll see like a similar displacement with digital art where it'll be like hey what are the what are the works of art that really like capture a moment in time you know nfts are really like moving into that position really quickly maybe someone like gave away seven copies of a piece of art when they bought it for only forty dollars and then like they spend the rest of their life like talking about it and regretting it i could see that what makes me so bullish about nfts is the amount of surface area that they bring to the table um and uh we're trying to get andrew yang on the podcast and the way that i think that we do this well yes is we talk about how much uh monetization tools specific ethereum and specifically nfts can bring to the table where all of a sudden we have these tools for these artists that probably wouldn't have been able to make it previously can monetize their own labor talk talk about like perhaps this renaissance of coming and you know both artistic expression and the ability for artists to be their own bosses to create and produce artistic value without having to sign away their soul and their contracts talk about this conversation yeah i mean honestly that that's the coolest part that's like what gets us and the nifty gateway team out of bed every morning you know like when we see grammatic post about the fact that he he wasn't able to tour all last year he did an nft drop with five unreleased songs and he was able to like make up for all that touring revenue in a single nft drop that's the thing that gets us the most excited or the like last year one of our artists twisted vacancy after three drops with us he bought a house he has a family now he's like living comfortably because he can sell his artwork on nifty gateway and other platforms that's like the coolest in the world frankly i mean like these people you know and those are just two examples there's way more artists like this people who can never like sell their artwork before they have a big following people love them but like there's just no way for it to be collected all of a sudden they're making like literally millions of dollars and some of them are like achieving financial independence some of them are escaping like you know bad situations where they're in abusive families and uh yeah like that's that's literally the coolest in the world seeing yeah seeing artists achieve like financial independence i agree and i would add to that something else which is that like every era of history is usually most impacted by the newest technology right like you read about the late 19th and early 20th century it's clearly most impacted by industrialization which caused like huge conflict between workers and like very wealthy owners and you know maybe led to world war one or two those were just like times of great shift and you know now is certainly no exception the internet has like influenced the world i think enormously over the last two decades um and we have so much new technology coming down the pipeline i really look forward to a world where nfts are like one of the most important technologies and a true creative renaissance where people are like passionate about collecting where art penetrates at a global scale you know where where these things like really start to impact the world you know i'm very optimistic i think the 2020s are actually going to be a time of remarkable technological innovation i don't know if anyone's read ark invest theory about all these technologies that are coming down the line but there's huge advantages in biotech and obviously blockchain and all this other stuff so i i'm just really excited about you know truly a digital renaissance where our culture shifts and the world becomes optimistic and you know it's all captured in this art of the time and like you know a hundred years from now you go to the the reichs museum in holland you see the paintings of the dutch masters in the 18th century and like you can see holland was on top of the world back then like just from the paintings like because they ruled you know they had the largest empire in like the largest financial system i i wonder what these digital nfts will say about our time like 300 years from now in the internet but and it's just really cool to think about truly impacting the world at scale and artists having such a large impact so i don't know we'll see what happens but it's really exciting to be a part of duncan i know you have to go in a minute griffin if you have some time to hang around we'd love to ask you a couple more questions but maybe duncan uh you you can just answer this last question for us so uh real quick cuban we asked him how how what's the size of the nft market uh he said a hundred billion or so and he gave that a time horizon i have a feeling you guys might be a bit more bullish how big could this nft thing get well people spend about 60 billion dollars a year on on physical art i think what we've already seen are early signs of like digital artists because like nfts are just so much easier to move and send like people are going to spend more money on them they're essentially like easier to trade the same way like people spend way more money on movies than plays just because it's so much harder to produce plays so i think on art alone we'll see a a larger amount of money spent on nfts than physical art um trillions and then i think it's like a dollar days what i like to say is like you know we started nifty gateway very much as like a company that was grounded in a specific point in time for the nft industry it was always supposed to be a gateway that's that's why it's called nifty gateway but like you could never start airbnb in 1994 because people just had no idea what the the internet was once we penetrate nfts with like digital art with nba top shots with a few other use cases then the fun really starts where it's like okay why are we sending people christmas cards like we could just commission an nft and send them that like why am i like i could commission an nft as a valentine's day gift for my girlfriend and bam there's 10 000 commission artists you know that's like a modern day version of cameo so once once these first few use cases really hit then like then the sky's the limit and who knows what's going to happen and then that doesn't even get into like snapchat adding nft filters you know there's like there's these are like or video game items i mean it's like yeah they're really reversed yeah the potential is unlimited and yeah again like we started nifty gateway it's supposed to be a gateway it's like very much grounded in this philosophy of like people have to understand a single use case of nfts and then all of a sudden it'll be like people don't send christmas cards anymore they just send nfts and that's that's my final thought i did not think about that use case at all that is absolutely face melting duncan thank you so much for for being with us on the the state of the nation and and uh yes cheers thanks for being part of the conversation thanks guys bye and of course we're sticking around with uh griffin and so griffin i kind of wanted to introduce yeah cool and and i think this is going to be a final a great final piece of the conversation to end on is i want to ask about uh what is your perception as to the role of nfts in the bull market right we're quote unquote in a bull market uh today doesn't look like it we're a little bit down but over the grand scheme of things i think we're going to be in a bull market what role does nfts do nfcs play in this bull market that's that's a great question um my main answer would be i don't know i think we're going to find out but i think nfts are really really compelling and when i was talking to justin blau the dj who's very into nfcs he thinks a lot of the reason there is such a bull market is that everybody like doesn't want to hold on to to the dollar which i i do think there's a lot a lot of truth to that and it's really interesting i i don't know i i sometimes wonder if official measures of inflation are doing a bad job truly measuring how much inflation is happening because there's huge inflation across all sorts of like elements of life and everything certainly feels more expensive and i think it's a large reason why people are fleeing to these safe haven assets um but i think nfts play an incredibly important role because they're like unique stores of value the same way that art is but they're just like 10 000 times better than art that being a store of value right the default with a piece of art is that like the provenance is almost impossible to like actually certify like i was talking about someone in the art world and all the committees that formed to certify artworks by andy warhol had to break up because they kept getting sued because andy warhol's artworks are like prince of campbell's soup cans on paper and they're so easy to fake so like it was so easy to fake them and like the committees that tried to like actually authenticate them just literally couldn't do it um so nfts it's the opposite like the authenticity is the default and that actually makes them an incredibly good store of value which drives the prices really high in like counter-intuitive ways people always see the prices that nfcs are going for and like it seems strange at first but when you think about it on like that systems level and they serve that function very well it actually kind of starts to make a lot of sense because authenticity is what stores value in art and nfts have perfect authenticity by default um and yeah and then the other thing i would say is nfts are also a great way to like take some gains and flex and like buy something amazing and people are really starting to do that and you know it's just like it's honestly so fun i i would caution people against getting started because it's just seriously addicting and you spend money like you didn't think you were capable of spending money and it's happened to a lot of my friends actually like i kind of worry about some of the financial decisions they made but you know they're all doing pretty well now so griffin is an nft dealer it sounds like and watch out this could be the gateway drug into nfps into crypto hey griffin i know you've got to run but we left one thread hanging and i just the dr for this because we don't have time to get into a technical discussion but you said uh you could do nifty gateways issue nfts one percent of the gas fee uh you know make it more efficient how are you doing scaling is l2 involved are you guys going to solve this can you do this in like 30 seconds or less give us a quick explanation and then come back when we talk about layer 2 from a technical perspective yes absolutely i'm happy to come back and talk about this any time it's too bad duncan left because he knows more about it than i do but um long story short we're switching our minting method so i i think the new standard is called eip2309 and it was pioneered by another nft platform named cargo and we're able to get away with minting all of the innovations with one single blockchain transaction instead of right now every single nft is minted with its own transaction but right now like if we sell like 2000 open editions we'll be able to do all of that with only a single transaction on ethereum i wish i understood the technical details better but duncan has always been the one in the weeds coding and solidity so he would know much better than i do as far as l2 goes i think l2 has a lot of you know it's definitely the future but nifty gateway itself is centralized you know we're centralized nft exchange the same way coinbase and gemini are and like that for us serves most the purposes of l2 you know anyone can send an nft to anyone else on nifty gateway for free anyone can put it up for sale you know with no fees because all of that's happening off chain and i i really think the future of ethereum is like some sort of hybrid like that everything that's on chain needs to be on chain and then everything that doesn't need to be on chain isn't and l2s are also going to get much more advanced and by the way the centralized approach not everyone is a fan of it but you know our thing is always like we give you the option of custodying your nfts if you want you can custody them with us and like trade them on our marketplace or you can test them yourself it's about giving you a choice so that's how we see it and plus there's so much other infrastructure that you guys shouldn't be responsible for building that you guys can tap into once it is built right decentralized storage i mean l2 technologies uh these are not these are not nft centric platforms somebody else should build those things when they're ready you can tap into those and i do believe that like the nft platforms that win are the ones that do um give the strongest assurances about the uh the redeemability or the link between the token and the art uh and you know that requires some sort of decentralization and decentralized storage um but there's no reason why we need to wait for those things to come about like let's get these these this nft revolution underway and it's already underway um so so thank you for what you have built with nft gateway and thank you for pioneering this conversation into the mainstream cheers guys thanks for having me this was a blast i i hope to be back soon once we hit our first 500 million dollar month i'll come back all right so well this rate should be in april yeah right our poor team the poor engineers oh whatever awesome well guys this has been yeah fantastic you guys are doing great work thanks for keeping us up to speed on this it's happening faster than i think uh any of us in maybe bankless thought it would and this is definitely an exciting year for nfts so we've just had griffin and duncan on from nifty gateway guys action items you can check out nifty gateway and what they're doing uh check out some of the artists we'll include some links in the show notes uh of this um risks and disclaimers we should say nfts are risky the valuation of them is anyway so is eth so is crypto all of d5 is you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on the bankless journey one last thing i forgot uh nifty gateway is a wholly owned subsidiary i believe of of gemini gemini is also a sponsor it's not why we had them on we had them on because nifty gateway's awesome and nfts are dope but just wanted to disclaim that guys thanks a lot for joining us on another state of the nation hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did
