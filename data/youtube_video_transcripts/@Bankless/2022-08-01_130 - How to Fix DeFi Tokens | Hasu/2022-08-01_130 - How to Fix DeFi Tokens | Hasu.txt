welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more thankless guys great episode great topic great guest for you this is how to fix defy tokens we have hassu who is a prominent researcher i think one of the best people on earth positioned to talk about this with us we talk about why defy tokens are broken and how to fix them this is really the hard work we have to do during the bear market look out for these takeaways number one we discuss what's broken about d5 tokens today number two we discussed why all roads seem to lead back to regulatory question mark we talk about number three why the west might actually be the last to embrace crypto number four we talk about why fixing governance is the key to fixing defy tokens we have to do that first and hastu dropped some tips for daos as well and number five we talk about why we have to fix defy tokens if we want to end the bear market this is key as well making defy tokens an investable asset class shoring up our investor protections there david this was a really fascinating discussion um with hasi what did you think there are i have so many things to say um some of them i'll definitely have to say for the debrief uh for the listeners that listened to my very quick interview with kane warwick out of ecc he talked about this meta of in 2017 the scoreboard was how much can your ico raise in 2020 the scoreboard was how much can your yield farm get up in tvl and then he predicted the next bull market the next scoreboard will be how much fees can your protocol generate and that third scoreboard is intimately tied to this conversation that we just had with hazu because how much fees can your protocol generate is going to be a function of the the quality of the protocol not necessarily the thing that's broken but the quality of how well that dow can organize around those fees and capture those fees and direct value back to token holders this is the thing that is broken today is that we have stellar protocols and fundamentally broken dows we have fundamentally broken dow structures and we need to fix that dow side of things to bridge the the fee flows that these protocols are just printing they're all they're money printers but we don't have the pipe between the money printer and the dow to fund operations to pay for contributors and we go through all the variables all the aspects of dows that need to be fixed in order to build this bridge between the fees that some dows are are absolutely printing right now and then the actual organization that governs over these things uh so this is the conversation i have so much more to say ryan so we'll have to talk about it in the debrief no we will talk about that in the deep brave the debrief of course is our episode after the episode where you get david and i's raw thoughts uh if you're a premium subscriber you get that and we'll include a link for you to become a premium subscriber it's really a fantastic episode and i think if you're a defy investor you want to pay close attention to this episode because we talk about um what's going to be required to make this a much more investable asset class as well one of the big themes that we've said on bankless is we're speed running the the history of money and finance then that quickly turned over into daos we are also speedrunning the history of human coordination systems and this that theme is part of what we're talking about today where we this is actually a science that human humanity has already perfected it's corporate governance it's human organization we already know the answers to these things we just need to learn how to apply them in a new dow context and so one of the big themes for this episode is how do we apply the lessons that we've already learned as a species onto this new form factor which is daos and so the listener should think in that frame as they go throughout this episode guys we're going to get right to our episode with hasu but before we do we want to tell you about these awesome tools for going bankless maker dow is the og d5 protocol the first d5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it d5 maker dow produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mince die directly with maker the power to mince new money is in your hands and there's something new in the maker dial ecosystem every time a new maker vault is opened the owner can claim a poem which contributes funds to one tree planted an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side soon maker will be present on all chains and layer twos bringing the biggest and best d5 credit facility to everywhere there is d5 today you can mint die on oasis.app defy saver or other d5 protocols that you use so follow maker on twitter at maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocketpool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 168 to get started you're getting an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your note to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish east taking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there hey bankless nation we're super excited to introduce you yet again to hasu hasso has been on the podcast before he's a crypto economic researcher pseudo-anonymous he's helping to build the frontier in many different directions he's a researcher at paradigm he works strategy at flash bots solving helping to solve the mev problem he's also a podcaster as well a governor a delegate in many d5 protocols such as maker dow and overall he's definitely a defy governance big thinker so um wanted to bring hassu on and i guess the original topic for today was how we can fix defy tokens but i think in talking to hasu pre-show david and hassu and i concluded that there might not be a clean answer on how to fix defy tokens right so i think the orientation of this podcast is really the question can defy tokens be fixed hasu welcome to bankless we're excited to have this discussion with you yeah hey ryan hey david um thanks for having me back on okay i'm gonna tee this up and just set this up i feel like defy tokens and i think maybe many people uh in crypto feel like d5 tokens are somewhat broken right now at least from a value accrual perspective so the idea is many of our d5 protocols actually are working really well like maker is working pretty darn well uniswap uh historic volumes it's driving more uh transaction revenue than ethereum at this point in time uh ave has proven itself in ways that the c5 lenders could not during this cycle and yet the value accrual for d5 tokens has been somewhat disappointing leads to the conclusion that that maybe they're a bit broken right now first tasu what do you think about that statement do you agree that defy tokens are kind of broken in their current form and what about them is broken um first of all i guess um so you're saying that d5 protocols do a really good job but the value crude of the token is is a bit disappointing right yes um i i wouldn't really over index on how the d5 protocols have done uh in sort of this credit um contraction that we've seen um over the last month i mean the defy protocols fortunately they haven't gotten into the business of unsecured lending yet which is what really drive all of these lenders into bankruptcy and so that you have a pretty easy explanation for why they came out of this um better than the seafaring does which is that they only offered repo landing so they're just all over collateralized is what you're saying exactly exactly so um yeah maker tao has like a small amount of sort of uncollateralized lending but that was sort of is completely orthogonal to um the crypto space but also there's examples in d5 of like uniswap and synthetics for example unrelated to lending unrelated to collateral that are also driving a ton of fees so yes i take the argument that just like the over collateralized nature of defy lenders makes them meaningfully different than c5 lenders but i think the real conversation is a lot of these defy apps are directing cash flows are directing fees and yet none of those fees are falling into the hands of value capture into the token uh they're we're not really seeing growth in the organization behind these protocols and we're not seeing basically we're not seeing token price go up we're kind of just seeing a leaking a leaky ship no matter what d5 protocol you're looking at you're not really seeing any of these protocols capturing and maintaining value as a function of the fees that they are collecting in this space would you agree with that um partially i mean i think unit sub for example is still worth seven billion dollars fully diluted um i think off the top of mad light or are they somewhere between one and two billion dollars omega around one billion so they are like we have d5 unicorns right um i i don't think that the variation is extremely unfair or anything um if anything they probably went up too high i think i mean as it's kind of expected in in the cycle of crypto that we see like as like kind of speculative mania um but i mean nonetheless it's really impressive to create like in the real world we would say it's extremely impressive to create a unicorn company um and and so i i think these companies are doing quite well but maybe not as well as they could do if investors had more faith that these um i mean they that sort of certain overhangs would be eliminated right and we can sort of get into what these are i mean um one is basically just to go like very briefly through them i mean um so they don't they tend to not have sort of uh you know effective management um why because um these protocols need to be decentralized um they don't they tend not to do any marketing at all um because then you get into securities regulation um they tend to uh you know have really broad token issuance um they tend to not drive any revenue to their token and so on so um and furthermore we are in a market that is extremely cyclical so investors don't really like very cyclical markets um and in many ways i mean sort of um i guess the staying power of d5 d5 has only been around for two years at this point um so i mean as an investor it feels warranted to put a large discount on um on default tokens before you see some of these regulatory overhangs and eliminate it just to really drive this point home you put out an article that was more or less i think close to the top of the bull market talking about uh the actual uh uh fleeting nature of all these defy treasuries where we was like we looked at the uniswap treasury and we saw four billion dollars and then we actually took a peek under the hood and it was all uni tokens which you were arguing doesn't really count as a treasury when it's denominated in an asset that the protocol can just freely mint if they so desire uh and so like if i wanted to i could go into token put it on unswap and then mint 10 trillion of them in the back end and i could claim that i have like a trillion dollar treasury it doesn't really work like that your treasury should really only be denominated in external assets and perhaps just mainly monies ether bitcoin and stable coins and so you made this argument that the size of these treasuries were actually extremely at risk from a bear market which we tend to always know comes in crypto and then tend to always be you know 90 drawdowns and that's kind of what we've seen in a lot of d5 treasuries and so this conversation of are defy tokens broken is there a missing link between protocol revenues and defy dow treasuries i think is really really salient and when i say the words like we have a leaky ship is that we have these dows we have these orgs that govern over defy protocols on chain and those protocols direct cash flows direct fees but those the fees that they are not directing uh that they are directing are not going into the treasuries of dows meaning that we cannot pay for labor we cannot pay for capital expenses we can't really grow these organizations uh in a meaningful way that has you know been tried and true throughout time would you agree with all these statements yeah and i think the the reason why it makes sense to bring up the the treasury debate from last year is that this this proves to me that most d5 protocols are not run like businesses um because if you were like if you were actually running your your protocol like a business then you would make sure that you know it has sufficient liquidity to pay wages and invest throughout the bear market but we are seeing the opposite we are seeing that many protocols did very poor treasury management and now find themselves in a position where you know they have to reduce the head count they have to stop incentive programs they have to raise money near the um sort of at peak low prices and this is all things that um i mean if you had someone in charge of judging management who had worked at a traditional company before i mean these are very basic things basically and i think if projects thought of themselves more as businesses then you wouldn't see some of these easy mistakes yeah what's interesting to me is it feels like um like the simple question and the simple question to me and maybe sort of an archetype for the protocol works incredibly well but the token feels like it's a little bit broken is probably the uni token right and the the criticisms of the uni token right now are oh it's just a governance token and by the way governance doesn't work very well go look at the kind of the uniswap governance forms and you can kind of see and it doesn't even have value accrual attached to it right now and so like uniswap incredible protocol working very well showing what defy is capable of but that is not translating into a token that is delivering value back to investors and what's interesting to me is like there's different answers to this like some some people uh would actually say uniswap should not have a token at all wha why are you even introducing a token in the first place it should just be a protocol that kind of works and there's no need for a token so why don't we just eliminate the token that's one potential answer to this problem another is from i guess the uni investor perspective why don't we just turn on fees let's start there let's start getting some revenue i suppose into the protocol so we can have some fees to govern of course there's there's lots of of governance issues to work through on the other side of that we could we could step into but why don't we just turn on fees i want to ask you about maybe these first two things like so first why does uniswap even need a token maybe some of the critics are right that some of these protocols should be tokenless and then secondly if there is an argument for uniswap to have a token why why haven't we just turned on fees yet why haven't the governor's done that yet okay so i think to get into the first question um depends what you mean by token uh whether it's like whether you mean that uh unicef should could in theory be owned by like one person one company one family without putting any sort of shares on the secondary market which is one valid interpretation or whether unisop should like benefit no one and be sort of a completely free open source project that doesn't ever charge a fee and i do mean that more the public good model i mean the the answer is basically that you can do that but there's not going to be another unisop after that so i think you need the ability for um you know people to get rich in order to have um you know a funding market for these things so if if you need the token can never you know pay back the investment that sort of the the investors made in it then uh basically the the primary funding market also is going to dry up and then we'll just have a lot less um innovation in d5 projects so i think that the founders and investors need to be able to get rich from this or you will just see no further projects and so i think it follows to say that this is kind of the core argument as to why everything has a token because if you don't have a token somebody will just copy you and then make a token and then now that's kind of the new the new shelling point and it's an arms race right it's a little bit like that it's a little bit of an arms race yeah that's why unity swap did this in the first place you might argue as a response to a competitor sushi swap and so i i think there's i think you'd agree with me is that daos have a many dows many defy apps have an undefined vision for themselves you know what are we what is unit swap is it a public good is it a for-profit exchange uh and i think the argument that we're making is like everything kind of boils down into a for-profit value capture governance token that governs over a d5 protocol would you agree with that conclusion i think i think that if the answer to that is yes then that's the brightest possible future for d5 right because if there's no value accrual then i think the space of possible innovation in the future is going to be a lot lower lower whereas if investors learn that you can make a lot of money from d5 tokens then you will attract a lot of great founders great teams will unlock a lot of financial innovation and you'll have a very uh deep and liquid market for funding these projects in the first place okay so we're we're now operating under a paradigm that everything is going to have a token the the best token governance the best dow governance that leverages the powers that their token enables to them to best govern over their protocol make the best protocol possible which captures the best fees possible will be the the protocol that wins honestly this feels like very basic business 101 and we just kind of forget this if we are not like escaping just like 101 rational economic truths by being in the crypto space we still follow the laws of economics we still follow the laws of incentives and so may the best protocol win and the protocol that wins is the one that you know drives a bunch of revenue to the dow grows the organization uh and ultimately rewards token holders uh yeah yeah we on the same page yeah i mean i i would think so yeah i mean so that begs the question then in the kind of the second point or the second criticism or the second question people have about something like the the uni token why not turn on fees why don't they just do that why hasn't this been done and we're seeing proposals that have come out over time and uh i think um some action has maybe been heating up in the last week or two around serious proposals to turn on the uniswap fee switch but i'm curious what's the history here why hasn't that been done previously do you think and is does does it feel like governance is broken because we can't do this simple thing uh well i don't i don't think it means governance is broken so why haven't we turned on the feasibility swap um i think there are very good business reasons why we haven't done it so um so traditional sort of um silicon valley uh you know startup canon would be um first you like in these kind of network-based businesses business with network effects which definitely unisop um kind of uh you know this applies to it as well um because you have a two-sided market between you know traders and market makers um really what you want to do is kind of you want to grow the network um as much as possible um and then only then when sort of yeah you just have a switching cost uh to another network uh and gain more utility from being in your network than in another network that that's when you start to uh monetize and you can monetize up to their exit cost so that would be kind of their traditional you know um vc way of thinking about these networks so hassi this is like why amazon ran with no profit for like you know decades and why facebook didn't even have a revenue model like you know four or five years into its business it's it's for to build that network effect yeah well i mean uber still uh loses money on every riot yeah so um so yeah i mean this these networks can require uh like 10 years of investment um before they uh are so big or youtube for example didn't run any ads for the first seven to eight years right uh and only when sort of the library of videos and the algorithm and everything was so strong that the users didn't really have an alternative to youtube's that's when they slowly started sort of to ramp up um you know the adwords and and started to all out youtube premium and and all of this stuff right so um that's why you can definitely point to business logic and say hey that's why you know shouldn't turn on the switch the fee switch today um but i think that there is the uh doubt in you know the general market's mind whether uh unicorn even if it would make sense uh were in a position to turn on the fees so i think that's definitely also um a factor what about that second bucket um so let's say i i totally understand that the argument of not turning on the fees on on something like the uniswap protocol of we're building network effect and um you know we want to make this as low cost as possible to out compete our competitors and build the the biggest network uh in all of that um and yet on the other side there could be the business case to do this you know turn it turning on fees for instance uh you got to think that that would be a positive catalyst for the value of the uni token for one and if the dao has a lot of uni in its treasury then that makes it more valuable which is a good thing can be spent on other aspects of of growing the uniswap protocol um also of course this starts to create the first revenue stream like a real way to uh bolster a dal's treasury with actual revenue rather than just kind of their own token and so this is a positive thing that could be poured back into investments in the business uh and could be used to kind of expand the unit swap protocol so you can also see yeah i could also see like the other side of the business argument which is like we don't have to you know put up um transaction fees to to kind of maximum but why don't we start somewhere at some low fee just so we could start this process and be able to signal just a signal to the market yeah we're turning on a point zero zero zero one percent fee yeah exactly that would be enough so maybe just turn it on for some tools right just to prove that you can but i wanna give you sort of the counter the counter argument why you shouldn't do it uh so right now if you turn on the fees if like if you turn on fees for the entire protocol i think what what will happen is um i mean unisop anyone can sort of fork in and swap um and unisop doesn't really have sort of a network effect that goes beyond like one pool right so even if it's just one pool every single pool can be forked and sort of replicated in a cheaper way but i think you get to you can get to a point where that's not possible and that sort of it seems to me from outside view sort of what unisop is doing which is sort of vertical integration right unisop want to control a lot more layers of the trading stack than they do today um what could that mean and that so that could include like a wallet a custody solution an mev solution a margin solution and then once you have sort of all of these and they have all of these friction points together by having them all from from sort of one hand the unisop can become a lot harder to fork and so it can make sense to grow the pie until all of these layers exist and unisop is sort of a more vertical vertically integrated exchange slash wallet slash custody solution and then um you saw the protocol could still turn on the fields just sort of um with a much stronger lock in um so i think that would be the contact point that's so interesting and that's just also just so much more to build uh to your point and the question is like where does that building happen and how does that get funded right because it feels it seems to be the case that dow governance in its current state for something like uniswap is not sophisticated does not have the business processes does not have the management processes to pull something like that off that feels like a complicated multi-product sort of investment strategy that almost requires like a centralized brain an entity right and i know you know not to pick on uniswap this entire time but it is as i say kind of an archetype for all of yeah all of these dows really but like uniswap has a labs function as well which is somewhat interesting yeah and you just swapped okay so that is the brain for this thing and that is an organized entity and i guess unit swap labs i mean they they're most recently they uh acquired um an nft aggregation company right and so yeah genie right so is that is the idea that that becomes the brain but then all of the other stuff that you just kind of you talked about that um uniswap needs to build as part of its comprehensive strategy the value of all of those things where do they go it's not clear that the value flows back to the uni token maybe it goes to equity in uniswap labs this is very confusing to me and i think to everyone in the in the crypto space trying to figure out what's the value of these d5 protocols um yeah exactly so for one i think um you have unisop labs which feels like it's pursuing like a strategy like that yeah um but that doesn't mean that for example unisop dao couldn't also pursue a similar strategy and it it wouldn't even necessarily need to like it's it's only level is not the fee switch right the units of dao can also be run just like unisop labs like maybe it can become second pronged to your sublapse or maybe it can become something more like um like a headquarters right that where sort of you see unicef labs as one supplier to um sort of the units of ecosystem but then there can be um there can be other suppliers um and um for example you know dao could do uh like a token financing right they could sell tokens to the market and raise an actual treasury and then start to invest that in projects that they think will make the united stop protocol better and um maybe it is time for the unisop community to start taking over the dao and put in you know slowly put in place of governance processes in order to manage such an expansion if if they were to do that hassou i guess from a the comment on on governance sophistication it it doesn't feel like defy token governance is there yet to be able to have the sophistication that you just that you just mentioned right it feels like the most efficient way for capital to organize if you want kind of a central brain or decision make maker um like is still a entity a corporate entity that's read a business that's registered somewhere are you optimistic that dow governance can become a bit more businesslike and capital efficient and like what's the gap in order to to get there where we have a uniswap dao that is able to execute on a similar vision as an entity like uniswap labs uh yeah great question um i think i am i'm definitely optimistic um i think the the problems right now are being recognized in the space and a lot of dolls are suffering from the exact same problems and i think that all come to a similar conclusion um i mean some might come to a different conclusion but i'm not too optimistic about those and um i mean maybe it makes sense sort of to describe the status quo of you know most doubts most doubts tend to have um you know just kind of uh one token one vote voting schemes um where um anyone can make a proposal and then sometimes you have like um like attempt checks via snapshots so those are not civil resistant uh and then you tend to have sort of actual on-chain proposals uh where people can vote um and then stuff goes on chain and um i mean the reality is that the there isn't really any sort of management or kind of central brain that defines a vision for the project and a strategy to reach that vision and then um operates the the dao or the protocol like a business right sort of um you know looks at you know its balance sheet and sort of things what assets should we acquire what assets like should we build how should we invest our capital but also how should we finance ourselves right um like when should when should we raise our next funding round how do we make sure we manage our cash flows and these are all kind of this is like the actual sort of 101 there's like the first chapter in every business book but right now instead of these sort of most basic functions are not filled in those and i think the reason is that everybody looks to everybody else to do it um so and i think that gets us to what i think is like the first solution which is just i let's identify the positions in our dials that definitely need to be filled and then let's make sure that we fill them with you know a dedicated person or a group of people that we then hold accountable i i said in the beginning of the show it's not like crypto or defy or daos have broken through any sort of just like barrier of the economics we are following the laws of economics and we have as uh species refined what it means to run a business and like you capture value we've already know this is a known science uh and i think what's really missing from the dow space is like paying attention to that model and one of the reasons very like a very small but significant thing that happened is that the meme the name dao took over decentralized autonomous organization which if you take at that at face value does those three words the centralized autonomous organization really actually describe the organizations that are governing over defy apps and i would absolutely argue that no it's just like this accidental meme that got caught on and now it's what we call these things i've been a big proponent of dues instead of daos digital organizations rather than decentralized autonomous organizations because decentralized autonomous organizations were supposed to illustrate something like where there's code at the center and humans at the periphery which i would actually really argue is just what bitcoin and ethereum are those are the actual dows these like very robotic no governance you know uh humans at the at the output sending in like value to the center a bunch of algorithms do a bunch of things and then send it back out to the humans when there's humans at the center it turns it into something completely different it turns it into a digital organization which is basically a company an llc but not it's just on chain it's just the new web3 like crypto enabled versions of these organizations and like this name decentralized has worked its way into the culture of so many doubts uh do which are actually dues uh and now it's like oh we can't have processes or order or organization we can't have centralized leadership we can't have a centralized brain because it's a meme in this space that centralization is bad but it's the wrong form factor applied to the wrong organization it's really dues and dues need to have and follow the same laws of business and economics that we've refined as a species over the last thousand years and that's really the only way to in order to mimic that tried and true business strategy of growing an organization and capturing revenue and paying out employees and laborers and contributors is the thing that we need to optimize for it's really just a difference of who are these contributors how do they engage with the do and how does value flow more liquid and more easily throughout the do that is really the new paradigm that we need to optimize for uh hazard do you agree with all these all this stuff um it depends whether it's sort of it's a description of the status quo or whether you think that every organization should be run like you know like a corporation or not can you elaborate on that well that goes back to what we were saying where all orgs have to have a token and that token has to capture more value than any competitor token and that is the moat and so yes i would conclude that all daos must generally be run like a corporation it's just like the best ones are going to find and change the things like well there's like top down extremely hierarchical or like uh organizations in the web 2 tradify world and they don't need to be so hierarchical they don't need to be so um like uh vertical and and have such like a strong chain of command it can be more flat and that is a goal to aspire to but there still needs to be a path towards we must collect revenue there needs to be a central vision a central goal which leadership directs the rest of the organization towards and then everyone else needs to be just like worker bees that achieve those that means to the end yeah so i think it sort of inspires the question you know why are the dows that we see so flat and i mean maybe a small part of the answer is that um especially some of the early crypto believers they you know just uh see centralization as something bad and that they want to avoid and so they really believe in the power of flat organizations but i would argue that for um you know the bigger part of the d5 founders is more that you know they are really worried about regulation um and and really we're talking like different kinds of regulation here so securities regulation um so if you drive value to your token um you know it might be a security if you run like a hierarchical organization it might be you know reliance on the managerial efforts of others might be a security if you market it um to like the general public um or even perform like a public sale might be security and then you get into like okay so money laundering you know tax evasion and the case of like make a doll etc you also get into like banking regulation and so that's where kind of um the the the a endowell also comes from um which is so um so lex lexnode wrote an article about this a couple months ago and he he called it how i think the article is called something like how you can discern like fake doubts from realdolls and and he gave a good i thought a good definition of what you know the three letters in in the dao stanford and the a for him uh so that autonomous for him was a another word for sovereign meaning that it's an organization that doesn't you know have to that isn't basically subject to any of these rules it plays by its own rules it's a sovereign player on the global stage and um yeah it's in order to do that you probably need a different kind of organization one that actually has very few levels to pull or that is you know credibly decentralized whatever that means so um i think the challenge that we see i mean either in the over the next years we are going to see more regulatory clarity and i don't just mean um sort of regulator saying that you know the duals don't apply to d5 tokens which if that happened that would be good but um probably unlikely so what's more likely is that there even is a path to get regulated if you want to but it's in like in the financial realm it's extremely hard to you know acquire um you know the necessary licenses to do any business uh to begin with um so i think what's more likely is that sort of we see a path between sort of regulatory like leniency but also sort of making it easier to get you know the the the necessary licenses and up to that point i think the alternative is really to build organizations that are more decentralized um than than a corporation but that um sort of still capture some of the same benefits of sort of a more traditional organizational design um yeah and what that what what which you know those might be i think we already touched on some right i think you need um i mean you definitely need um sort of some degree of hierarchy um i think maybe it doesn't maybe hierarchy is kind of the wrong word but you have these different roles that need to be filled and i think what you can do is you can't rely on just random people from your dao to do it um you have to say this is the exact role or the test that needs to be done and um you know anyone can sort of make a bid for that uh but then sort of once you get the job and you do get paid like uh we want to see an output from you and we're holding you accountable to that to that output um so yeah something something i don't know if this word resonates with you hasu but structure comes to mind not hierarchy but structure we just need some structure in these organizations that's much better yeah i agree and i definitely want to put a pin on governance minimization as a competitive design structure especially when it comes to regulation and also talk about a little bit more dow design structure i want to put a pin on these things but there's a rabbit hole i want to quickly go down small small rabbit hole that is about the interaction between regulation and dow governance and this has to do with the conversation of yield farming and how a lot of dao's a lot of leaders uh you know before there was a token the the the the leaders behind the project they come to make a protocol then they release their token and then they aggressively yield farm it out into you know the space um because of regulation kazu can you walk us through like the incentives as to why this was done so much in the last year and like what are the perils of this what's the negative outcome of this yeah so i think if you approach this from you know the mindset of a traditional investor or company builder then usually um so what they do is kind of it's called equity financing where you just issue tokens and um usually you do it to raise money in order to you know finance your operation and expansion and growth um but sort of the way and it can mean also like raising money from investors and then using that money to pay you know large scale incentive programs like the ones we touched on earlier where you sort of subsidize your entire business like uber subsidizing uh sort of every right that's that's taking place it's it's basically sort of yield farming with an extra step right um uh so however um the way that it's done in divi you know it just sort of it looks extremely you know broad and you know really large scale and really unfocused and and sort of unstructured and as a traditional investor you kind of scratch your head about you know why it's done in this way um especially when you compare it to a traditional company where um so usually um let's say sort of a private company says 10 um you know if it's cap table every round um and then raise money for it and puts that into sort of growth and incentives whereas here we have um projects that give away 80 90 of their cap table in a sense um to uh investors and not investors but sort of they don't even get any money for it all they get is sort of um usage of the protocol um and yeah i think we touched on one reason why um they are doing this they don't do it because they think it maximizes for growth they do it because they think it maximizes for decentralization they just wanna you know get rid of the token and the control of the project as soon as possible in order to say that um this project is now decentralized like don't look at us dear regulator because we are not in charge i mean look we only control 10 of the voting power like this is this is uh we are not pulling the strings here and not making the decisions and also more uh insidiously it pays for liquidity which towards the end of this bull market it allowed the founders to you know like oh yes let's yield farm get rid of our own control and also give us an exit because we only want to be around for six months because that's like how much this bull market has left in it and now we're out and like we've made this protocol and now like all these yield farmers govern over it not us and they got they got to exit and so like no one in the traditional startup space has like a six months like exit plan like that companies don't last for six months like you don't you don't want to have a six-month roadmap for the founders the founders need to be locked in for a long long time they need to be tied to the protocol for for years um how would you how would you ask for this dynamic to be fixed when it comes to like founder alignment with the protocol yeah i mean optimally you do have sort of long vesting schedules for founders in d5 as well but there are definitely some contact samples that you're probably thinking of where sort of this may not always be the case um but i think you're you're sort of pointing towards um a bigger problem which is that um you know just companies in crypto are not companies but that protocols in crypto did just if we sort of stretch the analogy here more to the traditional company then they just tend to go public extremely early and like a traditional company might stay private for many years and only sell shares to accredited investors but then you have sort of a crypto company that you know it's extremely early uh and they already issued tokens to the public and maybe do a public sale and this definitely creates adverse incentives um i mean for one it sort of subjects the the protocol to sort of the short-term whims of the market uh unlike sort of a private company where so the founders can just you know build in peace and sort of race from investors we have a long time horizon um but sort of more importantly it gives these founders exit liquidity and it creates this i mean especially in a market where you know tokens are in such high demand um when really like what we're selling here is kind of stories that you know a particular project might you know make it big in the future then yeah it does indeed create this incentive for um you know protocols uh to emerge that really put sort of that have the the token as the actual product um and are sort of all built around that and i think especially sort of in uh last year in what we uh uh what we saw later as like d5 2.0 i think uh that entire class of projects uh i think fits uh fits the example here of sort of um the token being the actual product very short vesting schedules uh etc so um i think these primarily existed yeah unfortunately to enrich their founders and uh the earliest investors the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we

the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and fiction free do you know um what's interesting about this conversation is i i feel like all roads lead to the same destination which is um defy has a regulatory issue here we don't have the regulatory clarity um it's like why are d5 pro tokens broken because we can't do so many of the things we want to do because we don't have regulatory clarity uh as as you were talking as soon as you guys were talking uh you know i cooked up this meme you know it's like i really feel like it's the case like the world if we had regulatory clarity in defy would be so much better and what i'm showing is like a picture of you know the classic beam template of a future world and everything's amazing and everything's futuristic it feels like there's so much more we could do in crypto and in d5 if we had this bridge to regulatory you know so often i think in crypto we talk about scale scalability sort of one-dimensionally you know transactions per second for instance or even if you broaden it you might say the market cap of crypto assets is a dimension of scalability or you might say user experiences scalability but i also think that regulatory bridges are an element of scalability that we need and we are kind of like growing and defy in this strange way because of like let's be honest there's some regulatory arbitrage here right we've had to sort of grow in this way and the only thing that regulators will uh really allow or have clarified that they will allow it seems is the a in for autonomous in decentralized autonomous organizations so we've kind of constrained the design path for these d5 protocols so that we're maximizing decentralization but the truth is some protocols and some projects need much more structure than complete decentralization will will provide and so i i guess this is a scalability limiter on uh defy and on our industry i i don't think it's insurmountable by any stretch of the imagination i think as the unit swaps of the world and the d5 protocols of the world prove their value we will earn more regulatory legitimacy but it feels like that is the mismatch here are are you seeing this as as kind of the common theme across all your research for you know why some of these things are broken why some of the governance could be improved like we know what we need to do with dials like there is a recipe book for creating a um structure for companies and we could get we could pay for the best uh managers and like people in the world who are fantastic at this but we're not allowed to create this structure because of regulatory concerns are you seeing this you know i actually kind of have two thesis here that are that go back to sort of what you said about this um regulation um and i think one is one one it's kind of the thesis why i think that regulation is not going to improve anytime soon and it goes back to um it goes back to this article that i wrote or already many years ago just called um independent property rights and sort of how bitcoin back in the day sort of is this this new property layer and i think you can really think this further for defy like blockchains in general are kind of um you know proper sort of property or like systems to enforce uh sort of property or promises between people right and and the financial system and there's like a really cool article that we can link for your listeners it's called the market for promises by anthony lee zhang and sort of he he makes the case that sort of financial assets are really just you know promises between people like whether that means like you know equity i get a share in your business in the future and like a claim on your dividends or you know debt i get sort of claim on you know repayment of the principle plus uh you know interest or whether it means sort of more complicated structures like derivatives on sort of uh you know stock market indices or you know futures options all of these kind of delivery products and um there is a big reason why sort of financial markets are so strong in the west and so weak everywhere else which is that you know markets four promises uh depend on the uh like lower layers sort of that can enforce actually these promises especially under very adverse conditions and core systems yes exactly and this goes back to like uh um sort of strong property rights and the strong independent legal system um and so yeah markets for promises have have been traditionally sort of been one of the core things that you know nation states and and governments in the west uh are providing um and this sort of locks a lot of uh you know both people but also companies especially companies you know into their respective domains and so i think this like i think there is a case here for why the western nations will fight very hard for domain over these market for promises let me let me make sure i understand that case so this is the bad case i'm hopeful you also have a good case right so we'll get to that in a second but like it's not just so if you read that if you read the article for by anthony he he it's actually a bull case for him because what he's saying is that um the western the the west will shut down you know shut itself out of this innovation but um especially everywhere else in the world where sort of you have very weak uh property rights and legal systems that's where there's much stronger demand for an independent market for promises that uh especially companies can tap into and that's that that's like a real case of how defy can bridge to the real world maybe much faster than currently anyone is expecting and he's saying he could imagine sort of a wild west for financial innovation you know emerging in sort of southeast asia and africa [Music] and all of these sort of or in south america and all of these places that that sort of um are sort of not really served right now by you know the capital markets of the west and so it's actually sort of a mix between like a bear and a bull case but i really love this as uh you know an explanation of sort of why def like why do we defy right um and it's kind of that um you can't have markets for for promises without a strong enforcement system for these promises and um without without effective markets for promises our economy would be uh you know one percent the size i'm like really convinced of that because like our economy is so financialized and financialization like empowers the economy so much that like if you have this you can really like supercharge your economy so i think that's that's definitely a sort of one one case and then i i i just i i just want to comment on that kid so so first of all i think uh dave and i um bankless the bankless thesis 100 believes that these are systems that are about property rights at the core there's a big you don't call it the bankless nation for nothing you know like um money is just a another form of property of course right and that's what these ledgers are they're ledgers for digital property rights um but just to kind of echo and make sure i understand what you're saying so um it's it's basically the it's a bear case for if you live in the west maybe or if you are a western government government the bear case is the west won't accept it and i think it's because you were saying they believe they already have a system and this upstart competitor is kind of infringing on their territory and so they're not going to embrace it you know best case scenario you get sort of like a shrugging the shoulders ignoring it uh and like maybe it it ekes itself into a few niches here or there and that's that's maybe the west reaction or the the uh countries with sophisticated financial markets and property rights system but the bookcase on the flip side of that is uh in emerging markets where there really is not a sophisticated property rights system uh in place they will be very quick to embrace these technologies and that's great news for emerging markets because they will be able to leapfrog like the west you know it's kind of similar we've seen this play on technology in the past where um you know everyone kind of skipped the emerging markets you kind of skipped the the pc and the laptop and you went straight to smartphones uh and they're the kind of computers and they you know built out the telecom networks to support that so it's that's sort of the argument penetration is like much higher in africa and india than than like in central europe and uh yeah so is it is it the tone is it the tone that the west will feel like kind of or the west like countries with sophisticated property rights system they'll feel threatened by this technology and so they'll never really want to embrace it they'll be dragged into it kicking and screaming is that the case that you're making i yeah i think i think it's possible yeah okay what's the second case then the second case would be that regulation can actually be a bull case for d5 um and this is kind of one that i i've been giving for for years also with regards to sort of bitcoin in the past um because regulation can also serve you know d5 projects uh to protect them from incumbents but if there's actually something that defy projects can offer you know in spite of regulation that incumbents can then that's a big competitive benefit um for example they can offer banking services without a banking license they can you know not pay taxes uh and stuff bankless services if you will yeah yeah exactly so um yeah and um so i think you see this i'm not sure if like the banking sector is sort of a good example for this but in general sort of the the history of regulation is very often you have sort of incumbents pushing the government to add more regulation in order to create barriers um for new that make it harder for new entrants to come into the market and compete with them so they kind of do this to protect that turf but then when someone comes into the market anyway for example as was the case with you know uber and lyft versus the taxi medallions then all of a sudden you see that the regulation actually works against the incumbent and it makes it harder for them to compete against um sort of the the new entrant and then all of a sudden you'll see the incumbent um asking the government to please deregulate so they can you know compete again um and um yeah so i think something like that is also possible where if we actually managed to find or create you know uh working d5 protocols that can scale and that are supported by you know actually decentralized but nonetheless effective organizations then uh it means that you probably like these projects probably have a lot of advantages that their regulated counterparts do not have i i love this example i think we're actually seeing this this play out and it strikes me that um both kind of your vision one and your vision two could both be at play at the same time it could be like some combination of these two visions but i want to ask you about the point of like one uh incumbent reaction you mentioned is the incumbents go to regulators and they say we're too regulated please deregulate us the the other reaction incumbents might have and you know we might be seeing some of this already is incumbents might point to the d5 protocols and they might say this isn't fair you better go regulate them right like we have sarbanes we have like 10k rep we have all of these things they don't so you better go get them out of here or regulate them in the same way that we are regulated do you think that's a possible incumbent reaction oh yeah oh yeah 100 i think i think that's probably already happening yeah i mean for example i i think definitely um uh like stable coin issues are effectively shadow banks right they're they're sort of issuing their own euro dollars um and uh what what you i think what you will ex what you will and so if like tether and circle et cetera keep growing like that then you would probably see um you know incumbent banks that actually have banking licenses and so on they will you know push for you know these competitors to be regulated because of course um it's bad for the banks if someone can offer banking services without banking licenses so i i just want to you know zoom out because this um i guess worry uh from critics or people in this in the space about crypto has been present with crypto and bitcoin since the early beginnings which is basically the worry of the government is going to not allow this they are going to regulate this thing that you're trying to do out of existence they said that in the early days with with bitcoin like you can't create a decentralized money what are you talking about like governments around the world have thrown people in jail when they've tried to create monies in the past and yet bitcoin is still legal here in you know 2022 and it is um like more more saturated and more part of of mainstream uh than ever so at some level this um this problem has been with us with with us forever and yet crypto has survived and crypto has kind of infiltrated in all of these various ways i'm wondering if you think that um the basic argument of game theory is is kind of at play here in that if you are a regulatory friendly uh cr crypto regulatory friendly jurisdiction you're going to attract uh more productive citizens uh more jobs um like more economic benefits from a friendlier posture to crypto than an anti-crypto posture and so as a country as a regular uh regulatory apparatus you will be slowly forced to embrace crypto for game theory reasons because because you can't let europe if you're the us have the advantage or um if you're china you can't have the let the u.s have an advantage you can't let emerging markets uh leapfrog you this has always been sort of my hopeful um response when people say no the government's going to regulate the stuff you're trying to do out of existence the response has always been no the game theory won't let them because this technology is so productive so useful that they'll they'll be forced to adopt it in the same way that countries were forced to adopt the internet what do you think of this uh argument yeah i think this argument has been in play um for a long time i think there's definitely some merit to it i think it applies more to smaller countries that have sort of more to gain than to lose and i think like it's it's not really like unexpected that we see sort of these smaller countries making moves on you know crypto regulation and also you know buying crypto um etc um so far uh i can't really point to you know an example where it really sort of worked out for them in a major way um but it's the like of course it's really early right so um i think definitely one place where we shouldn't expect it is maybe in sort of um i think in europe it's much harder and in the u.s it's much harder why because i mean these have much more to lose right so they they have sort of the incumbent currency sees china as well um so um in like the context of sort of layer one crypto i think for them um you know it it just makes much more sense to to ban it than to support it but if you don't have sort of a reserve currency then i think it's much more you know for you it may not really matter like if it's like the dollar or the euro or the yen or you know some cryptocurrency so i think you're much more open to you know whatever option and you are you're more interested in you know attracting capital attracting young people etc so i would say this argument um of like um yeah it's kind of a in a sense it's like a tragedy of the comments right from the perspective of sort of the the protectors of the existing system where like there's always the incentive for some nations to defect and you know check these resources um and sort of that that's i think what we've seen and that's what i would you know continue expect you know us to continue to see so we've talked a lot about regulation and the what we want to see out of the regulatory world that would enable daos to be their best dow be their best version of themselves but i think if we flip things around and we put ourselves in the shoes of a regulator we would also ask for dows for the same thing which would be clarity uh and there's that's one thing that dao's don't really have to offer right now dows are so chaotic they're so undefined they need more clarity uh like regulators would love to be able to appear inside of a dow and see what's going on in there and maybe maybe that's where we can meet in the middle and what i mean by this is that you know we've talked about the the need of structure and organization inside of dao's bahasa you've been a big proponent of dao constitutions as in setting a vision for a dao and having this like central north star piece of literature that allows for a dow to organize around itself and i think this can start to solve some both internal problems to the dao where dals don't have their own internal vision for what they are they don't have their own internal identity but also it's this thing this constitution this document that we can take uh externally and show the world like not only do we know who we are but we can tell you the world who we are too can you talk about the role and importance of having like a constitution for a dow yeah i but before i do that i want to actually pick up on something that you said like right before which i think is really interesting which is that i'm not even i'm not sure about you um but for me i'm not like do you feel that sort of talking holders in a dao right now are more protected than you know equity holders in a company in the west no no because of what the hell is a doubt it's the same thing like i don't know i don't know what it is exactly so i think like personally i feel like it's like it doesn't even feel good to say you know dolls shouldn't be regulated or like people should buy dow tokens it does doesn't feel good to me because when i look at uh when i look at corporate governance you know every so the way it works basically is every country has sort of a list of rules for corporate governance these are sort of you know best practices that all companies that are listed in the public markets have to follow and there's a lot of good stuff in there one is that the company should be run um you know to the benefit of the shareholder and then there's one that sort of all stakeholders of the company that's like suppliers employees um customers etc they should all be you know considered in the decision making one is about the protection of minority shareholders um and one is about accountability of the management to the hook to the owners of the company and sort of that the the owners get to elect the board and then the board gets select you know a ceo and fire them so you have like really clearly defined sort of structures of accountability and so on and and also sort of a big one is about disclosure right so um what who is supposed to have what information like um the managers and board members like do they need to um what do they need to disclose for example as a as a manager you're not allowed to trade uh you know the stock of your own company stuff like that right and if i look at dows i just don't see any of the same protections and that just makes me feel really bad about investing in daos and i think if we create i think so the biggest thing that we need to do is like first of all we need to get like level with um you know the shareholder protections that exist in the traditional financial system um because in theory we have all the tools to do it right i mean in theory we are operating in theory like decentralized organizations should serve to protect sure held us better but in practice they do it worse in theory they should be like more resistant to entrenchment and insider dealing um but in practice they are not at all in in theory there should be sort of harder to change and you know trust this but in practice they are not and so yeah i see i see all of these problems right now and i i think we need to like really start to uh you know look at um you know corporate governance best practices not because we want to turn dows into corporations but we cheat but because sort of corporate governance is fundamentally about solving principal agent problems uh sort of between minority and majority shareholders between owners and managers between like it's like there's so much good resource right it's a science that they have perfected and we would be uh the hubris of dows to think that that is just like invalid and not relevant to them is off the charts but but do you know what as as you guys are talking about this um you know what i find that so i will i completely agree that um the investor rights investor protections of doubt tokens suck they're inferior to holding u.s stock like they totally are but you know what is better than us stock is like the underlying crypto rails of an erc20 right like that my apple stock is stuck in etrade account somewhere and i can't do jack with it right whereas like in this programmable defy world my goodness how many opportu like you could do all sorts of things with an erc20 token um unlock like certain pages like discord access vote in different ways uh lock it as collateral another protocol trade it anywhere in the world all you need is an internet connection withdraw anytime like it's really that's the value proposition of the thing is the token that's on these new digital rails that are open permissionless and program it's almost like we've built a better banking system but we haven't built a better uh investor rights um asset yet 100 yeah so we can point to all of these things that are sort of worse for shareholders right now but we can also point to a lot of things that are better than traditional markets right i mean so crypto d5 projects they get access to if they if they want to race from like public market like public markets they get to tap into you know very liquid sort of funding markets they get to attract customers from all over the world without like having to acquire all of these regulations and so on um you know they can be non-custodial um they can be extremely cheap to build i think that's sort of one of the biggest like the to market in d5 and sort of the the the speed with which you can iterate on your product is just insanely fast i was talking to a d5 founder the other day and and he said um hustle like we built this like they have a they have like a mainnet protocol out that they built um on less than a million dollars in funding um and it's it now has over like 100 million tdi um and making revenue already and i mean so they built this in like one year on less than a million dollars which is insane and so um you in theory sort of all of the promises of d5 they are holding right it's it's like not the entire stack is broken like some parts of the stack are extremely promising um it's just that sort of the organizational part and sort of the uh you know the alignment between the the shareholder and sort so the operators and and so the the shareholder protections i think that is something that we need to focus on next um and really look how we can address it and i think that's what brings us back around to um you know what you were originally asking uh about with the constitution yeah tell us about that then um yeah so i think the governance design space i think i mean there are some there are like a lot of ways you can approach this right so you can have i mean uh of course it's best if you have a protocol that sort of you put it out there and it's set in stone it's like almost like an nft right almost like bitcoin uh it's funny how like the bitcoin protocol is also almost like an nft in the sense that it has barely been improved after the original launch and so you can really not say that there's any expectation you know that the value of bitcoin sort of depends on you know the managerial effort or of anything clearly not a security gary gensler okay yeah yeah exactly um and so um but unfortunately like if you can have that i mean that's that's great but it's also extremely hard and i think most uh you know d5 protocols are not going to fall into this category um we are seeing some experiments that are maybe like worth pointing out so i think rye is kind of very uh you know governance minimize and then liquidity is somewhere sort of in the middle and so it's not like there are projects kind of experimenting with how they can minimize the need to govern um but then there are also others where you know uh just decisions need to be made in order for um you know this this thing to work uh for example looking at rv or compound they need to um you know tune interest rate curves they need to decide what collateral to add and you know all kinds of parameters they need to decide how to you know expand especially now that the d5 world is getting more and more fragmented they need to like decide how they want to expand across you know um to other d5 chains and how they want to like set the the debt limits how they communicate across chains there's like so many technological and organizational problems that they need to address also like how to set incentives um really like it's it's like a lot of a lot of things that if you want these to be successful then it's just like it's a big complicated problem that you have to sort and so the question is then if you don't have the luxury of having you know a protocol that doesn't need any governance how can you do it in a way that is not strictly hierarchical that is not centralized basically you don't just put a traditional corporation in place to manage and run this protocol um and so i think it goes back to like this one keyword that we had which is structure right if you need um if you need a group of people to organize uh or to to sort of um you know make decisions then you know at the very least you you know you want it to be like less chaotic than it is right now i think um that's where this idea of um of sort of a constitution comes from so we said okay let's put as much sort of encode as possible and make it like immutable but what if we what about things where you know we can't do that uh because it's not code because it's let's say it's like the vision for our protocol and it changes like once a year or once every other year or whatever um or what what if it's about sort of the relationships or like the rights um and responsibilities of different actors in the system i think this is stuff that you would that you can put into a constitution and then the constitution says okay this is all the stuff that we can't put in code here's the vision for what this protocol is supposed to do defines here these five groups of shareholders and they have these rights and responsibilities um and yeah these if possible should never change and if you do change them then at least you know um you can't just change them on like a higher layer then you need to actually go back and sort of deal with the constitution itself and say hey i'm making a proposal to change the constitution i think you know this and that should change or be amended and um and you can and this can for example require like a lot higher uh buy-in and like the decision for that needs to be sort of a lot more um i need to have a lot more consensus than for example it's something that happens like on a layer like way higher on the stack so this is like an organizational operating system basically social code right yeah create a great point and this is something i've actually spent a lot of time uh thinking about and i don't really think that this actually stops at a highest level constitution uh dao's blockchains themselves operate kind of i think they will operate like a court system where and we also still need to talk about in this episode uh token voting and the broken nature of token voting um but i think the the token vote the global dow the global dow token vote really only needs to come to vote uh collectively as a dow when it comes to change the constitution as in like the i some some part of the dao is going to propose that we're going to change the constitution of the down this particular way that triggers off a global token vote but as there are sub-constitutions because there's going to be sub-dows we've already seen ave synthetics bankless dao break off into sub-dials because of you know modularity is just a a strong design structure and is efficient when it comes to dow organization and so like say you have like the you know the metadow maker dow right and like maker doubts got the core units uh but then you have like the growth core unit of maker dao and they can have their own constitution for the growth core unit about what the growth core unit does and that's a constitution that only the growth core unit votes on not the rest of the dow only that growth core unit and like maybe the growth core unit fractures off into three more sub dials that are just you know teams just like work work streams and they have their own micro sub constitution and they decide and that's just like what they are deciding to do as a micro sub dial in q3 2022 and so what this turns into is like a tree structure which is basically like a github repository it's like this fractal tree structure that grows into and creates a modular dow that has every part of it being defined by a piece of literature a a vision a roadmap that allows this organization to be highly scalable and this is the this not just like the meta constitution for the dao as a whole but also the sub dials and the micro sub dials each also get to concretely show the world this is what we do and it works like github it's like we merge this into our local constitution which gets merged up into the greater constitution which emulates the goddamn united states of america again a tried and true science that we already know about to this day so so get i guess david let's go also what you just described to me is just like it this is corporate governance man right so replace sub dials for like business unit or uh department area and replace kind of like the sub teams you were talking about to like different areas of responsibility and incorporation replace token vote with a shareholder proxy vote of some sort with delegates right i mean i mean we're kind of like back people like these things i'm sorry ryan have we said the line we are speed running the the history of human coordination enough on this podcast before i just think somebody somebody with some um organizational um structuring experience is gonna is gonna come to this podcast and be like uh yeah that's how you do it what do you think it took you 12 years to figure this out what do you think of this hazu yeah you should have professor andy hall on the podcast i think you think he would be a tremendous guest too to rif on the subject with yeah is he a he's an uh kind of an org structure specialist exactly yeah he he's he's been making some contribution some articles to um to make a dao and recently he published something for uh a16z um yeah he's like of the opinion that we need um that sort of um dao is uh sort of we need to get to like the representative democracy stage so this is something we haven't touched on yet right which is kind of um owners making decisions versus sort of their elected agents making decisions on their behalf um and then you want probably i think i think what this basically does is if you look at dollars today then um you just see sort of huge voter empathy right so you see like five percent uh uh five percent of like the the voters the votes participating in every vote and what this means is of course sort of the most motivated like if there's one motivated way they can push through almost any proposal in daos and this is like part of what's create what creates this you know big problem for uh minority shareholders and dows which is that if you're aware then you can do whatever you want um and oftentimes sort of they have different incentives than you know shareholder that's like a smaller size right um and so what we really need to do is we need to you know get if participation up in these votes and i think it's much easier to do if you sort of reduce the mental overhead and the decision for governance participants to okay let me vote like let me sort of elect a person who i think like really represents what i think this tao should do versus let me vote on you know all of these all of these 10 proposals that go live every week um so the mental overhead for um you know the law is extremely high whereas the mental over the former is very low and so um and then sort of your your um your delegates they can be you know this can be sort of full-time you know salaried roads i think we are this is something that we are now seeing in dallas which is it's a step in the right direction because it allows specialization uh in decision making um and it allows like consistency also among who the decision makers actually are um but yeah i think this is only this is only the the starting point for i think a lot of the innovation that has to happen in our governance certainly and uh i read your i believe a proposal for for maker dell which is kind of outlined the structure that you think maker down needs to go in and this is where this like constitution idea came into my head and you said like maker dao doesn't have a aligned vision there are competing visions for what maker dao is some people think it's a public good some people think it's a decentral bank you know some people wanted to do real world assets some people want it to be ether only and this lack of vision means that like different parts of the dao are having this tug of war against each other trying to pull maker dao in this different direction and just from a raw energy perspective when there's a internal tug of war pulling one thing in two different directions that is you know you're going nowhere because you're tugging against each other but if you can get everyone to point in the same direction and then tug that goes from a tug of war to progress and and this when we talk about why we need how to fix defy tokens when we turn our energy which is you know tugging one rope against our own teammates and that rope's not going anywhere and we reorient it to we tug the organization going in the correct direction like the current state of dow governance is a big hole that we need to plug i don't know if you've ever like crunched any numbers or done any napkin math hazu as to like how costly dow governance is um but i would imagine that it's one of the biggest expenditures that dao's have as an organization is that we need like global token votes on like who who's going to have what for breakfast on that morning and that is just that's costly that's expensive and that ends up as cell pressure in the secondary markets have you have you done any sort of like analysis or have any thoughts on this i mean that's sort of the the actual cost the tangible cost so mega doll spends like i don't know it has like uh it spends it pays two million dollars i think right now a year on you know paying delegates and then that's of course all of this the cost of on-chain voting um but then there's all of this time that's being put in by by all of the participants playing these governance games right and i think so the biggest problem that i see is that sort of people who are good politicians they you know sort of are much better at playing these games right um i i see people who have like a very good strategic mind to understand very good sort of what the the the the business model of maker should be but maybe they are not the best communicators maybe they are not the most popular and i think so one good way that um for example um representative democracies in the west have found with this is that there are uh elected parties and then they get sort of if you vote for them they go in power um but then you also have full-time employees uh that work for the government all the time and they don't need to be elected right they are actually um put in place on merit and not on popularity um and so i think that dao's um they kind of need both right i think um there's right now i mean very clearly there's way too much voting um and so this covers so the tangible course but also this huge field of like opportunity cost like because we don't actually know where we're going we don't have a coherent vision instead we are voting on every kind of micro management decision although if we ever sat down and put our strategy in place in our vision that a lot of these decisions would actually derive automatically from them and so one big theme for me personally uh in governance and with all of the projects that i work with is sort of don't have governance over decisions have governance over processes and then sort of decisions should derive from processes and the processes themselves they can be updated much less regularly so hazu let's uh summarize this and and turn this into some action items for all the dao governors out there that are listening to this who are now inspired like oh i need i know what i need to do to make my dow work uh wha what are the simplest lowest hanging fruits that all daos need to consider and engage in uh with that they should tackle first and then after that like where should they go after that just what are the action items here let's see okay so a big one is um you know treat your doubt like a business that doesn't mean treated like a corporation but you know think of it as like think of your dow as having a balance sheet and you know needing to manage its liquidity and its cash flow and needing your doubt to make money right maybe not today but you should have a plan how you want to grow it and how you want to make money in the future because otherwise like raising money from people if you don't have a plan on making money for them in the future i think that's unethical and that's not you know actually good for crypto and then number two would be uh i think need more structure in daos i think we need governance over processes and not over decisions so i think the constitution would be great for every dao like let's just eliminate discussion about 90 of things um and you know just focus on it's painful to do a constitution once and like agree on it but once you have it then all of a sudden everything else becomes much more streamlined and much more productive because now you talk about okay how can we do thing x and not all of the time should we do x y or z and i get every sort of um decision point sort of these fundamentals debate the fundamental debates pop up again um and so yeah i think i think more structure is good i think um you want to have like small committees i think if you want if you want thing x to be done then what the dow should do is should say uh like is task x and like let's put like a committee of these five people in place and they don't even need to be employees of the dow necessarily right they can be like one executive of the dao and like other external people um basically specialists and whatever that thing that needs to be done is and then you know they get a clear scope and um you know they get the thing done um and i don't i don't think that this really like constitutes sort of centralization right it's really just like a decentralized group of people coming together and saying we need to do thing x and here like five experts who are gonna pay and they are gonna do it and if they did the job then we release the money and i think that's kind of this kind of um you know does making high level like debating about vision and strategy and like making high level uh investment allocation decisions i think that scales much more than what we see today where uh sort of a lot of small uh decisions are also kicked to um two token holders uh so hassu as we start to close this out we we've talked about um so much you know so many things that um need to be built really and this kind of reminds me of you know it's only in the bear market we started like peeling these layers back and talking about this deeply and thinking about it um i think your post your excellent post from earlier this year about dow treasuries somewhat fell on deaf ears because people were like hey it's the bull market like don't be gloomy hasu now people are paying more attention and it's clear we have we have so much work to do um can you give me the case for why we should be optimistic about defy and tokens and and do you believe we actually should what what are the reasons maybe for optimism and and why are you spending your uh your time here why why are you spending your career here right now i'm extremely optimistic about you know define public blockchains over a longer time frame because i think they offer um you know assist like a trust machine or a system for sort of the enforcement of contracts and promises that are outside of the traditional financial system uh the traditional legal system and they are not dependent on any nation states and i mean much like the early internet i think it's still it's not super clear like what is going to be built on top of this and how like how it's going to change the world but i just have this feeling that um it's going to unlock a lot of innovation and will i will unlock like markets that are more global than ever before and that have um that sort of everybody can access um and that are really sort of uh you know they will create much more equity and equality in the world and um where where everybody can participate so that would be my hope i think um as for the d5 um projects i think that um we need more innovation in the field of dow governance i think we need to look at corporate governance not because we want to copy um you know all of it one to one and just you know basically create a corporation and put a dow label on top i think that's not what we should do but corporate governance is an extremely rich field that has done a lot of research on principal agent problems in human organization and how to get things done and um and so i think uh over the next year i would really love to see um sort of more experimentation with our governance structures and and really by uh by the end of then 2023 i think we'll hopefully have a lot of positive examples to point to for dows that you know really do it better and that are both sort of great business but also a great investment cases yeah so on on that on defy tokens endowed tokens as an investable asset class what would flip you to being more bullish on those as assets what things would need to happen um well i think for one if there's like more regulatory clarity i think that's big i mean either because we know it's okay or we know that you know um there's no enforcement sort of happening um but what would make me even more bullish is sort of if we just solve our own problems so we find governance structures that are more streamlined and more efficient and that give just overall more uh power to shareholders and not in the sense that you know we have them vote on more things because i think that's the exact opposite of what of what should be happening uh i think we need i think i think more dows need to be run like businesses and i think that should give um you know investors the confidence that um you know the thing that they buy uh you know there are other uh investors and you know uh and workers etc um who will try to you know maximize the value of that investment fantastic kasu thank you for uh guiding us through all this this has been a fascinating discussion i think exactly what um what crypto needs right now so i appreciate all your work in this area and for joining us on bank list today no thank you guys some action items for you i'm just going to recap what hassu said if you are a dow governor a few things you can do number one create a constitution think about that number two treat your dow like a business number three focus more on structure govern over decision decision processes not the decisions themselves number four break up into some uh the projects into smaller units those are some low-hanging fruit areas that we could do of course a lot more on the dao structure dow governance side needs to be built out a few other action items for you they'll be in the show notes but um hassu listed a number of resources some articles today one by gabriel shapiro fake dao vs real dolls another the anthony li zhang article the market for promises will also include links to hasu's recent maker governance post which gets you an idea of what the constitution a dao constitution might look like and of course uh if you are not a bankless premium member david and i want to cordially invite you to become one because you can join the debrief episode that david and i are recording right after this episode debrief is an opportunity for david and i to give our reflections on the episode it's just kind of unscripted canon we

won't be happening in this particular episode but sometimes that's where we get spicy about the guests uh nothing has nothing about you this episode was fantastic but sometimes uh we have to unpack what the guest uh what we disagreed with a guest on um but uh i don't think there was a single word that came out of hazu's mouth that we disagreed on uh so david you're supposed to hype it up man there's definitely gonna be some disagreements with you has you in the debrief you have to become a premium member if you want to hear those that's usually for when we host all layer one uh panels and stuff like this there you go guys this has been super exceptional i think this episode is gonna go down as the canonical episode that dal's need to follow in order to build our way out of the bear market because that's really what this episode is for uh this bear market isn't just going to immaculately end just like the last bear market didn't immaculately end we are going to build our way out
