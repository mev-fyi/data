welcome to layer zero lyrics here is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed by people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because the theorem is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer zero i'm talking to my friend julia and julia works at orca protocol and i without expecting it get what's called i guess orca pilt during the show as we talk about things like dow governance and dao structure and where daos are currently and where they are going to be now i don't know if i'm behind the curve on this conversation or ahead of the curve on this conversation but i think we just created a new meme on this podcast called the modular dao daos being in their current form monolithic dallas just like how blockchains all started modul monolithic uh and some or blockchains have then progressed into becoming modular and modular dow modular blockchains becoming the new frontier level of crypto cryptoeconomic research i think daos are in that same state where every single dow right now is monolithic as in there's token weighted governance governing over every single decision and it's causing apathy it's you can't the dow can't go in all directions at once and so some dowels are on the t uh are flirting with the frontier of monolithic dowel structure and that's really what orca protocol is or julia works at orca uh and they are pioneering on chain compartmentalization of dowels to have more like what they call pods but like sub-dials or like an org chart of dowels for for if you will and so we talk about the current state of dows and their problems we talk about uh organizational history both in tradify traditional institution org chart and how that came about but also its flaws we talked about the united states of america as the original dao and how daos need to adapt from this monolithic strategy into a modular strategy and i'll just get completely pilled during this episode you can literally hear the moment it happens about this whole uh pod pilled or modular dao strategy so let's go ahead and get into this conversation with julia rosenberg of orca protocol and get you pod pilled right after we listen to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible arbitrary is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitram and d5 and nft ecosystems are growing rapidly some of the coolest and newest nft collections have chosen arbitrarum as their home all the while d-fire protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity using arbitrary has never been easier especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrary through all the exchanges including binance ftx hobie and crypto.com once inside you'll notice arbitrary increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas feed if you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users visit arbitrum dot io developer to start building your dap on arbitro if you're a d-gen many of your favorite dapps on ethereum are already on arbitrom with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrom.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app cosmos polka dot tron algorithms tezos solana and of course ethereum with ledger live you can take money from your bank account buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the ledger live app through a partnership with figment ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with and ledger is running its own validating nodes offering a convenient way to participate in network validation and it even comes with slashing insurance ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world so go download ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to e so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there what's up jose how's it going hi david uh this is a very rare opportunity of an in real life podcast i know i'm very blessed by your presence welcome to williamsburg finally oh i'm having a fantastic time being here and very bullish on in real life podcast so we're gonna see how this goes my first guinea pig oh i'm very excited to test this out so what are you here to do in crypto the ultimate question i think that um i am here in crypto to figure out how we can use crypto and uh ethereum the blockchain to better scale human coordination and how we can actually use this trust layer of the blockchain to um actually better scale the better scale trust in organizations and dowse okay and how do we do that how do we do that can we skip to the end we're just like show me this magic pill yes right um well i think sadly it's a very iterative process um i have been using this sort of framework that um we created at orca called trustware and social wear okay we love new words yes and basically the idea is that um social wear is a mechanism that creates certain assurances through human coordination this is playing off software yes where software hardware they're different flavors so social wear is more of the social processes and policies of an organization whereas trustware is creating an assurance mechanism that minimizes the reliance on human coordination and human relationships which is more of you know codifying the trust centers of an organization which we haven't really had the opportunity to do yet with traditional organizations because um really traditional organizations use like digitization as a communications layer rather than a trust layer and that's something that we're very familiar with in crypto is using um you know ethereum the blockchain as a trust layer for our interactions whether that be financial whether that be around nfts any all of these things and so trustware is a new concept that we're able to use in daos to better scale human coordination um using these sort of digitized trust centers of organizations digitized trust centers of organizations okay so an example of trustworthy would be like the governor contract like that is a small primitive that was used to better scale decision making around different proposals that doesn't rely on correct the governor contract is the contract that is used um for token weighted voting so it's something that compound created a few years ago and is now kind of like the standard contract for token weighted voting so when people say we forked compound governance that's what we're talking about yeah that's all that they're talking about is the governor contract which is basically the state of all dow governments today is this thing that was created like two years ago sick i'm not sure if i should be bullish or bearish i mean it is kind of a an interesting state that like the governor contract was created and people were like we did it we figured it out this is a centralized governance like token way to voting that's all we need to do and now we're in this phase of like completely storming against dows and down processes and governance because we're like this doesn't work like there's too many whales that are voting like they can sway the vote or you know voter apathy people are engaged people don't care like they're not informed enough to be making these decisions and we have all of these problems now that exists with token weighted voting which like we you know probably could have anticipated a little bit better okay but i think it's really important now because i think people are seeing how important governance is at this stage and we are starting to see organizations in dao starting to iterate more on those governance processes because i think people understand the weight of those processes and sort of the friction that it's creating and basically becoming like a foot gun on these organizations i think here's how we can like speed run the history of the recent history of crypto yeah the recent ancient history uh compound makes his governor contract and simultaneously releases the comp token which kicks off the bull market yep so thanks compound for that and i think like when we had all these d files we had uniswap that launched in 2019 uh and then a number of other d5 applications came out after that compound being one of them we had like there was a lot of people who were like these this is these are the fundamentals of crypto d5 is like what we're here to do and then with the compound governor contract it created the the route the vehicle the path for all of these defy apps to have a token and that's really where this bull market got started it's like oh we have we have justifications for tokens now after everyone got burned in 2017 from ico tokens that were meaningless compound created the governor contract and gave a meaning to tokens yes and so for all the d5 people were like yes we solved it like we figured out how to tokenize stuff it's with governance and so we have these governance tokens and then now we've solved like defy tokenization and then that kicked off the bull market and now then we all got drunk on the bull market and now we're having our hangover and our hangovers like no no no you just added you just brought us back to square one which is the original problem of humanity which is governance right so like you don't solve problems by governance uh you just solved the fact that we now have tokens to speculate on via governance that is a beautiful summary okay but i also think that like it's we're not back to square one i think that we just kind of like lost sight of it because like of this beautiful path that compound pay forward in being able to have this token with like um utility that you can quite literally see um and creating the path for many many d5 projects to launch a token um that that basically just became the path to creating a dao so everyone now when you create it dao you launch a governor contract or you do something very similar via like snapshot um but i think what was missing in a lot of that and was catching up to people now is that we didn't really implement the social systems to uh actually create meaningful governance around that and that's kind of part of this framework that we created with orca is like the trustworthy social wear is that if you over index on either you focus on your organization foot gun meaning like you shoot yourself on the foot like you're creating problems for yourself okay and if you over index on either of those like you're creating massive problems for yourself and so i think what's happened with lotto dows is that they've over indexed on the trustworthiness like we rely wholeheartedly on on-chain governance and like the governor contract and you know you may make a proposal and then token holders vote on it governor contract is law code is law exactly but then we're like why is no one showing up to vote like where are the people why is there no informed decision making around the proposals where's the culture where's the culture where's the community all these things and so we started realizing that we're missing some of these social work processes which is just like kind of the social bedrock and social policies and processes that exist in an organization like i bet if you went and asked well as a fun fact even like delegates don't solve this problem and like 75 of compound delegates have never voted on an on-chain proposal in their lifespan of being a compound delegate um and again what signal should we get from that what does that tell us i think that tells us that's a good question well it's also potentially uh um the other side of that fact is that equates to like 80 of all delegated compound so the majority of delegated compound is voting because i think they understand the responsibility of it but the majority of delegates are not voting and i think that says more about our delegate systems is that people don't understand the responsibility they're taking on when they become a delegate become a delegate and we don't actually have clear responsibilities what that even means like when we say like oh yeah like i'll be a delegate like sure delegate your tokens to me like this is fun it's kind of like a popularity contest like you can see all these people delegate to me i can have a bunch of points yeah exactly give me the points so i could be higher on the compound's top 16 favorites exactly like jules.edu yeah but then you start to realize you're like wait what am i even supposed to be doing like i'm not getting paid for this like why should i even like waste my time on this like i'm not gonna get punished if i don't vote on behalf of all these people people don't actually care enough to undelegate to me right so like it's really just a broken system in that sense and i think that's where like all of the social wear comes in is like you need to create these sort of policies and processes around how people operate in these systems and i think like maker has done a really good job of that with their delegate system is that when you apply to become a delegate like you have to you know say like this is sort of the platform i'm running on and like there's um compensation involved and like there's a much clearer uh relationship there of what is expected of you and that's all just social wear that's not there's nothing on chain that's saying like you know hassu or monet supply like if these statements will happen right right right it's just understood in the social layer yes it's like social socially people know that hazu is about this life and that mode is about that life yes and that's not codified on chain anywhere yes so just just to like differentiate between trustware and social awareness a little bit more trustware is is what do you call it like synonymous with code is law like it's on the chain uh token gate voted voting uh we don't really need too much more than what's the data that's available on the blockchain and then socialwear is like literally everything off chain would you accept those definitions yeah i sort of like the comparison of like a lemonade stand versus a vending machine like a lemonade stand relies on social wear of like you the vendor like are asking for payment and i'm agreeing to those rules sure whereas vending machines like if i literally don't put the money in like i don't get my output i don't get my lemonade okay and i think that is the key difference is like the reliance on human coordination or humans to execute on the decisions that were made okay okay do you have any examples for us of organizations or things that have uh because you talked about over indexing on either one or the other yeah you have any examples of a dow or org that over index on one versus the other eddie stories around that yeah well i mean this is something i love to talk about and on is uh traditional organizations generally is um them basically over indexing on social wear and so not on purpose though right no again like i think it's something that they've done on accident and sort of foot gun themselves as um a lot of these things are actually really productive over time like in what's really interesting in the united states is over the last like 100 years productivity in the united states has been on like a crazy upwards trajectory like every year we just become more and more productive as a workforce and obviously there are like things in there that created massive gains for us like the industrial revolution and then like telecommunications and the internet and computers and all of these things but what's really interesting is that in the last 10 years like when technology and digitization is at an all-time high is that we've actually plateaued in our productivity rates um and we're not we're actually becoming increasingly less productive and efficient um as like a workforce which is i think um a very interesting thing to think about and like my sort of thesis on it is that a lot of it is that the sort of improvements we're trying to make is really mostly in digitization like more software more technology like you know let's just add another sas tool to this organization or you know what's the next thing we can do up um and where traditional organizations have failed is that they increasingly add more friction via these sort of social wear mechanisms so add a better expense like reporting software add like you know some trod fi like software that generic project management tool exactly that we have a meeting about to update every like three days exactly and so that's a big part of the problem i think is that um we've basically over uh like indexed on the social processes so like this is something i go back to all the time it's reid hastings like culture like netflix culture presentation that needed and i think 2008 where he really de-emphasized bureaucracy and um creating these types of processes like he felt very early on that the key to success in corporate culture is autonomy and freedom and flexibility and sort of self-responsibility which i think is the opposite of what i associate with corporate culture exactly which i think is really interesting i think there's a lot to learn there and like very synonymous with some of the values we see in daos um and real quick like side quest why is something like a project management tool or like some expense tool some trad web 2 software why is that trustware not or is why is that social ware not trustworthy because we're not relying on it for the execution of these things like it's really just a means of um analyzing things further and i think that's where some of the efficiency or productivity plateau has come in is that our digitization isn't around making things happen quicker or faster or better it's actually analyzing how people are working and talking about the problem exactly not fixing the problem it's like measuring the problem rather than executing on the problem and so like all this expense software that we see in like traditional companies is really just measuring like how much is david spending every month like and you know through all of these layers like that put like a person further away from david to make a decision based on like if he's spending too much and if we should approve these expenses okay rather than so somebody like three degrees away from me is saying that like david is being degenerate and we need to fire him or something not knowing that like i'm actually doing allegedly really good stuff exactly right exactly and so those are the types of things that really slow down people and organizations and on the flip side like i kind of pointed to the example of over-indexing on trustware when like some of these daos solely rely on like the governor contract or other on-chain mechanisms to like build out their governance systems and again that doesn't really like leave us in a good place in terms of how us as people are supposed to operate in a system and so i think that where we're starting to converge with some of the like outcry i think we've recently seen around centralized governance is that we need to meet somewhere in the middle and that like trustworth independently um isn't can't be successful without like layers of social wear around it and vice versa is so there was this recent meme going around a couple months ago uh right during the peak of like private market hotness it was like dow tooling like like dow tooling like this dow tool raised this much money this dog tool raised that much money is dell tooling like part of this trying to get at the social wear layer of daos is that is that kind of similar that's a good question um or where are we innovating at the trustwear layer yeah what does innovation on the trustwear layer look like i think that's where we're still really struggling um and that's something like i'm obviously working on with orca is um like we're in the business of basically building trustware so our key trust primitive are pods um which is the ability to group like small stakeholders based on their expertise and empower them in governance um when you say group them in what capacity like you put them into a room together or like how are we this is the new web3 airbnb no so we're basically creating like a permissions layer around these groups of people and saying you know based on xyz criteria or based on you know this stakeholder mapping that this organization has done you have the permission to execute on um high functioning governance parameters we're talking about on chain at this point yes okay completely on chain so the group of people is a group of ethereum addresses on chain that are approved to do something yes so is orca trying to make like an on-chain org chart basically yeah like what orca enables is um sort of mapping your stakeholders in your organization and as a result like helping define your organizational shape okay um and that in a way also creates like this per like decentralized permissions layer that you can better interact with all the tools that you're operating with okay so it allows is it optimizing for like more user individuality and autonomy by breaking one dow up into smaller dials yes and allowing those smaller dials to move faster by the nature of what small organizations do because they're not held back by their bigger dow and then the bigger dow just votes or by governance determines what the smaller downs actually are yep 100 vitalik created a good framework around it a few years ago of um bulldozer governance versus the autocracy meteocracy governance and the autocracy is basically just like vetocracy so it's really just pointing to like stakeholder governance which is everything that we know in decentralized governance today and then bulldozer governance is more around giving specific individuals like high amounts of autonomy um with like you can think of it more as like optimistic governance is like we're going to assume that david's going to act benevolently on behalf of this organization it's a good bet until he until he proves otherwise and then we slap him on the wrist for it um and we don't go crazy until they f it up and then as soon as they have it up it's like and then pull the plug exactly yeah but we don't really have like mechanisms for that today like again the only like widely adopted primitive that we have is the governor contract how many times will i say the governor this podcast um but that's like really the only widely adopted primitive that we have and the only way we know how and i think people have had a really hard time with bulldozer governance and again giving individuals or groups of individuals high amounts of power or autonomy because we haven't really had the accountability systems to ensure that they act benevolently like we are all too familiar with malicious actors um and again like we're putting potentially a lot of power in these people and so that's again kind of like what work enables is creating these more flexible and modular permission systems so that um when we you know put david in a pod and delegate to the pod like some essential governance functions like let's say even some like protocol parameters like you get to mess with um the contracts even we need to make sure that we can pull back those parameters at any moment or pull back you from those parameters at any moment and to this date we really haven't had mechanisms like that to create better accountability systems around individuals that want to um fill into high-performing roles in organizations okay okay so at one level i'm like well this makes this makes a ton of sense yeah they're the general state of dallas i would say they're for every like 100 dao people there are like three that do stuff and get stuff done and move the needle and then there's 97 people watching yeah and so all about uh putting more power and resources into those three people but where i'm still confused a little bit is like why does putting them into a pod change anything like cool we have like on chain permissions and on train org charts and maybe we can just put capital from the big org into their smaller pod so that they have the resource to go and run with it yeah but like what does actually compartmentalizing them inside of the pod like they're they were going to go and build stuff anyways what do we really unlock by putting them into a pod yeah so you're basically creating this flexible container that's able to actually interact in the governance system so like we all know that that already happens with like multi-six is like you know people set up a multiseg and then they get funding and then they go and do their thing but they're not really part of the governance system or part of that ecosystem so what orca enables is the ability to create sort of like principal agent relationships um within these pods so you could basically delegate what we call an admin key to another address that could be a specific person it could be another pod or even like a smart contract for example the governor contract and the admin as a result has the ability to manage the members on that pod so um potentially in the future also manage like the rules and requirements that they're beholden to so for example like we could put you in a pod and say like we're delegating the admin key to the governor contract meaning that the token holders have direct control over who sits on this pod not the decisions that they're making specifically um so again it's just kind of breaking up some of those decision-making like powers and creating these checks and balances systems within a more dynamic governance system okay so like the governor contract has like access over the treasuries and so and they also can determine who is going to be in this pod a and so they can say like all right since the whole entire dow the big doubt through the governor contract says let's give paul to a 10 million dollars of resources put 10 million in their treasury and they also get to update the contracts and so they only they don't get to run the entire treasury but they do get to upgrade the software that the dow runs like this is urine for example so we got urine core contributors give them 10 million dollars for their salary for 2023 and then they also can like update the strategies and but they can't do can't rug the entire treasury and maybe there's some other stuff too but like i'm on the right track here yeah i think like a good example is what we just did with tribe which i know is very contentious right now and there was a lot of drama around some of the recent votes that happened um which i think was also potentially like misdirected um because it actually worked exactly as it was intended so an implementation we just did with tribe was creating note dao which is basically um tribe created a few pods for each of their products specifically to hold um like contract powers over and those pods are have the autonomy to make decisions over those but they're wrapped with a time lock contract meaning that um token holders have the ability to veto decisions that they make so again we're assuming you're acting correctly but and like it's kind of an optimistic governance implementation but if we disagree with the decision that you make like we have the opportunity to veto that and participate in these sort of governance decisions and that's what recently happened um so the pods can do whatever they want but the meta the big dow can veto that in this specific example this specific example that tribe did of nope dow that was yeah that was the case okay yeah cool cool and so like it'll be if the in this particular case tribe will or the the one of the smaller dowels one of the smaller pods will go and do something and they'll do something again and then build something again and hopefully they keep start working and then they do something stupid and then the doubt like no we don't like that one yeah but up to that point they have the total freedom and sovereignty to do whatever they want and they still have freedom and sovereignty to do whatever they want but the dow still gets the ability to say no exactly right and so that's creating these more dynamic governance systems and also i think what's worth calling out is that behind the scenes like that it could be argued that that's how a lot of this runs regardless like in a bunch of the big protocols is that um you know we all know the meme of like the core contributors and investors around everything like they can basically sway the vote in any direction that they want and potentially behind the curtain that's already what's happening right but i think that's a really dangerous game to be playing is like if we're not honest about the power structures that do exist then we can't actually grow those systems um and so i think it's really important to be like a lot more honest about the structures that do exist in these organizations because then we can meaningfully scale them and continue to um grow them beyond just like you know a group of 20 insiders cool cool one of the critiques that of defy government style governance is that like there's so many inactive participants in dog governance yeah um and this was this has been true this has been true since maker dao so even before we had called the defy there was dow governance because there was maker dow and even at best there would be like 20 mkr participation and that was back in 2018 when mkr supply was super concentrated i don't even think we're anywhere close to that now yeah my my in defense of that an abstention or a non-participation of mkr voting in that in or just endow voting in general could also be implied as uh if you're not getting up off of your butt to go vote with your tokens in a dow it's because the vote wasn't controversial enough to get you to get up off your ass or or you just were down for it to go through anyways yeah do you agree with that take and how and is that a good state for dallas to be in um i agree with that take but i don't know if it's a good state for dallas to be in okay like i think again you're leaving it up to like the whim of the of the few engaged participants to decide if this is meaningful enough for them and so as a result you leave like a lot of power on the table to be taken by whoever that whoever that is um and i think again like that is like a super fair outcome is that there is a group of like specific people that feel that they have the expertise to vote on maybe the most boring proposals that no one cares about but why are we not empowering them further in the organizations to just make those decisions freely okay um is that because that doesn't unlock everything right i feel like this is one small yeah one small thing before we get to a much larger vision of highly sophisticated dow but i think that's like a key part of it is that we really haven't seen like that much innovation or experimentation happen in dallas in the last few years like they've all been following the same formula and i think that's really problematic is like we need to be continuously iterating and like testing out new frame like implementations of of how we're executing these decisions and growing the organization um but unfortunately i think governance has been like two high stakes to for anyone to like have the balls to do that basically do you think we do too much voting like it shouldn't the idea for daos to not to do minimum viable voting as in only the biggest things should really go to vote and the smaller things and medium things should be kind of figured out in other mechanisms that don't require the signing of a ledger and to be like more broken down into its sub-component parts and like let smaller pockets of the dow make those decisions in a more centralized fashion rather than it i feel like the long term of dallas should feel a little bit like a court model like where if some if a really big important decision is contentious yeah it goes all the way to the supreme court which is like actual token vote at the at the whole entire dow level and then uh smaller more minutia things as in like do we accept marketing firm a or marketing firm b is not token vote but like done at the the like uh county level where there's like you know only a sub fraction in the dell are we should dallas just ultimately be that same sort of structure of just like trying to answer decisions as quickly as possible on the pro as mostly on the periphery as possible um yes because i think again then you're taking the weight off of the token holders so like if we have an ops pod that is strictly tasked with like approving you know different payment forms like yes we choose marketing firm a versus marketing firm b like that immediately frees up bandwidth from the rest of the token holders to vote like you argued on things that are actually contentious and actually important um and i think you kind of were just like pod pilled in what you were describing yeah yeah because that's basically like what we're envisioning is like you need to be able to create these systems to delegate power away and create these checks and balances systems like i was a politics major like love political systems like love studying all this and however terrible the us government is like they were onto something and at least these theoretical implementations once at one point in time they were on to something long long time ago um in the theoretical implementation of like a tree branch government you know like the different branches of government act on different things and that they all hold each other accountable in different ways um and i think that is like a would be an interesting model for people to work towards not necessarily in copying the us government right i'm absolutely not supporting that message um but i think more just in creating uh like multi-stakeholder group governance rather than just this one bucket we have of token holders right so for for what it's worth like if you tally up all courts inside the united states there's probably like a pretty good number of decisions done per day yeah per second 100 like and and yeah and it's like some of some of them are bigger more contentious so they funnel upwards and upwards and upwards and then like when it makes its way the few things that do make their way to the supreme court like it starts to get like national media attention and people start like gluing their eyes to it and it sucks away the the attention capital of everyone in the united states because it actually like roe v wade for example the entire the country puts down what they're doing to pay attention to that so like resource highly resource consumptive when something goes to the the supreme court so the idea is like and we've used this line on bank list a number of times the united states is like the original model of a doubt yeah like it is the og let's push decision makings towards the margins let's have a representative democracy uh and i will have the central government but then we'll have also have state state rights and states governments and the states are like well like we're also kind of big too so we're going to go down to the counties and the counties go down to the cities yes uh and and so like is this is this like this tree structure is this this is this what you call or getting orc appealed is this this whole thing yes one thousand percent you're officially congratulations but it would be like think about that if we actually created a system like that within a dow like think about how much more productive and efficient we would be like rather than everything rolling up to like a single body right now like that is our only option that we have currently yeah that's kind of ridiculous it is it's crazy but i think that's also just saying that like we're really early like the other favorite line of fake lessons so early and these are so so nascent um and i think again it takes a lot to like unlearn what we know like the corporate model is so ingrained in us um is like the only way that organizations can be built and that takes like a lot of unlearning to think about how we can decouple that um and so i think we're like just at the beginning but like i truly believe that in the future dao's will be more efficient than traditional organizations because the most important part is you're putting people as close as possible to the decision making like meat space of that organization like with the use of like trustware you are quite literally giving people the execution power to perform what they need to do and that is not something that's available in traditional organizations if you want to make a decision in a traditional organization good luck like send it through the chain of command get that budgeted analysis going like start doing all those things and those i'm not saying that those aren't things we should practice endows like we can still i think learn a lot in terms of implementing some of those practices but i think the key part is that you're bringing people who potentially have like the most expertise and excitement to work on those things as close to the decision meat space as possible right the the vision that i'm getting picking up on a little bit and this is a theme that i've noticed throughout the space like one of the first times i kind of figured out this pattern was with uh justin blous platform royal where like if you have a creator and the creator can have a token you give the audience or the fans a way to reverberate the value that they see from the creator and and so like it's a two-way flow of value from like the the creator creates the creation and then he gives it out to his fans and then the fans are like we really like that here's our feedback and that feedback comes through the voice of the token and what i'm seeing with like uh traditional orgs traditional hierarchies is only one way yeah it's top down you are bestowed your duties and then you do them and you don't really have a way to like give you feed give feedback back up to the top you just you have you receive your inputs you give your outputs and your outputs are the product of your labor but not the outputs of your opinion your your opinion kind of stays fixed like if you have the opinion of we should change this i have an opinion about how we should do this differently that that part doesn't flow back up that part just stays in your brain and starts to accrue and resentment and then you put your job and go into web 3. exactly until exactly if we have this uh flow of this org structure of dals which is a little bit more just like uh back and forth where information does flow both ways that is like that is in line with the pattern i see in web 3 where like you actually get to have feedback and autonomy and agency much more fluidly than just like a top-down organization 100 and i think that's speaking a lot more to the future of work and the future of like labor markets and economies it's like no one wants to be like a corporate like person their whole life anymore like that generation is like very outdated at this point like people are changing jobs like every few years now they want to level up they want to get closer to the decision decision space like a lot of people are just quitting their corporate job entirely and going freelance like these are all the sort of labor trends that we're seeing and how people want to participate in these organizations and um make meaningful contributions that isn't just creating like you know labor liquidity at these massive corporations labor liquidity nice that's my new favorite word the era of proof of stake is upon us and lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone lydo is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using lido's distributed network of nodes don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defy with lido you can have both using lido you can stake any amount of your eth to the lido validating network and receive st eth in return sces can be traded used as collateral for lending and borrowing or leverage on your favorite d5 protocols all this without giving up your eath to centralized staking services or exchanges lido now supports solana kusama and polygon staking whatever your preferred proof-of-stake asset is lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake if you want to stake your eath soul or matic and get liquidity on your steak go to lido.fi to get started that's l-i-d-o-f-i to get started the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitram or boba networks ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave operates on like polygon phantom avalanche arbitram optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about ave is that it's completely open source decentralized and governed by its community enabling a truly bankless future for us all to get your first crypto collateralized loan get started at ave.com that's aabe.com and also check out the ave protocol governance forums to see what more than a hundred thousand dow members are all robbing about at governance.ave.com uh okay how do how do we get there how do we go from having one dow oh my gosh it's like it's like the you know the modular blockchain thesis tell me yes or the modular verse monolithic yes okay yeah yeah so like we're now in the state of monolithic taos yes and we need to become modular doubts yes exactly nice exactly modularity's type it is it's the most important how do we how do we go from monolithic dials to modular dows because you know ethereum's been trying to get modular to to extend the metaphor if you're trying to be a modular for years now yeah is that we're going to have a hard time turning our monolithic dials into modular dowels i mean that's a big part of what we're doing like i think one of the answers is pots is like how do we start to break down um some of these governance systems or start to delegate power away from this monolithic structure um and i think we feel like very impassioned with helping dallas do that i think the biggest part is that you have to operate within the faulty coordination systems to to implement the improved coordination system so it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem yeah yeah yeah um a coordination problem yeah which we're very familiar with but i think generally like most dowser are moving this direction like we have been memeing the pod very hard for a while and i think we're starting to see that in um basically every dow like has their own implementation of pods or their own aspirations or flavor towards pots like and we've seen it with several dowels too like maker has core units urine created y teams um synthetic created like the spartan council these were all like early forms of delegating power towards um smaller committees or you know fewer individuals to give them so we've already been doing this we've seen the early implementations of it okay i think the biggest problem though is again those accountability systems is we haven't had a way to include that in our governance systems is that we kind of just have to like rely on human coordination and social trust to like send off these funds into a multi-sig that is not captured by our organization and then just hope they do what they're doing for just to pick synthetics on chain there's like this vet dial vote that puts money into a multi-sig but that multisig has no on-chain association with the actual org other than the fact it received money not any sort of like backwards flow of communication that's on chain yep and so we need to build flows like the multi-sig is formally part of the synthetics protocol or like whatever dao and not only does does this uh pod this this multi-sig receive did it receive money but it can also control other things about the protocols yep exactly tight tight tight tight i am phil i am orthogonal i love it no this makes sense and like the the modular idea i think fits really really well yeah um well one of the arguments that we make about like the ethereum modular strategy is that it seems to be the logical conclusion of blockchains like if you re-roll the dice about the universe 10 000 times maybe it wouldn't be called ethereum but it would be a modular blockchain with like a data availability layer and multi-clients and all this stuff and i feel like you could make the same claim about dows in the future yeah you re-rolled it re-roll the dice a thousand times and very very very perhaps never would you ever end up at a monolithic dow outcome it's probably always going to converge on modularity it's just a matter of how we get there one hundred percent would you say like orca is like is orca primitive yeah i would say it's a primitive like i think of pods as sort of like the nodes of this contributor graph and orca the protocol manages how all of these nodes are connect interconnected with each other so that's sort of the way i would break it down so after like the first dow starts to oh it's also kind of like cellular division right you have like one monolithic cell and then it divides seven times into like smaller cells that you start to optimize for different things all of a sudden you can grow and body i love nature there's so many like nature comparisons technical comparisons to this like just like human comparisons to this like it's amazing right not to not to speed run through that metaphor so let's go into that yeah instead we have we right now we have the monolithic dow structure yes as like the status quo and it's inefficient can't really do anything it's trying to get pulled in all directions at once but it's just a cell so it can't yeah it's a red blood cell that's all it's supposed to do yeah it's got one thing and so in order to go in multiple directions at once it needs to create parts of the overall cohesive structure that are optimized for that so the cell starts dividing um from one cell the two cells and two cells to many cells and then we start like a growing appendages and so we have like and copying that dna as it goes like the dna of that organization the purpose the mission the vision the social contract the social contract is built into the cellular division you would hope ooh i would hope so yeah that's a different conversation i don't think you have the assurances of that social wear trustwear pill too oh my god wait what there's another half of this conversation uh okay but just just to tie off the metaphor yeah uh this dow starts growing like eyeballs to understand its own metrics and kpis it starts growing uh its own hands and fingers to go and reach out to other agencies to get stuff done to grab more tools and so like different parts of these taos start specializing in optimizing in different directions and over time we have like different organs with different sensory inputs and the ability to create outputs because we have modular dowels that are optimized in many different ways many different flavors but they're all tied together by this one metadow and the metadail the actual dow is like the prefrontal cortex of the damn thing done tight beautiful i actually love that too yeah like imagine if we relied on our entire bodily capacity on one organ in our body right now it's time to beat the heart [Laughter] be the brain heart kidney and bladder and if you forgot about anything else those things stopped working we will self-implode in one day oh my god okay so how so like part of um tradify trad orgs hierarchies yeah is that the culture doesn't extrapolate like extend but it doesn't permeate throughout the org yeah like one of the reasons why we have been at bankless very very intentionally slow to scale is that we need that right we love everyone's got to tie into the culture before we add in another person right you don't add 13 people at once because how do you scale out culture to like when we are literally a team of 13-ish or so give or take uh and you double the size of your org how do you get all of those people to add in to join the culture efficiently so like we're very intentionally slow to scale and that's worked out really really well for us if we're trying to build out dallas to and have like one dow be like massive excuse language how do we get culture to also like scale out with all of these cell divisions because cell divisions is a was it uh geometric growth right like like exponential growth how do we get culture to scale exponentially yeah this is my other favorite topic is that you really like tapping into this organs people um but i think this is like also one of the biggest potential failures that we can tap into is that more people does not equal more productive and that's something that like you have beautifully discovered as a leader within bankless and growing your team is that like sure we could if we wanted to hire 30 more people and just build this machine but like how would that you know how would that dna copy from each person to the next right and it wouldn't have lots of bad mutations yeah exactly we would have some cells die on themselves and i think that's something that we have to be really aware of like i i always forget if it's trach or zaku from coordinate that said this but you can only scale at the speed of trust and so that was a big part of like our early part thinking is that like the most basic primitive or like the smallest unit of an organization is just small groups of people and um like that was a big part of how i sort of landed into orca was just thinking about consumer behavior and that we have this like obsession in web 2 like internet culture and also like corporate culture that um it's just a game of the masses like the more people the better more subscribers more followers more you know people in the community like let's just grow this thing as big as we can get and what i saw so like aggressively happening and um was just that it actually degraded those systems really really quickly was that you know if you had this like let's say special internet community and you decided like let's get to a million followers is like it was actually way more powerful when it was like 100 people right and that path is actually really dangerous and you start to lose sort of like the value alignment and integrity of that thing right so the followers are like why are we here yeah or they're like i don't really care to show up in a meaningful way and like um i think the same thing has happened with corporate companies like in building this concept of like labor liquidity like if we just hire as many people as possible that creates some type of moat for us that you know we're safe because we just have all these people to build meaningless for us so we'll never make it into production right um and so that was like a really big part of our early thinking with pods is that the most functional unit of an organization is just a small group of people and as soon as you scale beyond like maybe eight people in that single pod like you've you've lost it like you've basically lost your optimal like window of effective coordination communication collaboration um and that is really what we need to be optimizing for so i think it's that is kind of the way that you have to think about it like art the orca team is now 11 people and we just recently split it up into two parts because we're like this is no this isn't too big to have a single group of people on a meeting talking and trying to connect with each other like and we'll likely probably like break it down even further because i can only like effectively communicate or collaborate with like a kumbaya like circle of people and that is applies to everything like our friends are like corporate team are like yoga class like whatever it is is that's just kind of how we naturally operate as people um like the dial world is obsessed with this dunbar's number right and i think it's really relevant it's just like the internet has created this new version of dunbar's number that like every circle is actually thousands and thousands of people because of our digital networks but at the same time like how are we actually meaningfully showing up and um participating in a meaningful and engaging way in those circles and that still looks a lot smaller like again eight-ish people right so when you break up your pod into two pods how how does how do those two pods coordinate like how does that happen yeah because do you need a third pod to get that done or like what happens with this yeah i mean i think it depends on the group like i think that's what's sort of beautiful about the way orca operates it's like we're not opinionated about how you coordinate or how you do the work that you need to do like a lot of that lies at the social layer is the answer is just figure it out yeah it's not that hard that question is actually not that big of a deal david i mean it is a big deal though because i think that is what a lot of dows are struggling with right now is like okay you know the ops team is saying that we need to reduce our burn rate and like oops we're accidentally spending 50 million dollars a year like how did that happen um and then the marketing pod is still just pumping out like money for ads and all these things so i do think it's really important and i think that's where we sort of rely on social wear systems like how um do we create like a pod that maybe is a source of truth for funding and how we're allocating budgeting and funds but that's actually uh a pod of pods where every pod has a seat at the table to advocate for themselves or um create proposals that are aligned with you know how they want to proceed so i think it's a combination and i think it is important to be very clear about um where there are failures in those communications what about the current state of dow governance makes you optimistic um actually the current i think the thing that makes me most optimistic about the state of down governance is that people are as bearish as ever so we're in like problem solving mentality yeah like i think people are finally realizing like oh this isn't working and like this is creating massive ripple effects if we don't figure this out like there will be massive liquidations there will be financial repercussions like we will not control our burn rate like all of these things are rising like i told you so not gonna lie um but i think that's really important is that we are sort of in this like storming phase of doubts where people are like it isn't working like why are we doing this if you look at the pnl we are dead exactly i actually have like i really think that um i'm like very bullish on dows during a bear market because um you know cash is tight like things aren't insane anymore and i think it really pushes dows to figure their  out and think very critically about the systems that um they're adopting as an organization so um i'm actually like very optimistic for um this sense of frustration that's happening in dow governance right right yes because we only move forward if we actually feel pain um exactly and ironically that that is absolutely true exactly i mean people are looking at their treasuries and they're like huh why didn't we do a treasury diversification like 10 months ago you're like we just couldn't get the proposal through sorry guys our tokens doesn't sound bad rip um for all of the dowers that are listening to this yeah whether it's a dow community member or a dow leader what would you say and they're they're already pilled like all right like i understand the modular dow vision yeah uh my dow is super too monolithic i need to make it more modular uh what should steps should they take what needs to happen first that's a good question i think just thinking about the biggest pain points in their organization like where are the biggest failures happening and then also what type of structure do you want to create i think that's like also part of the problem right now is that um everyone just sort of looks to what's been done and people really want like a template or a mental model to adopt but i think you just have to think very critically about one like what are the essential governance functions that you have in your organization and two who like should basically be responsible for those essential governance functions and that's how you start figuring out like what your organizational structure should look like cool yeah cool um if people need resources to access these tools where should they go um we're actually building out a ton of resources um at orca right now obviously all of our trustware product that we're building but we're actually building out some cool social work templates too um chase chapman and frogmonkey on our team and chase is obsessed with like holacracy and sociocracy co-op models um and trying to take a lot of learnings from some of those systems and think about how we can incorporate like productive processes and policies so we actually are coming up with some really cool resources um so check us out on twitter orca protocol um come through to the discord all of those things so like uh what what is orca though because cool you guys have this cool dow structure yeah but like what's the point like [Laughter] [Applause] do you get it it's like like yern dao makes a yield aggregator uh maker dow runs a credit facility orcado is governance but governance over what you mean like what will orca protocol the dao be yes okay yes what's the product other than being really good at governing what are we doing we have to govern over something well so basically it's kind of what i was saying it's like the product that we're building with orca are pods that's like our key primitive that we're building which is kind of like how gnosis makes gnosis multisig yeah okay and so we're building this permissions wrapper around multisig to create more modular governance systems and we will can be continuing to um i think create interesting features in that sort of governable surface area there um so again like pods are sort of like the nodes of this permissions graph and orca the protocol helps manage the relationships between those so for example something that's a pro uh like a feature that's upcoming with orca is that you can actually assign like arbitrary rule logic to gatekeep membership so you could assign you know very basic things like let's say you know you must hold 20 000 bank tokens to sit on this pod or you must be x amount active in um like on chain proposals to maintain your position in the meta governance pod so you can start to create sort of little parameters to ensure that people are acting like benevolently or in good faith on behalf of these orcs and i think um will help create some more like complex agreements so that uh you know you can build out i think more interesting use cases of that so like those are examples of um protocol developments that like we'll be having in the next few months so eventually like that protocol like orca the protocol element that is helping manage the relationships between pods will have like a ton of meat space in terms of what can be explored in helping you know these small units interact with each other and again just build more dynamic governance systems and how does how does orca capture resources from this it's a great question just also as an fbi we are not a doubt yet oh okay yeah so you were asking no so well like i mean every dow captures resources in one way or another right like you unicorn captures uh trade fees urine takes a percentage off of their yield aggregation yeah orca dow gets money from blake borka protocol protocol yeah um i think it's still very much to be determined i mean i think the sort of permissions layer of daos is one of the most um important things to be working towards um like i think the financial element is very commoditized like and that's what's the easiest thing to do in crypto is send money it's very difficult to move people and move people around and that's what we're simplifying with our product is um basically the creating this sort of orchestration layer for dallas and organizations to better manage orchestration player for davs to better manage the relationships the contributors and permissions that exist within their organization cool yeah one one last question that might be often a different direction but like say some dow org just like just kills it with a pot structure and they make like this template where like the very basic template of that kind of how like everyone forks uh compound the government contract well after if we the compound governor contract is like the monolithic dow mm-hmm or perhaps just like the prefrontal cortex of a doubt which is actually where dallas you would think would start is like okay if we're gonna make if you're gonna make a whole entire body you gotta start with the brain because the brain has to think about how to create the body but then some dao is successful in going from monolithic to modular and they create this basic uh conjure like system like that is totally copyable can like other orgs just cop take that off the shelf and just like start spitting out dowels and have like a bowl mania for dallas yes that's what's so cool is that um we're like going to help also build out those templates so we're in the process of building what we call the poddarcy builder so poddarky pod hierarchy nice little map system we were going to call it podography but it sounded too much like pornography yeah that's pretty close yeah and pornography you approve of our word choice um where you can actually like go and explore other like down implementation so you could go and see like tribes noped out implementation and say like that's really cool to like you can have this time-lapse contract around the pods and blah blah blah you can quite literally like duplicate that and plug it right in exactly cool like build a block uh institution yes exactly oh my god well i mean this fits right into the whole idea that crypto just does everything that we've already done before but faster and better and forkable and replicatable yes all the things that we love cool i know i'm so excited this is making me bullish on dallas i love it so yeah i knew i would get you there [Laughter] jules thanks you for coming on uh layer zero and telling me about
