underneath it all the idea was we want to bring together artists to do collaborative generative art in an experimental format like this is the lab where they do things that they wouldn't normally do that pushes them outside of what they're used to by collaborating together the other side of it was wanting to support up-and-coming artists so really the vision has always been that we want to get to the point where we're collaborating with an artist that might be a well-known artist that could bring in an audience and a lesser-known artist so they could you know learn from this well-known artist as well as benefit from having a joint collaborative project but in terms of the tokenomic model behind it there was always an idea that it would launch as a platform and a dow that would support artists and you know we wanted to capture the same lightning in a bottle as nouns now so we thought you know we could have a perpetual auction but i think we found it's not a model that looks like you can recreate it web3 lacks some of the stuff we have in the web too which is like we can't let people know that there's a new auction very easily so it's like we always have to do the work on socials like there's another auction today and seemed like as a perpetual auction model that was just too difficult to sustain but
