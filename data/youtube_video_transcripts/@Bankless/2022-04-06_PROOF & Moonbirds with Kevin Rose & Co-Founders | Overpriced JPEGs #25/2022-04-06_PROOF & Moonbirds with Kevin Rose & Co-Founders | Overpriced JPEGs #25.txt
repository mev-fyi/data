[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs this is a very special episode because it is another one in person in a studio here in new york city and i am joined by three very special people we've got kevin rose justin mazzell did i get that right you got it really right yeah yeah i thought it was good maybe better than i've ever said beautiful and ryan carson the carson ryan carson and i'm carly riley no we're joking earlier okay um thank you guys so much for being here gm gm mgm gmgm just fresh off the the plane for some of you and uh ryan you took the train in the train i'm the i'm the poor guy yeah just just proximity close is really all it is um okay i want to start by just like orienting probably kevin will start with you we're obviously going to talk about moon birds here let's call it why we're here but we're going to go a bunch of different places so you have this you know long history you started a bunch of companies sold a bunch of companies done the venture thing and then a year ago or so you start modern finance yes podcast right do i have that right that's right okay what made you launch modern finance that's a good question um i just saw all the activity in defy and everything that was going on there and quickly realized that some of the best kind of networking that i've ever done in my life has always been via podcast it's a great excuse to have guests on the show to meet people to chat about what they're excited about and then i'm also just like personally curious about everything going on web 3 wise so i saw this movement that was happening and thought okay let's launch a show um and largely that at that time it was like how do i earn interest like what all these people aping into like how do we avoid all the scams what are these meme coins all about do they have lasting value like and then at the same time like shortly thereafter two three months later nfts just popped and then i was like okay crap like i had this plan i was gonna do the show it's gonna be all finance finance hacks and all the fun stuff and then i was like crap i love like nfts too much it's just too there's too much about the artwork and just there's so many pieces of this that this space that for me that immediately drew me in yeah and um and i i realized that the nfts were going to be so much more than just you know a simple jpeg and that was really exciting so did you see that coming like from how far away did you kind of see the nft smart contract thing popping off because you're known for like seeing the future a little bit i think i appreciate you saying that um i was lucky enough i will say you know it's it's right place right time and a little bit of luck and all those things and a little bit of seeing the future it's like that mix and sometimes you miss things completely but i i was lucky enough to have a buddy say you got to mint these things called crypto punks like they're going to be and that's not buddy garyvee that was not gary vee did you tell gary vee i told gary vee to buy his first punk about a year a little over a year ago okay and so um i i meant to them and they were like five dollars a piece i got ten of them and i was like okay this is fun and then i forgot about them honestly i forgot about for years yeah and had to dig them out of a wallet and found them again thankfully oh my god and it was i didn't think i had them anymore and it was it was hard because it was long story i was using an old wallet system that didn't support the new key phrase so i couldn't restore it on the modern wallet did a lot of digging found them that was awesome but um you know that's the first time i heard about this idea of storing that type of data on the blockchain and then when i saw i started to see i think it was really when our blocks launched where it was like oh crap this generative thing is really interesting and that's when i i went all in and said okay this is a movement that's starting to happen now it's more than just some people speculating on things or this isn't crypto kitties all over again like we're going much deeper and it was it was clear that a lot of the tooling had been built up you know a lot of the marketplaces were now online that was a hard thing to do back in the day it was like you were literally like on reddits or trying to figure out ways to swap these things and sell them to people and you know crypto punks was lucky and they had their own little marketplace that they built and so it it was it was the right combination of maturity of the market along with new artists that were crypto native artists that were only publishing stuff like you can't go buy like well i guess you can actually buy printed x copies you did do some prints way back in the day but like these are people that are just doing stuff you know and producing content on as nfts yeah exactly that way and were you at true ventures at the time where were you in your career when you launched modern finance yeah true okay yeah okay awesome and then so uh walk me through now getting to to prove collective and the decision to move from these just podcast content you're putting out to like a brand what would you call proof collective at this point yeah i mean it was really the thinking there was let's um take this big audience because that that podcast proof quickly blew up because it was all things nfts nfts were like really hitting this inflection point like there was a ton of capital pouring in and we went from you know 5 000 listeners to 50 to 75 to 100 150 and all of a sudden i was like wow there's a hundred fifty thousand podcast envy our podcast is doing well but that's not that well i mean it was it was again like it was it caught that that movement and i i picked up a lot of subscribers when all the attention was on the nft market and we were there was like just us a couple other shows that were out there yeah and you're kevin rose well i appreciate you uh it does help to have previous podcast experience so all those people that used to listen to me on foundation or dignitation or all these other shows i used to do i could roll those in and then i'm you know tim ferriss and i were doing we still do the random show which is like you know once a quarter or more and he has a massive audience and i'm always talking about my shows on there so like that type of stuff just like pumps it up um got a lot of subs and then thought well there's a subset of these people that really want to go deep on nfts and it was clear to me that when anyone is armed with photoshop and they can create an nft there's going to be just a flood of new nfts hitting the market and how do you make heads or tails of what's actually collectible durable and that will appreciate over time right and obviously in the world of pfps that's a whole other thing where there's people that are rugging people on this and so in my mind i was like okay how can i bring a little bit of credibility to the space help guide people in the right direction and i need more eyeballs on this and i need help on this and so when i joined flamingo dow i was blown away because it was like this these like 35 or so people that from the bottoms up come together to find the best nft projects and they have these weekly calls they're just filled with alpha and deep dives because you have 35 people that are so obsessed with everything that then when that collect collective knowledge comes together it produces amazing results and in in getting rid of a lot of the garbage and so i'm like okay how can we do that at a bigger scale a lot of people can't afford to be in flamingo and they have a 99 member cap and so the idea of a membership nft made a lot of sense and that's when we launched the collective okay i'm going to bring you two in in just a second but i want to follow up on that and ask so so was flamingo like where were you first how are you individually combing through all of the space to to decide what you were bringing to your listeners yeah it's a it's a good question i think there was two or three people that jumped out um as kind of thought leaders in the space that were tweeting a lot about really credible projects at least i thought were credible projects that kind of guided my eyes to different things and i started learning about you know super rare and the one-of-one artist to pay attention to some of the degenerative stuff and so i was talking to snowfall a lot saying hey which artists are you really excited about are the ones that are dropping um you know and it's just little things like that it's little nuggets of information i remember when snow said oh we've got this crazy artist tyler hobbs is doing fidenza next week and like you should check that out because it's really beautiful and take a look at some of the test net stuff or whatever you know and i i wouldn't looked at it and i was like wow this is the first drop i've seen that looks like art like like this could be this this looks like art it's generative like you could print this and someone might think it was painted like that's cool yeah and so like it was just those little like okay let's jump in here and and go buy a few of these and i never dreamed they would be this valuable like it was like you're like oh maybe they'll like 3x or something you know you didn't think it was gonna go where it went but um i've joked about frequently about how this space just like ruins all other kinds of investing for you you know like 20 returns for like a hedge fund is like you know whatever you're like might lock my money up for 20 of you kidding me exactly please maybe for a month i can get that a month but yeah exactly the year what are you talking about yeah okay so that that's the the origin story for for proof collective okay i want to start bringing this alpha can we use that word to to kind of a group of my early die hards i don't know i feel like i'm probably not characterizing this person that's right it's like like the people that were into the podcast that were going really deep and and justin was a part of this all along because when i needed someone to design i'm a horrible designer and so i needed someone to help me with the branding on modern finance and on proof so that's how we met so that was literally going to be my next question is is now connect the dots for me kind of y'all give you perspective on how this happens so justin starting with you how did you how did you get involved here i was coming home from a vacation with my kids we were like on spring break and i think i got a dm from kevin rose that was just like hey i like your work you want to work on something and is kevin rose yeah and so i was like okay yeah i mean what are you working on and so he's like well let's just hop on a call like is this am i being scammed yeah like i'm like checking like like win win he's like how about you i i got seven eighth out of them i did scam them yeah yeah which honestly was a great lesson to learn it was a great lesson yeah you got to learn the hard way yeah he never gave it back but i painted it back in design fees yeah you got it we're working on it um and so yeah when i kind of came on board it was it was just kind of working on the podcast and he had some ideas about some of the visuals and at first you know we were kind of like rotating on like these really 80s kind of synthwave just kind of fun stuff and then we kind of you know talked about when proof was launching just sort of like what does it look like to build a brand that like allows other people's artwork to really like we're giving the platform to that it's not all about proof being this loud big thing um and the other thing are you describing right now like the thumbnail for the podcast and the website or like those the two big design pieces or is there i mean in terms of our brand at the time yeah it was it was very much like we have you know kind of like a masthead or like a you know a logo type identity and then thinking about how does that play with some of the artwork we're doing and obviously we're in an audio format right which i know you know and it's you know describing these jpegs is a little hard and so we knew that there there were going to be brand extensions at some point outside of it whether it was like pursuing more of an editorial route um kevin had kind of like also at the same time started taking a lot of the guests that had been on the show and was kind of running this discord of artists too so it was really neat to see like you know artists like i've watched the space and just like oh my god these people just talking every day just talking about what's going on in their life and sometimes they're sharing about their drops and so that was one of the cool things too with collective i think that we had was like there was already this amazing community of artists that existed and now we're adding more people from the collective to be able to you know talk to them and ask questions and see when something is going to drop and they're posting and they're like hey you know i've got this kind of coming out and so it was a really neat sort of blend with you know kevin's product thinking about seeing you know okay there's something going on here with sort of how people are looking at the nfts and how proof is growing and then taking that and being like we could grow community around this appreciation around people that are excited about collecting and yeah and since then it's just kind of it's done what it's did you've accepted the seven eighth loss i don't bring it up anymore um what were you drawn to in justin's work that made you be like this is who i want oh i think i found your dribble first right i think yeah you referenced yeah i found i found his online work and it was just a beautiful illustrations and just it's um in justin it's it's hard to find i've worked with a lot of designers and and oftentimes you can find people that can are beautiful designers but don't really think of through the usability and they like the overarching brand and everything else that needs to be considered and so even in our early earliest conversations it was all around it wasn't just like let me build you a website it's like okay who's the audience in mind like how how do we want to make sure that we're we're building towards that audience i mean just a deeper level of thinking that you typically find from great product people and it was clearly he had that and so i was like this is this could be awesome we should we should work on this that's just running the gamut though it's like you know i like started off in editorial design doing magazine design and then it was you know working at an agency doing branding design and then from there i broke off and did illustration work and just worked for a bunch of companies like you know contracting with them so it was like i started off with like the paypal illustration system and then i went to twitter and then worked with google and so it was like but as i was doing their illustration teams i was like how where are you guys using these things and so i wanted to learn like how is product being developed how do you decide where illustrations go and so then it was doing product work and then it was after that running product kind of departments and so i've just kind of gone all over design and so what's been really fun about proof and originally modern finances like we get to start with kind of a brand or an identity but it evolves into like all of these extensions through a ton of different mediums and i mean that's the way it feels today at proof you know it's like sometimes i'm working on as we'll talk about i'm sure a little bit like moon birds but sometimes we're working on some of our brand stuff sometimes i'm working on some of the podcast stuff and so it's like we have so many ways to visualize what it is we do and sometimes we take a front seat like it's all about proof sometimes we're doing a back seat and it's about the other artwork you can flex a lot of muscles yeah everything you guys have going on wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flow tasos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft traders wearable has a variety of nft features that set it apart from other nfc marketplaces they have a native messaging function allowing you to dm your friends or haggle with sellers they also have a mobile app on ios and android with a built-in nft portfolio tracker tool so you can easily check the value of your digital art portfolio wearable is built on the wearable protocol a multi-purpose open source and community governed nft protocol that helps build products and services across the nft ecosystem including white label marketplaces tailored to specific nft communities so go to wearable.com and start discovering and trading nfts putting in floor biz to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the defy exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect po apps nfts and use it for all my d5 things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 ryan your piece in this tell us i know you and kevin go like back one of the fun things when i have guests on that i that i like and that i want to listen to i get to go back into the archives and like listen to so i listened to a conversation with the two of you from like four years ago yeah so tell us how you got involved here so uh i used to run a conference called future web apps and uh way back in 2006 we were doing an event in san francisco and you know dig was big um around that time and was like well clearly we need to get kevin on stage um so we met for the first time on stage you know right backstage right before he was going on and it was just kind of weird it was like we're the same age we both studied computer science like just like a ton of weird similarities and just kind of hit it off and became friends and then he spoke i think like every future web apps um it was fun the london one was great he threw the best conferences back in the website we learned that was garyvee's start was we had a blast stage in london wow i mean i'm just a big believer in and and human relationships irl like there's just so much value and getting people together so i was doing conferences and um kev and i became friends and then at some point it was like well if we really want to empower people um doing conferences isn't the best way to do it we need to teach code online like let's just teach people how to code online and so we launched treehouse sold the events business and then um i was doing my urn out and kevin spoke for me in la i know it was vegas and i was like hey kevin check out the spreadsheet and i was like this this treehouse thing is really growing a lot and he said i want to invest in that and i was like oh i don't know how to do that let me go read a book so i literally read a i think it was a book by brad feld you know remember what it's called um it's like his classic you know how to not get like hurt by investors like book and so i thought about it and after a while i was like all right let's do it so kevin was my first investor in treehouse and that was a decade ago um so we've just been friends forever um both lived in portland at some point and um and then he kept pinging me about this podcast you know because in 20 last year in 2021 i began to get sort of inbound acquisition offers on treehouse and i was like okay i think we're gonna we're gonna sell and he's like you should listen to my podcast i'm like okay fine you know and i listened to the first episode of mofi which i think was i think it was dc investor or was he the first dc investor was the first proof okay uh yeah so i first listened to all the mofi episodes and i i loved d5 so that was kind of fun you know and i was and i was like learning okay how does ethereum work and all these kind of things and then um and then kevin sort of integrated the proof podcast and i was like oh nfts and i'll never forget like i was driving um and i was seeing a dc investor talk about nfts and i had to pull the car over because i was like oh my god why did you have to pull the car off well you know you know like i'm so excited i might correct you like throw up or something i just can't control it i can i mean it was like my brain i had i couldn't focus on driving it was like my brain was processing like holy like this is literally going to change the fabric of science amazing i've never had to pull the card off so i was like and then i just sat there and i listened to it and you know i was like okay you can burn nfts like you can like all it blew my mind so i was like holy this is so interesting i listen i remember you hit me up and you were like you don't understand i'm like no i do that's why it does and you're like no it's just gonna be and i'm like i get it dude you're doing the podcast he was going over the top so excited i was like losing my mind so but you know was selling my company it was just very busy um you know doing all that and so uh eventually you know i'm listening to every single episode of proof and then and then kevin had told me he's like so we're gonna do a thing like you know and it's gonna be a thing you know and then it was announced and and um so treehouse was bought in december um and i decided it was actually in new york um i was having uh breakfast with my wife and and it was minting day and i was like i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna get a proof pass like talking my wife about it you know because i thought it was gonna be five eth so i was like that's a decent investment you know you gotta talk to your wife about that stuff and and she's like we should do it like i'm like yeah there's gonna be smart people like in this group you know and i was gonna retire at that point so i just thought it'd be fun to be in this group um and i just got sucked in like the proof discord is just so funny i mean for 50 eath the proof discord i mean i have like inappropriate jokes i want to make about what must be happening in the proof of score to be early but really you knew is a good community so like i got it i was just a proof member like i wasn't the ceo yeah like yeah i was just in there like learning how to use discord it is a good question like what's going on so i mean at some point i was just reading discord all day and my wife was like what are you doing you know i'm like i i think i'm obsessed i think i'm down the road and then and then i woke up one morning and i was like honey like i i think i want this to be my job like what would you think if i went to gov and asked to work from well i remember when you hit you hit me up and i was like you want to be a moderator because it's like i was like dude you're the ceo you just sold the company you're retiring would be a moderator no but it was it was a little bit like you were like i love this discord so much i want to be involved and i'm like what do you want to do he's like you're overqualified like are you sure he wants to run discord i was like no no no i'm going to be your co yeah i want to run your company oh and then he's like okay and then you two obviously had a conversation he's like you got to talk to justin and then justin and i hit it off like soul brothers just like so true we have all these hilarious and then here we are and so at this point is is it is it the three of you full time yeah you got another one over there they got another one in the corner of this room we're not going to say it though but we are it's the three of you yeah you want to announce it i mean we we can do you want to do that now or do you want to so we've got ryan who is he's basically um is joining us uh as our director of engineering in second ryan yeah second second ryan and we we worked together um in the past at several things and and he actually uh helped out with our initial proof drop on the collective path side which people don't know just doing a little bit of contracting stuff in the background and uh um what's your twitter is it melting isis yeah it's at melting ice on twitter and um yeah so i've watched him scale things to like millions of users on the back end and his engineering chops are just insane and so i was like okay we're going big here like in terms of what we're building um which is the combination of like decentralized and centralized applications like we need a rockstar in this position so um well congratulations to all of you it seems like a win do you want to come say hi to youtube or something i know podcasters won't be able to hear it but say to ryan melting ice on twitter that's awesome this is the second episode i've had where somebody's made a big engineering announcement on this show doodles jordan castro announced that so this is we're becoming the place for this i'm so glad this happened thank you thank you yeah we've got we've got uh i'd say two or three more hires we're about to make and i do these four on my team yeah and it's definitely not lost on us that we're a bunch of white dudes at this point so we've got um some at least two other women uh one uh person of color that we're interviewing like we're we're gonna be diversified really really fast uh because that we we do not want to be a bunch of white dudes so yeah just want to throw that out there for people watching the video this video is not lost on us at all well and i know it's something you've talked about with moon birds which we should get to because i have some other bigger picture questions i want to ask and i'm cognizant of time here so i know you've talked about you have like a panel of of folks who've been helping advise on moon birds where diversity has been super important and it's been super helpful um i don't know if you want to say anything on that i'll just start diving in making questions about moon birds yeah i mean i i think it's it's easy to that's the easy one to to answer we didn't want to create like um we didn't want this to be something where it's just like we have a website and it's like look at our diverse panel of advisors and we're just kind of like doing that for a show and so one of the cool things that we did is said okay we just need help with attributes because like we want attributes meaning like how do they appear how do they look like what speaks to you as a collector and so we wanted to get a bunch of different voices to the table and see what what came out of that and so uh that means a bunch of people of color a bunch of women like people that we just want to all have involved and um essentially said hey listen um give us 15 minutes of your time um it doesn't have to be a big ass we're not asking you to design anything but just tell us what what you would like to see done and and they provide back some fantastic attributes that made it into the collection so we've got um some great stuff coming that actually it's so cool it's actually it made the collection better it really truly made the collection better because like there was stuff we would have never thought about as just like a couple white guys iterating on on this stuff you know and and we've got some really fun things that we have yet to reveal yet but it'll come out at midday and it felt important because it's you know i mean a pfp is still a pfp i'm sure to a lot of people but in the web3 space like it is becoming a part of identity and you know people are building brands around it and they're being recognized by their pfp and so i think like as maybe low table stakes as it might seem it's also really important and it can be a real powerful piece and so we thought you know it it must be really difficult to see the same collections rehashing the same traits the same ideas and every time a new collection comes out to say like i don't see myself there i don't see myself here and so when it came to moonbirds it was really important to try to think about that through the lens of like how can we make sure somebody who hasn't seen themselves somewhere else says finally like this feels like something or or an individual that i'm proud to represent as my identity so in case anybody who's listening has missed this i'll give the the context which is why this is so important what you all are saying this is the the first pfp and i don't know i guess the only pfp dropout you'll tell me that is coming out of the proof collective you started with these membership passes and i've been on twitter spaces talking about this and on podcasts i don't want to i don't want to rehash things that can be found in a couple of other places but but you know the proof membership pass not a good pfp beautiful art not a good psp and so this was your way to sort of foray into that let this be something that folks can use to socially signal to say they're a part of this group and that's what's landed us here right but it extends further than so we only have 2 000 members or 1 000 members as proof collective holders and the number one thing people ping me about is love the idea i'm priced out now because it's too expensive and so how can we provide a lot of the benefits and do slightly different benefits that are utility pfp and to a wider audience that is less expensive and so for us this is the way to take kind of our chops and community building and then also tying in real world unlocks into the actual pfp like one of the things that we love to do is figure out like pfp's they're awesome and the and justin's doing great work in terms of their being like this great little thing that you said as your twitter avatar but we think they could be much deeper than that like they can go much further than that in terms of the utility that they actually unlock for that person that holder and so that is what gets gets us really excited as product builders is how can we build around that to make this have a lot more depth than just another drop like just another pfp isn't that there's been so many it's like why just do just another one it's going to be completely different we can give you some examples of stuff well i would love that i know i heard you mentioned somewhere like a mobile app that you know can easily make this an access pass to irl events it seems like there's a lot of blending of irl and metaverse and we'll talk about that but if any of you want to chime in on on uh what that might look like i think we have an amazing community number one in collective now it's going to expand to you know an extra 8 000 people and also we have this amazing group of holders that we can just reward and reward and reward with interesting things right and so we've got this idea of nesting yes great and there's just so many permutations of of fun value that we can drop into our amazing holders and reward them for being a part of the community and you know we have a long time to do that really excited about that yeah i think a couple so what nesting does to give people the quick little tldr is that you essentially take your bird and you kind of lock it up so it's it's a way that we've figured out on the smart contract side to make it so it can't be sold and then you start to accumulate time that your bird has been nested it's almost like staking kind of you know and then you get a total amount of time and a cumulative time on that particular bird and what this allows you to do is now you can divide up rewards based on loyalty so the same way that everyone does loyalty programs like the airlines do it like this right your platinum status or whatever it may be in the credit cards do like this everybody does like this crypto doesn't do it like this which is very confusing everyone everyone gets the same thing like if you held a board ape since day one and you bought one the day before they did the apecoin launch you got the same amount of coins it made no sense presumably they do that to encourage secondary activity because they get royalties off that yeah but i don't care about that that's like for us we'd rather like i don't know this needs to be more fun than that and it's like for us we wanted that allows us to take the capital that we were going to invest back into the community so if you have you know 10 000 members that are all in equal footing and you have a budget of a hundred thousand dollars like now you only have like a few dollars to spend on each individual user like they get a pen and a cap in the mail like that's it right but if you only if if you break it into segments of loyalty now you can take larger pools of capital and provide really interesting benefits and perks for those people right well no one is building real communities like we don't want uh 10 000 people on secondary flipping moon birds constantly like we actually want to build a community of people that stay i mean we're not optimizing for secondary sales i think that's part of the problem with pfp like we're optimizing to create a real community like we it's our dream that everybody would hold their moon bird forever it is stunning this hasn't been done before given all of the talk around community and how every project claims that's what they're about build a real client right well we we were referencing this earlier what must be happening in the in the the proof collective discord for for the valuations or you know for the 50 eath sales maybe give a little insight into that but also what are going to be the different access points what what's the difference between a proof collective card and and um and a moon bird yeah it's a great question so proof collective has always been about the most hardcore nft collectors it's a thousand members in total they get the research reports the almost like forester level like if you're familiar with the old stock market world like the really deep pdfs explaining to you like you know why you should care about a project so it's it's it's our curation with a point of view so it's it's podcast release early before anybody else it is that private discord of only a thousand members so the moon bird holders are not allowed into that discord it's for the hardcore collectors and that will always remain to be that separate entity the moon birds are more about in real life having fun unlocking physical and digital things as well and some of that will spill over some of the benefits that we offer to the proof collectible spillover into the actual moon birds but there'll be other unique things that we do for that community that are just different like i'll give you an example and this isn't one that we we have to offer but it's an example of how we're thinking like we have a little member that has a little space helmet on it right there's probably going to be a hundred 150 of those it'll and there's a world where we take an attribute combined with the nesting time and we tie it to something that you can do so in this example like we know people that work at spacex so we do a spacex tour every year for the people that have that particular attribute so you can think about attributes actually being used in the reward system as well so we have a moon bird that's going to have a little grail on top of its head so we have all kinds of things like that we have one that's glitch that looks like a little glitch type thing and you can imagine we have certain glitch artists that we know that would that would play into some of that type of uh airdrop type mechanic so it's really having fun it moon birds is all about having fun and then it all ties back to proof of conference which is our big yearly conference that's launching next year that's gonna be a multi-thousand person event and we'll have all the boomer holders and proof collective all come together for that great speakers and of course we've got the best person in the world to throw those events right here it's gonna be fun it'll be the best nft conference in the world i mean it's to be a blast i do want to point out the moon bird holders will be able to access the proof discord but in a token gated channel so part of what we're trying to do is is encourage people to rub shoulders you know moonbird holders want to rub shoulders with proof holders we want the alpha well yeah we i think we want them to be able to experience that um and get to know each other and start to see like what are proof holders like and what's going on in there but we have to protect you know proof collectives you know uh all the benefits we offer them so which will be just for the proof collective members like their access to a lot of our original collections that we put out like grails that will still remain with the proof collective so there's going to be a lot of those kind of exclusive things that will stay within proof collective but you know we think about moon birds on that fun side as sort of like it's a playground for us it's a product playground to take mechanics that sound intriguing to us that we kind of think up and really kind of put it to use because i mean there were times where we were ideating on even the proof collective pass what do we want to do with it you know what kind of mechanics do we want to introduce and you know we've put a lot of rigor into trying to determine they're like that doesn't feel like proof's brand though like the collective brand that's that's not where we want to go with this particular thing but it's a great utility it's a great idea moon birds for us has been amazing because we haven't even talked about all of the things that we've kicked around and like you know theoretically whiteboard oh what if you did this or like what if what if we could try out these things and that is going to be the platform you should mention high-rise because that that's a big piece of this we have we have something called project highrise which is our take on the metaverse and that's a very loaded term metaverse and there's a lot of crap out there that's called metaverse we don't want to create this endless expansive 3d world where you have to find your mouse cursor by hitting escape and all this weird stuff like it's it's ours is going to be different and moon bird's holders will have a front row seat to that so they will have access to all that stuff so there will be bigger broader projects that moon birds people get to participate in so it's not just about the proof collective getting everything can you say more about what highrise and your metaverse will be since we have a sense of what it won't be yeah um that's a good question we're trying to figure out uh how much to share on this front because we we are in the ideation kind of stage of it and we want to kick off at least enough development work to where we can get a v1 out there very soon um i can tell you that when we do launch it it'll be very much in the public in kind of alpha and beta so you'll see iteration and launches it won't be one of the problems i have with the metaverse on a lot of these projects is that there is a ton of capital they have no clue how to do software development they've never done build products before and then you see our metaverse is coming in three years and you're like is that gonna really happen or not you know it's like so we're gonna get something out this year and and iterate on it you'll see new pushes going live every couple weeks and our thinking is like let's make this about a way to come together have conversation around nfts and collections so it's like if uh the old school sims met discord meets like something else and has like geocities and like has a baby or something so it's like all right in i'll go i'll come back um it's going to be it's going to be fun it'll be less complex than all the other metaverses out there but by design so that it just like you come in and get an mvp out see what's working see what people like iterate and you i think this team has the credibility that you guys can do that because you have a public enough platform to to signal that that's what you're doing right so like hey don't take this as like the final version of what all this will be you know you can you can signal that properly and then um so i think i think that makes sense i i think what people need to understand is that we're very serious about community so we're building everything on this foundation of real relationships that have real value and i'm just going to read one of the posts um in our discord from justin versano who's one of the world's most famous nft photographers and he said grateful to be a part of one of the most innovative and tightly knit discord ever made proof for life and that that feeling and that foundation is what we're going to roll out to to the moon birds discord that's what we're going to roll out to high raise like real value real curation and so we don't see high rise as being this expansive massive place we actually want curation and care and and quality yeah it's when you go into some of these metaverses i'm sure you've done this too it's like you look around and you're like what is is anything happening here there's like these empty things you can literally run in the woods for like a while yeah you can get lost yeah and there's no purpose outside of like an nft gallery show or something which makes sense so like everything that we do is gonna have a actual real purpose on why it should exist and not just because like i feel like second life and all these things the 3d worlds have been built before when zuckerberg went on stage and showed people in vr playing virtual chess i was like okay they don't get it like like nobody needs to sit in vr dude that was in his last pitch literally two people were saying across from each other playing chess and i'm like i was doing that in aol in like 97. like we don't need to reinvent that again like we can do better so that's that's our hope it's increasingly obvious that everything will become tokenized and nft marketplaces needs robust financial reporting performance analysis and the peace of mind that they are

over your crypto do you all really not think this is going to sell out at 2.5 eth and i'll give a little context before you guys answer that so the mechanism here it's a dutch auction that's how you did proof collective ryan you made reference earlier to the fact that you thought it was going to sell out at five eth i think it ended up selling out proof collective auction at one eight this dutch auction will be starting at 2.5 eth you've said on a couple twitter spaces you don't expect it to sell out there momentum question is really no like a real talk like a lot of momentum has gained since then yeah and so i don't i don't know i i we'll see i can i will say one thing no matter what it sells out at people should know um that a hundred percent of this capital is going back into building it goes back into the company not into our pockets none of us walk away with anything from the bag and like go do something with it like it's it's all going right back into how we're building and how we're structuring and i think that is a key difference is like we're not building a just a project to collect money and then figure out what to do with it like we want to build a lasting company that stays around and continues to make incredible products across web 3. yeah if we don't make the top five pfps like i think we have a shot at the top five in terms of because ours is just so uniquely different and i know what our roadmap looks like and it's like we're going after the bigs in this space like we're not just doing it just to do another little tiny thing on the side and then you know cash out that's not there's no interest in that like we we're all in yeah we've all built big ish companies had great exits and like we don't need another little single like we want to swing for the fences here and do something massive so how does building a company in the web 3 space feel different from building it in the web 2 space and i have even more specific questions on that but let's start broad and see where you guys go it's so much more fun i mean oh my god to have like all like a community that just loves your product and is your biggest fans and is involved in the success of the i mean it's just well let me ask you about the flip side of that which is i think about what you guys are doing you have a little bit of venture money i know and then you have you know you're putting all the money that's coming from the community back in where my head goes it's like oh my god all the stakeholders like it feels like it's it's scarier because you have you have the proof collective community now you're going to have the moon birds community you have your venture community like does that scare y'all at all it wins in what way like like there's so many people that now expect something from you and like the the the you know it's fun the venture company wants to continue to mark it up in their books and the community wants the value and i guess these all work in in alignment but well the good news is i'm a partner at the venture company that we raise the money from you are in a unique position we're okay there yeah um i i will say that um the the thing that you're right there is a lot of expectation along with it the reason why everyone that you've met so far on the team the small team that we have um we're all kind of seasoned vets and product builders and entrepreneurs and ceos and like we've we've done this before so we're we're careful not to bite off too much we know kind of where our limits are and we also know that hiring rock stars are the way to build and scale this thing like we need the absolute best talent so we're being very selective at who we hire and who we bring on and like you know we've run big organizations i had 500 people that were um when i was at google plus i didn't even say google plus i was only for a couple months but like i've worked in in very large organizations and seen from the inside of google when i was there for for three years how to run and scale those large engineering organizations and like we've all kind of had our tours of duty in very similar type environments and we're bringing that experience to go and roll this out so you're right in that we want to make sure to not over promise so we've been kind of like talking broadly about the things that we want to do but we'd rather like under promise and over deliver and that that first and foremost starts with high quality people that are working on the team so um you know that's that's our main focus over the next few months is how can we hire the absolute best folks and there's the community side where you know you've talked it's all about community and i think we've tried to be really communicative with our particularly right now it's the proof collective community sharing our intentions where we're going you know projecting road maps if there's any changes just trying to be transparent and i think what i've seen you know to the credit of the community is when somebody has questions and they voice that in the discord it's never met with just throwing anybody down calling it fudd or anything it's literally like cool here's some great perspectives here's somebody sharing their perspective on it i think this is the intention of why we would go here this is what i think and like we've tried to be open and remain you know and read what's going on interject at times but also just listen to other people that are in the discord i've got a great example that'll take two seconds there was there was somebody was like you got this is when we're getting ready to launch moon birds like maybe like three weeks ago they're like you don't have a marketing plan for this how are you guys gonna do this like blah blah blah this is happening in the discord and it was a fair question you know they were just like i i don't know like are you really gonna like make this thing a big reality nobody knows about proof like it's an echo chamber in here ryan took a screenshot of our notion document that showed our marketing plans which is line by line which podcasts were appearing on which different um influencers that were using all like everything and dropped it everyone's like oh and then and then they go stop marketing stop marketing because this is something i was going to ask about because you you know proof collective was very stealth it felt like you know i was vaguely aware of it but like i can't believe i wasn't more aware of it given i listen to your show whatever right and so how has it changed this time around and now it feels like it's overkill it's hilarious i mean people said nobody knows about moon birds like i'm i'm in all these discords and literally nobody knows like people don't even know what proof is and and then we said okay well wait just just like just wait and we did one twitter space and kevin has 1.6 million followers right so i was like okay we gotta we gotta spin it up from your account let's go and let's just talk about the project and like during the twitter space we started to see proof passes fly and it's like oh that's that's cool and we don't talk about floor um we we talk about quality but that was fun and then all of a sudden everyone came back and said oh my god everyone's talking about moon birds and i was like cool well we're gonna continue the plan i've got us booked in these shows let's go we gotta we got accused today of buying bots for our moonlight there was like somebody who was like i don't know this looks really fishy it was like 1500 not like two mondays or something like that and then now 50. no we broke 60k yeah just today we were talking i mean and people are now scared that you know it's going to be a massive gas warranty and that's fair that's fair yeah then it probably will be and it's like well i okay well i love that you guys made the decision you made a decision not to do an allow list which i i thought was really smart because i feel like the the initial conception of allow lists was around to avoid gas wars but then in theory the detection is supposed to avoid the gas war right so it's like okay cool they're doing the dutch auction that avoids the gas for not doing an allow list because if you're doing an allow list for any reason other than the gas where reason it really does just become like an insider's club and i think not doing it is super smart but now i'm like well now i feel like we're back to the gas right exactly and then we can't raise the price because that's just like people will be pissed and that's fair that i would be pissed too if i'm sitting there thinking i'm gonna so it's it's really tough but pricing has been difficult because it's like okay well if we undercut pricing and go for the low end then chances are we're gonna get other behaviors that not necessarily what we're looking for whether it's you know a bunch of people getting it and they're like this is a hotly you know hotly contested project like i know i'm just gonna go and just get as many as i can and flip them and so it's like no matter what the decision is you're either gonna price people out or you're gonna opportune people out where it's just they can't get in in like a certain amount of time and so all of these decisions like we're trying to weigh all of the competing ideas and principles that we have and trying to figure out what's a way that makes sense at least the best shot to get you know either a diverse group or thinking about equitable opportunity for the people to jump in because i mean we've shared this with the proof collective our intention for this project is absolutely to expand the community to bring new voices and more people that can you know meet one another can can either you know build their knowledge base or just build a brand around you know being in the web three states or just be more known and you know the idea is not that you know everybody in the the proof collected discord just you know everybody grabs ten of them and like that so they're all gone we purposely there's a couple things we've done we put a limit of two macs per wallet and the uh obviously people can find their way around that yeah and then the other thing we did is we have a bunch of like anti-bot technology that divergence is building so there are smart contract partners on this um they've been fantastic they've done all the drops that we've done so far and so they are going to go and they just spun up a bunch of stuff uh on the google cloud that they're using for anti-botting that they we can't talk about today because obviously they'll just find their way around it but they're pretty confident they're gonna stop some of the bigger bots from coming in and doing mass mints with some of this stuff so we're trying we're trying to slow things down a bit okay a couple a couple bigger picture questions i want to have you back all all on individually at some point so i can really dive deep with you guys uh because there's so much i think you can bring in terms of wisdom in general you've been talking about community ryan and one thing i thought was fascinating in an interview i heard you do actually with kevin many years ago was at treehouse you experimented with like a no hierarchy thing and it sounded essentially like a dow i mean to the point there you had software like you you had built products or had you know whatever you had done to make this to try and make this work i want you to talk about your experience with that because i think it's very interesting so the thought was well why do you need managers you know our people are smart you know people work hard you know so let's remove all the managers so we did that if you hire good people they'll be motivated i mean you were following a book though right wasn't there a book that was written on this um oh yeah uh so i think tony shea yeah tony was doing it first zappos yeah yeah and i'm pretty sure i got the idea from him yeah and i was like yeah this makes sense like i people are i inherently believe people are good so i'm like okay um so we i we we announced it to the company and said okay we're going to remove all the managers you know don't worry you managers are going to stay you just go back to being ics um and you know we were probably like 100 people at this point um and we built a piece of software it's called convoy which was basically reddit and the idea was you'd make a proposal and you'd talk about the resources you need and people would vote and like what got voted got done and it was a disaster i mean it just it was fun for like a month and then i was like oh my god i can't control the company like we can't do anything we can't get anything done it turns out like the popular forceful people control things anyway because they influence everybody um so we unwound it so what how does that influence your feeling or opinions on daos well i think we all believe in like strong opinionated leadership like i think i'm not super bullish on dao is like running things quickly but you're in flamingo so yeah i'm in a handful of them and i would say that when it comes to having really um very smart uh motivated financially committed people to these investment dows they tend to bring like their a game when they come and bring ideas to the table um and it's i think dao's had to be very careful about kind of who they vote in to that community or who they allow into that that community because it's it's almost like you're only as good as your your weakest loudest link and in in flamingo's case it is the most hardcore kind of like investor um like nft collectors that that that i've seen in terms of a financial doubt that's been put together i mean there's over a billion dollars of nfts under management at flamingo and they've run a very tight ship but there's two people at the top there aaron and pre that kind of orchestrate everything so still you know it's it's not there's voting on should we buy this nft or not or a collection of this nft or the allocation of these nfts but um you know there's still someone kind of like making sure the way i like to think of it is it's almost like um the kids bowling alley when like they flip up the little the paddles on the side like the ball makes it all the way through the end it's gonna bounce around a lot as it's going down the alleyway but like it always makes it through to the right spot and like that's kind of what you have going on and so you know there's examples of centralized leadership like the iphone would have never been the iphone had it not gone through a very tight group of people that had a very specific opinion on how something should be built i mean we saw what all these devices looked like prior to that they were just a hodgepodge of like crap that were out there you know so um in terms of what we like to do and what we've done so far is that we kind of set the agenda for what we want to go out and build and we want to surprise people with some things i think so far with like grails and other products that we've homegrown people have liked that surprise of like oh this is new and unique but in terms of shaping the community and who we are from that standpoint like we're all ears to like bottoms up and help mold that community and then for in individual little things um i i love taking input and then bringing that back to the the team that is making the decisions so when you go out for attributes that you want uh included into something or pieces of functionality um like the way that i that i found we used to do this at dig that worked quite well back in the day is that we would have five things we were working on at any given time and then two of those five were communities suggested and then we would stack rank all the community ones and we would slot those in so we still got to do what we wanted to do and we still listened to the community and built what they wanted as well and they were like another seat at the table so you don't treat them as someone that has complete control over everything but you definitely give them a collective seat at the table to help shape what you're doing and that so far has been amazing and i think that will work well for us okay we are essentially at time i one thing i will have you back on because i i there's something that really stuck out to me you i was saying this before we kicked off here kevin you were tim ferriss's first guest on the tim ferriss show which is a very fun fact i think um and you all were talking about twitter at the time and you were saying that one of the you know one of the things that made you invest in twitter was part of its moat was that the the followers weren't portable right and that you know you couldn't take them anywhere which is so fascinating now given being in web 3 decentralization take your followers anywhere and in general business models that are trying to be disrupted with decentralization and how does that change like the investing calculus as a vc is anything can you exit a company like that like there's a lot of philosophical questions i have that really don't have time to get into i don't know if you have like a quick reaction to that but uh that'll be the teaser for when i somehow convince y'all to come back on no we should we should do a deep dive on that there's a lot to chat about there i mean i think um well two things come to mind and then you can tell me if there's something else you want me to attack on top of this but one is that i do this like this idea of providing some type of liquidity mechanism for um especially in the defy space for a lot of these projects so a lot of that's happening via via token and governance tokens and things of that nature so that's interesting that allows investors typically investors will have like token rights as part of their investment it's like andrews and horowitz unit swap exactly they'll come in they'll have some token rights that's one piece of it um the other thing what were you talking about before that the the twitter twitter portability decentralization and website yeah so what we're building so i think made the best product win at the end of the day and so when we build metaverse stuff like when we're talking about the stuff that we're building it's going to be 100 portable into any other metaverse that that supports it so you know we're not about blocking access and i think at the end you just have to build a fantastic experience that delights your customers which are your users and if they stick around that's great and they want to take their assets somewhere else and use them elsewhere then that's fine too such an interesting evolution in business thought though right that that it was we have to be so close we have to be protected that's our moat right well it's community ownership it's community ownership and you're finally saying you're part of this the next disney will not be top down we're making toy story seven it's gonna be about some type of pfp coming in and developing iep that is community owned and then it'll be bottoms up built which is fascinating as a media company well and this actually happened in proof so we had a group of proof members that were bullish on proof and they actually created a dow to raise money to buy more proof members and and the truth is we couldn't stop it like we didn't want to stop it but that's the beauty of actual ownership the community owns their passes we can't control them yeah and and i thought that was actually kind of a neat example of these are actually owned by our members yeah well we didn't even get into rights i'm i'm really fascinated by how i p rights will play out in this space over time and what hello sunshine is doing you know partnering with world of women that are owned by these individuals i think all that's gonna be fascinating i know you guys have said it on twitter space moon birds the individual moon bird you will own it you will own the ip rights i think more will be revealed on that front yeah it sounds like okay actual last question how did you get to the term moon birds i've heard you justin talk about the art i think people should go listen to twitter space you hear about that but how did the name come to be we had a long notion dock full of a bunch of different names and we just like i remember we were up like at night texting i was like sitting on the couch with wine and like it was just like and then i i really was like moon birds it sounds kind of cool that was your idea though yeah yeah it came free but it was just this long list of a bunch of them so yeah we all loved it yeah and then it just kind of stuck love it well thank you all so much i uh really appreciate you hopping on and your your busy media schedule i know you got you run a tight ship here so thank you for having us i really appreciate it and we'd all love to come back on at some point i would love it again there's a lot of just big picture questions that i would love to pick all your brains on so
