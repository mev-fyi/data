kickstarter created a new piece of infrastructure it was a new model for how to fund work it was a new model for how the public could be involved in a work or could validate a work to this date it's like six billion dollars have flown through to creative projects through kickstarter i believe something like that there was four years of us going around and pitching the idea of what now people call crowdfunding four years of pitching without anything to point to and it would take forever to explain what crowdfunding was and then when you would show someone a webpage it took less than 10 seconds people like oh why didn't you tell me and i'm like i was you know we were trying we're trying it's just some some things are easier to experience than explain i see kickstarter as no one knew that there needed to be a door there and then one appeared and that door represented a way for creative people to go straight to their audiences to get support
