so ethereum in 2032 you have a note your node runs on your phone every 12 seconds or 32 seconds or whatever number we agree on you download 3.6 megabytes of data you hash it you do a couple of elliptic curve equations to check a snark that's it you know the block is valid wait 12 seconds get 33.6 megabytes of data hash it do some elliptic curve operations verify the snark and valid 12 seconds later data hash elliptic curve check that one right so the whole process just becomes incredibly sleek and seamless to the point where like literally a phone could even do it right because it's incredibly light on computation the only thing that it's heavy on is data and data just happens to be the thing that you know phones are increasingly getting insanely good and it will get even better at over the next 10 years right so that to me is what I see the final goal being from a protocol standpoint
