what's up coordination how you doing on the pod today we have peter who's going to talk about upala upala is a protocol that creates civil resistance on chain more specifically it sort of aggregates identity systems and then creates a crypto economic game where any user can consume their identity and add it to a blacklist in exchange for some amount of reward and what this does from a crypto economic perspective is that it starts to play with this idea of of price of forgery so basically price of forgery of an of a digital identity is sort of an upper bound on the economic gains that you could attach to that identity in a civil resistance type of system and in this episode we talk about apollo what is what is it why peter got so into civil resistance how git coin passport nupala could be interoperable and what is the beautiful vision of a coordinating world that is going to be created by impala digital identity systems so this episode is a little bit technical and into the weeds if you're deep on sible resistance then i think that you're going to enjoy it if you are not then it might be one that well it's up to your judgment whether or not it's for you or not but i think the upside of civil resistance and digital identity is quite big that's why we're doing a whole season on regenerative society so i hope that you enjoy this episode with peter from upala immutable x is

resistance matters for you uh well uh i started this idea as one of the things that is super important for peace and and now it became real even more important so i have this crazy idea that small people can coordinate and that small people can have real power against their own governments you're saying my magic word coordination yeah got it but but why civil resistance so basically the idea is that civil resistance is important for coordination in some way yes civil resistance is like close super closely knit with digital identity and unique human so if we are talking about creating real decentralized digital identity that is a substitute for government ids so we just automatically talk about civil resistance got it okay yeah i mean the way i've been saying it is that civil resistance enables a whole ecosystem of one human one vote dows quadratic voting quadratic funding genie coefficient measurements ubi like like talking about the the uh use cases that it enables is my way of talking about the why and then you can get back to the what which is the digital identity so i know how does that how does that resonate with you yeah totally uh i i'd also uh would say that this is just just a very very deep the very the highest tip of the iceberg because having a real digital identity on blockchain like um [Music] unlocks uh digital governments which is super powerful thing we can't even imagine i think right now what are they all the advantages of this transition we already have bitcoin and digital currencies which like break government monopolies on currencies on money and and the other big monopoly of governments is identity so we can try and uh break this monopoly yeah yeah i i sort of come to it from an angle of what's the utility that could be brought to end users with digital identity systems and for me you know i mentioned all of those things uh and and um you know i think there's two ways of coming at it there's breaking the monopoly of governments which is more the cypherpunk way of saying it and then the solar punk way of saying it is how do we coordinate better how do we give give value to public goods and you know it's interesting to hear it from your side uh where you're coming from so so so let's pull the thread more tell us about your founding of uh who what does upola mean what does it do what you're what are you trying to do with it um like uh are we talking about the whole protocol or just the word impala yeah let's let's let's start in wherever it feels natural for for you and then let's let's cover all those things eventually okay uh yeah i would just i think that's uh like cool to mention that umbala means a precious stone it's a sanskrit word um and specifically an opal uh which is like a beautiful stone with intricate intricate structure inside and i think that's a analogy of a human society so it's beautiful we all knit together we all of us are friends um no human is a like and yeah there is nothing against one another when just single people meet each other so yeah that's an opal that's a beautiful beautiful it reminds me of like positive some games that we could create with coordination and and having it instantiated as a gem is sort of a beautiful way of thinking about it yeah and also apollo logo and opal around a spherical opal looks like earth so that's another beautiful like thing to inside great beautiful so so to take us further down the rabbit hole uh oop how does it deliver civil resistance so it doesn't actually provide single resistance it uh now i tend to start explaining apollo more in terms of quality control of human verification method methods so upala is like a layer above any other human verification method or in perfect world in my perfect world all of them so that it can quality control different human verification methods and combine them under single standard of price of forgery uh like here let's segue to this price of forgery uh term so what upala basically provides is this uh price of forgery uh let's say parameter of a human verification method so with kupala we can assess how much does it cost to forge an account of a human who passed like several or one human verification method and the protocol does that through market dynamics right so it's a way of sort of aggregating on top of digital identity systems and then generating a crypto economic game that guarantees a certain amount of cost of forgery for an id for an identity um i want to dig in on the cost of forgery there why cost to forge really why not why not just say this user is a civil attacker or or not uh why is cost of forgery such an important primitive in this system uh like that's that's the major feature main feature of apollo this price of forgery uh and cool thing about it is that it's not binary of course uh no i i mean one of the cool things is that it's it is not binary and why is it it is non-binary and why it is so cool is that it is derived by market forces so there is no algorithm behind apollo there is only this incentive and all the rest is on the market uh so just just a couple of words of how on how price of forgery even works uh so yeah well so impala consists of groups uh you can also say that a group is formed around a human verification method so let's say we are a group manager and we create an apollo group around sms verification then we say that any person who passes sms verification can access that group and can get a score within that group and the manager sets that score and for example for sms verification let's say we say that the score is one dollar so everyone who's who passed sms verification gets the one dollar score within that group from then uh we see [Music] the so-called explosions uh or liquidations gopala protocol allows anyone who passed into a group to liquidate their id for an amount of money equal to their score so in our case if someone got into sms verification group with one dollar score they can get away get out of it and get there one dollar for like breaking so the verification method and from here we can start discovering by changing this score at what at what cost at what at what score users get into that group just for the money if we start with one dollar and see that there is not many users coming in we can assume that we can safely increase the score a bit and then we do it and if we don't see explosions for liquidations again liquidations we can increase it again and so this way we for example come up with a score of five dollars for everyone who passes sms verification at at this point it turns out that we attracted a lot of bots so they start so they start passing a sms certification just for this five dollars and then we need to decrease the price so this way we can gradually come up with the real market the price of forgery for the sms verification so so let me say back to you what i heard in in a i'll summarize for the listener and i'm curious if i got it mostly right so the reason why we center off cost of forgery is that uh the web is an adversarial game there's the red team there's the blue team and the red team like people are always gonna be basically trying to forge identities if there's going to be rewards on the other side of having that identity but you've got a spectrum of sophisticatedness of your attackers all the way from script kitties which maybe just downloaded some script to forge something to organize crime which is maybe more sophisticated they're producing software to nation states like north korea and so the cost of forgery to keep each of these baddies out is different and the way that you do that with apollo is that you've built a crypto economic game where people can build an identity through various identity systems and then there's like a honey pot where they can consume that identity and get the cost and get that value so like if i've verified with sms just use your example and apollo thinks that sms has a five dollar cost of forgery then i can always consume that identity and get five dollars back and therefore we know crypto economically that that that verification mechanism has about that much of cost of forgery because if it was more than the user would have consumed it already is it am i getting close at all anywhere you want to correct me on that summary yeah i think that that is correct uh we have single or price of forgery for all users so it's okay if someone doing it manually or someone doing it um like with some sophisticated software we assume that [Music] it doesn't matter and um actually a group manager will decide what rate of liquidations they can bear so that could be for example like 10 people a day or it's a thousand people a day so i think 10 10 maybe there should be some some limit because people maybe get hacked or i don't know just just making mistakes so we need to have this limit right okay got it so uh i think i i was just summarizing what you had told me and then uh you know i'm curious what's next in your presentation you know take us further down the the apollo rabbit hole so this this primitive this price of forgeries uh thing allows for multiple uh multiple use cases so one is assessing uh different human verification methods uh and another is aggregating so that we can for example assess sms verification github accounts verification facebook and have this multiple groups who curates users directly and now we can create groups that curate other groups so they don't create users directly and those groups can potentially have very high price of forgery costs basically unlimited we can have for example a price of forgery of million dollars maybe for some super reputation heavy services like oracles nodes and stuff like that maybe judges so that we require them to pass a lot of human verification methods with high cut price of forgery and by the way in in this in this uh uh in this area like fala is and price of forgery concept is a lot better than passports because passports have their limited price of forgery uh which is also unknown uh and we can do unlimited stuff got it okay and you know what what kind of stuff can we do you said unlimited stuff so what kind of stuff can we do yeah as i said like very reputation okay these uh things like jurors like all the an analogy of national state uh uh like authorities on blockchains on blockchain right so that i mean that feels like governance to me you know it feels like governance of this system is going to be something that's pretty important to design elegantly on the on the back of it yeah i think so i think so as well but i don't know where that would go probably there are there are other super cool unique human methods around there being developed right now so we'll see yeah it feels like we're in this primordial soup in which everyone knows digital identity is important but no one's really figured out how to build a sound digital identity system that's privacy preserving and sovereign and that delivers utility to a user and we're just kind of like on that precipice so it's exciting once it starts happening but i think everyone doesn't know really know which systems to bet on and which ones to integrate on so you know i i guess i guess i'm wondering as you may have seen get coin which i've since just affiliated from get coin from leadership in get coin but i'm still like contributing from the edges uh git coin announced git coin passport last week which is basically a way of getting different stamps from different identity verification systems and basically the the the idea is to inform the trust bonus that you get on git coin grants when you contribute to a git coin grants round you know i'm wondering if anyone from get going dial is listening to this or if anyone who's just following digital identity in the ecosystem and needs civil resistance is listening to this how might they integrate with upala in order to derive the civil resistance or the identity signals that are that are coming out of apollo yeah i um basically i'm developing right now upala just for bitcoin as like first user yeah right i think we have uh the most the the most possible synergy behind the projects uh so uh as as i see it uh the the coolest advantage of using price of forgery concept and apollo for bitcoin is evaluating different human verification methods that are already there that are involved in trust bonus calculation so with upali and price of forgery concept we can assess them at least [Music] like from the quality side how they relate to each other and [Music] at most we will find the actual price of forgery for all those methods right and that will be and that would be beneficial for the whole ecosystem yeah if we find out that those we if we find out that bright id has like thousand dollars price of forgery that would mean a lot i think yeah so it feels like one of the things that i've sort of learned from this this space is that you can build like the perfect most like academically sound civil resistance tool or identity tool but if no one ever uses it it never really has an impact on the world so there's this cycle between impact and usage and and maybe one of the ways that getcoin which has a bunch of usage and is still getting civil resistance and apollo which has this beautiful system for creating costs to forge we can work together is by integrating so bitcoin will send users over to apollo and then apollo will issue civil resistance back and forth and it kind of becomes this positive some synergistic relationship from there and you know i'm not sure other ways to set it up for success but i know that the get coin dial is working on adding a lot of stamps to passport right now and so maybe there's an opportunity there sure for sure that's that's a great opportunity yeah well i'm realizing now as i'm asking these questions that i'm basically representing the stakeholders who listen to get coined out here but maybe not representing the rest of the ecosystem all that well so say i'm a member of the ecosystem that has done some degen stuff has done some dao stuff and i'm interested in getting an upal id like what what can i do now is there a website that i can go to and and how would i onboard into the system now uh for right now deployed uh deployed only mvp part so it meant to be totally invisible for users so at this stage we are concerned only with uh price of forgery of only with discovering this uh price of forgery stuff and i also don't like there is no no such there is no user interface now so [Music] we will only like aggregating information now right and uh yeah and there is no no for for a user there's no such thing as apollo id there is upali id only for those who want to liquidate and mvp actually is called group managers versus bots so it's only for this uh this battle so it's the first battle of bots and group managers got it are all but so not all civil attackers are bots though i don't know if anyone's seen these pictures of people that have like a hundred cell phones in front of them and you basically pay someone like ten dollars an hour in order to go through and in civil attack all these things right so as far as i know it's not always bots to to me it's like it's the same thing it's uh it's not it's not a human so it's about got it not a real account anyway no no matter what tech is under the hood uh is it like men on a bicycle or or a script yeah got it so so what i heard from your answer there is that uh upala is running its first sort of like red team blue team exercise uh red team blue team just means adversaries that are attacking a crypto economic system and the blue team is like the defenders of the system and and and that's happening very soon it sounds like uh yeah uh upali is ready and all this need right now all is needed is just to like export all users uh to upala and put some funds in the pool and see the explosions the liquidations got it and start this this price of forgery discovery yeah mechanism no no okay so say in a hypothetical future that i am a bitcoin grant user i've set up my passport in order to contribute to get coin grants there's uh there's basically a data export that would be on the back end for for the passport where some of the the privacy preserving user information would be uploaded into paula and then anyone could go in and could sort of consume and liquidate their identity from there and so is is that more or less correct yeah like just just exporting data some publish somewhere our intentions to create honeypot for bots and like try to attract more as more as as much but as many bots as we can right so um do you think it's only going to be bots or adversaries that are going to want to consume their identities like say i'm kavanaugh and i started get coin and because of that i have a ton of cost of forgery because i've been doing stuff on chain for four years like what if i just want to make 200 bucks and i want to consume my my identity or something like that you know is that a use case that you've kind of thought through uh so i'm i'm currently trying to figure out the ways that uh price of forgery mechanism could be more even more helpful for git coin because uh i now separate this uh like this price of forgery stuff like how much does it cost to forge those accounts and there is another thing which is extracted value from bitcoin uh so what are you hunting for for bitcoin value or for this price of forgery value and how they are connected there is some there should be some like sim i think there's there is some simple connection and we can somewhat some way extract keep some at least some kpi from there but it's totally fine if someone will try to to explode or liquidate their id so i think it's okay to have some liquidations and i hope we will have um more liquidations from both sides so that we can have some statistics some better statistics right okay yeah i was just sort of curious about that that economic game like some people aren't attacking the system but once they realize there's a 300 airdrop on the other end of of of things they would just consume their identity because you know maybe maybe that's that's a payday for them they gotta meet some short-term need but i think that basically there has to be a consequence to doing that so maybe you can't contribute to bitcoin grants or anything in the bitcoin passport network anymore once you've consumed that id and you're kind of like blacklisted you're starting from zero again from there so that's that's what comes to mind for me but that that's definitely so so but it's on the it's not on the palace side the pilot will just tell you who who liquidated and for how much and then you decide what you can do with this address in the future so will you not like will you refuse this address to register or maybe you will require them to refund yeah and get their get their id back maybe some people being hacked or yeah liquidated by mistake this feels really synergistic to get coin grants where basically there's three million dollars worth of economic activity over time and there's the there's a whole infrastructure there of of stamps and passports and there's a fraud analysis team that's analyzing these things but it almost feels like a really interesting like diplomatic tool between the blue team and the red team to just be able to put out this honey pop it's like hey yeah here's 100 bucks if you can get to this and then you basically but what you're doing is the it's a honey pot so the civil attackers are revealing themselves to the blue team and over time the blue team gets stronger because of that and in a short term it feels like you're giving up a lot by giving up a hundred dollars but on the long term adversarial game you're actually gaining a lot in in way of insights by setting up this game sure sure and both both sides will increase their technologies but that would actually mean that we have a higher price of forgery over time so we we will have better tools to find bots and bots will constantly improve their skills so it's like uh in in the long term it should increase it should always increase price of forgery and by the way uh you oh like from from your side i hear the term cost of forgery um and from my side it's price of forgery so maybe i should like describe some more here some thoughts um right yeah so say more about the difference between those two things yeah yeah i would say that uh the the right term is price of forgery um as like as it is mentioned in this paper called uh who watches the watchman oh that's that that one's cannon by paula berman berman and uh insanti from proof of humanity we basically built built the whole get coin trust bonus system off of that but uh okay i will update my uh update the way i speak about it then if you think that that's the right way to go uh yeah we uh wrote this paper together and um i really like think that the right the difference is that cost of forgery doesn't assume some like profit for the bot so if we are exploding just for the cost of forgery we don't get the profit but if we explode for the price of forgery we have this like margin and we have this profit but yeah that's that's an open question actually right but i think the better the better term would be a price of forgery the opera crypto browser is the world's first web browser built for the crypto community with web3

attending ecc visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of refi from industry experts so so take us further down this rabbit hole i mean what else is there to discover in the poly universe you know what continues to drive you working on this what's next uh where's your head at uh yeah the um i think it's good to mention other use cases possible what i foresee in the nearest future so when we um when we pass this stage of mvp and start with uh opal the real lopal id that could be used in services uh we already have by the way this uh domain multipassport.if you can remember that and try from time to time if it is working so when we have this ux other use cases uh besides quality control is of course score providing uh so that opala can be used in like bitcoin uh like bitcoin passport it can it would could it would be possible to use a policy id in other apps it will also be possible to use for so this is the score provider use case the other use case is core consumer uh is on on the app side and another use case is score prosumer this is bitcoin uh meaning that you digest different human verification methods and then provide your own better score based on some uh other interactions within your cloud platform so this is cor prosuming then there is other stuff uh which i call identity bridge uh with apollo we can instantly bridge other identity systems to any other blockchain starting with ethereum for example we can instantly bridge bright id to ethereum or bridge idina to ethereum or any other blockchain really instantly then there is a cool use case of using mobile id as collateral uh right now we only can have eight un over collateralized loans on ethereum but with apollo we can like stake our id and say that if we don't repay our loan please liquidate liquidate me and get your money and this unlocks this collateral stuff right so quite an expansive set of primitives it seems like the different people building on regenerative society decentralized society could do bridging from chain to chain the ability to consume scores the ability to create scores at at scale what does this sort of hyper structure look like you know what's what's sort of your 10 year vision if you're maximally successful in 10 years what it what what does the world look like how does it differ well uh like super successful uh scenario is having real digital identities or identities and of course governments so that that's the hope to let people coordinate and i think that's really comes in alignment with what blockchains can do so what the way i see blockchains is that we scaling the whole world to down to the level of a tribe so that we can have same relations as we had when we lived in tribes so there meaning trustless and we have repeated games right between each other so there's a there's sort of a dunbar's number thing in there where there's five people that i can have intimate relationships with 15 that i can have strong relationships 50 casual 500 i forget exactly what the upper limit of dunbar's number is but just basically envisioning the level of coordination that we've been able to have with smaller groups of people with larger groups of people once we have digital identity and more positive some creation games is sort of how i interpret your your vision for what could be what could be done here well yeah that yeah that's that's that's that's the goal to to scale down the um social institutes down to tribal level quite beautiful and i i think that there's just a lot of really opportunity here for building in the space but it seems like it's been really hard to get a lot of these digital identity systems going there's a network effect to them where the more people use them the more people use them the more d-apps use them the more people use them and so spinning that that network is i think what we the positive some game that getcoin and apollo and red id and proof of humanity and everyone else in this space can spin together i don't know if you have anything to say about that about that layer of the game oh yeah that's um that's again the beauty of blockchains because there is no competition i i really like you can't stop wondering how organically synergies emerge in blockchain space so we really we just can't cannot compete the only thing we can do is to cooperate on blockchain so the better system will be the the better systems we build the more all of us like benefit yeah and the whole society benefits too yeah is it do you think it's a change of system thing or is it a change of self thing uh or is it both oh that's a cool question uh i think that's that that's both and yeah i like i i think about it a lot and i think that's uh we live in very very interesting time like it's super singularity right now it's we i think humanity never had such a rapid change in social constructs uh in history so this blockchain stuff is like super changing yeah what makes me optimistic about it is that it's a fundamentally it feels like we're moving into this information age in which a lot of us are creators and consumers of information and there's our data is our labor and in the what we do on the internet is in a lot of ways our impact on the world and one of the things that makes me really excited about this digital identity and civil resistance stuff is that we're kind of building new not we but the web 3 space is kind of building new institutions that are going to be fundamentally future forward almost everything in the future of humanity is going to be internet connected and the opportunity to build high resolution democracy and social systems that support each other at web scale seems very high and there's this fertile crescent that is the ethereum and blockchain space which is where where those institutions are going to be built so i i think it's it's it's really going to be a big leap from the industrial age to the information age but it seems like there's high upside if if we make the leap for sure and i like the term high resolution democracy never heard that before that's yeah that's a cool term you got to subscribe to the green pill podcast i will yup all right well is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to talk about um [Music] well uh there's one one use case i didn't mention but it's like i might i consider it minor one it's better capture for web too like but probably it could be a huge uh use case in terms of getting user base yeah if we start from there we can like start attracting users from traditional web into web3 yeah yeah i think that there's a lot of opportunity there and and and the more that you can do once you have a web3 wallet the better and that's one of the upsides i see of these digital identity systems they don't cost much to set up a bright id or a bitcoin passport or proof of humanity but then once you're on the other side there's a bunch of cool stuff that you can do you can kind of take it's like a magic wand you can take and wave around and get utility yeah um there's one thing that actually comes to mind for me and that's that i've listened to vitalik talk a lot about in order to design systems that are anti-fragile in the information age you have to make it uh more cost efficient to defend those systems than to attack the systems yeah and and i'm wondering how you think about that in the context of civil resistance in apollo because uh it seems to me that you know with proof of stake this is where vitalik talks about you stake your 32 eth and it's more from there this system can slash you if or attest penalties if you do something that's not good and and that makes the system much much cheaper to defend than to attack and i'm wondering how you think about that within the context of civil resistance it seems like it's not scalable to give out hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of like bounties or liquidations in in return for these identities but maybe the data that you get creates like a new iteration of the game which makes it cheaper over time i don't know if you thought about it in these terms at all but this is one of the terms that i'm starting to think about these adversarial games within uh that's interesting actually i didn't think from from this side uh like i imagine apollo as a more like assessing tool for and they like [Music] the thing that creates this motivation to make the tools better the the simple resistance tool and bots tools so it's it's like it's on the side from from from this uh from this terminology yeah what i think is important is crea is creating is is creating some better stuff to manage your uh manage your accounts and your blockchain accounts and from that it will create better tools to managing your ids great that's that's the mode of thinking got it okay that's quite interesting well uh is there anything i didn't ask that you want to say i think i asked you that once already but then we went down this rabbit hole of efficiency so is there anything else that you want to say um [Music] no that's i think we covered pretty much uh yeah if anyone's interested uh please uh proceed to upon the dashboard and see there right and anyone can also have a call with me if you have ideas cool and where can people find you online twitter twitter handles domain names stuff like that yeah everything so i i will insert it or should i should i put it in the chat yeah that's my twitter yeah so maybe you say it out loud so that people are audio only can hear it and then we'll also put in the chat which will become the show notes okay uh it's my handle on twitter is part above underscore p so p o r o b o v underscore p uh peter for peter uh and upala uh it's the paula amazing well peter thanks so much for being on the green pill pod really bullish on digital identity and i know that you are also and hopefully we'll see get coin passport and apollo do an integration in the future and and uh looking forward to a very positive sum game on multi-levels here so thanks again that would be really really cool yeah let's let's move society to a better version of it yeah to a regenerative society yeah sure all right well thanks again yeah thank you thanks for having me bye-bye [Music]
