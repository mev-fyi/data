[Music] bankless nation happy second week of march this is your roll up david what are we doing today we are rolling up the second week of march it's always an ambitious endeavor in the world of crypto to condense a full week of news into as short of time period as possible and this is what we try and get done on the weekly rollups we talk about the markets what has happened in the last week of the markets we go into news what got what is in the news cycle in the last week and then we go into releases what got released in the last week and then we finish up with some eco system takes who had some good opinions in the last week of crypto and then we go into what david and ryan are excited about and last and my personal favorite the meme of the week to finish things off yup you come for the roll up you stay for the meme that's how it goes david you ready to get into the roll up let's roll it up ryan all right man hey before we do one thing we should mention to our listeners is that consensus is having a conference this is a bull market conference and there's only like five more days i think by the time you listen to this it might be four more days to get a ticket at a reduced price with a bankless code you can get that for 79 so make sure you check that out i will be going david ray dalio is going to be there you know what if he announced he was buying bitcoin at this conference i'm not saying that's going to happen but like what if you know you want to be there for that i want to be there for that you know it's more likely that he would because he's going right like why would ray dalio go to a crypto conference if he isn't intrinsically interested in crypto question mark wow this is how rumors start we don't know guys of course but check out that conference gonna be a lot of fun david let's get to markets what is bitcoin telling us this week it's not telling us that ray dalio purchased but it's telling us something good i have a feeling what's the price yeah bitcoin is really pushing again up a previous up against a previous all-time high it is at 57 474. what is that previous all-time high ryan if you uh go out into the longer time frames i think it's something like 58 something thousand dollars we we have oh there it is really close yeah there it is we're really close to the peak there so we we're almost climbing over 58 000 and we are just under that uh just a one more thousand dollar pump out of bitcoin and we could be seeing bitcoin all-time highs once again ether is not doing us any favors this week it's you know it's just hanging it's just hanging under 2 000. i'm going to celebrate that eth 2k again but not going to be this week where are we at and what's going on yeah ether price i think it's moving up off the floor pretty strongly struggling to keep itself above eighteen hundred dollars at the time of recording seventeen and a hundred dollars not i always mess that up one hundred and seven one thousand seven hundred and ninety six dollars is the easiest price uh and i i think it's in a little bit of a holding pattern but we are definitely uh moving up to two thousand dollars 4k by may question mark 4k 4k by mate well look your last call of it won't drop below 1300 kind of held so congrats on that perfectly held it went down to 1297 and then just got right back up there it did not like the 1200s sir sign me up for your hedge fund sir when you found that david's making the calls here all right let's we'll make some calls we've got uh total locked in d5 that is hold and steady as well over 40 billion though that's a lot locked in d5 anything you want to say about that or should we uh skip to uh dpi more d5 protocols more assets deposited into d5 protocols eventually we are going to resume this climb up this mountain and you know next up 100 billion dollars maybe i'm just a permabull you know what you are a permabull but it was crazy to me do you remember we had that conversation with vance from framework like way back over the summer and he was predicting total locked value and he said something like 100 billion would be like the low estimate of total locked value and now here we are at close to 50 billion right well done vance another guy who could you should start a fun with vance david fantastic uh podcast episode uh the bowl case for defy uh a hundred billion dollars locked in defy at the time of recording was a little bit absurd but now we're only a little bit over a doubling away from that and there's so much left in this bull market too dude our our previous podcasts were fire like if you listen to those even like um the bulk case for nfts has held up very strongly we recorded that back in the fall uh anyway go check out bagless archive you guys can see some of those predictions bank list doesn't age i dare any listeners to go and find something that has aged poorly i dare you wow someone will now so you just uh you just taunted all of twitter um all right tell us about dpi that's at 450. so once again this is the d5 pulse index we talk about it every week because it's important these are the top 10 d5 protocols we're hanging out at 455 or so um a little up on the week actually not bad yep started ended last week at 420 dollars now we are at 455 dollars in the d5 index again slow slow march up and to the right for the defy index let's look at it versus ether ryan all right here we are at dpi versus eth point two five one dpi for verse eth um and we are seeing that channel play out in the longer time frames dpi versus eth over the course of 2021 doing a really good job of staying in a channel uh down versus eth on the week but still in that upwards trend up and to the right and again dpi versus eth is the indication that people are being risk on ryan's having trouble getting it sorry he doesn't look at the charts look man i'm a long time long term permabull so i don't care what's going on in the minute by minute david but like what is this telling us are we still in defy season yeah we are still in defy season go ahead and hit that uh year to date ytd in the bottom left corner and we can see what it's been looking like there we go uh yeah so again a local local down in the last week but in that solid up into the right trend very good okay um let's talk a little bit about this dashboard we like showing dashboards we like showing data in the market section this is the mev explorer you're gonna have to explain this minor extractable value is what mev stands for what is it why is it important it looks like it's going up but unlike our other numbers going up has been a good thing this is not necessarily a good thing we don't necessarily want this number to go up get into this for us david yeah it's a nuanced conversation i wouldn't say that mev is exclusively a bad thing but if it's unanswered for or unaccounted for it definitely can really mess with your blockchain a minor extractable value is the value that you can extract if you are a person that has the right to order transactions and in proof of work those are the miners right so miners are collecting transactions throughout the ecosystem when you broadcast a transaction it goes into what is called the mempool which is where all the miners listen to and they start pulling out of all the transactions with the highest gas fees and then they include them in a block but what sophisticated miners can do is they can order transactions as they see fit to maximize their own returns because they also get to inject their own transactions as well right and so miners can tinker with trades if people are putting in trades into uniswap usdc for dot for dye or ether or whatever miners can take that spread between the input and the output of those trades and they can take that for themselves because they're the ones ordering the transactions and we see this in bidding wars when bots try and arbitrage or compete for the rights to make to take this spread and what ultimately happens is that these arbitrage just bid up the value of the gas and into up to the value of the transaction that they would have received right and so if through an arbitrage trade that they would have gotten a hundred dollars they'll build up to 99 worth of gas so ultimately just goes to the miners and this can be destabilizing for a blockchain if if a block in ethereum gets mined and it has a hundred each worth of fees well ethereum only issues two ease per block and so ethereum the blockchain won't be stable for 50 more blocks until the issuance of ether catches up with the fees issued by that one block now eip1559 is a fantastic mitigator of this but there are plenty of other things to be concerned about because this is a destabilizing event for for blockchains and why this is in markets is that this is an important metric that people need that is not found in legacy in legacy finance this is not something that has correlates i guess you we could talk about like the extremely high frequency yeah exactly one correlate i would say is sort of the flash boys high frequency traders who who literally park their servers like as close as possible next to the nasdaq servers and and have an advantage that way by getting their orders in before everybody else this is right somewhat similar to that right that's exactly right right except now now that now there's a new party uh now it's the miners or in the future this is the proof-of-stake validators um and and this is going to be a metric that traditional finance is going to first be intimidated about but i think will really increasingly come to love because of how much rich data amongst other things is provided to them through this metric and so this is going paying attention to mev is going to be a decades-long experiment and it's going to be one of the most fascinating economic experience experiments that humans have ever gone through yeah it'll it'll follow us too in this multi-chain future it'll follow us to layer two when layer two um validators have the ability to reorder transactions we'll see mev there so it's it's something kind of i guess pernicious in some ways it's something that we definitely have to to monitor is though it's harnessable it can be used for good um anyway we've talked about it a lot enough but we'll look at this metric from time to time in the weekly rollup i think the key takeaway is it's going up it's going miners are finding ways to extract value out of reordering transactions and and we should continue to monitor that in the future mev is a double-edged sword and it's up to consensus mechanism designers mechanism designers to make sure that that sword is a weapon for good not for bad let's slay moloch with that sword shall we sir indeed all right um david this is an interesting take to take by stani from ave is defy undervalued well coinbase is worth a hundred billion dollars that valuation demonstrates maybe how undervalued defy is look david if you compare the coinbase valuation right now it's a hundred billion hasn't hasn't released its ipo yet it will but this is what it's trading for on secondary like prediction type markets right so it's a fairly good proxy 100 billion dollars one crypto bank all of d5 put together david you know how much that is how much i'll tell you 85 billion it's less all of d5 is worth less than one single solitary crypto bank the interesting thing is the aggregators tokens is that how we measure it yes aggregate of d5 tokens right now so total value of d5 is about 85 billion market cap according to coin gecko valuation of one crypto bank 100 billion feels to me like defy has a long ways to catch up maybe it's undervalued at this point and if you look at the banking global banking system right now uh global banking market cap lucas from our team put this together 6.2 trillion dollars whereas the market cap of d5 is only 85 billion so we are very early on is the point one thing i'd like to say about this is um d5 tokens don't have the overhead that coinbase is in traditional banks have david right like they don't have offices they don't have many employees like a t unit swap is a team of like 15 people compared to coinbase which employs you know thousands and then big banks like crypto like jp morgan they're employing tens of thousands right so um market cap has got to flip it at some point too we are in the early days and he takes here yeah i think the reason why coinbase is valued at such a high level versus defy is because defy is harder to understand than coinbase and a constant theme that we talked about on bankless is it's bullish to be understood and people are understanding coinbase sooner than they are understanding defy and that is my explanation for the discrepancy between these two uh these two evaluations and that's also the alpha that bankless listeners should be paying attention to because if you understand d5 you can be bullish on it and express that and if hopefully we're right cross our fingers but like the discrepancy between these two things should definitely not just equalize uh another reference to van spencer's podcast with us the bold case for d5 is that people that build d5 protocols they're not going for the typical c-corp you know a public ipo valuation they are going for many hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars worth of value created and there's no way that that equates in the legacy world we are trying to create something substantially new and value generative and the valuations of d5 protocols at maturity should be orders of magnitude larger than the typical company ipo on the stock market david's bullish d5 may be undervalued you know it's up to you to use these protocols and determine for yourself that's part of the bankless journey as well don't just take our word for it go use this stuff and see for yourself uh david let's skip to this we mentioned this last time on the roll-ups but um grayscale is still this is the gbtc product and the eth e product they are still trading under nav and traditionally when we've talked about these products these of course can be purchased in traditional brokerages like fidelity you can buy gbtc that is not actual bitcoin it's a trust it's a proxy for bitcoin it comes with its own management fees but it's always traded over spot same thing with e it's always traded for more than the value of its underlying no longer david now last week it's trading for uh 15 below spot price of bitcoin um i asked crypto twitter like what's going on here because we talked a little bit about it uh but like last time but um we didn't talk about it in detail and david you know the most interesting and i got a lot of different answers some people are trying to figure out what's going on but the most interesting answer uh to me was that actually gbtc is facing some competition these days okay so microstrategy what is that well that's a stock that you can buy in your fidelity account that can be a proxy for the price of bitcoin there's rumors of etfs on the horizon there's increasing competitive pressure on gpdc and so it is trading at a discount uh as a result of this this increase in competition so net david i feel like that's a good thing for the space like we want competitive pressures um for these these proxy financial products and you know the thing we want most of all david is we want the sec to let retail get access to an etf because it's a complete rip-off right now and all they have to do is hit that button to approve and they've been holding back all this time uh gets me upset every time i talk about it any takes here yeah there's a huge story here i think what my opinion as to why this uh this the premium is below the the nav as in like when you buy something uh you buy one bitcoin's worth of value you actually only get 85 percent worth of a bitcoin because of grayscale the people have been arbitraging the grayscale premium for forever and there's a certain there is a six months commitment that you must do and so when you deposit your bitcoin into grayscale with the intention of generating of capturing that premium so previously the the gbtc premium was 50 over navs meaning that uh the the value of the market cap of gptc was 50 higher than the bitcoin that was backing it the reason why this premium was so high because of demand people wanted it and so people come in submit their bitcoin and then in six months because of the rules of regulation six months they would be able to turn their one bitcoin into 1.5 bitcoins worth of gbtc sell that on the open market and it's four dollars take those dollars and buy 1.5 bitcoin so you magically prove turned one bitcoin into 1.5 this has been a massive arbitrage opportunity for so many companies and it my opinion is it got flooded too many people tried to take the same premium and as a result people when they sell gbtc they push the pressure down and it's a really sad story for the typical uninformed retail investor who wants to go buy bitcoin in in their brokerage in the ways that they are comfortable with and they buy gbtc at 150 premium and now it's 15 below the value of bitcoin meanwhile actual bitcoin has gone up and so during times where actual bitcoin holders have made money gbtc holders have lost money and this is the fault of the sec not grayscale in the slightest it is the sec's fault for not protecting consumers by approving an etf this is what an etf is supposed to do and instead we have these shitty inefficient mechanisms to try and get bitcoin exposure just approve the etf come on let's get this done it's really it's causing the ripoff like a mass ripoff of retail investors and it's really a shame absolutely uh i'm sure there's tons of people from the sec listening to this right now that heard that message david and are rushing to approve the etf just do it david david says so david wants it look retail wants it uh it's very clear from a demand perspective dave the last thing we should mention is our favorite git coin grant organization uh this is a grant organization funding public goods on ethereum they have just launched their latest grant running uh grant they just watched their latest grant funding round that is hard to say uh and there's a matching process here tell us about that and how folks can get involved yeah git coin is a beloved platform of the ethereum ecosystem bitcoin i consider a public good but it's importantly distinct from typical public goods because it is a public good that funds other public goods and what is ethereum other than a layer of hosting public goods of money and finance on the internet and so using bitcoin is really important and so if you like something if you like to use an application or a protocol and you would want to help fund that git coin grants is for you the cool thing about bitcoin grants is that your dollar is amplified right and so if you use something for free but you would like to contribute value to it you can donate a dollar and because of quadratic funding which is something that everyone listening should be familiar with i think it's a little bit too much to explain all the details about but i'll do my best is that there is outsize matching and so if you donate one dollar you could get matched up to ten dollars or a hundred dollars and how much you are matched by is determined by how many other unique people are also donating to the same thing that you are donating it's a very clever mechanism and it's a way to fund things on ethereum that otherwise wouldn't have gotten funded so if you like to use stuff in ethereum either protocols or you want to see protocols um built out last last uh bitcoin grant i donated to tornado cash because i want privacy on ethereum i also am going to intend on donating to connex network this pro at this cycle because i want that l2 liquidity mesh network to be built out if you believe in something donate to it now's the time you've probably made a decent amount of money in the last few months throw a few dollars at get coin yep every dollar depending on the project you fund could be worth like we're not talking small amounts a dollar and you get twenty dollars matching fifty dollars matching 100 matching that is the power of quadratic matching as david was saying so check that out guys before we get into the releases section which we're super excited about we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets gemini just launched their urn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees and defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini iron is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than 100 within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemiini.com go bank list ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave dot com all right david let's get to releases this is one i am super excited about what i'm showing here on twitter is hop protocol and this is showing a metamask connection and we're moving from one layer to to another sidechain or another layer two from arbitrum the layer to roll up to xdi we're actually moving funds in this transaction that's what you're seeing if you're if you're viewing this on youtube david explain what is going on here with hot critical right so the problem that is being addressed is that liquidity can be fractured across various l2s and that's bad because we want liquidity to be centralized or centralized into specific exchanges and uh hop protocol i don't know if this is true but i'm assuming what they are doing is some sort of payment channel mechanism where they're they have liquidity providers on both sides or they have or they are actually sending it routing it through the l1 i don't think that's true i think what must be going on is a a payment channel and they are just connecting uh assets across various l2 so if somebody has but die on both sides of um of x die and arbitrary and then somebody wants to trade eth and they want to get eth on one side on the other market makers on both sides of the of the l2s are allowing people to just swap assets so so they're not sending their assets they are just swapping assets and the assets can be either the same or different on both sides um that is a really important tool to make sure that liquidity across l2s and overall l2 usability stays really really accessible so getting onto an l2 can take a lot of gas but with something like cop protocol you can stay on various l2s and experience all l2s without actually having to go back to ethereum because if you end up going back to ethereum you're gonna have to pay another gas fee and that's a hundred dollars every time you want to go on to an l2 or or so which you know while it's still an improvement on 100 l1 transfers uh it's still too much for people that want to be able to use ethereum so this is helping them with that yeah very cool stuff and of course we want to be precise in our language and sometimes uh we're not always precise but it's important for listeners to know that the difference between a side chain and an l2 the difference is this a side chain 2 ethereum is not secured by the ethereum protocol or ethiosa a layer 2 and l2 as david was saying absolutely is and so this is a transfer from arbitrum which is a rollup which would be l2 which would be secured by the ethereum chain to a side chain um xdi which has its own validator set and it's not secured by the ethereum chain we'll repeat that every once in a while so you guys get the flavor of that but david this also reminds me of your conversation with connex uh there is a whole meet the nation video on youtube about that where you talk to connex can you give us the tl dr of that conversation because um it seems very related to this topic of chain to chain interoperability without having to go back to the main chain yeah connext has been with ethereum since 2017 working on payment channels because we understand payment channels to be an extremely useful piece of technology but connects has really kind of struggled to see where payment channels fits into ethereum except for lately with this exact same problem and so wow the conversation i i i think was really cool because it was one part a lesson in ethereum history it was one part a lesson in cryptography it was one part a lesson in liquidity and one part a lesson in l2s and so there was a bunch of information all wrapped into one and basically where connects has landed is the system for matching orders across l2s across any l2 that is evm compatible and even stuff that isn't evm compatible including bitcoin's lightning network so if bitcoin's lightning network does ever actually achieve adoption we could match bitcoin's lightning network with a payment on an l2 via connext which is pretty crazy and so there's a bunch of cross protocol interoperability and communication that is viable due to these payment channel levels uh in uh like that acts as like this mesh network middleware layer between all of these various l2s it's super cool to hear state channels actually having almost a rebirth moment just as we need them and we need this this chain to chain interoperability and state channels may be a solution for that super cool listeners should double check us if uh state channels are actually part of hop protocol i'm not 100 sure on that so take note that is true okay um this is another interesting i think update from maker dow this time and this is they are announcing optimism so this is of optimism roll up die bridge with fast withdrawals this is a theme that i think we'll we'll hear it's really like layer two season uh i think we'll see a ton of d5 protocols over the coming weeks and months start announcing what their layer two initiatives are what their layer two solutions are where they're going to deploy next we we heard that last roll up this is this is it again this is maker dow though a pretty long-standing d5 protocol making an announcement of how they're going to handle this what's the tl dr for us yeah the tdl dr for me is that we are solving problems before they actually even arise right and so we are allowing tokens starting with dye um on and off of l2s uh with immediate or relatively fast withdrawals near instant is what they say um and this is this is a similar problem to what we were just talking about but it's fixing the problem of getting on and off l2s from the l1 which at least with optimistic roll-ups getting off getting on is instant and does cost money and getting off can take up to a week or even longer depending on the the construction of the optimistic roll-up uh and so fixing that problem is already being addressed even before optimistic roll-ups have actually been deployed to ethereum uh and so maybe it's a cart before the horse but what really my takeaway is that we are having compounding progress in the ethereum ecosystem yeah super cool definitely this is another d5 protocol this one's called super fluid and they are announcing that they've deployed not on ethereum mainnet but interestingly they've deployed on right on side chains basically or layered to you uh with the deployment to polygon and xdi and david when i looked at what super fluid is doing i thought it was super cool because this is an idea that a protocol called sablier had which was like streaming payments so almost a new d5 money protocol unlock where if i want to send you a hundred dollars i could stream that to you over a 24 period of time or let's say i want to pay you as a contractor david and i owe you you know two thousand dollars a month i could stream that to you over the 30-day monthly period of time it's like the idea of streaming money is super cool it just wasn't actually practical on ethereum mainnet because of gas fees and because you know ethereum is not not really great for this these peer-to-peer transactions that are small amounts but it works super well on something like polygons something like xdi and that's what super where superfluid is deploying it handles subscriptions salaries rewards any composable stream of value with continuous settlement and per second netting for what for extreme capital efficiency this is a a cool new unlock david i'm super excited to check this out and actually try it out yeah listeners should understand that this starts with money but it ends with everything and that's why they have composable stream of value so think about uh equity um distributions or vesting periods where like you get unlocked in tranches and it's just rigid and we can smooth that out vitalik i know likes to talk about um streaming payments for compensation for p for people that allow people to use their wi-fi and so you could pay someone a penny for every megabyte you download using their wi-fi meaning you can go anywhere in the world and and somebody might be able to let you use their wi-fi if you just pay them with streaming payments the the use cases for this are infinite infinite any any type of asset any valuable asset any sort of logic about about time i think time is actually the really strong component here because it allows you to link assets and time i think that's kind of cool yeah absolutely something you cannot do again in the traditional space for sure last we should talk about this release and it's a release that is actually upcoming but the the announcement is that some pretty large vcs andreessen horowitz frame rich framework ventures we were just talking about vance earlier from framework uh coinbase ventures angelus deval bunch of people are investing in the fey protocol this is david uh a new algorithmic staple coin we've talked about algorithmic stable coins a lot in the past um empty set dollar would be an example of this also maker dow is kind of an algorithmic staple coin but it is collateral backed whereas empty set dollar is not this fey protocol seems to kind of mix a bit of that collateral backed world but rather than being backed by vaults that are put in place by individual users it's actually backed by a protocol so it's almost like critical collateral backed there are a ton of specifics here and actually the mechanism design gets pretty complicated right but again this is back to the idea that what is a stable coin trying to do it's trying to be stable over time it's trying to to have a predictable um stability mechanism attached to it this is a even more complicated way to to do it and we're innovating again back to the theme the waves talk about on bankless david which is every money experiment on ethereum will be tried any conceivable experiment that can be tried will be tried this is just another one i'm not sure if i'm bullish or bearish on this but in the category of algorithmic stable coins in general something's got to work we're just trying too many experiments for it not to yeah that's exactly right i dove into this white paper trying to get my head wrapped around this to be able to explain it and i saw some pretty crazy math equations that are well beyond my interest my takeaway was that um there are things being tried on ethereum that are increasing in complexity and increasing in sophistication and i'm kind of reminded that uh the bare bones d5 protocols well we don't consider them bare bones but they i think in the future they could be considered the bare bones d5 protocols the d5 protocols that are based off of at addition subtraction and division where like unit swap it's super simple whereas like d5 protocols based off of like calculus or whatever was more complicated than calculus i didn't do very well in math in school uh is is coming and that is a potential feature and so can't wait for all the crazy calculus defy apps to come yeah they're definitely increasing in complexity um this is interesting because it actually has a launch event where it's going to be distributed people can park ethan it to get some of the fae critical we'll have some stuff on the newsletter about that maybe an alpha leak as it launches we will see um david all right that's releases let's get to news here's the big news this isn't crypto news this isn't just crypto news i mean this is like global us news but it's also global news the senate has just passed a 1.9 trillion dollar coveted relief bills much talked about everybody gets another 1400 stimulus check of course you have children you get even more than that david what's going on here what are some of the the i guess key points and takeaways yeah this is a huge victory for biden who was kind of leading the charge with trying to get seamless checks into the hands of americans um and so this will be the third yeah the third stimulus check for americans uh first was 1200 then another 600 dollar one came and then and then next a fourteen hundred dollar stimulus check came this is in stark contrast to 2008 where i don't think any americans got uh got seamless checks um and so uh we are learning that we have the power of the money printer the people learned that and the people demanded it and so while it's one thing that i'm i'm glad bailouts are going to people not just corporations we also have to be reminded at least us in the amer in the united states of our american privilege because we have the global reserve asset that everyone else wants and the money printer of america is printing it out for americans as a gift because they are americans whereas the rest of the world doesn't actually get access to that money printer even though they want the dollars um so american privilege being expressed here everybody has every other country has their own money printer some work better than others uh the us arguably has the one that works better than them all right now but the problem with money printers of course is that if they are abused that might no longer be the case he could run out of ink i guess we're using that metaphor you know the interesting thing about this david is whatever regime whatever political regime is in control is gonna hit the money printer button like no matter what this whole modern monetary theory that is in full swing in full effect i think the last 10 to 20 years what we've seen is money printing that that's gone to capital uh essentially those that control the capital oh yes yes last 10 to 15 years i'd say it's more capital right so like you know uh we've talked about this on bank list the uh the cantalon effect basically if you're in close proximity to the money printer you get it first and so we've seen this in asset appreciation these stocks real estate this sort of thing but now labor the people as you said are starting to um get control of the money printer and bending it to their will this is what ubi is and like i'm not here to say that that's a good thing or a bad thing i think it is a thing that is happening and anyone listening to this should absolutely understand that the money printer trend is not going away we've had the first i guess uh chapter of this whole money printer that's gone to capital i think the next chapter is going to go to labor going to go to the people we're not going to see the end of these checks that are going to us citizens or citizens of any other country their central bank is going to continue to do this it's going to be a major theme of the decade and in the backdrop stands crypto which is not based on central bank monetary policy something i think about a lot very very very true i wouldn't again like the the usage of the money printer i don't think is ever a good thing uh i guess that makes me a little bit of an austrian but you're totally right we've been using it and we're going to be using it and so now the fact that we're giving the the fruits of the money printer out to more people i guess is better in my opinion i'd still be a fan of destroying the money printer right like that it's like the one ring that should be destroyed right like no one should have that power but we do have that power so if we're going to have that power let's distribute it to as many people as possible that's the ethos behind proof of stake too by the way is staking rewards can be done by anyone anywhere anyone with a laptop right and so that's the same kind of energy and the bitcoin energy is the opposite of saying like no one should have that power so we delete it right and america is coming to terms with like well the american citizens have figured out well we have this power how can we harness it and then the wealthy elite have been like damn it they found out that we have this power like now they know oh no that's my story that's my tl dr of what's going on yeah yeah very much i think look uh the difference between this form of money printing and the money printing that we saw over the last 10 years is this is uh fiscal right this is not not just the fed chair like you know adjusting rates or providing quantitative quantitative easing this is congress and the executive branch like on behalf of the people voting to increase uh money supply and put that in the hands of the people so this is a whole new chapter um you know and uh look it's it's all part of the same story um let's talk about another story that is super important this is a crypto native story but we've been tracking it for a while this is ei five nine in start contest what a segway so in crypto we're not trying to print more money actually we're trying to to burn money apparently right bitcoin is the story of a fixed supply money but ether is becoming a story of actually a negative issuance possibly a burning light the furnaces my friend eip 1559 has been approved to go in not the next hard fork but the hard fork after which could be slated for a july release of ethereum and that would put this thing eip 1559 into the protocol for for folks that haven't been paying attention to what eip 1559 is could you give a quick summary and tell us why this is so important right eip1559 instead of making a transaction under in ethereum and that a transaction fee going to validators or miners instead it just gets burned uh and there's a number of reasons behind this one it's just more game theoretically stable if you just burn that fee um and the imp important juxtaposition here is that uh transaction fees on ethereum it reflect demand for ethereum's block space which will reflect demands for ethereum economy right and so ethereum has to protocol when it collects fees that is like the ethereum system collecting revenue that is the gdp of ethereum the revenue that ethereum collects is directly correlated with uh the gdp of the ethereum economy and because we are now burning this ether the asset the scarcity of ether should also be tracking the gdp of ethereum as the gdp of ethereum grows we should be burning more and more ether making ether more and more scarce so this is in stark contrast to the united states economy where our gdp except for during covet our gdp has never been higher yet we are still issuing money at an all-time high rate those two things are backwards because if the american economy if the american nation state was efficient it would be able to generate revenue from its own gdp this is what a nation state does this is what ethereum does it generates security to fund itself to fund its growth through the gdp that it taxes in in the united states we tax our citizens and then we also print money ethereum taxes the people that use it and then it burns money and it importantly burns it issues like a stock buyback on ether of the asset because the more and more ether that it can pull away from the secondary market to make ether more and more scarce makes ethereum and ether harder to attack under a proof-of-stake paradigm there's your five nine eip1559 like two minutes that was awesome man and and guys uh go check out the uh the opening note that that david wrote about eip1559 it's a great summary so basically what we're doing is we're taxing transactions and we're giving that back to eath holders in the form of a burn good times to be an eth holder the last thing i'll say david is i don't think the market has woken up and realized that this is an actual protocol going into a store of value commodity asset like ether i don't think the market understands what eip1559 is guys i think this is alpha this is if you use alpha if you are in this space you see do you see anybody talking about this oh well here's the closest thing actually actually this is bloomberg this is the bloomberg front page the first time i've seen an ethereum related article but david this is what they this is their headline cryptocoin outperforming bitcoin is about to see supply reduced david cryptocoin i guess they're talking about ether are they crypto coin that's my favorite crypto coin it turns out they are but this is the first like um i guess narrative that we're seeing of eip 1559 escaping into into mainstream so it's still stupid early the market doesn't understand this the market has just wrapped its head around 21 million fixed supply bitcoin wait till they figure out eip 1559 burning supply ether dude so eip1559 extremely elegant upgrade to a blockchain it just it is so perfect in every single way yet the best thing about eip1559 is not anything about the code it's about the narrative it's about the story that is developed which is the best thing about it oh it's so crazy it's so crazy david we're gonna do an entire episode about eip 1559 guys and we have a fantastic guest who's been in eip1559 like the best analyst the guy who understands is the best hassu who's a student anonymous um i guess analyst thinker researcher crypto economic researcher i would call him yeah yes we are camping an entire episode on this it is that important so stay tuned to bankless podcast make sure you check out that episode coming last thing on eip1559. not everyone's a fan not everyone's a fan miners do not like it can't believe this is if we can't well this is ethereum miners and this is a headline saying ethereum miners plot a hash power show of force against eip 1559 so there's undercurrents of threats coming from miners of course miners revenue is going to get cut as a result of this uh 20 30 i mean they're doing pretty well and they've been doing pretty well okay so that's the that's the backdrop of this that's the context but i've had actually a lot of people reach out to me david and like are you concerned about this that it won't go through um are you concerned that miners might fork um my response to that is no i'm not concerned at all not even in the slightest i think miners think they are some miners think they are far more powerful over this ecosystem than they are they if they fork that's great for eath holders right thanks for the free coin see you later i'm going to sell it i'm going to buy some more eth that's it and a story right um i think that the the threat of minor fork is definitely uh over inflated um in fact i think a lot of this might be saber rattling we'll see if they fork or not uh but it could very well be just saber rattling if they do fork in the end i'm not concerned about it what's your opinion on this yeah it's absolutely saber rattling and the reason why like the title of this uh a hash power show of force and what that means is that a bunch of miners are going to all signal with their hash power saying hey we do not approve this and this is just the wrong paradigm ethereum doesn't answer to hash power that's not what it does it's not bitcoin this isn't bitcoin cash versus bitcoin this is ethereum first off proof of stake is coming where your hash power is just gonna get deleted anyways and so like goodbye and also cool you can anyone can fork a blockchain it doesn't matter if all the hash power goes in one direction if all of the community goes in a different direction and starts valuing the a different fork hash power is going to go to the fork that is valued because that's where revenue comes from it doesn't matter if you have if 99 of hash power is signaling in support of something if all of the value goes into a different fork then miners are just going to go back to that one like the hash power is not the the saber it's not a weapon you're like no it's a bluff we we've and look man we've seen this play out already time and time again even in the bitcoin ecosystem right with kind of these other uh minor instigated forks or other party instigated forks like bitcoin cash and all of these things and um it's the community that decides what bitcoin is the same same with ethereum in fact more so because now we have assets that are issued on top of ethereum we have a whole defy ecosystem that gets to choose which chain is going to be the chain that it supports right um and so miners have very little power here i'm not worried at all eip1559 is going to go through and it's going to be great i think for the stakeholders of the platform who are users dap developers uh people who believe in a decentralized future and want more economic bandwidth i'm super bullish it's gonna be fine don't worry about the miners guys all right let's talk about this david beeple is setting some more records dude you know what 70 million people art sold for 70 million on christie's 70 million you know this is the today yeah this just happened this is the third largest art sale from a living artist in human history the third largest yeah like this is happening in crypto right now wow and this is like almost it's on the brink of breaking all traditional records um look we've done a lot of nft content uh lately we just talked to openc and ask me anything that's fantastic you can check it out on youtube we talked to nifty gateway we just had blau on the podcast um so there's tons of material here but how would you what would you summarize david like what's going on here dude it's it's pretty overwhelming and like people keep on saying like this mark the inside you just had a deep sigh it's there's so many things to talk about and like i feel out of my element and many many people are talking about how it's it's this is the top it's too frothy and if you're telling me that like say an all-time high record or third third highest or whatever is is setting the records and it's crypto and it's just such a short amount of time into this that that makes me concerned but also it keeps on going up right and so it keeps i don't know but like i'm optimistic that nfts are going to innovate and improve in ways that ico tokens didn't and in a way that defy tokens did um and i'm optimistic about that i'm optimistic about just being able to make nfts more legitimate because there are kind of just like dumb nfts out there um i'm optimistic uh but damn is this accelerating really quickly really fast you know congrats to people i was listening to a clubhouse conversation of many many artists that were all trying to get their heads wrapped around nfts and uh i can't remember who who was speaking but they said that um and i don't know people i'm trying to get him on the podcast so if anyone knows him uh connect us um but they said that that beeple uh um is one is the best representative to represent nfts and ethereum for the space um just as a testament to his character uh so that makes me feel very good so congrats people and thank you yeah super cool and look it pays to be an innovator here and people certainly an innovator doing stuff when no one else believed it got all the way to christie's and the third largest sale ever and it does feel like this is just getting started as weird as that sounds uh we'll see what happens um but this could put a dampener on it david there's been a lot of talk yeah there's been a lot of talk in i guess uh nft twitter right which is sort of a subset maybe of crypto twitter but also intersects with like creator twitter and art like all of these other communities that were not as plugged into you about the problem of crypto art and the summary is the problem is some artists are starting to get their head wrapped around proof of work in particular bitcoin proof-of-work but also ethereum is now based on proof-of-work and the energy consumption behind proof-of-work so at least one artist said that it's a disaster i issued a first nft but now that i've realized its environmental impact is kind of the you know the summary uh i am no longer issuing an nft and so this is of course caused um a uh i guess uh tremors in the the nft community and there have been responses and other responses give me give me a quick take on this at least your take david is this um overblown is this is this real could this curtail the nft market in a significant way yeah i've never been compelled by the energy sustainability arguments behind proof of work and and in blockchains even with bitcoins um we have to realize that bitcoin is something that is doing a very useful and good thing and that unfortunately that thing consumes energy but so do so many other things in our world that all we also like it also consumes energy the counterpoint that i've heard to that is like well we also know of this thing called proof of stake so if we can achieve the same results but without the energy why not why not you know say no to proof of work and say yes to proof of stake which i'm also compelled by but at the end of the day the artist connecting nfts to energy consumption is just too far too disparate of a connection to make like i just wrote an article about the cultural revolution that i think could come as a result of artistic creation and artistic expression is specifically empowered by nfts and what those things can do for the world and there are trade-offs to everything i guess and i guess if we could make those trade-offs better that's always better but if if proof-of-work ethereum which hosts economic activity based on nfts allows for this cultural revolution along with all the other innovations behind d5 like it's worth it and things cost things and at the end of the day like the reason why electricity with proof of work is so targeted is is because it's such an easy target right like you can see the miners you can see them just sucking up all the electricity and we don't know how much like the federal reserve or the inflating money system or like the battleships that you that the united states employs or the aircraft carriers or the f-35s that cost like 10 billion dollars a plane that we don't really use like all of that cost stuff and that's the system of the us dollar and so i i think it's just a bunch of do about nothing it's interesting like so i am sympathetic to a lot of elements of that that argument and i think probably nick carter from bitcoin like um makes them best right in that you know everything you just said basically um i will also say though that i'm i'm compelled by the argument that well basically um you're saying that there you know proof of work does consume energy right um and that that is worth it for society and that we're not seeing all of the other energy consumption devices and i i would say probably someone like nick would also say and by the way some of this energy consumption is actually producing uh and accelerating the move to more renewable energy sources right so i think that's all part of the argument but the the thing i think that is interesting as well is that um that may be true with for proof of work but as you were saying like if you compare proof of work to everything else you know that's really really not the argument what you should be doing is comparing proof of work to a better mechanism potentially like proof-of-stake and when you do that and you say well is proof-of-work worth it or not and what what are we trying to get from proof-of-work well with bitcoin you're trying to get an ultra-hard ultrasound digital money well if you could do achieve the same end with proof of stake and it like the energy consumption is almost like it's nil compared to proof of work then why not where is then your argument for proof of work which is ultimately david where i see ethereum uh coming down on on that side right so this whole conversation about nfts on ethereum well ethereum is not going to be a proof-of-work blockchain for very much longer like two years i i that that would be a long like i think the merge happens a lot sooner and so this this entire commentary is going to be nil anyway we'll be issuing nfts on proof of stake blockchains like ethereum uh moving forward and it won't even be a factor so it's all temporal in my opinion but that does not discount i do think that this narrative david you're seeing echoes of this nft narrative but it's going to persist in other ways um like a company like tesla putting bitcoin on its balance sheet in the future bitcoin is going to have to wrestle with this anti-proof-of-work narrative in a way very strong on what other side whatever side of the argument you're on in a way that proof of stake chains do not and that could give proof of stake chains like ethereum a narrative advantage regardless of of what the data actually uh falls down on what side it falls down on i i don't know who this artist is that made this blog post or if they are a big deal artist or just a minor deal artist i don't really know but i do know that nfts are a democratizing piece of infrastructure that can help creators monetize so instead of going and and working their nine-to-five job perhaps that job is minimum wage perhaps they're living a less than life less than comfortable lifestyle than they really deserve because they can't find ways to monetize their own labor if nfts can do that the cost of the the proof-of-work cost of that 70-dollar wearable minting transaction is completely justifiable like think about the other downstream implications of this if we can harness the energy behind nfts and employ a generation who is otherwise doing meaningless work in their nine-to-five gargantuan job that they felt was meaningless and has sucked on their soul let's consume some energy and get that done like it's worth it it's worth it yeah absolutely look guys i think the bottom line is it's uh it's way too soon to cancel nfts let's not do that just yet we've got more work to do it's getting don't cancel nfts yeah so anyway that's uh that's a narrative we will keep you updated on as well all right regulation narrative we actually have some good regulation news this week great u.s lawmakers well they haven't done it yet but they're introducing a bill to clarify crypto regulations one of the key clarifications here would be what is a security and what is not can you give us some clarity we've been asking for this for a long time that would definitely help in the us if this bill goes through i'm more excited about this at the state level because this is even more forward-looking uh in the state of wyoming which has been a very cryptic crypto friendly uh state wyoming passed a bill through i believe maybe the first um the first phase of the bill process or is it totally passed oh it's past the wyoming senate committee on its way to being passed by the wyoming center senate to um essentially recognize dows these are decentralized autonomous organizations so smart contract systems property management systems on ethereum to recognize them and give them legal status under the wyoming law structure legal structure this is super cool this is like um this is the kind of thing that regulatory regimes if they really cared about pushing things forward this is the kind of thing they could do to help accelerate the innovation and the crypto economy and um ultimately it'll be good for any regulatory regime that does this and and and any state or uh country or government that institutes these crypto friendly laws so i'm pretty bullish on this david what's your take yeah the legal recognition of dowse is something that is pretty sci-fi and also nicely harmonious between the legacy nation state and the sci-fi versions of social organizations we don't have to conflict we don't have to fight we can cooperate and integrate and that's what i see happening here i don't know if caitlyn long had anything to do with this but she is a huge proponent out of the state of wyoming if that was anything to do with her caitlyn thank you thank you for your work we appreciate it come on the podcast all this stuff um yeah absolutely yeah it's she's doing great work in that state and uh so so are many of the wyoming lawmakers um david let's talk about this this is back to nft land a report from somebody who is an nba top shot user talks about fight yeah ted i've been engaged with him do you know do you fight oh okay i don't know yeah he's in i believe he's in the bankless nation okay so uh a real person here defy ted shout out um he is relaying his experience on medium of being like having his funds frozen on nba top shots and you can go through the coal thread he he provides kind of the history of what it's like forty thousand dollars something like that of funds he could not withdraw from nba top shots which is interesting because nba top shots in the flow chain um definitely talks about itself as a as a layer one right but it does not have the same level of decentralization baked into it as as ethereum does and i think we want to get some of the folks from uh nba top shots on bankless actually we'll do that in the near future to kind of get get uh get their take on this and get their take on whether flow is an ethereum killer the future of nfts what makes an nft an nft david i think is a really important question how decentralized does it have to be to be an nft do you have any hot takes here yeah again to take this to the extreme like i can spin up my centralized database and start issuing unique digital assets that trade on that centralized database and then i can call those things nfts that's not what flow is flow's a blockchain but it's not ethereum it's not bitcoin it's not maximally decentralized and i think that flow is has is committing to a huge loss in potential by not having their tokens settle on ethereum because part of the digital nature of this ecosystem is the reduction of dependencies the increasing levels of assurances that you and the user has your asset and if the flow blockchain can censor your nft is it really an nft if it doesn't have maximum maximally decentralized and trustlessness assurances about the ownership of said asset and the true link between the nft and the arts then the question of the nft gets thrown into question um the nature of the nfc gets on this is kind of hard because where would you put this right is the question right so um is this is this a side chain is this similar like to like a coin base or binance right for nfts that's not that's not how flow advertises itself it advertises itself as a layer one chain for nfts essentially right but if you can't withdraw your funds from it if you have to ask permission if there's any sort of censorship involved if there's not a decentralized validator set um then what are you actually dealing with here is it is it yeah what are you so look i you know we talked about this a little bit on the the ama with devin finster from from open c and kind of the where we came down is basically like if this is going to be up to the market to decide how decentralized does the market want its nfts to be and protocol sync thesis would say the most valuable nfts the most valuable assets everything will have to be on the most credibly neutral settlement layers right now that is something like ethereum but also these other chains will play a role maybe some of them will settle to ethereum but from what i hear you saying david is you would prefer that flow was not a layer one chain at all that it would be some sort of a roll-up uh chain some sort of a layer two with settlement on ethereum so i hear that too yeah i i i think when people make a an l1 blockchain they i hope they are informed about the these magnitude of that decision if you are an l1 blockchain you are competing to be money if you are an l1 blockchain you are competing to have nation state level resistance there is no alternative alternative alternative to that you have to be self-sovereign and you have to be able to protect yourself from external attack because as soon as the flow blockchain has a meaningful level of value to it it will invite people to come and attack it and this is the whole point of cryptoeconomic system design is it needs to be able to withstand attack and if you are an l1 blockchain you need to be able to do that or you can just deploy to ethereum and outsource all of that energy to ether the asset and proof of stake the whole point of ethereum is to make state level sovereign level resistance to any application that exists on top of it so just just go on ethereum plus you get to tap into the power of defy the whole the centralized blockchain application specific centralized blockchain thing doesn't make any sense to me well we are going to have hopefully rome from nba top shots on the program to discuss that very thing i'm sure he'll have some responses to that but we will uh we will talk about it it's an interesting conversation i think one of the most important ones um david let's talk about this we'll just do a quick drive by here jp morgan is launching cryptocurrency exposure basket but these are just basically bitcoin proxy stocks so this is buying microstrategy square riot jp morgan is putting this into some sort of fund or uh index where you can purchase this um look man like why not buy bitcoin if you're gonna do this like why are you buying proxy equity stocks that might have some relationship to bitcoin why not just like buy bitcoin yeah bitcoins is once in a lifetime opportunity of value a value capture and value generation and so i'm gonna buy infrastructure around it like what no just buy the best buy stocks that that own some of it on their balance sheet yeah no just just go for the asset i don't get it well some people want this it doesn't make any sense to me they're probably boomers whatever this is this is for people who want to purchase in a way they can't custody crypto uh it's definitely not for uh for folks that are on the bankless journey but good to see jp morgan i guess you know providing some sort of proxy asset exposure to the class people are going to want it yeah logan paul talk about logan paul i guess just one maybe one thing here so i'm not sure that okay so uh is this a tweet yeah that's the tweet yeah sfi saffron finance so this is a d5 protocol it's kind of cool it's a cool d5 protocol has legitimate investors and legitimate as legitimate investors is is it's sort of really interesting but i saw a logan paul tweet that said something like i just bought or i'm super bullish on sfi which is saffron's it was right after coinbase ventures the adventure arm of coinbase announced that they had invested in it yeah logan paul was like look coinbase is investing in sfi or something like that yeah yeah so i saw this and i was like what what logan paul like what's going on is this like how did he jump all the way to sfi that's extremely rich right well like but but uh we brought on mark cuban and it turns out mark cuban had been playing in d5 for months like he was legit he was crypto native he knew what he was doing it turns out that the case with logan paul is not this it turns out that legislative allegedly okay so but this is backed by some blockchain data right so also a legend but also with some possible evidence that possibly someone paid logan paul 30k into the fight right whether or not this is true david whether sfi somebody from sfi somebody paid logan paul to tweet this out whether or not that's true i think there's a lesson here for us right what do you think that lesson is i think that lesson is that crypto is a dark forest and there are monsters that can eat you every step of the way and so if you saw that logan paul tweet and it's like oh my god logan paul's tweeting about sfi i'm gonna go buy it somebody who if they did allegedly uh reward logan paul for that paid tweet they got their bags pumped and that was worth it for them so you gotta be careful gotta be careful you have to be super careful especially when you see these celebrity tweets um and it's gonna get crazier and crazier in the bull run david okay yeah good practice run we've we've issued some takes so far let's issue some more takes um this is one from zero hedge i just like the title of this article and the entire article is fantastic but everything is broken is the title is everything broken if i tyler turner everything is broken broken lines broken strings broken threads everything is broken he quotes a bob dylan song and then he gets into all of the things that are broken broken credit and he talks about the credit market and the debt markets in the us broken retirement boomers cannot retire and god help gen x and millennials and zoomers in retirement a broken stock market that doesn't actually track value it just is tracks monetary policy yield curve price pumps broken data in the whole system writ large a broken unemployment system institutions are broken is the summary of this article david is everything broken well that is it's pessimistic to say everything is broken but uh we are allegedly in a late stage fiat credit cycle which means our money isn't working we have extremely entrenched institutions with wealthy elites not allowing any new institutions to come or those institutions to morph or evolve or adapt they are staying as the same old institutions because they're funneling value into the elites that own them things just seem to be aging and decrepid as social infrastructure um so perhaps everything is broken breaking or broken or something either way there's a bunch of stuff that just is not working right i think it's the case that it also depends on you know your generation your stage of life how you view the world as as far as whether you see things as broken or not does that factor in yeah yeah i mean i think i think the younger generations me particularly would be more inclined to think things are broken because younger millennials and and zoomers are just kind of quote-unquote fed up with the system because the system doesn't incorporate them into the world uh and so things aren't working for them they aren't working for this for the systems everything is just misaligned well let's talk about the the next take here which i think is uh maybe related to this and this is um i think i just thought i was thinking of is people that get rich off of crypto will just reinvest in crypto and that's how multi-generational sectors are born when i was thinking of this tweet david i was really thinking about silicon valley you know and it started with hewlett-packard back in the you know 1960s and the 70s that's that's where silicon valley comes from right um the silicon ships that they created and then the those who were successful from these early chip manufacturer investments then went on to um invest in and put capital into the the microprocessor revolution the pc revolution right and that formed silicon valley who later invested in the infrastructure of the internet which became all of our social media companies today so it's like the paypal mafia paypal mafia they created a sector well we're seeing the same thing happen in crypto there are a lot of people in crypto doing well right now we've had many cycles of this right but if you were in early you're doing fairly well right now some people have even gotten rich off of crypto shocked as you might be to hear that and what are they doing with their funds well they're just reinvesting it they're doing what everybody who's gotten rich on something that they care passionately about does which is they become venture capitalists they become investors they invest in the next generation of this technology yeah art like it's it's very much like it's similar to uh how galaxies are formed right there there are multiple generations of stars and you get the first generation that really breeds the the birthplace for the second generation of stars and it keeps going right right recirculated the resources get recirculated and by the way the the the materials get richer and richer every time because the materials after a supernova nova explosion are like you know different on the periodic table of elements and that's exactly what's happening in kryptom which is why i think we're seeing this very rich organic soil of activity when crypto people get rich they are plowing that back into crypto and that is how crypto becomes a multi-generational cycle of of investments we're just in cycle one man this is just like the very first cycle there's going to be multiple waves of innovation investment and i like i'm already seeing it all of these new d5 protocols that are coming up and they're just like they're being invested in by the people who who did well on the previous cycle what any thoughts on this yeah going back to that zero hedge article that we just came from where it says everything is broken this is how we fix everything this is the opposite of that this is why we keep talking about new institutions that are going to fix the old ones new digital institutions built on ethereum built on crypto that fix all the problems by necessity right i'm not saying that they're these perfect new institutions then they're just a complete upgrade we're going to adopt these institutions because we don't have any other choice there aren't any other institutions out there that are solving our own problems right and so i'm particularly bullish on just like the adoption of these new digital institutions that we are trying to erect on ethereum and you're totally right like when people make a bunch of money off of an asset they fall in love with that asset they marry that asset there's this phrase called like being married to your bags perhaps i'm married to ether um and when people when crypto makes a bunch of money for people they're not going to like oh well now i can go back to the legacy world like no no they're going to stay in crypto and they're going to help fund and seed it right and so i shouted or buy art from it or buy art from it which again funds artists which of funds jobs which funds families right at the end of the day and this goes back to what i was yelling about last weekly roll up listener have you done something this week to find a job in crypto because if you haven't why not because these new institutions need your help to build them and if you build them and build them faster this whole revolution can just be a lot easier uh and so you know people getting rich off crypto and then recirculating that that value oh this is a really good point that i want to talk about the reason why all the legacy institutions aren't working it's in in my cultural revolution article i talked i harped on the boomers saying like the boomers didn't pass down the wealth but actually wasn't the boomer's fault that was actually an inaccuracy it's the it's the wealthy elite which also happens to be boomers but specifically the wealthy elite boomers which are over all the other boomers just like the rest of us and the reason why our legacy institutions aren't working for us it's because the value that they are creating isn't circulating it got captured and this is the lesson that we need to learn from that if we build new institutions on ethereum or new social or organizational structures that produce value for the world they will be adopted but if they don't recirculate that value we will just do the same things that we did over again it's not about new institutions just by themselves we need new institutions but we need new institutions that can recirculate the wealth intrinsically perpetually so that they don't calcify so that they don't become rigid and fix and only benefit some of the early adopters that just manage to get rich off this whole ecosystem then is a fee burn a problem maybe could be could be like these problems aren't solved i believe is magical but it has plenty of problems that are ahead of it if we want to truly be revolutionary yeah and the interesting thing here is i think that um everyone out there many people outside of of crypto see this this speculative nature is as a bad thing but the speculative nature like the the ability to generate wealth in the space is actually what that it's the it's the heartbeat of this space it's what's drawing the crowds into the space is all of the opportunity and there's definitely something to that um david this goes off maybe my supernova uh you like take here beautiful right so this is this is um eth expansion from genesis i hope they make an nft of this but sorry podcast listeners go watch the youtube yeah go watch the youtube look okay how would you describe this this is almost like a big big bang a big event right from like like a very small point and what we're looking at is uh i guess the ethereum network expansion from genesis looks very much like maybe the the start of the universe all right david i'm about to play a clip from somebody at the today show and some some anchors who are trying to get their heads wrapped around this nft revolution that we've talked so much about this is um this is somebody from nbc on the today show talking about nfts and describing it to the other anchors you own it yeah it's an internet thing complicated but a nonsense wait savannah has a very important question my question is huh no but really what do you do with it like if you have a digital file that you paid 2.5 million dollars of yeah but then what you can't hang it up no well i guess you could say it's kind of like and then you show it to your friend you know like here it is i have it right here and they're like yeah me too and it looks the exact same thing but i paid for it i paid two and a half million for it yeah oh you're an idiot you can resell it i'm with you guys a little confusing by the way that's so crazy that was that was an entertaining ending and it goes on from there um yeah yeah so you know what this reminded me of is um there is there there's a clip of well yeah is that who wait yeah where they're all trying to figure out what the at sign is is the at sign the internet is that oh my god no no tell me tell me about that i remember that clip i was actually thinking of a clip of bill gates and he was on the tonight show with david letterman and he was trying to describe like the potential of the internet this is like 1994-95 and he's describing it to to letterman and he's like well the ability to like you know stream music online you can listen to your favorite songs and letterman keeps going like what like the radio like i already have that i don't need that um but what were you talking about yeah i was talking about that katy kirk matt lauer which is also the today show by the way so this is the same exact show history repeats i think it happened in like 1998 somewhere in the 90s where they were talking about the internet and so they were asking about like the at sign is is that what the internet is like where is the internet oh is it the dot-com is that what the internet is what's the internet and they just just couldn't wrap their minds around it so this kind of feels like the reprise to to that which it was pretty hilarious they're asking good questions so like you buy this 2.5 million dollar nft and then what and then but they were also answering them too he's like well you could resell it yeah and you could definitely resell it right that that shows that there's a market for it so um yeah super fascinating but there's definitely echoes of the early internet in in people trying to wrap their heads around this nft thing i don't think this is going to be the case for like zoomers or or even like younger millennials right we're just going they're just newer generations are just going to natively get this you mean there's going to be new digital institutions that the younger people are just going to accept because they're different and better weird weird that feels like an article it feels like an article you just wrote let's let's get to our last section oh but before we do we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors who made this roll-up possible synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quenta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out cuenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or eth and earn fees from synthetics if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a monolith defy visa card monolith is both a one-two punch of an ethereum smart contract

shop go to monolith monolith.xyz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today all right david let's get into what we're excited about what are you excited about this week oh i'm excited about this digital cultural revolution that's upon us just no big deal or anything i wrote this article came out on the banquets newsletter on wednesday titled the digital cultural revolution it's one of the longer articles i've ever written um so i've done you a favor and i've read it for you so you can go consume that on the bankless youtube um 18 minutes 18 minutes or so read uh 18 minute read and i think it took me reading it out loud is different it's a little bit slower so i think it's a 35 minute long video wow well worth your time though guys at 2x speed it's 18 minutes um there you go the tldr is that um the social institutions that we that we've known aren't doing us any favors and the crypto the culture found in crypto is unique and offers really like a strong tailwind towards why this um why this industry i think is going to be adopted crypto culture is awesome and maybe i'm biased but it resonates with young people it resonates with the digitally native and it also is really hard hitting for the people that can't really find their place in in the normal outside world the outside world who are struggling to like find a way to contribute value to back to the world because social institutions are entrenched and they are not passing down wealth to the people that need it the young people and there's this unfortunate reality that happens when so many people try and find ways to achieve their goals and to and try and find ways to contribute to society and then they don't actually and those goals end up getting thwarted when you're this is a lesson in psychology when your goals get thwarted over and over and over again you stop trying you end up becoming learn you learn to be helpless and this is the state of learned helplessness it's bad we want to avoid that and we need an environment that allows younger people to achieve their goals and there's nothing more like rich and fertile than the crypto ecosystem to make a name for yourself and build something up and contribute something of valuable value whether it's art for nfts or community members in d5 protocols or again 200 million dollars in dows available for funding you can go make a name for yourself and then get convinced dao's to pay you money this is how labor works um and so the culture behind crypto i think is going to offer very a very compelling new host a new landscape for digital digitally native generations the zoomers and the millennials to come over and start building stuff yeah then you inter you wove together i think a number of different themes an interesting way in this in this article where you're talking about the cultural renaissance because you're not just talking about a cultural renaissance right and like the the aging and the the falling apart of our and the failings of our institutions but you're also talking about like this opportunity renaissance right where there's all of this opportunity for young people in institution and then these new institutions that are forming they're in the kind of their proto-phases and their birth phases that is are not present these opportunities are not present with the established institutions everything is calcified is hardened um i think this is why like many young people like choose not to vote i think that's a mistake you should vote but like they choose not to because of this learned helplessness that you're talking about but this these new institutions these crypto institutions this infinite white space that we've been talking about is much more malleable and it feels like much more open it feels much much more free and i think culture is a reflection of of all of these things it's a reflection of these new institutions and the new opportunities that come as a as a result of creating this whole new digital economy and it seems to me that culture just falls out um it falls out of that but it's you know in your article you're talking about like all of these sort of memes about you know how lonely people are and how depressed they feel about their their certain their life circumstances um crypto is the opposite of that dude like it's it's so optimistic so right like it's it's almost optimistic to a fault right i feel like we're like if we make mistakes on bank list it's because we're like overly bullish about things and overly optimistic or like the timing isn't isn't correct but uh it's very different than i think the the cloud of helplessness that persists over over some of the younger generations in our established institutions so that was my takeaway from it's like a great article dude thank you and i hope people take that article and run with it because it's supposed to inspire people to to you have the opportunity to do something new in a new realm that is asking for people to do something in it so it's really a call out to people that are interested in helping build out this world because it needs to be built out i use this line in the article saying the there's two people there's two things that are missing from this world it's people and structures and those structures are getting built every single step of the day those are the defy apps those are the nft infrastructures those are all the things that help people do things but we also need more people um so we need your help to build out the world we can make it a better place world a better place ryan what are you excited about look i'm just gonna say eip1559 is what i'm excited about it's finally approved it is the third leg of the stool for ether's value proposition and look it's full steam ahead man maybe this summer we'll see sometimes hard forks can get delayed of course but possibly this summer ethereum will have its scarcity engine installed and activated and i think that anybody who was doubting or pessimistic about the the value accrual mechanisms of ether as an asset like this just kind of slays that argument because block space demand ethereum is already the highest demanded block space uh network that has been built um it is generating the most revenue from transaction fees uh pouring that into the scarcity of its asset look dude that's going to be just a powerful mechanism but also as you said earlier a powerful narrative so that's what i'm excited about man it's common so question to you uh the most the most bullish thing is to be understood but when eip1559 gets integrated into ethereum doesn't mean that the world automatically understands it how long are they how long is it going to take for them to catch up you know i think actually um price follows narrative in these in these kind of uh circumstances and narrative follows price right so look even think about the name eip1559 right like what is that what a terrible like what a terrible name for mainstream consumption and the ethereum community hasn't really come up with something better so we're like we're like rallying around eip 1559 but but when eath price starts to go up the outside world mainstream will start to look for explanations as to why and that's where the feedback loop of narrative to price comes in so that is in that eip1559 thing yep and they'll explain it this cycle and they'll go figure it out this cycle and then it'll start to make sense and we'll even come up with better terms better memes it'll no longer be called eip1559 or if it does it's because geek speak has somehow translated into mainstream speak um i think we lose the term eip1559 and actually the bullish case is that we just start to call it ethereum once it gets integrated totally that could be the case i've also seen this weird thing where uh sometimes geek speak actually becomes the mainstream speak yeah like like gifs right was that like you know 20 like nfts right surprising i don't think nfcs start to become nifty start to be called nifties i think that's a better name also human nifty gateway if that becomes true yeah they're they're definitely betting on that we'll see all right david time for the meme of the week let me show you the meme of the week i know guys you've been waiting for this all week this is another bankless week uh bankless meme week bankless instagram is where this was first published what are we looking at here tom and jerry did you watch that cartoon as a kid yeah i did not enough clearly though because i had to refresh my memory as to which one's tom and which one is jerry turns out what are we looking at jerry tom is the cat and jerry's the mouse just if anyone else needs that help thank you for clarifying all right what are we looking at we're looking at uh tom then who is like this big bulky muscular figure as the cat and he's reaching out to jerry and tom is labeled ethel hughes reaching out to eath killers and the caption here is competitors are stuck in a rat race i think that's this is saying that basically l2s are going to uh are going to win against these killers it's kind of this is kind of the maximus tweet i don't know what super davis super duper maximalist tweet but it's okay because i think it's the correct one the whole point about this is that economic activity on ethereum of which there is a ton of is closer to ethereum l2s than it is to eath killers and so if ethereum l2s offer the same things that eath killers do well people economic activity will just go to the l2s because it's closer to ethereum it's closer to the nexus it's closer to the heartbeat now we should point out that uh in the in the actual show jerry always ends up winning so this don't they can't talk about that we can't okay all right don't read into this tweet too deeply guys if you watch the show look all right man that has been meme of the week this has been another roll up the second week of march almost into
