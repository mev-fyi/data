there's this conversation right now about some that was not being daoist or some that was not working this and that we kind of want to prove people wrong and the whole thing in the outside especially like yo we can build a community-owned dao that you know governs over this conglomerate we're trying to build and that's gonna actually reward its participants as holders for being there in the long term [Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today i am joined by faroq and mel who are instrumental and the leaders behind rug radio which is a project i've spoken about multiple times on this show i'm really excited about it it is fundamentally a decentralized media company led by faroq who has been building communities social media media brands for a decade at this point and it's a substantive project that goes beyond your typical pfp one of my sort of mottos for this year have been nfts beyond pfps so i'm really interested in exploring different use cases for the blockchain and for nfts and rug radio is just a fascinating example of one i i say this i think during the episode but i i think there's a world where rug radio is studied at harvard business school in in the decades to come because they are really trying to fundamentally change the incentive structure within our media industry today which is something i'm passionate about i i'm fairly critical of media uh i will see if this if this if it works or how it works or how it interacts or compares to traditional media structures i think it'll be fascinating to watch it evolve these are two really smart people i was thrilled to get to talk to mel and understand her a little bit better she handled the tokenomic structure behind rugradio which is complicated and involved we get into that we get into what faroek's looking for as they bring on talent to host shows through their rug radio platform we talk philosophically about media and how web 3 can disrupt it and improve our current systems so a ton of me in this episode i think it's a long one because i was having so much fun talking to them and i hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed having it thanks for being here we're gonna hear a word from our sponsors and then we'll get into the conversation with faroq and mel oxy infiniti is a game universe filled with cute fascinating

kick it off being like i'm so excited for this episode and i mean that but i really am so excited for this episode today on the show we have faroq and mel who are the team really behind rug radio faroq being the founder of rug radio mel being an advisor who specializes in tokenomic structures and i believe in for oaks work the the biggest brain in the game uh an important identifier for mel so we have them both here uh folks who have listened to this podcast a bit know that i'm a really big fan of rug radio and think it's a really fascinating project uh i'm also fascinated by how media works writ large uh and so really looking forward to diving more into this project with you too so thank you both so much for being here thank you thank you for having us yeah and thank you for mentioning us that's how we reached out right everyone's like yo yo overpriced jpegs bank list blah blah blah like they're talking about you and i'm like you know let's let's connect so it's a pleasure to be here it brings me so much joy when communities are like excited if i talk it's the space is just so beautiful there's so much like love and positivity and um it's it's a beautiful thing so let's start the the kind of simple give you give your kind of backgrounds maybe for roke starting with you folks i'm sure are familiar with you but maybe they don't really know your story and it's amazing you've been basically a community builder professionally for like a decade and you're young so that's really saying something so talk a little bit about that journey and then mel would love for you to do the same whatever you're comfortable sharing awesome yeah i mean my name is frogstar man now 27 year old entrepreneur i've been building communities on social media since as long as i remember i made my first facebook page when i was 12 years old that's when it came out and ever since i was just like obsessed with the idea of like being able to reach like millions of people from the tip of your thumbs right just like that you have your phone you just be able to reach people so ever since i've just been navigating through social media uh when i was 15 is when i really got into it deep like with tumblr and i feel like a lot of the og like internet kids actually come from that whole like space like the whole tumbler scene and stuff like that and then i i built a blog became one of the biggest luxury blogs in the space then three years later and mind you like unpaid just building building community et cetera et cetera got into instagram uh in 2014 so early instagram days and i was like wow like this thing is going to revolutionize the world like everybody's on it scrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling how do i like monetize this and build the business on this platform so that you know i can take the ad spots away from tv and stuff like platforms and web one thing things we don't consume and bring into web too and and you know so like you know built something for myself so within two years i went from zero to ten million followers on instagram organically across multiple pages built my business on there out of nothing like really from scratch and for the years to come i just built a multi uh you know just like a media company where i would do like branding marketing but communication strategies online for clients right uh and with an expertise in personal branding that's how i met like the likes of garyvee and all these people early on in 2015 and then end of 2021 peak pandemic you know clubhouse is popping right it was the place to be because it was the only social life social audio channel right and so i got on one night december 28th and i opened the room to two people for four hours and uh and that's when i realized the power of light social audio so i got hooked onto it because in my opinion voice the most powerful tool anybody has and um fast forward uh february 2021 one night i'm there i'm a clubhouse midnight and i end up in the nft room and the rest is history like i met everybody from thank you wax fuocious and all the biggest artists and builders in the space back then and i was like wow that's amazing woke up the next day dropped everything i was doing in my like web 2 business literally cut it down i was like i'm going all into this because i always had this vision of being able to build something really big but i guess i didn't have the tools in web 2 right on these platforms and i immediately saw the opportunity on here so started building brand new nft space started uplifting and elevating artists and builders and people in the space in general whether it was through raising money helping artists or building community et cetera and then fast forward to september 2021 you know one night on twitter spaces because we then we no choice basis came around in july last year we all moved to spaces fast forward you know one night we're like hey like we're on spaces for like 10 hours straight and then someone in my spaces is like and my discord is like yo it sucks i can't partake in this conversation anymore uh i gotta go back to my 11 hour job tomorrow word for word and in my head i'm like wait how do we create some sort of like ubi or income right because web3 can probably do that where people can participate to earn right and be a part of our spaces be a part of our content that they're consuming but turn them from consumers to participants and be able to build something bigger and build like a web 3 media company so i'm on stage like you have john knoff right there photographer one of my best friends in the space is like hey like i wanna help you build this and i'm like okay we need a tokenomics person and then i'm like who wants to be the the head of tokenomics like yo i know this genius like her name is mel blah blah blah like mel chimes in and i'm like do you want to be queen of tokenomics and she's like yeah i'll take it and so and so that's how i met mel september 19th that night and then our friend jeremiah's like yo i'll make a pop-up for tomorrow you want to be the do the artwork and stuff he's like yeah i'll do that i'll be the creative director i'll do the artwork and so he ended up doing the art for like the the tokens and jess as well chimed in so and then a bunch of people like oh jose it's all hosts that so that's kind of like how we came to rug radio but i know we'll get to that but yeah so that's kind of like my background what you know tldr led me to that point and how i met mel and how rug radio started it's amazing this such a like microcosm of what this space is it's just like a bunch of people hanging out being like this is a good idea let's go do this mel i want to get into your background but i want to quickly just i think you made a really interesting point there around somebody's hanging out in your space for 10 hours and it's like okay i got it or can't stay for the 10 hours or whatever it is because they're like i have to go and do the job that i hate to make not enough money probably even really to to live the life that i want and and it's like how can we change that dynamic i think right like it's it's um somebody is making money off the fact that that dude is on your space for 10 hours right like this is not oh i'm doing nothing so how is somebody supposed to earn money for doing nothing like no like twitter's making money off the fact that that dude is in your space for 10 hours and i think the the core of what i find so interesting of what you're trying to do is to say okay why can't that person be one of the people making money off of that fact because somebody is is profiting off of this um i think that's like really the core you're tapping into which is awesome but we will of course get there mel can can i get your uh your sort of story in your version of how this all came to be uh yes of course um so my background's probably a little bit different for it's probably because we came up in a different generation um and so my background i started my first company um when i was 19 years old and um i was somehow fluked out it was to complete luck because i obviously had no idea what i was doing and um sold that company when i was 22 and then i was um got the bug whatever that bug is which is the building bug and i was built a few more companies after that sold a few more and then um just as the ethereum white paper came out i had sold my last company and i read the white paper about it was about eight months after it came out um and i was completely blown away by it it was my like watershed moment of this is going to change everything like this is going to change the world what was that click sorry not to interrupt you i mean this might be slightly esoteric but this is kind of how i got to it i had spent a little bit of time in my company beforehand in um organic agriculture and one of the principles that i studied was um bada names which looks at the complexity in nature natural complex decentralized systems is what nature actually runs by and when i read the ethereum white paper i could just see that i could see that it was had a natural complex system element to it and i was like oh hang on a second this is all the things that usually don't work kind of taken care of like in its most ideal application this removes the things that we complicate in complexity like as humans and if you could remove those things you get this beautiful flow this beautiful natural system that can work and so i am i just like you know like a lot of people i think especially at that time it was a really idealist time in the ecosystem and i just fell in love with it and the potential of it and i kind of never let that go and we all obviously know what happened between then and now like there was a lot of a lot of very lows um and but i just you know i just tried to um i tried to learn like i came in with a complete beginner's mindset into the space because i knew nothing and it was almost it was so hard to find stuff and you know i just was trying to read everything i could get my hands on and understand everything i could and i did that for years and years and years before i even did anything and then um slowly started to just put myself and get involved in different projects and then over the last couple of years i've been really fortunate to be heavily involved in you know a number of projects um that are really just on the tokenic side of things so i'm totally fascinated about how tokens work how they fit together what makes them do different cause different outcomes and externalities in the marketplace and the power of those across really big scale um and what they can do for for humanity and society and you know the betterment of all those things so um so yeah i'm very much the decentralized decentralization purist i guess you could say oh yeah that's amazing so this was it 2015 did you did you find ethereum right when the white paper came out or your what what year are we talking yeah it was just a little bit it was just a little bit after that yeah i just um it was around about eight months after i was yeah it was really like at the very start and it was hard at the beginning you know how does it look just in general to even know what the haircut it took me months to even figure out like how to do what a wallet was like you know like everybody sort of talks about their beginning journey and you see it a lot in the space and i have so much empathy still because i mean every single day even now like so many years in i come across stuff and just go what the heck is that oh my god i know nothing that oh yeah literally hourly that that complex system answer and i want to get into rug radio because i'm worried i'm going to need two hours just to get through rug radio except so much but but that's the most interesting answer i've ever heard of like somebody's click moment like i studied complex systems in nature and i saw ethereum and that's why what can you just as as you know kind of quickly if it's possible like what does that actually mean like what what was the complexity that's being abstracted away or the potential layer that you saw with ethereum um if you look if you look at your garden right like this is a really easy way of thinking about it if you look at your garden and any um sliver of the system that is your garden like a rose bush in the soil and all the bugs around it and the rain and atmosphere and the sun and all the things that meet in to make that rose bush exist in your garden that's a natural decentralized system right near none of those components are talking to each other or um enmeshed but the sun isn't being like hey soil do this now hey grow now rose yeah it's like it's only existing because of each other's existence like it's a perpetual network effect of each other's existence constantly compounding on itself right and so um i mean that's essentially like if you really break down crypto and and the technology that's kind of essentially how it works and it's just a group of complex system compounding against each other and um and so it just after like i i had to spend a bit of time understanding those systems in nature for my last business and so when i read the paper even though i didn't understand the technical elements like the tech the hard technology of it i understood the merit of what it was trying to achieve and so it just it kind of just made sense and so um [Music] you when you have human intervention in complex systems like so there's like complexity and then there's complicated complicated is usually what humans bring into the mix and complexity is usually a natural function and so um complicated is when you stop a natural system in its flow like a dam for example and you reroute it somewhere else for a different cause and that always has externalities and and effects and so often relationships cause that and when you remove trust and relationship from the equation which is again essentially what crypto is doing you don't have to trust each side you just they intersect and interact without that and so that then allows a freedom of movement and a freedom of interaction that removes complicated from the complexity [ __ ] that's fascinating that's a very very cool analogy that i have never heard before um okay well we're going to dive into you know i can't if that's your take on just ethereum bradley i'm really excited to get into rug radio tokenomics um but let's start let's start i want to kind of start i think both like broad and philosophical but also kind of specific right about like what rug radio is i think high level it's like well get go ahead and give your spiel as to what radio is and then i'll all i kind of want to take us a couple places yeah i mean what we're trying to build with rug radio and what we're building is we're trying to build that's what we want as fully decentralized weaponry media company so i see rock radio really just like this like big conglomerate that's like lydia govern obviously governed by dao and it's tokenized where our holders have ownership over the ecosystem right so when i speak of it as a conglomerate that means that rug radio is a media brand it's an incubator it's an accelerator and it's just is this like laying foundation in web 3 for people to build on top of like literally your when you build a house you put a rug on the floor and then you put your couch and you put this and that right there's a bunch of puns that are they can play around with rug right more than just rock pool and so and so really like this is the infrastructure like i come from being a background not as much like crypto as mel does but to me like the space was fascinating about nft space it's like the meaning of the minds between internet kids and crypto ogs that got here together and that's that that just met in the nft space and that are building web 3 together and like it's it's it's to me it's incredible what you can build through that so you know rug radio is just like there's just so much so many layers to it we have the shows that we've launched our aids about 15 20 shows we're looking to launch 50 pilot shows right now uh there's media partnerships that we're working on actively with you know large brands in the space in order to help them you really being like in tune with the space right and create content with them for them and there's also the the the partnership and accelerator side where we can incubate our own projects from the community in order to allow them to grow and build within the ecosystem because we're going to be a dow right the dow launches very soon in the next two weeks and you know and it's gonna be governed by the people and that's essentially what rug radio is it's there's there's there's just like it's this big living breathing organism where everybody can come in and build on top of and and work work within and that's really just what we wanted is to be able to to reward you know listeners and participants for just being a part of it and to be able to really really just build this house for everyone in web 3 in the nft space just be able to come into and to build like i didn't want to just go and drop like a pfp project and just like you know just do my thing it's like no rug radio is literally just for everybody to come inside of and just learn and build like we're really big on education that's why we have a learn to earn program that's launched right now we have like tokenomics uh uh courses smart contracts classes we had one today classes on taos et cetera but it's just that's what it is right and in my opinion in my eyes that's kind of like um the way i see it you know evolving what i think is so interesting about this is we're kind of living through this age that i think is like the fall of institutions and like you see it in the fact that you know joe rogan the individual has 11 million whatever downloads an episode or whatever it comes out to be right and and cnn has far fewer nightly viewers at this point right it's this move to people trusting people rather than people trusting institutions and that'll like you know ebb and flow over time probably for forever more but we're definitely in this trusting people era and i think what's really interesting is your model is is tapping into that in the first example i know where like you're making a really big bet on tapping into that in i think a really interesting way but i want to say so i think when people think about media companies like we think about cnn which is like obviously centralized but probably not a good a good comp here in a couple different ways or you or you think of maybe like a gimlet media which is okay we have this network of podcasts they're ad supported uh which is how gimlet makes money and the individual shows and they pay that out to the creators etc and you know it's a ecosystem that helps each other out because they share producers like they share the costs among a bunch of different shows and then they have ads and they pay it out my sense on what what radio is doing is it's it's a network of hosts which is already kind of interesting because it's not like a network of you know i don't know tv shows or a network of podcasts it's more a network of people there's already sort of this people first piece to it yeah 100 that do is it twitter spaces exclusively right now well the thing is we launched the twitter spaces that's where the community is right but we're platform agnostic like we have people right now that i'm trying to help with that they're youtube shows or they have their podcasts just like yourself like overpriced jpegs could be a rug radio show and have a podcast and we would equip you with a host pass and you would still be a rugratial host right and you would still be able to find ways to reward your community using the rock token right so it's really just platform agnostic obviously if you ask me about dreams aspirations long-term visions of course i want to build like a decentralized you know web3 platform for the people that to own and to use but for now the thing is the attention is on those web 2 platforms attention is on twitter on discord on instagram right on on on youtube on twitch right so we have to go get the attention everywhere we have to educate the masses right this is the point we're at right now is like everybody and their mothers want to learn about web3 and nfts or at least as a keyword they know the buzzword but they don't understand it yet so if we as a big media brand which obviously started with my personal brand right which is was big enough in the space and then i can take a step back and help others build theirs and we come all together and we truly educate the masses then we can take that energy and build something that we're actually going to own i've been a user of these platforms for decades like for as long as i can remember right and the thing is i've never gotten anything out of it like instagram even though i had whatever 15 million followers doing a billion impressions a month didn't pay me i had to go out there and build systems and businesses and this and then grind it to get something out of it but at the end of the day you're just enriching the platform right no matter what the platform is l the web 2 platform this is exactly how it is right but we're in liv in a day and age right and you know nobody speaks to decentralization better than mel here where we could actually build something and where all of our time and energy goes towards building the actual greater good it's almost like positive some capitalism where we can like just build something and like i'll have a piece of it own it vote on it make the decisions and drive it so spell this out because again if i'm if i have a podcast i want to do when i go with gimlet they're gonna they have a bunch of ad partners they're gonna throw those ads onto my podcast and they're gonna pay me we're gonna negotiate a salary whatever right and and there we go if i come to y'all and i'm like hey i wanna do this twitter space through rug radio walk me through that process and how does then the kind of ecosystem the flow of money like what what support does rug radio give what how does that look um i think like to answer this question you should we could if we go back to your original question which is um uh you sort of propose that like a cnn or a gimlet was a web like like a web 2 media company i'd probably say they're actually web one yeah many companies web two media companies is instagram instagram facebook and snapchat yeah i think that's spot on yeah uh tick tock um and then web three is where we're at now right and so um when you reframe it like that then you go okay so the what what did those companies do right right like if you we all know what they did wrong they were all like a result i guess of what they've done wrong um we're all still traumatized by all the things they're doing wrong i mean i mean totally right and so and we're all still uh participating in what they've done wrong um and so what did but when you ask what they did right what they did right is they figured out how to organize really complex networks of people really big complex networks of people right and so and then the second thing that they did really well even though it wasn't directed necessarily in the right direction is they figured out how to extract value from those networks all right so they know how to organize and they know how to find and extract value all right so both of those two things is really important when you're thinking about building any kind of organization let alone a media organization right and so when you think about oh this sort of comes back to answer your second question when you think about how do you create a network a new network in a decentralized way that's decentralized but organized and understands the extraction of value and then takes that value and almost reverse engineers it instead of it going a community platform it goes platform community platform and in a loop right um whereas before it was just a one-way trip it was like community platform that's it and then maybe later on if the company listed on the stock exchange it may come back through a very very like watered-down version of return of value to the community again right whereas um the opportunity that the the ecosystem in web 3 presents is the ability to take that value redirect it and create more freedom around where the content can then live right because the way that you capture all the value is to capture all the content and to lock it to your platform right but if you remove that and you just say the value can exist as long as it's created and here's a way to link that together and own a piece of it no matter where you exist in the ecosystem and that's the role that the tokens play inside a decentralized ecosystem this they're sort of almost like moving around the background of the of the ecosystem like little beavers per se and say oh i see value there i'm going to pull it out and i'm going to push it through the network and i'm going to make sure these four or five things are catered for by doing that so here's a host they get tokens for doing for showing up and creating content they get more value in ownership from continuing to do that content over time they get value from every other single person that contributes to the network through the inherent value of the network and then they get access to even more value depending on their motivation to build things in the ecosystem all right and so you're taking they're all the things that were being extracted from you in the old ecosystem but you're taking them and presenting them as ways to create value for yourself in the new you're making your creators your shareholders sort of one in the same as opposed to kind of two separate groups you're really putting the creator at the at the epicenter of the whole thing like that's what mel's touching it's like whereas like i've written about a lot like web 2 is like platform creators community a consumer we flip the script and now it's participant uh creator platform but the creator is at the center of it it's the bridge it's what brings the two together and holds it together so when we're talking about being like you know uh putting emphasis in the space on the artists on the creators right because creators are artists right whether you're a host or whether you're doing a podcast you're an artist in a way right whether you're entrepreneur builder there's this is there's art in that there's artistry in that and that's what we we focus on right and it's not putting that first and forward so we found a way for everybody that's hosting with us through their host pass right because we did the membership pass you're probably gonna get to that later whatever but membership has the nfts we also have the host passes where these creators can reward get rewarded for participating within the rugby ecosystem and therefore have bigger more access more chances to earn to participate but also more ownership awesome mel did you have a thought you wanted to finish before i kind of ask and it'll be on the tokenomic from my next question but yeah so the other the other thing that's important to think about when you're thinking about the creation and the receiving of value in this kind of ecosystem is that there's a complete delineation between person and wallet right um that's what that's what web 3 does as well it delineates your identity from your movement in an ecosystem so you can move through an ecosystem as an anonymous person as an anonymous entity completely separate your identity from that but not do that at the cost of the ecosystem so the ecosystem still benefits from understanding your movement and your actions and reactions and intersections with the ecosystem but i don't know who you are as the creator of a token right i just know that there's a wallet there okay and so it allows value to sit separate from identity which is a really important part of thinking rethinking media right because the way that media has happened up until this point especially in web 2 is most of the value has been extracted from identity right and if you remove identity from the equation then substance must replace it and so over time even though at the beginning it doesn't feel like that over time as that evolves it means the incentives are not on identity they're on action and building and creating and outputting in the middle of that yeah yeah it's like it's a different interaction contribution it's a different incentive model completely right so those two things change the kind of value the way you benefit from that value the position of that value in the overlord your overall ecosystem how much power you get from that so i think this is again fascinating of course and there's so many layers to why it's awesome and fascinating i think it also is probably still kind of abstract for folks to kind of wrap their head around this which is why i think let's talk about the tokenomic model and then get kind of like whether it's where things are right now or in a year or two where you imagine things being of like what is like in practical terms i come join rug radio what what's happening when i start that journey so i want to do that and i want to do kind of the tokenomic side would be helpful to talk through tokenomics first maybe to to get into that or to talk about the uh yeah absolutely yeah it's probably easy to understand the structure first and then focus very much about the future of the space and what what's being built there and and so forth so um so i so obviously have sort of prefaced all of this with the kind of reasoning behind it which is what we were just talking about it's a little bit more esoteric but it's like putting um specific tangible words on what we've all experienced in the in the previous ecosystems right and so um so how do you make a tokenomic structure that actually does that and it's like it's something that i've thought about for for a number of years it's not a new thing and it's not an easy thing to kind of think through like there's a lot of com complications and all of that there's a lot of externalities and when you talk about social networks there's also uh the unknown unknowns are really really big because you never really know what's going to happen when you put something out into the marketplace like this right so you're sort of thinking through lots of scenarios but um so when the way that we've um sort of worked out the structure of this is really in three core segments um the first segment is the dao and the dao is is the heart of ownership in the ecosystem um and so like i'm sure your audience is probably educated enough to know this but it's a decentralized autonomous organization um and our dow is not an investment dow it's a community doubt which means it's in non-income and not-for-profit it's an unincorporated enough profit which acts as a club in the ecosystem i think bankless is the same as this bankless has a dow it's sort of a dual structure so but yeah yeah yeah they've got a dow component there you go um so um so what does that mean and then how is rug rug rugs um dao set up um it's set up so that that the people that interact with this ecosystem can own the ecosystem and it was a completely fair launch in the sense that even everybody that built the project everybody that's in the project and everyone that brought the project in the marketplace all had exactly the same access to getting to the project at the same time so for example faroek and i actually had a moment where it was like well after the launch and we've gone oh my god we didn't buy any tokens like we didn't buy maybe she passed we didn't buy anything right and so we're like out in the marketplace going oh we close by the way you know because we were building it and we forgot um and so uh you know we like that's the first point of a doubt a doubt really to be properly decentralized needs to be a fair launch um and then the second part of the dow was um governance right and this is something that we're in the middle of launching right now but there's two parts to the rug radio dao there's the rug broader dao and then there's sub-dials and the first sub-dao is the tokenomics area which is called rug bank um and the rug bank is like sits in the heart of the ragday which manages the movement of tokens and the structure of the tokenomics process through the ecosystem and the reason there's a separate dowel or a sub dao inside our dao is that the rug bank is held under different governance structures than the broader dao ecosystem and that allows the tokenomic structure to be able to function properly in the ecosystem so as far as dow's go with we work with the incredible team at syndicate dow who are really just the absolute benchmark for how to build and think through the complexities of a large-scale dow and they helped us figure out the best way to structure the dow so that we know that we can keep the economic structure going over the long term but also make it the most fair ownership structure for the people inside it all right so there's a dow and the doubt has the right bank inside it and um the next middle part of so there's three parts of the ecosystem the middle part is the membership layer right and the membership nfts and i don't want to get too too much into the technicality of it but i do get really excited and i geek out about the smart contract it is totally exciting just when you actually say it this is why the podcast exists for long furl form nerding out give us the the nerd nerd straight up there's so much layers for this structure it's not just okay rugs like you know so um the membership layer was actually the first first ever kind released um composable nft and so what does the comp what's a composable nft well a composable nft is when every the the nft can actually change its status and its memory per se according to what you do with it inside an ecosystem so you can burn actions onto your nft as a member and then your nft becomes a reflection or a mirror of everything that you have personally done within an ecosystem right so the kind of um detail of uh potentiality of what this actual contract can do is so unreal and i'm so excited that as we launch other things where we start talking about the other features that it can do but just as a starting point because so it's this composable nft and what that allows people to do or us to do is to use it in a number of really dynamic ways um and when you have membership and like flexibility you have something really interesting as far as what you can then do to reward your members and have them participate in the ecosystem over the long term i'm taking notes by the way like if anybody's seeing me if anybody's seeing me turn away because i'm like literally taking notes that's why i keep looking away so keep going but if anybody's watching on youtube and they're like why i'm like no i'm literally like i'm in school that's what's happening i'll share them too i feel like if you're a read listener at home you want those god for continuing so helpful the more of that in the marketplace the better so i really appreciate that um so the the membership player has three levels the first level is um the members so that's anybody that has a membership nft that's participating in the ecosystem that membership nft is theirs and we use it for a whole heap of different host of things in the in the ecosystem the second layer of membership area is the partner pass we actually haven't launched our partner pass yet but syndicate are building an incredible incredible platform which is essentially like upwork but on chain and our partner pass will give anybody in our ecosystem the ability to contribute to anything that's needed in our ecosystem and be paid on chain and i have a record on chain like an on-chain cv of tasks completed um similar to what balaji has done and built with 17 29 yeah so he's where he's doing micro payments in bitcoin for and then doing on chain records of people's participation in in projects what that does is it means you don't have to trust me when i say i've done xyz project you can just look at my token and it says it on chain right and send it to that transferable reputation too now i can kind of move anywhere and i have that trustless transferable reputation house should be totally exactly correct okay and so um so and then like actually on that point so what else is coming down the the pipeline with ethereum with log in with ethereum which is an incredible project that i recommend everybody go and check out and have a look at um is the capacity to also have people follow your wallets on chain and so you can bring your followers anywhere and so all of a sudden you have your reputation your followers all on something that is immutable and yours and you own it and you can bring it with you anywhere and so the power of that is really extraordinary and really exciting so that's a little bit away from being launched there's a couple of months away of being launched but we're we're super super super jazzed to even be a part of the beta program that syndicate are putting forward for that and just excited so that's the middle layer um and then the bottom layer of that is then the hosts and who are the hosts the hosts are anybody that contribute any kind of content into the ecosystem and the hosts then receive a payment of tokens depending on how they often they contribute and for how long they contribute so it's about volume and length of time for that incentive structure um and so if that's the middle layer which is the membership structure then there's the final layer which is the token the utility token and so the utility token was launched um as a nft which might sound a little bit strange to people because it's not the usual way that you release a token um so there's something really important that we wanted to achieve with the utility token and that was um consistency so when i before i was talking about how web 2 companies do something really well and what they do is they organize complex large networks of people really really well and so when you break that down what it means to be organized as an experience what you actually get is consistency right the experience of an organizer being inside an organized network is consistent understanding of how the network behaves right you have to be able to peg yourself your psychological understanding of the network against something that you know is immutable and won't move and is consistently going to be the same each day right so that you can trust the network so that you can understand how it flows and you can navigate it right and so i had to figure out a way to use a token to create the same outcome for this network but in a way that's decentralized right without centralizing things because obviously you can quickly achieve that through centralization it's obviously very very easy to do that through centralization so um so what i decided to do was to actually make the token slow release so the tokens released over a period of five years the same exact amount every single day over five years and is that's the rug token this is the rug token that's correct which is the utility token okay ecosystem so rug token is is a 721 it's it's a seven no it's just it works it's it's a um not a 721 it's an ese 20 that's released it's really really good it's actually in this and again to the to um the incredible work that cindy could have done they created an interlinking contract so it's two contracts in one that is lego together so that one can't exist without the other right and so that's this is the amazing people talk about how smart contracts can talk to each other and how amazing they are and how they fit together like lego and all of these things that people say in practice like in in theory but like this is that in practice this is two lego pieces stuck together in a very particular way to achieve a particular outcome over a long term period um in a specific direction right and so it showcases how you know you can how particular you can get with contracts if you really like think them through okay continue describing i i interrupted you continue describing sort of like what what that end goal was and so and how you're you're achieving it yeah so this is how brings it all together so the the the slow release the rad tokens the rug radio rugs which you see on open sea and you're seeing people's banners and the beautiful artwork that jeremiah did um for each of them produce a certain amount of tokens a day depending on their rarity so the standard ones produce five and up until the rarest ones which produce 11. right and so every single day they produce the same amount of tokens for a period of five years right and those tokens then accumulate in your um against your nft and then you can go to a custom built dashboard which seemed to get built for rug radio um and you can plug in your wallet and claim your tokens right and so then what's that do what what's the token for and how does it fit into the whole ecosystem and this is kind of where the whole circle kind of comes back in together um so the way that it fits in together is that the first utility not the only utility there's definitely a lot more to come but the very first utility of the rug token is to convert your rug token to rug dow token and may come and become a member of the network become an owner of the dow right and the reason why we chose that as the very first utility was because for us as builders in of this ecosystem the most important thing we wanted to achieve first is to have a very broad open membership base of owners in the dow right because that is good going to be who governs and builds the whole ecosystem and so we wanted as many as we could possibly get like as wide a community range which is where we had a very particular way to launch the whole project in making sure there was only one token per wallet and a whole lot of other things that we did um and just getting that out to as many people as possible so that the first thing that they can do is take their rug tokens convert them to a doubt token and become an owner of the network right and so it's it's seems almost um uh that there's like a very limited amount of utility at the moment but it's limited by design in the sense that the first thing we want people to do is convert and become owners and then we launch the rest of the token openings um incentives and the utility that go along with that but but first off you have to own reflection and so um so the rug token converts in um to a breakdown token and those tokens that you've used to convert to a dow token go into the rug bank right and the rug bank also earns 10 has a special 101 token inside it like nft inside it that produces a 10 of all tokens in the marketplace daily so it receives a 10 um top of every token that's produced in the marketplace and so um all of those tokens in the rug bank are pushed back out into the ecosystem through the host network and the partner network and so every time you host you receive rug tokens and then they go back out and they're back through into the dow ownership and so on and so forth so there's like a secular motion of how the token moves through the ecosystem into the bank back out of the bank into the hosts and so forth um so that's like the base structure of the whole ecosystem and how it all interlinks together okay i'm gonna try and say this back in in in a few seconds but you have a dao you have you have the dao you have your company call it right your decentralized company it's called radio rug dao is what it's called right that's your company you know it'd be it's like it's not an llc because it's a non-profit but it's out rug dao has a uh has money yes right and that's your favorite talk about that sorry we didn't talk about what we allocated to the dow that's a good point so well and i know it it's generous it's like deepest animals it was like 50 of all initial sales and then 70 percent royalties sorry no no no no no that's a billion of all the primary sales and 70 of all secondary sales for all of the tokens produced by the rug ecosystem go into the dow so at the moment that's somewhere around five billion dollars amazing so you have the company you've got your treasury which it sounded like you said had sort of its own little dow that that operates within that bank but let's not that's not good that's cool noted little asterisk there right and then you have all these ways to be like a like a a member or like kind of an employee but that's not really the right word but to map it like uh of this this rug down this is a real participant a participant great there we go right you can be a member which will you know we'll probably talk more about you can be a partner in some way contribute to the ecosystem in a variety of ways that probably mean like social media spreading the word that like being a marketer or being uh being you know think of all the departments that you would have somewhere like if you fit into a department in like content ecosystem yeah so many things memes i mean yeah great you're gonna if you're yeah you're creative whatever and then you have the hosts who will have their shows whether it's on twitter spaces or podcasts or youtube or you know whatever that kind of looks like they're you know the host and then you have this uh erc20 slash actually erc721 wrapped in 1000 contracts which we can do probably a whole episode on to understand that um that is slow released into this whole ecosystem and then you know over the course of five years and then lives in this sort of circular motion where people get that this token they spend it to get uh to get to own to buy into getting to own the dow overall and then uh by doing that it goes back into the treasury and out of it and then it goes out of the treasury back to the hosts okay can i ask a couple questions on that that came up as you're saying well and and i don't want to take us too far feel but i'm curious on the on the host front because you mentioned the sort of compensation there is around volume and like length uh length was that like duration of sort of putting out yeah duration of being part of the network look how long they're with us right yeah was that a hard decision because i feel like there's so many different ways you can measure like you could measure engagement like you know what if somebody's putting out a crazy amount of content but like you know not getting a lot of engagement i don't say terrible but like you know like people aren't responding to it and they're just you know is that complicated for you guys at all or you're like no we we feel good yeah it's definitely precarious because this is what i was talking about the unknown unknowns and what you're incentivizing right like i i genuinely don't think that the existing social networks set out to incentivize the outcomes that they that they have right but it was an externality of the structure of the what they put forward right and then once they figured out what their externalities were they were probably too deep into it to reverse engineer them to go somewhere else so so it's it's precarious to know that and i still we still don't know we're early early right we still don't know what our true externalities are you know there's still a long time before you can see them um and so it was more thinking through how do you create it so that this is what you incentivize now but it has enough flexibility and pliability in it to allow that to shift if it's not correct um later on and then also um the layers what we how we incentivize participants how we've incentivized partners and how we incentivize hosts are all different and different layers of kinds of of incentive and so um how we incentivize her participants is very much what you're talking about around like engagement whereas um how we incentivize hosts is around contribution right and so it it it's still pointing to all the things that you're talking about but it points to them um in ways that we felt like were more aligned with a broader collaborative ecosystem but yeah it was hard it wasn't easy to figure that out okay yeah yeah there's so much to think about here you know i'm i'm like watching the clock and i'm like oh my god are you kidding me i've got like literally a bunch more questions so i'm going to try and run through them but i want to do this sort of tangible thing really quick so i want to come be a host you know maybe i want to do a youtube channel and i come to rugradio i'm like hey i want to come and be a part of this you guys approve me and so you give me a host pass correct that's the i'll get a host pass and that's sort of my ticket now into this ecosystem and i now what kind of support do you now offer and do you kind of want to offer around like if if it's youtube for example like is there a little guide for how to get your youtube channel set up like what does that kind of piece look like it for for hosts or people coming onto your network that's really what we're working on right now and we have a header host that just started working with us last week we have director operation also that started with us last week like we're actually building a fully fully structured team and everything we're putting a bunch of templates out for hosts to start with us um you know i myself like to spend time with the host and i want to get on with them like a weekly call and be like yo like let me help you guys build out your brands right because i've been doing this for a minute right and it's more than that it's just like building a network of hosts because like you have your community but then you have the network of hosts that sits above that because they're to me like our host like some of the most important if not the most important people in in the whole structure because they're the educators they're the teachers right it's like when you have society the most important people in the society are the teachers but also the less paid right but they're the educators and so these people to me are so important and it's just like being able to support them to help them brand so of course like we have like we're so early right we're second month in right now and we're like launching a dial so really focused on that but like definitely like the focus is like helping you come in build out your brand we have a massive audience obviously through rug radio through our discord and different channels that we're building for you to be able to have more eyeballs to have better understanding of how to build your brand how to build your show and everything so definitely we want to our goal is like we're like a home depot so that you don't pay for the tools like you come in we give you the tools we help you build it and you go off and the cool thing about rugby and the way we've built it is and through web3 ethos that we want nothing out of it like there's no ip none of no ownership nothing you come in you you know we flourish together and if someone wants to go and do their own thing that's totally fine we just want to help people build out you know their platforms in web3 essentially because it started off with like me building my own platform right you saw that through the year and i'm like yo how do i take a step back and help other build others build theirs so i can build something you know bigger than myself right and be able to empower the space and how do we have like hundreds of people out there just educating others but also make a living okay so i'm uh so so awesome so i'm a host i want to do a youtube show i come on i get to pick your brain for oak who's like truly an expert in this sort of world of social media you know building community all the rest of it i also now have an uh you know sort of a cohort of another 12 40 whatever it is sort of people who have come in people we're leveraging yeah that you can like leverage insights from now i start putting out content and as i'm putting out content i'm accruing these rug tokens as a reward for that and it's on a preset basis and it's on the blockchain and it's totally transparent how i'm getting that and all that and now i can use those rug tokens to potentially buy an ardao token right which is my ownership that's my my dow token it's my way to kind of own the company that i'm in and vote on governance and the rest of that so is that how how that kind of piece works that's the goal that's the first utility we wanted to push out is the ardou token like we want people to understand that governance we want people to understand like what it's like to have equity or own something and be able to participate into something right it's like i can put out the laundry list of rug token utility i have on my desk it's easy for me here you can hey here's a rock shop because i want to open a rock shop with merch right i want to have our own merch everybody wants it right it's dope we like merch we like swag or i can have a list where it's like hey like i like when you have a token the beautiful thing is you can add so much utility to it right but obviously there's this conversation right now about some that was not being daoist or something that was not working this and that we kind of want to prove people wrong and the whole thing in the you know outsider specialists like yo we can build a community-owned house now that you know governs over this whole company's whatever we're trying to conglomerate we're trying to build and that's gonna actually reward its participants as holders for being there in the long term so it's like yes the answer is yes we want to push people to the ardour as fast as possible because that's the first utility and the most important in my eyes like why you're gonna put another piece of sweater on your back okay that's cool you want to rep the brand that's fire but like at least own it first and learn about governance like our goal like really rug radio is an education it's like it's a conglomerate it's a tech company and it's educational platform and it's really important like our our emphasis on education and rock radio it's so important on the point of what fruit says it's like you can say all those things like long-term value and you know ownership and all of these things and people in the marketplace go okay like what do they mean right and so yeah if you go back to rem when i was describing the dao i said that the rug banks sit and i sat in a sub-dial right and this structure this tokenomic structure that we've built with syndicate so why is that important and why do i talk about that when i talk about the tokenomic structure well the reason why i go into that much specifics is because it's actually key to the way that the community will grow create value for themselves in the long term or in the medium term because what that sub does structure allows us to do is it allows us to spin up projects that can be created by the community voted on by the community and then funded by the dao and those projects whoever's in those projects and sits within them under this sub-dash structure will benefit both directly and indirectly commercially from those projects so those projects can pay out to the people that are building them and it can also pay out to the dow again broader right so the dow makes a return on its investment in the subject projects and then everybody that owns the dow obviously benefits from having more capacity to invest in more things in the dow and then also the participants that take part in that don't just get funding from the dow let's say they also get access to the entire network that sits within the project so we're talking about partnerships with some of the biggest brands in the space and some of the biggest brands in the world really we're talking about you know reach through all of these networks of of hosts and content creators and supporters and owners and so forth and these are things that are they sit in a type of value that is hard to quantify with a number but they sit in a value proposition space that's really really rare and really difficult to get and so it's using the compounding effect of that greater value to benefit every member that's within the dow over the longer term okay i have my thorny question but going off of what you just said i noticed you have this new channel in the house of farooq i think uh discord that is your updates and you're giving these very detailed updates like on a virtually day by day basis on everything you guys have going on yeah and one thing that caught my attention recently was you're like we have two i think potential media partners that you're talking to or something like that and and this again goes into because i think your point now is this is it's like hard to wrap your head around it and i think the more specific uh we can get the the kind of more it crystallizes for folks so when you talk about having two potential media partners you don't say who they are but like what does that mean does that mean other like ways for the for your host to distribute their content is that what that looks like what is it what would a partnership like that look like so what it looks like it's actually four now i just had them for you two more that we're working with but they're all like man i was saying it's like global brands like massive companies and just like you operate as a media company like we are at the heart and pulse of the space right rugby we're like out there every day there's myself for all the amazing hosts and people and the community is out there every single day and so when i tell you a media partner and the reason we're in the daily updates it's almost like it's not every day but like i try to update people in the in the spirit of transparency and like what we're working on right but i want to overlap and say who that partner is because it's like oh partnership you know how twitter is oh yeah oh yeah yeah you miss me with that you know like let me just close that and then we make a proper article to announce that stuff yeah i mean yeah and it's like but we're working you know so what a media partner looks like it's like look like we have all these hosts right and we have all this reach like my personal page gets like what 40 million visits a month rugby does that's five million a month and we have all these hosts and all this stuff medium articles are crushing the youtube channel is launched and we're gonna have more and more and more even our own app that we're building in order to like have everything streamlined and centralized in the place where people can get the information and everything which is gonna help a lot because that everything's so scattered in our space i think everybody knows that but you know what it means is that we can have partners and it's it's revenue for the dow as a media company to help these partners get into the space okay yeah it's literally like as a media company like let's say hey like uh carly so it's like it's like company x we're gonna help you build yourself in the space and obviously we vet the company's like okay so we think carly's a good host for you carly should host this then we think that's good we think faroq is a good host for you and this and that so that not only is going to help me and help us put even more money in my opinions the pocket of our hosts right because we can give them brand deals but also at the same time and the dow that serves as a media company for these like media outlets so anyone who can host a show with rugby a brand could come and host a show with rugby we have events that will be at south by southwest sponsor a panel get on folks rug radio go out there do this do that let's get a medium article written right as a media company like an actual like i want people to sound like an actual full-fledged media company because we are fully operating mm-hmm okay and and it sounds like there are moments where like these these companies you're partnering with like they'll they'll pay they'll either pay one of your hosts for something because you think that's a good partner or they'll pay your they'll pay the dow for you know pushing out the content on the rug radio and the feroc you know twitter accounts or whatever and that money just goes right into that rugby treasury or some percentage of it does that's what you're describing there essentially right not even just some pacific of it like that oh oh 100 goes okay as a company like whatever we bring in and i'm not even talking small like we're talking like big six months like let's go out there let's find the proper companies to work with and some of the bigger ones the biggest ones right now to actually serve them as as a media you know yeah okay and so now you're gonna have the situation where you have this treasury this rug bank and it's going to have both rug tokens which is sort of your native currency within the ecosystem and it's going to have presumably fiat or usdc or eth or whatever you guys are being paid in some sort of other currency correct treasury sits in the main dow not in the rug bank the rug bank is only for tokens so the token structure is okay okay this is the main structure for purpose and then the all of the revenues so the proceeds from the sales the proceeds from the secondary sales and the proceeds from any kind of partnership program actually sits under the main dial treasury okay so good understood and then hosts and these partners who are the two kind of categories that i'm assuming you know earn revenue in some capacity are they paid both in you know crypto or fiat and in in this sort of native rug token how does that uh the host so every host pass yields rug token daily depending on how much they're hosting yeah but then they also there's this reward for volume and like duration with the platform and that role we're still like you know we're we're literally like on boarding the partners so that's something that's like tomorrow i could we could decide to change that and like yeah you'll have different set of rewards as well cool and so then the the the the treasury that's not the rug bank the treasury that just sits in the dow from these partner programs that have come in from the sale of the nfts like this this huge like treasury that you're building there's i'm assuming voting on sort of how that gets utilized like what are some what do you this it feels like such a question like what are you spending all that you know that five million dollars you have like how is that being determined where is that well that's we're not spending it at the moment at all um i'm sitting there and okay um so there's that um but once the bat the dow is operational um and the the token is released which is um happening at the end of this month um which is exciting um that will then um there's a six month period and how we're launching the dow um which has a governance council the government council will be voted in by every single token holder both member and rug token holders um and that governance down that governance council will just represent the broader community until there's enough members that have earned enough tokens to get in and swap over and become members so again like just thinking trying to ensure that it's decentralized from the whole way through um not not um you know half decentralized or kind of decentralized whatever so it's always community community operated and then um there's a there'll be a very clear governance structure on how you put proposals forward in fact this week on um the education session that we're doing on daos myself and will are going to break down governance um so this is the topic that we're talking about this week and then next week we're talking about proposals beautiful um so this will cover sort of all of the details of this but essentially there's a there's a process in which the types of proposals you can put forward how many backers you need to have those proposals to get them through um you know how many people have to be in the teams that the types of things that we expect for the proposals to be considered vetted and legitimate um and then the dao gets presented with these proposals and they choose what projects the dow has done it's not up to us it's not up to for myself we we just like we're completely out of the as much in the decision-making process as anybody else in the dao so it's it's up to them the dow to choose what the dao spends its money on right and we our role i guess as far as like the creators of the dao is to think through the governance as a foundation to enough so that we have the right frameworks around how those proposals are put forward to ensure that the direction of the spending of that of that that process like those monies and the treasury is done in a way that's for the betterment of the media ecosystem that's being built right so there's parameters as by which people people can't just go let's go and buy a crypto punk right because it doesn't fit within the parameters of what either a community dow or a media enterprise would do right but so there's definitely rules right but those rules are broad enough to allow innovation and creativity and community driven projects and interesting things to come out that we would never think of you know because they're community driven is there a liquidity pool or an expectation of some sort of like dex situation for the rug tokens again knowing i'm asking that question and it's like not exactly an erc20 so and i still don't fully understand what the contract is but like the resale of the rug utility tokens is there an expectation around that or are you so we created a utility token because we it was it's against securities law to create a liquidity token as a not-for-profit so yeah our token is a utility token got it and because it's a token like any other the marketplace is free to create whatever it wants like we can't dictate what the marketplace does as no one can in the crypto ecosystem but um for us and our role in the token is that it's a purely utility token for the existence of the tokenomic structure in our ecosystem and we have no involvement in any kind of liquidity play that might be attached to the token unstoppable

worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse okay and you're a non-profit i think this model fascinates me because i find web 1 and web 2 media fascinating and i find the ways they're broken fascinating it also fascinates me because i think it's a harbinger of what's to come in a lot of industries where you know there's a lot of industries with middlemen and you know you know gatekeepers and and and [ __ ] that's going to be done away with um one of the things i think like so this is what's behind my next question which is are you guys making money and i don't mean that in a negative way i mean that in a you have to be in a very privileged position to be able to take something on and not make money from it so i'm curious how the economics work for other people who maybe want to disrupt industries in a similar way but need to make some money yeah we've been very transparent about the revenue um distribution between the team and the the dow and the everything out so um as a team the with the secondary sales there's a 70 that's going to the dow and 30 of it goes to the core team um and structure of the primary sales that we took that didn't go to the dow um fifty percent the other so there was fifty percent when it's to the down then you've got another fifty percent so another fifty percent of that fifty percent was set aside for tax and um you know all the things that we need to do there um and then uh and then the balance of that the second 50 of that was um a percentage of it was split between the team and then another percent large percentage of it was actually held for the first six months of operation to bring on the head of operations the head of partners the head of members the head of the dow the run the community et cetera et cetera so eventually that will all move out over as an expense under the dow but we knew that in the interim before whether dao was still getting built and the project being structured out in the ecosystem we would require a runway and so we put a runway in place from the proceeds of the primary sales it's just like how it should be in my opinion like you know obviously like you need to be incentivized as a founder to be to want to continue working but also it's like you should be incentivized for working right you should be rewarded for working right so i love the way we set it up like i'm really i'm actually really proud of ourselves like when it comes to that something really like vocal about is that we're giving so much money to these projects without knowing what they're doing and the second you have a roadmap your business so you there's expectations no matter if your pfp project or whatever we're a business we came right off the bat we're not a pfp we're a business we're running an enterprise that we're trying to build that's going to be owned by you guys so it's like we're putting 50 there and then we're doing this and that and then this is this piece of the of the seconds as well so i'm really happy of the way we like set this up because it matter it manages you know to put a significant of money on the side for the company to have revenue because the 70 is no joke like we've we've catered over 600 ether in the first month and a half of profit in the dow in when it comes to like to secondary sales so which is a lot when you're launching a startup most startups like they're trying to make money into that like we're talking about like 40 million dollars of volume in the first month month and a half for a media company right so we managed to do that but the same time enough for like our team to be like okay let's go we want to wake up in the morning and do it right so i think we found the perfect balance and i hope that people really like use that as a standard yeah okay here's the thorny question because when we think about what's gone so wrong in web one and web two i think like probably what comes top of mind to a lot of people one of the things is like misinformation and then from misinformation you get to censorship and de-platforming and these are just like you know a mishigosh of just thorny questions that in some ways are like at the core of human beings like you kind of can't tech your way out of these problems i'm curious how you guys think about this and um how you think a dao structure helps or or if anything can help i haven't i have a response for this and i it's it's simplified so there's obviously nuance in my thinking around it so i just want to pre-face it with that because i understand that these this topic is thorny for sure and everybody has an opinion on it um and so i'm just speaking on behalf of myself now not on behalf of rugradio either so um if you think about um let's say like at the extreme version of it and neo-nazi wants to produce content for rug radio right i mean a terrifying thought process right um so where does the where's the line of free speech and access and tolerance right of of this of this thing well for me personally there's no tolerance for that behavior right and so then you actually say what's the next step of that like i think probably most people would agree that there's no tolerance for the behavior right as an extreme example yeah it's the where do you draw the line question where's the where's the line drawn so you can say okay as a dao we all vote there's no tolerance for that they're not allowed on the ecosystem right but when where decentralization sits in this in this argument is that that's fine they can no longer be in the system but we as individuals and as a collective have no right over their ability to own or not own if they want to own they can buy it in the free marketplace if they don't own they don't buy it in the free marketplace right and that's where the line is the line is the freedom to choose what they own and don't own just like everybody should have that whereas as a community as an ecosystem we get to have the freedom to choose what we tolerate and what we promote and what exists in our ecosystem right and so for me the line sits there and you can see this as an example and it's a very fresh example so i don't want to dive too much into it but with the ens example so there was a situation there where everybody strongly disagreed with the behavior and didn't tolerate it and he was removed from the situation but no one can take away his ownership right and that's a really important thing even if you don't agree with it that that person should have that benefit it's a really important thing to say everybody has the right to maintain the ownership of what they own i strongly agree with that like you should never like this about ownership right our space is really about the ownership and and i think that as long as you don't have power to take over ownership from someone but you know it's like we don't want that person to be representative of this basically yeah right so it's different and i think what's appealing here is i think neo-nazism thankfully really is a fringe ideology so if you're a dao where there's a collective decision-making component happening that's just not going to be allowed because the majority do think that's like really really wrong and i think what what where there's really exciting potential in the dow media landscape is it's no longer like a handful of editors coming out of in some cases like a handful of schools right like kind of making that determination it like i would find cnn more interesting if the hosts who are the people that i'm there to watch anyways were really the ones who fully got to decide together what could and could not stand and right now you have is all these people in the background that you don't know that i have no you know even sort of parasocial relationship with right like who i know are pulling strings and saying look i worked for andrew young's presidential campaign i know from versailles from people telling me that they were told like msnbc and other places like hey you know don't talk about yang or if you talk about him you have to say he doesn't have a chance to win like and and whereas if a community is like i don't think in math that decision would have been made right if it wasn't sort of a couple of individuals so i find that exciting and um and we'll never be able to solve this issue right but it but i think having the great narrative is interesting um our literally our just do it is on the narrative you know i mean like you know how 6510 speaks about seizing the means of production yeah you know the disgrace is all about owning the narrative the memes and the conversation and this is exactly what they mean i mean it's funny right but mimetics is a fundamental part of the way not just this ecosystem but all ecosystems work and i mean fundamental around like why even do a decentralized like fight why bother right like why bother with all this because it's not easy okay so why bother building something like this right and the why bother is because we can build the best coolest things in the world in in crypto like we could build the coolest stuff ever made but if we don't own the narrative we will not win this space will not survive like it's really that simple just like this space does not survive no but like just like web 2 like is getting to a point where you almost feel like it's getting like strangled and it's begging for air just like how at some point instagram and social platforms were placed news outlets and sienna and tv and like this and just like new ones are coming and they're coming up for air there's a reason why it's because at some point there's kids like me like yo like i'm sick and tired of this [ __ ] like i don't own it i'm only adding value to this like it's happened to me platforms i've left previous platforms where i just felt like i'm bringing you so much value and i'm at the point where it's not even entitlement just like it's how much more can i give you yeah where i could get something like the thing well and i don't think it's entitlement it goes back to the thing i was saying that excites me at the top right which is like if i'm spending 10 hours on a twitter space somebody says i'm wasting time but somebody's also making money off of that why shouldn't i be a part of making the money off of that like there's money to be made from an activity and it's my activity like like even the person even below that like like yeah i i could like do some make something out of that because i'm on all day but like what about the person that's listening to me all day like i want that person gently like that wag me mentality is not just a freaking like say oh wait me like it's not how it is like i know people want to make fun of it but it's not like it's like we have ways to like build generational wealth individually all while building wealth for the people around us through crypto and nfts so the last question and so i interviewed justin khan and we were we were talking about how twitch would have been built in the web 3 world and i was asking like how would have that has changed his incentive structure as a founder and his economics and whatever and you know he made an interesting point which is he's like i wouldn't have been able to sell it like you can't exit a decentralized company which is like a huge mindset shift if you're an entrepreneur right like that's you know that's that's like fundamental so this company is not something that well and again it's a non-profit structure literally but it it's not something you can exit or or sell if you build this really successful media brand correct so that that's interesting and maybe comment on that but but you know the big question is five years from now a year from now 10 years from now like would love to kind of hear each of your like visions of like the ideal of what this looks like and knowing it's never gonna sell it's gonna what just be it's gonna be owned by by the people speak on that yeah um for me the the ideal is that whatever structure that i mean i obviously come at this from the tokenomics perspective as opposed to the marketplace perspective but so from my my viewpoint i look at the structure and i hope that somebody comes in and adds to it and really makes it better but this is v1 it feels like v1 right it's like the first take at how to do this and i'm sure it's not right like i'm sure there's so many things that will be shown out by the marker that there's ways to do better right and so i'd love for to come and look at this in five years time and see all of the ways in which the collective the commons have taken something and made it so much better for for the ecosystem and so from that perspective that's that's what i'd really love to see and then the just from the general marketplace perspective i just you know i you know like i said at the very beginning i'm a pretty pretty much staunch decentralization advocate and so if i could imagine a world where power was held accountable by truth through through the commons um i think that that would be an extraordinary place to live in and i hope that my children grow up in a world like that where they feel like they can speak truth to power through the commons through something they own in the commons like that's exciting for me to think about so yeah that's what i hope for from this awesome i love it mel i'm so glad i got to know you a bit better on here thank you so so much for joining i know you gotta run this is amazing your brand is amazing i uh would love to chat more so i'm sure hopefully we'll stay in touch yes thank you so much for your time i appreciate it and for listening to to what we've built really really appreciated so much so thank you it's amazing bye and uh yeah paint your paint your vision well my vision is just like like i never built like we never built even from a gecko like there was never even a question like what if we want to exit and and like sell it like even people as we're asking us like so can it be bought like can facebook like meta come here and like say oh you're the biggest brand in the space and we'll buy you out it's like no they can't actually the way it's set up it can't be bought right and because it's through the true ethos of what we're trying to build it's like to give it to the people and we're building on top of it right like that's literally how i think this will be successful could have gone a traditional route started media company called the boys at a16 and the fam out there because we got friends everywhere shout out to the vcs too and the angels they're very important to every space but like that's not what i wanted to do you know i mean like i wanted to truly show the world that i can build and we can build a company through nfts that's the what it is and that's what's so revolutionary about it and i want people to double it down because i really want people to understand that we just showed everyone that we can raise 2 100 which was equal to 7 million a day of launch exactly on the dot through nfts and build something that will be successful but also owned by the people like my i'm a true like i'm a i'm a really a pure like as well you know how as much as male as a purist in terms of decentralization i'm really a purist in terms of community building and so really wanting to reward the people that believed in me personally and that followed the journey of baroque in the space from the get-go that then evolved into something bigger than me i want this to outgrow me by 10 million times and that's what's already doing i'm seeing it people are starting to value our hoes and the treasury and then there's the dow and i'm slowly just going to blend in like i have to buy my rugs in the secondary market yeah okay like straight up yeah no i i posted like yo i just swept it and like because i'm allowed if it comes from my personal like pocket right and i'm a dog so i'll verify everything so like i that's what i want and it's going to go to the people because like just and even like money-wise like there's so many different avenues for myself for my co-founders and everybody to just go out there and make money in the nfc space anyways and we're going to keep on building things like we're going to add layers to it this rock radio we're gonna incubate brands and companies and keep building from within right so there's so many different ideas and layers that we can add to this and in my opinion like it's it's it's it's it's extremely bullish because like you can just do so much more out of that yeah let me ask you this do you have you compromised uh making the maximum amount of money you possibly could for the sake of doing what's right or do you feel like this in narrow terms yes but in the broader sense you'll actually be able to make a lot more because of what you're building here i i swear to god my first mentor was 18 starting the whole stuff like was like yo think about the 10-year plan yeah and when you think about it rock radio i was talking about with my my my community the other night it was like all inspired and stuff i was like 2021 was my 10th year actually grinding social media signed 2011 with tumblr and it's my 11th year and it actually all came into place on the 10th year i actually all my life i put aside short-term money so i was never super rich i was always doing good but i was never like i was seeing some of my friends going to get rich quick and like [ __ ] ferrari this nice house apartment in l.a i always stayed in my home in montreal you know and and this and that and it's just like but i was always doing good it's just but never doing bad but i was never doing crazy but on your tent it's like it hit hard right life changed and here it is we're building something in 10 years so the answer to this is like short term i probably did like probably did right built something look at the valuations these companies are getting nowadays like oh this is half a billion that's like it's i swear to god i make it sound easy but it's actually not that hard nowadays to build something crazy and get insane evaluations from it yeah and then go out there like you just i wanna you have to really go out and get it right but long term the answer is no i don't think i've i let anything off the table i genuinely think that we're going to be able to all become uh successful together my that's my goal i want everybody around me like i'm seeing through nfts i'm like wow like we were telling people about apes like 0.2 and i'm seeing all my homies get money now and i'm just like let's [ __ ] go like on like on a bigger level on a bigger scale right now is the same thing right like we're going to be able to build that i'm not worried like i literally live in the mentality of like the more you give these you're going to get tenfold you'll see receive tempo and if you actually live in that that like mentality and the mindset of abundance your whole life like you're gonna get tenfold so yeah like the answer is yes to no right it's like yes in the short term but no in the long term i don't think so and that's why i think it's such an important point to highlight because we were so kind of conditioned to think of like oh he had a billion dollar acquisition or whatever right and and so that's why i think some people look at this space or look at this like this will never work like this doesn't make sense like yeah well i was guilty who wants to exit his own company what the [ __ ] you're going to say hey i'm building to exit that means you're building i said but like but then the consumer is just going to consume to consume and then it's just going to pass hands but like yeah yeah i'm building because i wanna [ __ ] build you know and then it'll work out and it doesn't work out i'll just go build something else but it's gonna work out because i'm gonna put my time and attention towards it because i've got my name on this but it's just like like it's just so weird this like mentality and i've been entrepreneurs i'm 18 so of course my whole life i was conditioned to like you're going to build to exit like they never sat right with me like what would you want to exit you so many founders go back and buy their own companies again or just build the same thing again because they're like [ __ ] i wish i'd never exited or i wish i'd never taken vc money because now i don't actually own it me it's like yo you want to be an investment rug radio you can be sequoia acc the biggest guys you could be a billionaire bill gates whatever you can be carly you can be feroc or anywhere on the ground level you have to buy the nfts that's how you invest in rug radio well and that was an interesting piece that osf thread that you know i i liked like right he kind of made that point and he's like why i think this is a great investment if you're like a regular person right is is you're gonna get rug tokens you know my rug genesis nft is gonna feed me this rug utility token and if facebook wants to come along and buy rug radio they just buy all of the rug utility tokens which we may or may not allow for or i don't know if it's the utility token whatever the point being like they have to actually just buy out the tokens which in theory should be cannot the price you cannot buy all the tokens right but you cannot it's impossible we ran the math like you cannot buy it so it's like there's there's never even more than 400 nfts listed of 20 000 on the marketplace right now there hasn't been once more like 500 which is sick right but it's just like and that's what like you know that's what i'm focused on is really the grand the big picture like and and people are going to get to that because there's going to be a point where a lot of stuff is going to crash and a lot of like quick whatever project is going to go up and down and we're going to still be here delivering content to the people because media is never going to die media has been going on forever and ever and also like people won't be entertained and we are actually like it's our creators are are native it's like the people literally like i'm one i'm one of the people too like it's like you're one of the people too it's like all of us just like getting together to create content for the space what are you looking for in hosts right now you've got applications i know you've onboarded a whole series like you're kind of first cohort uh when people are applying what are you looking for i'm looking for originality i'm looking for entertainment i'm looking for depth of information looking for a wealth of information i'm looking for intelligence i'm looking for fun there's all sorts of shows right some are hilarious some like we got nyla with kids on the blockchain for like younger crowd we got photography we got um music nfts we got psychedelic shows we got nft fantasy league we got that's what i'm looking for like right now i have a group of lawyers like hey like we don't have a legal show i think we should go and i'm like wait that's yeah like we don't have that yet let's go like you know it's just like and also obviously with the partners we're talking to like the potential partners like they could bring in like their corpse and like all the people to like just all their eyes and also to rug radio and host a show within the space obviously like we want them to like match the ethos ethos and the and the and what we stand for which is very important uh ideally working with mostly if only not only web 3 native companies and people that's the goal right to highlight them that's what we've done so far and yeah like it's just like there's so much that can be done but that's what we're looking for it's just like you know like originality fun you know people that are actually in the space for good reasons like that's that's what it is essentially i mean swimming in the hands of people soon so they're going to be able to vote on shows and they're going to decide what they like right so it's uh so that was that was the question that will be something where i'll apply to be a host and the governance folks who hold the governance tokens will vote and say yes right now we're we're picking 50 right i'm at 20 deep right now being like 50 which is pilot shows but you know at some point like that's why like i'm i'm so bullish on this because i call the network effect like this is really a network effect of information in people and it's just gonna go be everywhere and in my opinion it's gonna be everywhere for the right reasons and we're gonna be doing the job of like educating people like a lot of people like yo i don't want to open instagram it's so toxic out there there's so much rock pools but like someone has to do it or else people are gonna keep like someone has to go out there and create the content guess what this morning this kid's like yo i can help you with the instagram content okay let's go let's get it this other person might hear me like yo i'm a youtube seo expert let's go let's get it like it's crazy the amount of look betting on rock radio is lady betting on the community because we're community oriented it's really like when you go on my discord right now we have conversations about like how we're going to build things do this do that wait i want like i said yo we're going to be in austin who's a videographer in austin boom bang there's so many people like you know what i mean so that's what i'm bullish on that's why i'm not worried on like people you keep floor prices increase decrease this that i don't care it doesn't matter to me because it's so clear to me where we're going over the next 10 years that i'm so not like worried about this because i'm there like i'm i'm already there mentally and so is our team right and that's why i love and even our community right now has been conditioned to think about the long term in a space where time is so warped that you think about your quick pump quick dump right we're conditioning our community to really think about the fact that we're building a company for nfc this is revolutionary like i'm surprised like we're not like i and the thing is i haven't had the time to do this whole pr push this that get on these interviews and is that why because we're so head down building honestly like you're catching me after like another 10 hours straight of like calls right and it's just like that's what we're up to we just want to build something for the community where one day i can step back and just watch it grow that's the idea i think also sometimes pune the stage in the kind of ecosystem that we're in right now sometimes punishes projects and i mean that sort of economically in terms of their evaluation that do have a specific vision because like we're still sort of in this hypey phase where it's like oh i can project that this could be anything and i'd rather buy that than a thing that's telling me it's something amazing you know i could i could have launched through a pfp and said warren talks with disney pop yeah yeah yeah i'm hungry of course i'm talking of course i'm talking to the biggest brands in the world because when you have a following on twitter they already reach out to you anyways yeah so like myself like ferocious like the as the business person the influence or whatever you want to [ __ ] call it like obviously like there's already like this demand from these people but i'm not going to use that to like boost my project because it doesn't work that way i'm trying to set up meaningful collaborations and partnership with brands which is going to drive value to the space and to the dow that's essentially what i'm looking for when i'm working with a partner so i could name you the two people i was on the phone with today it's so crazy actually because some of two global brands but it's like for what right i'll come to the moment because it's also about attraction if you have a long-term orientation you want to attract the right audience like you don't want to attract the audience that's just in it to flip or who's going to freak out because they haven't made enough money on it you want to attract the audience that fundamentally gets what you're doing and wants to stand by you for that um are you an actor me yeah i'm like an introverted extrovert i'm extroverted like af but the thing is there's a lot of [ __ ] i just like i just like you know it's like like it's like i feel like there's only 10 out there even though it sounds like more no that it's interesting because i i would kind of describe myself on that line too like i can extrovert i think really well and then i'm like okay now i just need to like shut down and like like you know kind of shut out the world to recharge yeah which is fascinating though because you're you're so good at just like you know talking to the community like that that's where for me and i i don't have a reason to launch an nft program right now but of course you're in this space people are like why are you gonna launch an nft and i'm like when i have a reason to but the thing for me is like the i'm exhausted i love i think the community stuff is so important but the idea of now having a like i'm tired with what i do and like the idea of having to output emotionally that much i'm like oh i can't do that right now i'm not really exhausted it's exhausting it's exhausting anybody if you're trying to drop a project and you don't have the nerve to handle a mob of people come at you the second your floor is down quick don't quit i mean by that but don't do this round do a different route it's like wait like i waited a whole year before launching a project you have people that haven't been in space for two weeks to launch a project and then they expect like the world like it's just like it's just like you got to be ready for it like sometimes you're just like yo i swear to god some days i wake up actually every day i wake up i'm like all right you're insane and let's go like i think i'm i genuinely think i'm crazy carly but like sometimes but it's okay because i love chaos right yeah but the thing is like and i love that kick of like that stress that anxiety like i thrive off that too i'm insane i guess i don't know that's every entrepreneur is a little bit crazy in them but it's just like but it's just like but i also love what i do and i do it with passion and and i have a lot of heart and soul into it right and if you don't have that you're never going to be able to make it in the space because it requires an extra little passion in order to go every day right but the thing is it's just like you gotta like it's just like a project requires just like i have 14 000 holders there's 14 000 people every day is that like fun that's big that's massive it's one of the problems it's it's one of the projects with the most amount of holders in the space we should have left it's not holy [ __ ] and where the launch is gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be one of the dials as per cynical dial with the most the most of my participant in the entire crypto space could go figure i when i i went big and the thing is that because i we can do it and we we're going to do it because we're building the right team like we have the right intentions you know our minds are at the right place and we have also the knowledge and the capacity to build it because we have a community behind us of builders and we have investors investors means the people invested in the community in the project that actually believe in it you know and everybody who doesn't doesn't have to put you vote with your wallet that's why i love about web3 is if i don't disagree with this i can just sell it never with my wallet and the beauty of it is that we have people that are just determined to help us build this and i will see the end of it and it's going to be sick so it's just like now my focus is on building this entire thing and infrastructure and we're already working on incubating two projects already working on four media partnerships in order for us to show people now how it's tangible how you're gonna be able to see you know this come to fruition and it's really cool to do but that was launching like 15 20 days and today is the second for context for folks okay i'm gonna ask you the last question because you've been on for so long okay this actually is circling back because i've heard you say this before you said it on here and i feel like this is a really fundamental point to what you're doing and and and and i don't fully understand it yet and so i i'm imagining there's somebody else who feels that way so this is this point you make that i think is really profound but i need it spelled out a little bit more which is the the kind of web two is platform creators and this this is the creators the center the participants creators platform can you flesh out a little bit more like so web 2 is platform creators consumers web 2 is platform creator consumer meaning platform comes first it gets it extracts all of the value the billion dollar add money everything's picture instagram instagram comes first twitter comes first the other one publicly is traded then come the creators whatever because they get some kickback some way they get ads money this and that they create but they get nothing much for that and then the consumers just literally get like almost like dumped on like you're doing just like scrolling you're scrolling you're scrolling it's going and sometimes honestly your iq is lowering it's bad for your mental health i come from the internet and yo i come from the inca instagram space i've built tens of millions of pages of followers worth it like i still have 10 million followers on instagram i think i don't even log back in i don't know so i've done it i know what it's like i see what it does to people i see how people get hooked up on it right so there's no like it's almost zero stop like the the consumer essentially gets absolutely nothing out of it but the dopamine and stuff like that and we [ __ ] up like the mental health of people like the web 2 platforms have done that to people right yeah web3 flips it it's participants first the people get the most amount of value out of this is the participant right which are our holders and the people learning and it's not because they get something out of it directly because they get to own the the infrastructure then the creators which to me are the educators the teachers they're the bridge and then the platform which is rug radio right and so to me when i started on on instagram on on in the nft space sorry last year i went on the whale shark podcast early on he picked me up in march and i was just a nobody he's like you're going to be the bridge between nfts in the mainstream world and so i made it my mission to become a bridge what does that mean i want to take the mainstream space and i want to take the nft space and the community and bridge them together because there's so much beauty in both of them and if you manage to build a bridge that's what you're going to do and i've and i they used to call me the bridge as a joke right so that's what i always wanted to be because i'm like i don't want to be open c and i'm not a painter i'm not an artist i'm not this but i can be this platform in the middle this creator that just bridges everyone together so that's the most important people because they're the educators right and then the platform so yeah essentially rug radio gets a lot of value out of it but it goes back to the participant and the creator because they own it yeah when you say it flips it it's that it's that click for me now that the it is value extraction or or the value right like the platform and that's the piece that i hadn't hadn't clicked in terms of that analogy you're giving but that's it is profound i'm glad i'm glad we flushed that out well like there's too much it's amazing i am so grateful to you and of course mel who's now gone for for hopping on here i i have a a twitter space actually that i have to on on to in a few minutes so and i've already taken a ton of your time but this is so i think hopefully really helpful for the audience amazing exciting i think it's amazing because it's just it's such an interesting new test case or study of how media can be run but i also think you're building a model that in a lot of other industries will want to study and like you know they're going to study this like harvard business school someday you know it's like i hope to be copy this open source everything go ahead build it just because at the end of the day like that's what's beautiful about the space it's like you can copy it but you can never replicate like you can take someone's idea but you can't take someone's energy so rugby is always gonna have its own energy and i hope that people will come and see what we're building and really highlight it because i really think we're changing the space and the world as a whole so what's the what's the
