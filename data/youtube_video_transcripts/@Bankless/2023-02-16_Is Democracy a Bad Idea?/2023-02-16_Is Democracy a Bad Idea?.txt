take for example a desert island of 10 people and they all find themselves there no help is coming give six of the people all raise their hands and voted for those six people to rule the four I think most people would have a problem with that they'd be like why did the six of you get to rule the four but that's just democracy if you cast it like with men and women then it becomes even more visceral let's say there's four women and six men to what degree do those six men have the right to do whatever they want to the women just because they outnumber them right I think they don't have any right to do anything to the women doesn't matter if a vote is taken to violate them and to me that seems obvious on the example of the desert island but somehow when you expand it from 10 people to 350 million most throw that idea out the window and they think anything that is democratically voted is fine
