grayscale just won a Monumental legal Victory against the SEC and we've got a lot of cause to celebrate this was the fight for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S this was a major step forward for grayscale and crypto to get a spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S lots of jurisdictions have one the U.S doesn't why so I think in recent times it's because the SEC has just waged this war on crypto they typically have kind of cited concerns around Market manipulation and things like that which I don't think that holds much water that would kind of cite concerns around custody but we have coinbase as a custodian who has been operating like that for over 10 years now and has never been hacked so really I don't think there's any reason for them to to be denying these things outside of personal bias and just not wanting to see this happen and that is pretty much I think what the judge has actually said here as well yeah the judge used these words arbitrary and capricious
