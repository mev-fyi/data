on wednesday october 14th coindesk is throwing an invest ethereum economy virtual event which i'm really excited that coindesk is getting into the ethereum space more vitalik buterin is going to talk there as well as heath from the cftc and i am also giving a talk as well on the bowl case of ether so here i am right down here defy dad is also talking rune christensen is also talking uh some really all stars who are giving some really fantastic talks so i i've seen the schedule i've seen the list of talks and i'm really excited about it they've done a really good job picking out the right topics there's a link in the show notes where you can register with the code bank list to get 25 off of your ticket so get that ticket and then watch me talk about how awesome ether the asset is okay guys we are back we've got jake chernovitsky and we are talking about uh regulation and what it means for d5 you know jake part of me wonders like it it's like kind of regulators is sort of like the the eye of sauron from like lord of the rings where just like it's sweeping the land and right now it's it it found uh bitmex and its eyes turned to bitmex and i think the question in everyone's mind is when what what are the regulators going to do with b5 because d5 is no longer a small niche market right so we have we have uniswap and it just last month surpassed coinbase in terms of uh trading volume i think that's a pretty large market for crypto how long until the eye of sauron turns its eye on like decentralized exchanges for instance maybe a uniswap and d5 as a whole and once it does turn its eye on d5 what does it do yeah so um and so it's a funny comparison i i guess it's more like the eye of sauron with a two-year lag right so like and also i mean it's not really the eye of sauron because i think we you know have a little more respect for our regulators than that but um look regulators are already paying attention to d5 there's no question about that um there are different levels of understanding about d5 depending on which regulatory agency you're talking about but as you're showing here um you know there is some concern about defy and compliance with anti-money laundering laws like the bank secrecy act i think this article is a little bit sensational and i i disagree uh with that headline which seems a little bit clickbaity to me but we can get into that um but you know fincen in particular is very sophisticated in thinking about d5 i guess if the question is when if ever do we see enforcement actions or settlements related to d5 um before you go on jake just for the podcast listener so the headline i'm pulling up is called booming decentralized finance a potential haven for money laundering and this was published in bloomberg that was the headline you're referring to yeah so i yeah i i um i respectfully disagree with the author on that one we can sort of get into why i think the risk is a lot lower than that might represent um but you know i think enforcement actions are a little bit far off i think that it will just take longer for regulators to understand the technology and then figure out who the right subjects are for regulation and whether and to what extent uh there have been actual violations of those regulatory frameworks so i think it's you know it's the early days but just like in 2017 there was a lot of identification of activity that seemed pretty clearly to violate the securities laws you know i think there are various elements of i think what people may call defy but which i would dispute as to whether it's really decentralized uh that you know in a couple of years we'll be seeing some pretty obvious enforcement actions related to those so jake what are what are like the carve outs for d5 right now right so it seems to be there there is one like like point of differentiation from a bitmex versus a not something that's more defi uh is is certainly custody of assets right so um with bitmex you have to deposit your bitcoin they retain custody of your assets in order to use their derivative services with with most d5 you don't have to like with with d5 that's actually more on the decentralized spectrum you don't have to do that a smart contract ideally autonomous non-controlled smart contract kind of takes takes ownership of that is that a key carve out i guess and maybe in particular i think it's more interesting to talk about sort of the eye of sauron with respect to like um the bank secrecy act and fincen um is that going is that a difference and what other differences will a group like vincent kind of uh make yeah so i i wouldn't call it a carve out i would say it's it's an important fact that changes whether regulation applies or not and we always have to remember a couple things one is decentralization is not a magic cure right it's not a perfect defense to all regulation decentralization is a tool that reduces risk in certain ways and some of the ways in which it reduces risk means that traditional regulations no longer apply the way they do to centralized systems you also have to remember regulations don't apply to technology they apply to people and their conduct so the question isn't necessarily is defy regulated or is a d5 protocol regulated the question is are there people using d5 protocols who are subject to regulation um in the example you give about whether a system is custodial or not that is really important for some regulatory frameworks and some classifications of regulated institutions under those frameworks including the bank secrecy act so the main question that we look at under the bank secrecy act and that fincen has provided a lot of guidance about is whether or not crypto systems are money transmitters or money services businesses a money transmitter is an entity that receives funds from one person and transmits those funds to another person or location and a money transmitter needs to be registered with vincenne and it needs to have an aml compliance program including kyc a centralized exchange is a money transmitter it's probably a number of other regulatory classifications as well but for starters it's a money transmitter it receives funds in the form of deposits from its customers it transmits those funds back to customers at different wallet addresses therefore it is regulated under the bank secrecy act a defy protocol which is non-custodial arguably does not perform money transmission and fincen has actually put out some really helpful guidance on this in particular in may of last year may of 2019 they put out sort of a summary of their analysis of the different categories of pl of market participants in crypto including users administrators and exchangers of uh digital assets and basically from that guidance the lesson to be learned is a purely non-custodial platform that does not have a centralized operator that is performing this service of money transmission is not a regulated financial institution and therefore does not need to have an aml compliance program so that's why being non-custodial is very important the one thing i'll add to that though is being a money transmitter is one of many types of regulated financial institutions that has to comply with the bsa another totally different classification is a futures commission merchant right what bitmex was classified as by the cftc if you are a futures commission merchant in fcm you also have bank secrecy act obligations whether your fcm is custodial or not so being non-custodial is not a cure for bank secrecy act regulation wow okay so like following the first category i get i guess traditionally think of something like a wallet right so like a meta mask for instance you know not to put specific companies or projects on this but that would be something that probably falls outside of the bank secrecy act and fincen's jurisdiction yes and fincen actually said in their guidance pretty clearly that in a quote-unquote unhosted wallet and by that what they mean is a wallet that is that is purely under the control of the user is not money transmission right the creator of that unhosted wallet is basically just a software developer that put out a piece of software but that developer does not have custody of the user's funds and the user as long as they're using cryptocurrency on their own behalf right for their own account their own purposes then they're not performing money transmission for other people so that's why an unhosted wallet is not subject to bank secrecy act regulation and that's kind of jake the case of like so far right that's that's how kind of vincent has has uh issued guidance that so far that seems to be the case i guess yeah you know maybe the question is right so we we talked about earlier what c the sec and cftc what their goals are right um but uh fincen the big secrecy act goals are completely different they're they're really like we're trying to prevent um like terrorist types of events we're trying to prevent a category of financial activity that um like child pornography these sorts of things that that kind of goes against um the laws and and ethics of the united states right so like is it possible that this kind of mandate starts to creep into these other like transactions like what what about individual civil liberties right so like ken fincen um or like the bank secrecy act or the doj start to broaden their mandate to say well individual u.s citizens cannot use say a uniswap or some decentralized exchange like how broad is their mandate when their entire reason for existence is to stop terrorist activity it seems pretty broad yeah you're you're hitting a really important point and this i think is going to be the policy battle for our space in the coming years and it's been heating up a lot in just even the last couple of months um so i guess a couple things on this the first is fincen is a regulatory agency they do not make the law they interpret the law they also can pass their own implementing regulations but if you want to have a change to the bank secrecy act that would have to come from the u.s congress right now the bank's secrecy act the statute is what says that only regulated financial institutions are subject to the aml compliance program obligations of the law and an unhosted wallet just doesn't fit any of those definitions of a regulated financial institution so the question is number one to what extent might fincen want to exert more authority over unhosted wallets or peer-to-peer transactions and number two how could the law change to be more restrictive of these kinds of these kinds of transactions i think stepping back from the technical legal analysis it is important to note that what we are building is a parallel financial system that allows the transfer of basically any amount of value to anyone anywhere almost instantly almost for free without any ability of governments to censor or surveil those transactions right that is a threatening sounding type of technology and there is just a really big ongoing policy question whether regulators are going to be okay with that you know the world we live in right now is a world where regulators are more or less comfortable having surveillance of the on-ramps and off-ramps into the crypto ecosystem right so if you want to get us dollars into ether or ether back into us dollars you're gonna have to do that through a regulated exchange that's why you have an account at coinbase or gemini or kraken or you know name your your um your on-ramp or off-ramp into crypto but then the transactions once you're in the crypto ecosystem right once you have your ether in your metamask wallet and you're you know moving it around between different d5 protocols there is basically no regulation or at least no um requirement of reporting or kyc at that point i think where we're heading there's basically two directions we can go from here one is um policymakers understand the benefits and the value of that kind of financial activity right the whole point of what we're building is a system where people can actually own their own assets they don't have to rely on trusted third parties centralized custodians to manage their assets for them and also manage their personal identifying information for them we know how that goes right not terribly well and also policymakers who understand the civil liberties issues that ryan was mentioning right i believe that financial privacy is a really important right and i believe the right to own your own assets is really important the other version though and this frankly is what we're hearing more from policymakers now and i can tell you you know i do a lot of work here in washington dc where i'm based uh you know talking to regulators and legislators about these issues is a desire to create a fully custodial system right where you cannot withdraw crypto assets from a traditional intermediated financial system and the way that they're sort of right now thinking about creating that barrier between the custodial system and sort of the open defy system is to say that exchanges those on-ramps and off-ramps are not allowed to perform transactions with unhosted wallets or that they have to kyc on hosted wallets before they can do the transaction in other words you have to prove that your ledger hardware wallet or your metamask account is yours before the exchange can allow you to withdraw to that wallet oh my god there could be transaction limits right you can only withdraw 500 a day something like that um and this is actually heating up as an issue and i think in the next six months or so this is something that we need to start arguing about that sounds like a direct attack on the bankless nation it is and and it's not look it sounds you know pessimistic but this is what has happened in switzerland so there is uh the swiss rule which says that vasps virtual asset service providers have to verify the beneficial owner of an unhosted wallet before they can do a transaction to that unhosted wallet this is all under the auspices of the travel rule which you've probably heard about before and the result of this basically is swiss institutions refuse to process transactions to unhosted wallets because they don't know how to comply with that requirement this is okay so um david you wrote a piece on bagless on monday about kind of the bit mex case being sort of like like dividing the crypto community a little bit and i've got to say i'm somewhat divided on it too right so on the one hand i i totally agree with regulator mandate to basically let's let's get the bad actors out of the space so to the extent that bitmex can like you know cheat or like um you know take funds away or basically have their have their service operated as a black box so you have no transparency into going what's going on and therefore allegedly trade against their own customers exactly right so to the extent they were doing that like that's a bad actor okay regulator like you know there's a bad actor in the space do your job and thank you yes but but but the other side of this is to the extent that uh regulators not just regulators nation states uh want to clamp down on civil liberties like things that like if i pay you in cash money david right there's no aml kyc going on if i give you a bar of gold the transaction has completed and the nation state doesn't need to get involved and that that's where jake like i'm i've got to be honest i'm pessimistic and it's concerning to me because like even even this week we get stuff like this i'm going to show it on my screen i tweeted this but the uh the earn it act is in front of congress right now and this is basically uh legislation that is attacking internet encryption and privacy on the internet this is in front of the house right now with some supporters bipartisan support and it's like we need we need help with covid we like we don't need this kind of thing like so i'm worried quite frankly jake that our boomer um our boomer legislators are gonna go with option two and instead try to institute this whole authoritarian we need to know every single transaction in and out there are no peer-to-peer money transmissions that the government doesn't have an eye into there's no such thing as financial privacy anymore now that it's digital we somehow have a right to see everything that happens if you're a citizen of the nation and quite frankly that is terrifying to me jake is there any hope here like please say say that someone is willing to preserve our civil liberties at the nation-state level there is hope there's definitely hope um i am worried that i'm probably one of the more worried people you know working on these policy issues and i do think we need to take it seriously but i do think there's hope i think we have really good arguments and you know i hate to um you know i hate to be sort of like too much of a patriotic american but i do think especially we have really strong constitutional arguments you know arguments that really speak to american principles about uh first amendment rights fourth amendment rights i think financial privacy is something that we care about a lot in america i don't think we want to have a system like a more authoritarian country like china has set up where the government can see absolutely everything that everyone is doing at all times um so i do think we have good constitutional arguments good principled arguments i also think we have to look at this from the other side of the equation so when you go to policymakers and all you do is handwave about how amazing this new innovative technology is they don't really hear those arguments as much as they do when you say the risk that you're concerned about is actually pretty low right what think about what the policy makers are concerned about they're concerned that terrorists are going to use this technology to perpetrate attacks on our country to hurt innocent people to carry out crimes that none of us want to happen right we do not want to see child abuse in the world or terrorist attacks in the world we don't want to see defy being used by isis and hamas and al-qaeda that is not something that we want so what we have to do is also make arguments about why those risks aren't that serious right now and why concerns about some future world where terrorists are all of a sudden doing all of their business through defy which is not what's happening now don't get me wrong right there is is basically none of that happening right now there's very little actual use of crypto i mean they're doing it with um bills right with benjamin's with cash u.s dollars by far and away the most used currency for for criminal purposes and so you want to say to policymakers look we understand the risk there are ways to mitigate those risks we're fine with regulation of those on-ramps and off-ramps right it's okay for something like bitmex to have to perform kyc of its customers um but also don't kill the innovation that's happening in this new world that is trying to compete with the centralized version that china is building right or that other uh you know i guess you could call them foreign adversaries of the us and the sort of western world where they will control everything that happens on these on these systems um don't kill that version of this technology for fear of something that isn't really happening right now and instead consider other ways to attack the problem other than the overbroad act of just shutting down all innovation completely i feel like it's the case jake that we have a kind of a fight on our hands and what i mean is like uh so many in kind of crypto they they want to remove themselves from nation-state politics right um personally i don't advocate that at all right so like i think that if we want to preserve our civil liberties right um we actually have to engage in political discussions we actually have to vote we actually have to uh persuade lawmakers as to our case like it's almost like we have to re-fight for our constitutional rights in the digital age like because they they do seem to be eroding all around us so like what what can people do jake i mean um it feels like so much of this is um just pushed on us and foisted on us uh are there groups talking to legislators in in washington about these issues like should we inform ourselves on who to vote for what what kinds of things can the people do the bankless nation do to um like push these in the direction of option one rather than option two where we go full authoritarian yeah there's there's a lot that we can do and i think everyone needs to be engaged in this issue because if they're not it's very easy for elected officials to crush the space right at the end of the day our politicians say what you want about american democracy and and the state in which it finds itself today they are supposed to uh carry out the will of the people and so we need to make clear what the benefits of this technology are and make clear what we want to see happen in the space there's a couple organizations to know about that are working on these issues um one is coin center coin center has put out some amazing research and papers on this very issue one of my favorite papers is by their executive director jerry britto on digital cash and financial privacy uh arguing why this is extremely important to a free society that's a really important piece of work to read um there's the blockchain association which is a trade association here in dc i'm one of the co-chairs of its d5 working group along with jason somanzado at xerox and brian avello who's the general counsel at maker uh and we are engaging with policymakers often to discuss these issues and you know argue about why onerous regulation isn't necessary there's the chicago defy alliance we're working on a task force to also advance some of these policy arguments but really what people need to do is start getting educated about what the policy arguments are why it is important to a free society to have digital cash why we should not uh should not treat um a public blockchain like ethereum like a wire transfer system in the traditional financial system and and sort of you know why we should allow innovation to flourish what the benefits are and why they outweigh the risks you know i i guess uh dangling that carrot in front of our lawmakers is important and this is all not all bad news um we saw stc chair uh clayton talk about tokens like all stocks becoming tokenized at some point in the future so on the flip side to what you're saying jake there does seem to be kind of a carrot in front of the us the nation state lawmakers to say look you don't want to get left behind of this innovative technology the future is is quite clearly digital it's internet native it's programmable if we can somehow preserve our civil liberties in the process right then the bankless nation wins but but that is i guess the uh the challenge that's in front of us last question for you jake and thank you so much for spending time with us on these subjects it's hard to to wrap our heads around when we hear these headlines and you've distilled it quite well but i guess the question is um how long will it take for all of this stuff to shake out do you think so are we talking on the order of years like um are we talking on the order of of decades um if things go the optimistic route where do you see us in 10 years um i do think it's it's years to decades um it depends it depends on a lot of different factors um it depends on how effective we are in making these arguments and i mean just to to um to wrap up the thought that you just put out about um jay clayton sort of seeming to approve for the first time i've seen about you know tokenizing securities there are policy makers who are on our side this is not us versus them um brian brooks who's the uh the controller of the currency is a big fan of of crypto in general the deputy director at fincen is you know sort of a fan of what we're doing so there are people who sort of uh identify with with the mission um or at least are you know interested in sort of the benefits that these technologies can offer but you know where do we go in the next 10 years um i think that it partly depends on what the traditional financial systems response is to crypto as it grows so one of the fights we haven't really had yet is with the banks right so i mean bring this full circle right we're on the bankless state of the nation today the question is does jp morgan and morgan stanley and bank of america and et cetera et cetera did they all decide that it's us versus them did they decide that they need to start pushing policy makers to tamp down on uh what we're building in the d5 space or is there some world where we play together where there's some new role for those banks to serve um and that's something that we've been talking about a lot in the d5 space you know there are ways where it's not necessarily a bankless world it's just that banks look very different from how they look today right they're not custodying our assets um they're not performing this very capital intensive role they're serving a different purpose their service providers they are sort of launching their own products and services on top of blockchain-based decentralized finance protocols i think if we can get to that world where this doesn't seem like such a threat and we can then make a really strong argument that um supporting innovation in defy is good for american citizens and it's good for free enterprise and for for fair and and open markets that in a way it is a good response to the geopolitical threat that we're facing now where there are other countries going more toward a socialist or even more of a communist approach to their own financial systems then in 10 years we could be in an extremely good situation where defy is the financial infrastructure of the western world and no one even thinks twice about the fact that under the hood of the app that you have on your phone is a defy protocol as opposed to a traditional financial software on a on a server or something like that um we just really need to pay attention to what the risks are that we go in the other direction and do our best to sort of guide policymakers to the right place i i'm glad we're ending on an optimistic note here because i do think everything you said is optimistic jake and you know one one other thing i'll say is we largely got through the open communication protocol of the internet with a fairly free and neutral and open internet we did that with the the help of regulators and legislators there were bumps along the road it was not perfect but but largely the internet that we had the 1990s and the 2000s came through relatively unscathed it's possible we might be able to do that uh with with d5 and these open finance protocols uh david you have anything else that's optimistic man yeah jake you're talking about how a lot of this depends on what legacy financial institutions do and i'm reminded of the podcast that we just released on molok where it would take a lot for every single legacy financial system to all agree to be on the same page as be anti-crypto or anti-d5 right because the the more banks that sign up to be anti-crypto or anti-defy the more likely it is for one to defect and become like the the the c5d5 bank that spans across both right and so that that makes me optimistic that there's always going to be the incentive to be that one bank that's crypto friendly and then hopefully the market rewards them and then i think the other thing that makes me optimistic jake is that you you rattled off a list of uh defy working groups along with coin center that there are actual people like you so thank you tip of the hat jake for for defending the nation there there are people coordinating around the need to uh to get ahead of this problem right and to make sure that when the boomers leading this country are get informed with what's actually going on from people that are in the space and so jake i do see that as your role as perhaps protector of of the d5 nation so so thank you with everything you do and also thank you for coming on the bankless state of the nation to get us educated as to what's going on in this world my pleasure guys great to talk to you
