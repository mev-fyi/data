can you talk about the technology in the orb and how it does what its job is so what it does it has a lot of sensors in the front to just make sure whatever we see is an actual human being so not a display and not an AI that tries to fool us all of that compute happens locally so first check we look at a human being then second the eye is imaged and a unique Iris code is calculated on the device what that means is that the only thing we or anyone else could prove is that a user has verified before yes or no real coin is the option to make it privacy preserving open source and decentralized
