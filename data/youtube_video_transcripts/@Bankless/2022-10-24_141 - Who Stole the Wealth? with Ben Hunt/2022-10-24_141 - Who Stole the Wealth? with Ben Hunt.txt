welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better on how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys excellent episode with Ben Hunt we talk about wealth and who stole it first a few takeaways for you number one why is the world on fire now that's the opening question we ask Ben Ben thinks the root cause is actually just a simple number we get into that number two who stole the wealth actually why wealth is accelerating while GDP is flat we talk about the difference between these two metrics number three why the center cannot hold not against big Tech not against big media not against big politics why our world is increasingly fractionalized number four how Wall Street and treasury are defanging Bitcoin Ben's bear take on bitcoin also his bull take more bearish than bullish I think and you'll hear why and number five Ben's best advice for us in crypto and is hope for the future we talk about all of these things David what are we talking about in this episode and what should listeners pay attention to Ben Hunt and his Epsilon Theory newsletter Community is I've always appreciated it because of how close to the metal it is Epsilon theory is going after the alpha of the market which rides along the beta of the market and these are all real parts of you know the market cycle right like the fundamentals the numbers but the Epsilon part is the part that Ben Hunt is truly excels at which is the narrative part and this was novel a few years ago when Ben Hunt was was talking about the The Narrative and the storytelling side of financial markets and now everyone has kind of woken up to it post all of these like Federal Reserve Shenanigans and the fleeting nature of money and so we're bringing Ben back onto the show to talk about what are the big narrative migrations narrative movements uh that are going on in in the macro markets right now uh and also just like how people are all waking up to the story of fiat currency so as listeners go through this I think it's it's one part a lesson in history of how the story has been told since the 70s the 80s and the 90s and how that story has been conducive and flexible in creating a disparity between GDP and wealth wealth being a lot higher than GDP and I think as listeners listen to this they'll get a tune into a little bit of the future stories that they will probably hear out of the Central Bank uh Federal Reserve members but also what what uh Ben also calls you know big Tech big media big politics just a little bit closer to the stories that that we hear that we forget to uh forget to pull back the curtain on but Ben always does a fantastic job yes great he also has a lot of insight for people in crypto I think outside outside of our bubble so Ben exists in the in kind of the real non-crypto world I would say and he has some uh he's definitely on our side from a core values and thesis perspective but he also has some almost like fatherly wisdom I would say to offer the crypto and that comes near the end don't miss that as well of course David premium subscribers get to stick around the show for the debrief which is an episode after the episode where you and I talk about this Ben Hunt episode there's some things I want to unpack there what are you interested in talking about yeah Ben Hunt's characterization of Bitcoin is Art I thought was really interesting that you know not to undersell Bitcoin as a financial asset but it's also much more of a cultural expression of values more than it is money I think is a new take that I want to unpack with you in the debrief what do you want to talk about in the debrief run I think that Ben was a little more pessimistic than I am on crypto so not as pessimistic on bitcoin TM well maybe that but not as pessimistic on D5 itm or Bank TM I think we have a real shot at making this more than a bumper sticker making this a real Revolution anyway listeners get a flavor of that in the episode if you're a premium member you can stick around for the debrief

metal of things Ben welcome back to bankless well it's great to be here and thanks for the kind uh the kind introduction I've got to have you do uh you're in front of me every time I go somewhere to speak yeah I'm happy to do it happy to do this big fan of your work and it's been actually um two years a little bit more over two two years since you've been on Bank list and so I think we a lot has happened in the world in the last two years and I know you've been keeping you're someone who keeps uh Kean Paulson like reality versus narrative um I guess one narrative that feels true in my mind and I want you to check this against reality is it feels like the world is on fire right now like things are really like we're not in control and I'm wondering from your perspective if this is unique or if this is just a thing that's always happened in history and every generation every kind of Moment In Time Has Its struggles and problems is this unique or is this something that is pretty normal unique's a strong word you know a stronger word than I would use uh but is it uh the first time in 40 plus years that we've been the world's been in a situation like this absolutely absolutely I and I you know that that 40-year number I I use advisedly because it was 40 years since the last time we had a dramatic repricing of money and that's what's happening right now money globally is being repriced and that is uh that's always going to be a searing event and it's particularly searing given the amount of money that has been borrowed and has been is now sloshing around the world in various forms so the a global repricing of money is about as big or as impactful a global event as you can have and it absolutely means that central banks in other words Western economies cannot paper over their differences anymore you can't it's it's impossible now right to just print your way out of a real world problem that comes up like a war like an energy crisis um you just can't do it and so we're we're returning to an environment of every country for itself returning to an environment where as thucydidity said 2500 years ago that the strong do what they will and the weak do as they must so it's not unique it's happened you know many times before including 2500 years ago with freaking thucydides in Athens and Sparta uh but it sure is the first time in you know in my adult life where this has happened it sounds very volatile very chaotic this this era that that we're entering into once again but I'm trying to stop you there I'm gonna stop you there um I wouldn't describe it as chaotic and what I mean by that is what we're experiencing is not an aberration what we're experiencing I believe both internationally and domestically here in the United States it's an equilibrium which is just a ten dollar word that means a balancing point so chaotic you know and I obviously that's a term of of real art when you're talking about physics but I I mean it I I take it fortunate the chaos the chaotic in a colloquial sense that you know that anything could happen actually actually don't think that's where we are I think we're at a pretty stable balancing point unfortunately it's a very painful balancing point so uh so I just had to interrupt there just I don't I don't think it's chaotic but I but I think it is absolutely you know once in a lifetime once in a generation and searingly painful this idea of Money Getting repriced I think I think that is foreign to people because when people think about money they think about dollars no that that is the thing we price things with Ben Hunt uh money can't get repriced can it that's a foreign idea to people and if it's repriced what is it repriced against other types of monies are we talking about like foreign currencies no no no no no no but the price of money is an interest rate that's what a price of money is right I've I'm it look in the beginning I was just writing a note about this and so this is so great to have this conversation so in the beginning there was and I'm talking in the beginning like 10 000 years ago in the beginning there was a person with a business you know doing some economic activity hauling you know grain from point A to point B whatever right in in Sumeria right person with the business and uh they wanted money from a person with money I don't know what the money's worth you know to buy another cart right to you know develop a you know better wheel technology who knows right but a person with a business wants money from a person with a with with money and there are only two mutually voluntary ways to have that transaction I'm usually voluntary I mean you know obviously the the the person with the business could you know use violence to get money from the person with money or the person with money could use violence to take over that person's business let's leave that aside two voluntary transactions one is that the person with a business can offer the person with money a promise to participate in the future business activities the future economic activities we call that stock right or the person with the business can promise to repay the person with money at some point in the future with more money right we call that a bot that's it there's stocks in their bonds that's all there is so about a nanosecond after stocks and bonds and money was invented uh Wall Street was invented again this is ten thousand years ago so this is before we had streets but it's different right different street name right or Street I don't know right and uh these are people who are in the business of facilitating these transactions so all of Finance all of Wall Street for the last 10 000 years have been has been designed to do one of two things either to find new ways to turn something into a transferable piece of the economic business we call that securitization creating stock to transfer or to find new ways to make a promise to take money today and to give back more money in the future so we call that leverage or borrowing that's it all of financial Innovation for ten thousand years has been to do one of those two things to find something new to securitize or to find something new to apply leverage to that's really it that's it now in nanosecond after Wall Street was invented organizations with a how do we Define this political science so an organization with the uh uh a monopoly on the legitimate use of force okay we call that a government an organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force so these governments noticed that the price of Leverage the more money you had to pay the person with money in the future it ruled the economic lives of everyone over whom they had a monopoly of the legitimate use of force right it just it just ruled their worlds and we experienced the same thing today if you know if I want to buy a house I'm using Leverage so here in the U.S if I'm putting 20 down to my house I've got I'm using four to one leverage it's a very highly leveraged transaction I'm borrowing using the technical term a shitload of money to buy that house and it's a long-term loan too typically 30 years the difference in the price of my leverage whether it's three percent a year for 30 a year for 30 years or six percent a year for 30 years it's everything it's everything it rules my world and that's what governments discovered ten thousand years ago is that the price of money by which I mean the price of borrowing it rules every aspect of our economic lives every single one and so governments whatever that organization with a monopoly and the legitimate use of force whatever that organization was ever since they have been trying to control the price of money by which I mean interest rates in their territory that was true ten thousand years ago and that's absolutely true today so when I say that there's been a global repricing of money what I mean is that governments are shaping interest rates and that is everything when it comes to an economy and because they are having to raise interest rates which is painful for everyone it's painful for everyone who wants to buy a house or buy a car or do any sort of economic activity that uses borrowing it's really painful for us so this is a once in a generation time where money is being globally repriced and it Reveals All the fault lines that exist otherwise in our world so the old Warren Buffett line right that when the tide goes out you see he's not wearing you know swimming trunks it's the same thing here it's the same thing here and we're seeing more and more people who are naked when the tide goes out uh and we're going to have more and more traumatic experiences because of this Global repricing of money which is the increase in interest rates we're seeing around the world what what is different this time Ben because um you know central banks have raised interest rates previously right um you know they've even been as high as three point you know three percent or whatever they are now three three percent three point two five percent in um the majority of people's listening in their lifetime so we've been here before why is this event different than other times the FED raises rates either up or down based on business Cycles yeah I mean I mean my parents had a their mortgage was something like 15 16 interest rates right right imagine that imagine that and here you know our world is turned upside down oh my God it's a six percent interest rate we're done we're finished the difference is that we've had 30 years 30 years where again globally central banks have intentionally and effectively pushed interest rates the price of money artificially down artificially lower than they should or would be and they were able to get away with it right and why would they do that they do that because in the same way that High interest rates are you know economic death right low interest rates are an economic Bonanza particularly for people with money right particularly going back to that you know in the beginning there was a person with a business and there was a person with money and the person with the business wanted that money from the person with money and so they made a deal that collection of deals that people with money have made go up enormously in value when interest rates are held down low that's yeah it's just the math right it's the math of how promises to repay in the future bonds it's just the math of how they work that when interest rates go down the value of those promises to repay you in the future the value goes up so what we've had is 30 years of artificially low interest rates artificially High values of investment portfolios and so a crazily High divide between how wealthy we are particularly how wealthy the rich are and how our economy has grown and that's what's different today is that that divide the Divide between the really rich and the not so rich The Divide between how we have grown our economy and how we've grown our financial assets that's what's different today and that's why this experience is so much more painful than you know economically than anything I think we've experienced in our lifetimes and why I think it exacerbates the changes intentions that have happened in politics and every other aspect of our lives so I'm not really optimistic right what's coming out of here but uh you know you gotta you gotta play the cards you're dealt right these are the cards that were dealt and um I think bankless listeners uh feel a lot of this pessimism right right now like it's not it's not as if you know you're in a bubble here Ben talking about this like we feel like this we feel this in our everyday lives you wrote this uh article that maybe puts a fine point on what you just said uh it's called Hollow Men Hollow markets Hollow world and it's about this hollowing out effect people in Western countries I think in particular maybe all around the world have felt and we could narrow into the US in particular because we're talking about the the FED interest rate this hollowing out and you have a a graph as part of that article which um it was I kind of blew my mind when I saw saw it and we'll show this to bankless listeners who are watching on YouTube but this is a graph with two lines uh one line is US GDP from the 1950s onward to 2021 and you see kind of like a nice you know increasing uh curve going up of course because GDP of the US has increased since the 1950s and this is nominal US dollar GDP and then you see this other line which is an orange line and the orange line is U.S household and non-profit net worth so this is net worth so we're looking at two lines One Is wealth the other is GDP and what's really interesting is these lines track incredibly close until about 1996. so until about 1996 they are basically right on top of one another which means GDP increased and so did wealth and that seems pretty logical your economy your nation produces more economic output and what happens the citizens get wealthy okay this makes sense but then something in 1996 happens I want you to tell us what happened but for people who aren't able to see these two lines happens is the Orange Line completely departs from the Blue Line wealth completely departs from GDP and it never goes back and in fact it departs in such a way that it is like I don't know double the increased rate and so the wealth has increased at a rate that is not commensurate with GDP increases from 1996 onward and so we have the wealthy apparently getting very wealthy well the economy is not providing productive return it's not providing GDP explain these lines to us Ben is this what you mean by the hollowing out absolutely it is and it's exactly what I meant earlier when I said that in the eternal relationship between people with businesses you know our real economy and how that grows versus people with money uh you know starting in the kind of I'll call it the early 1990s with Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve other central banks around the world made a very conscious decision that they could keep interest rates a little lower than you would think they'd have to it was a very conscious decision Alan Greenspan writes about it in his Memoir right I mean it's it's not like this is some conspiracy theory it's like yeah yeah we did it and why because we wanted people to be richer we wanted people to be richer and I you know I'm all for that all for it right the problem though is that you end up starting by sinning a little bit that's what Alan Greenspan thought he was doing he thought he was sending a little bit meaning he was keeping interest rates lower artificially so than he thought he had to uh because he thought well if I can keep it low I can make us richer and I'm not going to create inflation and he was right and he was absolutely right what happened though after Alan Greenspan you know he had Bernanke you have Yellen now I got Jay Powell is that each step in the way they've gone from sinning a little to sinning a lot so for people actually look at that chart and this has been answered people I'm comparing two growth rates you know growth in GDP to growth and wealth the important thing to look at is probably not the actual distance between the two lines but what the slope of those lines are and the the really scary part about that line is that the slope the rate of increase in wealth continues to outpace by a greater and greater degree the rate of increase in our economy so what we're let me go back and say why Greenspan was able to get away with it why sending a little worked for him it worked because we were in the middle of something that that you know the fed and other economists called the Great moderation meaning that there was productivity increases uh without inflation increase now what I think is really clear that drove the ability to keep in FL interest rates low and so to keep asset prices High propped up was really because of of well you know one really big thing right and that was globalization which is another 10 word all globalization means is that money was able to go to countries with cheap labor and they were able to build factories make stuff that was cheaper and could do it for Less labor than before right so that's what kept inflation down that's what kept inflation down for like 30 years and the other thing that helped was that governments you know there's certainly deficit spending but it wasn't crazy you know it wasn't you know just completely off the wall crazy with how much money they would give to their citizens to spend in the real economy until the pandemic hit and then both of those things broke right globalization broke globalization started breaking earlier with the U.S China trade War right globalization started breaking earlier with you know the the the first Russian you know invasion of Ukraine so you know all these things there's no kind of single moment where it breaks but the pandemic's a pretty good Breaking Point for the breaking of globalization and with the pandemic governments went absolutely completely crazy in giving people money to spend in the real economy and those two things happen inflation comes back and so now all these central banks are in a bind this is why they have to reprice money for 30 years they've been keeping interest rates artificially low and for the last 15 years they've been keeping interest rates at zero which is just which is just nuts it is just nuts so now they're in a position where they've got to get quote unquote normalize interest rates in order to try to contain inflation before he gets well and truly embedded in our society and I think they're too late I think they're too late but but that's that's what that graph was showing right and and as a result we've got a wider than ever disparity between the rich the very rich and the not rich we've got a wider than ever disparity between where interest rates are and what inflation is I mean usually in the past right to control inflation you need your interest rates to be above the rate of inflation right USA percent we're at three and a quarter so you know this this is what I mean when I say that that what's different this time is that we've had 30 plus years of excess of intentionally keeping the beach ball underneath the the pool right and now by God that beach ball is going to pop up out of the pool and there ain't nothing you can do to stop it Ben in this article you use the word Hollow uh Hollow Man Hollow markets Hollow word can you unpack that word the hollow word why is that the appropriate word to describe uh the State of the State of the world right now so I think it's it's at least I feel the hollowness in at least three different ways all right the first way I I feel it is when I look at like the charts I was making there right there is the hollowness is the difference between our wealth and our actual economy right there's there's there's a real hollowness there it's a hollowness that I think we all feel uh in our own lives I think we feel the hollowness of when jobs are offshored I think we feel the hollowness of when capital and investment doesn't come back into our own communities I think we all feel the hollowness of the it's not the difference between I'll say kind of rich and middle class right it's the difference between the very rich and everyone else it's not the one percent it's the point zero one percent right right and we all feel that and we all see that in that in the final hollowness that I think we see we could talk about politics in a in in a minute at a national scale but what I mean is our social lives right there's there's there's a hollowness that comes from the ground not being steady beneath your feet there's a hollowness that comes from The Barrage of narrative and words that are meant to change our behaviors there's a hollowness that comes from going to bed at night and looking at my iPhone is the last thing I do when I go to sleep and then looking at it again is the first thing I look at when I wake up I mean how pathetic is that but that's that's the hollowness that I'm describing it's at a very personal level it's also at this macro level yeah and I think listeners might be able to kind of get the gist for this hollowness when we see these two lines that are diverging between each other the the wealth of the United States versus the actual GDP and people I think also intrinsically understand that it is there's just like what's missing here is a bunch of real stuff as in we have the wealth but we don't have the real stuff to back it up we don't have the real economy it's it's all fake economy it's all financialization economy how did the how did this Gap come to be where we have more wealth than we have economy and I and I think as a result of that that's where this hollowness comes from when we have there's an is ought gap between we have the world that is versus what it ought to be which isn't Which is less than what it is because we've been able to prop up this uh unsustainable financialized economy how did this Gap coming come about in in the first place how did this hollowness arise where did this void come from well I'll talk about from a macro in an economic perspective first then we can talk about our own personal lives right but it's but in both cases it's a separation from what is real yeah maybe I'll talk about the personal first then we could talk about the the economic I mean what I mean by separation from what's real is that most people at least in my circle right those people I know are symbolists right meaning that their job is to work with symbols all day every day uh that could be numbers as symbols to represent some ticker or something in finance it could be letters in an alphabet representing words that they used to write but we're we're symbolists so there's there's that sort of disjuncture between what's what's what's real in our kind of macro world one of the big results of keeping interest rates really low the price of money really low making it really easy to get as much money as you want if you are already a person with money or a company with money right so let's be clear here when interest rates are really low that doesn't mean that anybody can just get a you know their their credit card interest rate goes down to to to do nothing that is not what it means it means that a public corporation can borrow money at essentially nothing it means that a government can borrow money for nothing it means that a family office with a lot of assets can access money and borrow against things essentially pay nothing so when I say that money the price of money is really low and the price of money is nothing and interest rates are zero that's not meaning that everyone gets that right um it particularly helps the people who already have are people with money so this plays out in so many different directions and one of the most pernicious ways it plays out to get to this why it doesn't translate into building real uh businesses and hiring real people and doing real things and real cash flows in the real world is that when the price of money is exceptionally low for corporations like it is today it eliminates risk taking I'll say that again it eliminates risk taking and risk taking is the oxygen for an economy if you don't have people who are willing to take risks I'm going to I'm going to build this company here I'm going to invest in this idea that I have right and I might lose right I might lose if you don't have that risk taking your economy will not grow it just won't and that's what we've had with phenomenally low interest rates why you're a company let's say uh you know pick pick any company you like right uh you know Intel right there's a good one for you IBM there's another good one for you let's see I could take a risk you're the board of directors of Intel I could take a risk I could build a new semiconductor Factory here in the United States it's a big risk you're taking a lot of you know I think we can afford it you know we can we can raise the money we can borrow some money it's a cheap raise but gosh you know demand my value I don't know if it works that's great but man it's a real risk to build that factory or I can borrow a couple of billion dollars and I can buy back some stock I can get a guaranteed return investment return by borrowing money for nothing and buying back stock or doing a dividend whatever I want to do it's a riskless return really nice return in this world of zero interest rates why take a chance why take a risk of actually building a factory like this so that is played out again and again and again in every corporation and frankly the Western world that has access to this phenomenally low Capital why would you take a chance of investing that money in a real world economic activity that might fail when you can absolutely guarantee yourself as the manager of this company or the director of this company a wonderful return to become even richer than you already are through a financialization activity increase a turn of Leverage buyback stock and the like look I'm not opposed to buying back stock I'm really not I'm not one of those wackos can say oh my God biomex rock is the worst thing no it's not it's not it's really not but what it is something different than actually investing that money into productive economic growth and that's what we as a country United States with the West have not done for 15 years the past 15 years have been the worst yeah pick any 10 years in there it's been the worst decade for productivity growth in the history of the United States boom that's the root of the problem when you say you know why why isn't our real economy grown it's because our productivity has been the worst over this period of time than at any other point of time in this country's history that's the answer to your question at a macro level of why the real hasn't kept up with The Leverage and the money and just to summarize this it's it's a culprit of low interest rates which are primarily benefiting already sufficiently capitalized people is that correct so they do not take risks with their money to and it's that risk-taking man that is what drives an economy that's what drives a real economy is taking risks so the largest most capitalized players in the world don't have to take any risks to generate returns anymore because of low interest rates absolutely right Ben what's what's crazy about this is for people who've not thought about it it's like one tiny number causes all of these Downstream effects and misalignments in incentives right that that number the kind of the interest rate number that the FED sets and I I want to everything it's everything right it's really everything and like I said this is why I started the talk with this was this was the realization ten thousand years ago that it is the price of Leverage price of borrowed money that drives every aspect of our economic lives yeah it's it's uh it's absolutely incredible and um as we get into the conversation about politics maybe the last thing to to kind of cover in this hollowed-out concept uh will lead us into a discussion about kind of the the political decision you call it the the widening Geyer I believe in one of your uh articles the political climate in the US and all of the division we we feel but when we're talking about this hollowing out and we you see these two Divergent lines of productivity and then wealth and wealth increasing far faster than productivity right yep um one of the Contra like one of the interesting pieces in your articles you say it's theft it's stolen money that this is a line through monetary and fiscal policies that have pulled forward future growth and productivity into the present they have and you're talking about the leaders of the U.S political system stolen wealth and prosperity from our children and our children's children absolutely but they've also created a political Dynamic that has hollowed out the Constitution's attendant political Norms um as a people you say you can't be richer than your economy grows without stealing that wealth from someone else and you say that that stolen wealth comes from you know one of the few places it's either you steal it from other countries it's not quite the case the us maybe maybe a little bit but you still from the future uh or you steal it from maybe you know different classes I suppose and you know take it from middle class or low class and and bring it into kind of you know upper class but stealing from the future is the one that strikes me most being from kind of like the millennial generation and I know gen Z feels this uh as well is there is an anger a feeling that like like absolutely we've been stolen from like our future so so tell us about this is has this future really been you know stolen from us has wealth actually been stolen from from future Generations here yeah yeah to the degree that you borrow for consumption you are stealing from the future yeah major stealing from your own future which is probably right we're all well we're all humans we can make these economic decisions right for ourselves which is that you know what I'm I haven't gone on a trip with my wife and three maybe four years right as our 50th birthday and you know it's our 20-somethings anniversary and we're gonna go on a really nice trip in a couple of weeks can't wait now bucket list kind of thing gonna you know borrow is gonna be expensive and I hell yeah I mean this is my life and we would have spend it on this fantastic right uh there's other kind of borrowing that I can do I you know I borrowed to um you know for my children's education right I borrow to you know on my home you know I've got a mortgage to you know invest in my company that's from the future right so long as the investment pays off and and like some of the decimals work some adult y'all we can do is the best you can do and but but those were Investments right investments in my children investments in my company that's not stealing from the future either what is absolutely stealing from the future foreign pulling forward economic activity is the encouragement to do so by keeping interest rates artificially low by having a whole Suite of government policies that encourage just that right borrowing pulling from the future for consumption beyond what you know your means are your future means are and that is absolutely taking from our children and our children's children it is absolutely what they said that is borrowing for consumption is is is is exactly what I mean borrowing for let's call it Mal investment bar for example borrowing to buy back stock borrowing for a dividend right that's it's all connected to this notion of not taking risks in the real economy you take a risk by investing to the degree you don't invest to the degree that you're making riskless choices of financialization through Leverage through again easy money that is absolutely taking from the future because at some point and this is what I'm experiencing right now at some point it catches up with you at our degrees of freedom today because we haven't we have no savings we have enormous debt our degrees of freedom to invest for the future now that the price of money is increased it's going to be really hard it's going to be really hard it's going to be really hard unless our standard of living goes down unless we're prepared to consume a lot less and that's what breaks politics I don't know any electorate that's we'll say oh yes please tax me more oh yes no I you're you're right you're right I need to pay more for that gasoline and no you're right you know I took too many vacations I'm done you're right I need to I need to I need to work a little bit more and you know enjoy life a little bit yeah yeah I'm sign me up for that all right but that's where we are

is currently impacting Society but in order to get there I kind of just want to tie off this last article Hollow Man Hollow markets Hollow world because you you on these two charts on these two graphs that they're both going up and to the right but wealth is going up into the right a lot faster you've also overlaid all of the Federal Reserve chair members uh and and you talked about the the First Federal Reserve chair member who had this realization like hey I could actually keep interest rates lower than what Alan Greenspan and then that like that Vibe rolled forward into the next chair member who I think thought the same Ben Bernanke who thought the same thing but was perhaps like oh I could do it a little bit more and then this kind of set the status quo to where we are today with Powell uh and and I want to read just a single line from this power from this article because I think this is a great um is a great just punchline for this whole thing uh you say that I all after you know thinking of making a lot of statements about Jay Powell you say I also think that Jay Powell Banker would sooner betray his convictions then risk a tarnished refutation with his Wall Street Tong as the man who ended the decades-long party so it's partly a question of like how did how did we get here oh well one Federal chair member made easier money than the last Federal chair member which made easier money than the last Federal chairman member and then now we're at Jay Powell yep at the very end of the story and it's and it seems though from what you're talking about what many other people are talking about we actually can't kick the can further down the road right it's like why can't we just have easier money why can't we just do it again why is it now like Landing in the realm of politics uh so why Can't We Kick the Can down the road why does this seem to end with Jay Powell and why do you think that no that's a great question and the answer is because now we have inflation right it's it's possible to keep having ever easier policy so long as inflation is under you know Under Wraps but when globalization broke when we pumped trillions of dollars into the economy through PPP you know through you know the other tax credits through in 2017 the tax cut and job you know I could like to call the tax cuts and law jobs Act Right the the tax breaks for people all of these things put enormous amounts of money into the economy that was used for consumption right that was used to drive that that that triggered inflation and that's where we are so that's why we can't keep doing it so what's JP how are we going to do well you're right that he you know my strong belief is at a certain point in someone's life in someone's career when there's no job Above This that you're aspiring to your overwhelming concern becomes one of how is history going to remember me what is my reputation what is my legacy and what I will tell you is Jay Powell is not going to be remembered as the man who unleashed the inflation Genie out of the bottle to wreck the world that's not how he's going to go down in the history books if he can help it because he was a big part of it he was the one who said he made the gruesome error saying no inflation is transitory which was just like Ben Bernanke saying no the subprime crisis is contained right those are the two phrases they'll just go down it's just like oh my God you blew it you blew it you had your chance and you blew it so I will blew it by not addressing the inflation problem earlier and so now it'll be damned if he's going to go down in history as the guy who let this Genie out of the bottle so instead you can see this in the articles that he's kind of dictating to be published about him in the Wall Street Journal he's channeling Paul volcker Who was the Fed chair before Alan Greenspan and was the man who was credited with breaking inflation in the 1970s so so volcker is again there's a lot of truth to it there's some not truth to it but truth of the capital it doesn't matter volker's image the way that history remembers him is as the guy who is Tough Enough and crazy enough to raise interest rates far enough to break inflation when other fed chairmen couldn't do it so that's how Powell wants to be remembered that's what he wants his legacy to be and so I think that's what he's going to do that's what he's going to do and it took a while for the market to kind of recognize that but over the last few months that's what we recognize and uh yeah it's an interesting question though Ben is as to whether like the politics are going to let him I I think this is maybe the segue to that the next question we wanted to have with you so we've got this hollowing out that I think a lot of us feel and you've described very very aptly from an economic perspective also from a personal perspective and that has led to uh some societal consequences that we also feel in addition to this feeling of of hollowed outness we also feel more divided than ever like things feel unharmonic unharmonious feel like everyone is always angry at one another and maybe I just spend too much time on Twitter but um this is honestly the way it feels uh you wrote this article called the the widening Geyer it's what you're calling it The widening Geyer which is interesting I think that's from a yeet's poem and I'm going to read a quote out the widening Gaia is eating America alive and it's not just our country it's our families and friendships too ourselves even as the widening guy or rips our internal identities to shreds rips are uh internal identities to shreds what what is this widening Geyer like what's happening in the US right now well I think we all feel it right I mean um I think we've all got family members we've all got friends who are essentially lost to us now who have gone across the Event Horizon right to use a an astrophysics analogy they've gone past a point of no return to either the trumpism Maga side or gone over the Event Horizon into the you know liberal Lefty side right I mean right there's a black hole in the middle of both of those ends and I I think we've all experienced right I mean it had we it's so hard just to have conversations their own family members anymore friends are you know the people we hang out with the people at work I mean gosh I'm we're all very wary of what we say because it's unclear whether the person we're talking to has it has been infected by my word my phrase you know weaponized narratives I think this is entirely intentional I think the result is again not an aberration but ten dollar word equilibrium where political entrepreneurs uh our political parties our media system our technology players I like to call you know big politics big Tech and big media this is all to their advantage right to create a state of crisis uh in our relationships with other humans to snip the connections that we have with our family with our friends with our workplace to atomize us and I and I do think it it ends up creating a conflict inside of us as well right I mean I I I feel it I feel it sometimes I mean it's it's very attractive right the siren Call of this Call to Arms from the left or this call of arms to the right and because it's about something that you really care about it's about your kids it's about your country it's about uh you know your work is about your the people you love who you love and it's when I say it's a weaponized narrative I really mean that in exactly the same way that a virus can be weaponized I it's it's an intentional effort to choose words and grammars that hit our brains to elicit specific response patterns um again that's not tin foil head stuff I mean that's really how the this is designed to work and um what you end up with then again equilibrium a balancing point where there is no middle the center cannot hold which is the the main point of yates's point that the Falcon cannot hear the falconer Falcon is us the falconer is God if you're religious it's um truth and wisdom if you're not religious like I'm not but I but I but the we don't we can't hear the wisdom of the past we can't hear our better natures and the center does not hold this feels like uh something that we've talked about which bankless listeners I don't know if you're familiar with but um meditations on moloch was a slate uh star codex article from a long time ago and talks about this um God of coordination failure it's kind of like you've just been screwing with Humanity for I mean our entire existence and this this feels very much like he is raising uh his ugly head we've got a time when 72 percent of registered Democrats and 70 percent of registered Republicans both of them believe that the other party poses a clear and present danger to the survival of American democracy we're talking about existential threats and what we've seen Ben is politics really change from kind of this coordination game of we're all on the same team this is how a democracy works the free open Fair elections and then one group wins compromises the other group and we kind of get our best guess at the will of the people to from a coordinated game to a game of competition where stuck in like this moloch trap this prisoner's dilemma can you talk about that a bit more sure well you know coordination game it doesn't mean that we always agree on stuff right so so a coordination game has I I'm sorry and I don't mean to get too into the Weeds on this stuff but it's I think I inscribe in a way so that it it makes some sense right so a coordination game actually has two equilibrium two balancing points that work right one is where oh everybody works together in the famous example this the name of the game is called the Stag hunt uh you know Rousseau first wrote about this as a game theory idea and we called it the stack hunt because we can all cooperate to bring down a big big animal and we'll all eat really well that's our best outcome and once you do that once it persists it's an equilibrium because neither side has got a an incentive to defect do something different man we can all go out we can all eat like kings this is a great stick with it now if something happens by accident whatever happens in in one day someone does defect and they go out uh I was gonna hunt for this join the ground the crowd and hunt the big the big deer the Stag now but I a rabbit just crossing my paths I just grabbed it right I didn't go hunt for the the Stag but I bet I got a rabbits I eat fine and that that happens once and so the rest of us we don't get the big stag but we say you know I come home with the rabbit and say what were you doing I said I got a rabbit oh I gotta say so the next day we all hunt for rabbits and that's also a balancing Point again it's it's not as good as it's all eating like kings from taking out the big snack but it's a it's an equilibrium point we're all hunting rabbits we're kind of on our own but we can there are ways to get from one equilibrium to the other the game the coordination game a game that is set up by the rules of the game like the Constitution of the United States right it doesn't mean that the two parties are always doing bipartisan stuff and you know you know winning World War II or doing whatever kind of big game stag hunt they're going to do a lot of times they do their own thing and they're in competition but a true Cooperative outcome is possible in a coordination game and what is Magic about the way the United States was set up and the way the Constitution set up the gives and takes of American politics is that it truly sets up a coordination game where at least it's possible to work together to achieve really big things you change one kind of like little outcome in the The Game Matrix and I you know I talk about this in the note you can show it and it transforms into a competition game a prisoner's dilemma being the most famous of those right where cooperation is active is actually impossible there's only one balancing point in a prison Mr Lima game and that is the every man for his freaking self that's the only balancing point and that's that's what's so important I think about what's happened to our electorate and our constitution because it's just a piece of paper right but it is true in markets as well we've lost the potential to even have a Cooperative outcome and work together to accomplish something big and now we're locked in a game that only has one equilibrium of every man for his freaking self and that becomes the rational Behavior so everyone's thinking you know I got mine Jack right and it's so hard to find a community where you can I call it a pack what's find your pack people where you're not just out for yourself but you're actually working together to achieve something better that's what we have to do we have to find our way back to a coordination game where at least it's possible for us to work together for some great end our uh political coordination game breaking down which means kind of the fabric of our nation state our societal structure breaking down as well it's a scary Prospect and we have this Hydra before us which is Big politics big media and big Tech um at the end of your article I was really interested because of course like the crypto world has its kind of not solution but it's it's a way to help the same problems that you see right big Tech big big politics and uh big media of course we have like crypto answers to these problems um one of your answers to these problems is actually goes back to the the Constitutional protocol itself which was very interesting and I actually learned just learned about this um there is an amendment in our Constitution that hasn't been fully passed was not never ratified by the states and it's only one of 12 amendments passed by Congress that was never ratified called the Constitutional apportionment amendment I believe Ben this is interesting because we've had Andrew fascinating we've had Andrew Yang on the podcast before and politically he talks about like you know ranked Choice voting um and uh open primaries being very important like protocol changes and we're like oh this sounds very reasonable yes like the solution to part of America's problems is you have to adjust the base protocol this is another way to adjust the base protocol can you describe what the Constitutional uh apportionment Amendment actually is and how it can help yeah I I I'd be happy to by the way I've had conversations with Andrew too I mean he dm'd me the other day and we started talking and you know he's a big believer in the same things that I am right I you know a third party is a tough way to go honestly because of the structural issues they exist with first past the post you know our voting system is really Geared for that and I and I'll say my my main concern with the third party and I know that Andrew um shares his concern is that I think all of this will be so much wasted if it just becomes you know a play thing for some Billionaire's ego right I mean the last thing the world needs right is a political party so you know Mark Cuban can run for president I mean who gives a  right I mean but um but what I like about Andrew's I think his real effort is to try to make some changes in the rules so the Constitutional apportionment amendment is I think a really interesting approach to this so I really and it's over yeah I may just just Google it constitutional apportionment Amendment it was passed it was passed by Congress in the 1700s it was like along with the Bill of Rights this was passed way back then right and there are a range of reasons it was not ratified by the requisite number of states but see here's the thing once an amendment a constitutional amendment is approved by Congress it's out there it doesn't go away there's no you know statute of limitations on it so we've got I think it's like I think 11 states have ratified it and so it needs something like you know 20 something more but here's the thing about ratifying an amendment it's done by the state legislature it's done by the state legislature and what the Constitutional apportionment Amendment would do would be to massively increase the number of people who are elected to the National House of Representatives which is what the founders intended right now we've capped it at a certain number so that as our population grows each member of the House represents some larger and larger number of people I think it's like 550 000 people that are rep that every representative represents which means that they don't get represented right which means that the only way you can be elected to congress it's like a massive election so you've got to be part of the Republican machine or you've got to be part of the democratic machine that's the only way you're gonna you can run an election at such a large scale so what the apportionment Amendment would basically mean that every 50 000 people would would elect somebody to Congress and fifty thousand still a big number man that's doable right that's that's some local person who says yeah well I got an idea what you'll get if the Constitutional apportionment Amendment were to pass would be a lot more people going to congress with a lot weaker party affiliations the forward party somebody could run under the forward party Andrew Yang's party and win in some districts right you could get green candidates win you could get you know you get wacko far rights win right absolutely you would and I am so okay with that I want so much broader representation because what will end is that you know when 6 000 people go to Washington you know Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy they'll have no clue about you know they can't organize that and that that's wonderful right because what it leads to I think is the formation of lots of political parties true multi-party representation and proportional representation and that's how we break the Stranglehold of the two-party system I think from the bottom up through an amendment that's already been passed through Congress it could never get passed by Congress today because you're you're basically asking Congress people to let in you know thousands more people into their in their little Club so we've never passed today but it only has to be passed by state legislatures and as though state legislators the individuals there they're the ones who are most likely to go to Congress right so it's a it's a promotion for them so I think it serves their self-interest and I sure as hell I think it serves the people's self-interest to try to break this Stranglehold that the two parties have over these massive elections that we have me and Ryan we certainly like uh changes to our systems that seem to go right down to the root level uh because especially when we are in these times where it feels like all of the world or all of society's turning a page it really takes the conscious thought to go down to that Rue level like all right let's what is the base level protocol that we need to Tinker with exactly I'm wondering Ben as we talk about this widening Geyer we have the the far left getting further from the far right getting further from the center and the center gets smaller and smaller how does this connect to the earlier conversation where we had the discrepancy between the GDP and the wealth are these adjacent conversations are these highly synonymous are they just happening because we're talking about the United States of America and that's the common denominator well what are the big common denominators here or are there many well it it's connected by that hollowing out right so so on the political side the hollowing out is that the center dissipates and so it's on the it's on the far ends and farther and farther ends where people fall off into that event horizon of you know becoming part of that tribe where they think that the other tribe is not just wrong but evil when they think that the other side whoever the other side is that they are the threat to American democracy that's the hollowing out that happens in politics there's there's nothing the the Constitution just becomes a piece of paper and there's no belief or faith in the American people by a majority on either side of the spectrum that's the hollowing out in politics following out in markets is very similar right our real economy becomes more and more just a shadow of the market economy and that results in the disparity between the very very rich in everyone else being as hollowed out as our politics and where does the hollowing out really happens it happens in the middle class the middle class economically is what the center is politically it's just there's no there there anymore or it's going away more and more every day and that's what we've got to stop now do you stop it I think you stop it in the same way you stop it from the bottom up you start it from real risk taking in the economy you started from real risk taking in politics which is means you know running not as a Democrat or as a republican but for a small District of the people around you you represent Ben it's the same way both for both the the answer I really believe is from the bottom up not from the top down so let's talk about this the the bottom up as you say yeah and there's there's another sort of third party right it's not Andrew Yang's Ford party but this is kind of the the crypto party if you will I'm the Bitcoin uh party and then kind of The Wider uh crypto ecosystem I want to get your thoughts on on this lastly as we close because I think your diagnosis of the problem is exactly right that you know the Hydra and the question of how do we slay that the Hydra big media big politics and big attack and your answer to that question is like well if you just you know cut off a hydra's head maybe you take Facebook and carve it up into like 20 different companies another Hot Head will pop up in its place that is the nature of a Hydra and so what we have to do is get down to these fundamental protocol level changes right um one protocol level change is potentially bottom-up adoption of cryptocurrency and and using crypto as kind of a banking layer now I know you have some aspects of that that you like and you're kind of cheering on from a narrative and mean perspective but um fundamentally you have some concerns with it and I want us you to take us back to like I think it was April 2021 I was reading uh it sounds like you got on a zoom call with Paul Krugman a bunch of academics like from the fed and the topic at that time of course we're in an entirely different crypto Market we're in a bear season band I don't know if you've noticed but crypto prices yeah all right but at the time take us back to April 2021 you're hosting the zoom call bitcoin price was at 50k and I think the conversation was what's happening with this Bitcoin thing is there anything there there what was that discussion I mean it was by the way and I I want to make sure I say this I find Paul Krugman personally to be just as nice and as gracious and as thoughtful as they come right so I I mean I he gets a lot of he gets a little harder I I think he's I think he's I think he's he's genuinely a thoughtful nice person and I really want to make that get that get that out there but he was kind of in the in the placed in the position of you know what's the use case right and and the best that you know this is the way these things get set up it was set up to be like oh we're gonna there were gonna be two people who kind of going to argue in favor of Bitcoin and then for some reason they had me on the the group that was anti-bitcoin and I'm really not but um well it's really effective way of you know people in failed states to you know get their money out right which is true right I I get it I love that's that's fine right but that but that use case is not why all these people from Academia and finance were getting on a call at a zoom call at six or seven at night or whenever we were doing it they weren't getting on there to discuss the use case of you know helping people in Venezuela get their money out of the system they were on a call because Bitcoin was trading at fifty thousand dollars a Bitcoin right that's why yeah and the consistency well it has no use case and so you know it's it's it's it's a it's a it's nothing there's nothing there to it and even the people arguing for Bitcoin were saying well I guess maybe the but the blockchain will have something and you know someone's like oh okay so you're kidding me are you kidding me and so I I switched right I was on the team kind of supposed to be arguing against Bitcoin when I came in and said no this is ridiculous Bitcoin is elegant Bitcoin is so smart Bitcoin is art right Bitcoin is inspirational like all good Art Is Right big Bitcoin I love those aspects of Bitcoin I you know that's that that community that that entrepreneurial energy that Spirit of autonomy of risk taking of a long time Horizon we are not stealing from the future but you're actually being a steward of the present to build for the future I think those are all absolutely part and parcel inextricable from OG Bitcoin right right and I say OG Bitcoin because what what I have against Bitcoin is not the OG Bitcoin but it's like what I call Bitcoin TM or you know Bitcoin actually with jazz hands right which is the securitization they were the only two things that Wall Street does for thousands of years you found a new way to securitize something you find a new way to apply leverage to something and with Bitcoin TM they've done both right so it's securitized is rehabothecated we can talk about what all those words mean but what it really means is that it is absorbed by Wall Street into another casino game to another table at the casino and it and and I get it you know it's number go up and that's why you had all these people on the call at seven o'clock because it was fifty thousand dollars right they didn't want to talk about defy or you know leading a more autonomous decentralized life and having a different layer rather than a layer that that's that's smothering you from the state that wasn't the point of the call the call was I was 50k how did yeah that sounds interesting and [Laughter] anyway I get I get I get agitated about this because it does agitate me because this is what Wall Street and frankly Washington through the treasury does so well right they co-opt they don't yeah prevent they don't forbid they don't Outlaw they co-opt and I see it every day that this is what's happened to Bitcoin in the same way that gold was co-opted into GLD and the ETFs and and the like you know 15 years ago and it makes me really sad so I I am such a supporter of all those aspects that I said were part and parcel of this community of this pack right and it is not the grumpy grandpa in me I swear to God it is the revolutionary in me that is disappointed when it becomes Bitcoin with jazz hands and we talk about oh is it you know is it above or below the 200-day trend line and and I mean God what a what a waste you know sorry Ben I want to articulate your point because I think it's a really unique and um prescient uh perspective like it's it's really like you're you're hitting the nail on the head in a way that I think many in the crypto industry don't like take time to actually understand but your take is like you don't agree with the krugmans and and you know the FED economists and such that Bitcoin is worthless right you actually believe there's value there and you think that value is that it's uh it's art it's cultural expression it's almost like an nft as it were and you said this yes the Bitcoin project in and of itself is an nft right you said you said this owning Bitcoin has been an authentic expression of identity and extremely positive identity of autonomy entrepreneurialism and resistance it's almost like a um bumper sticker that you put in the back of your car team Bitcoin what do I believe sound money principles I believe the FED should get out of our you know money printing a business and you think that that is uh incredible and accounts for for much of the value value of Bitcoin now on the other side of things if I'm taking your meaning you do not go to the side of let's call it Bitcoin maximalists where like Bitcoin is going to take over the money system it's going to be the reserve currency of the world and part of the reason you are skeptical of that claim is you're seeing it play out in Bitcoin TM Bitcoin with the trademark which is you see a world this may be a more practical world than the Bitcoin Maximus um are envisioning of Wall Street is going to co-op this thing they're going to securitize it they're going to make it an ETF Bitcoin ETF just the way they did with other Commodities like gold and so you got there and they'll sell their product you got that competing interest and then you have um the treasury which is all about financial secure surveillance I think there's a picture of the eye of Sauron the eye of Sauron that's my word yeah the eye of Sauron what are they what's the eye of Sauron trying to do it wants to log everything so this idea of on-chain privacy your own private Keys all right not unless we can AML k I see you we have to know your identity and so These two factions are going to basically uh trim the the claws off The Lion and make it a house cat and so we get Bitcoin TM and we don't have the full vision and it becomes just a bumper sticker rather than a true Revolution that's going to shake the system is that your Viewpoint Amen brother you put it you've said it just perfectly it's really fascinating I so here's the thing so um what I want bankless listeners to to think about here and this is kind of challenging in reading some of your work for us and I'll just like give some Reflections is I definitely see we're talking about with Bitcoin TM right it all ends up in coinbases and exchanges and in centralized lending platforms the block fives of the world as a regulated thing we don't get it out elsewhere we are now fighting this but battle though Ben on the D5 front okay yep and the bank list front and My worry is that it becomes bankless TM or it becomes defy TM as well one of the things I don't know if you've been following following it but um there's this privacy mixing technology it's a smart contract on ethereum it's called Tornado cash have you been following this at all I have okay sure have so um it seems that the treasury via ofac does not want this to exist and in fact they are they do not oh fact sanctioning some code right now which is like are you sure you could do that because you could sanction like individuals and corporations and entities but can you can you sanction code and yet they are okay and so like this is where we get into this place of um crypto Advocates and I think many lawyers in the space will say this is a fundamental breach of American freedoms like we should have the ability to have our private keys and be able to use privacy sorts of applications we have this ability with with encrypted communication on the internet SSL and https is not illegal and are do does ofac really have the ability to sanction code and so like I very much worry about this and we collectively worry about this bend that if we don't win some battles in our court system now which is where this this is all going that we will become D5 TM and bankless TM do you have any comments for us or thoughts on all of this this is playing out in real time yeah I I do I um first obviously you're on the side of the terrorist you know obviously that was a joke right uh but that that is the the battle that takes place in narrative space right and and it's a it's and it's a hard battle to win given the uh not control but the influence over big Tech big media uh and big politics that treasury has right so so it's from a narrative space this is a very tough fight to to undertake right I think it's a very tough space a very tough fight to undertake in legal space right because the the nature the the the argument that code is speech you know there are lots of ways in which you know speech is regulated first and foremost commercial speech right commercial speech doesn't get the same sort of privilege that political speech does in the United States and so you know putting the code Under The Heading of this is commercial speech it was to you know to deal with money and there's a compelling National interest you know all this kind of stuff I think it makes it a very tough fight in legal space where I'm going is that once you start challenging organizations with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force which are governments once you start challenging them on the ability to set the price of money which they know that that is the reason really that governments exist right is to to control the price of money and when you start challenging that when you start fighting them on the battlefield of money it's it is fighting them on their Turf in a way that you know is the greatest wall home field advantages for them doesn't mean you don't do the fight but I think you have to prepare yourself that is a fight you are likely to lose and so what does that mean right what it means I think my view and this is my Approach that everyone people can have very different approaches to this and that's okay I don't want to fight in the realm of money what I want to do is I want to fight on the realm of a protocol that people don't associate with money and that's what I think is possible right I I think it it we have to get at these protocol layers is there a time what are the the the the the rules here and I want to apply the the the the energy of defy it can be in finance but it's got to somehow be away from money itself and maybe that's small right and maybe it's it doesn't have the same sort of number go up properties as you know working directly and oh here's my coin right you know but but but but I think that's what we've got to figure out and I think there's some really smart people out there with some various projects that are out of the direct money Arena do you like nfts would this be an example of this or it's like absolutely it is right absolutely very non-threatening for Gary Gensler for Janet Yellen like I you know uh cute little owls and you know cute cute apes and you know Jimmy Fallon talk shows that sort of thing that that is the farthest thing away from yeah money launder it well I Financial surveillance or I guess you know terrorism that you can think of in the US right and yet and yet I still believe that the most subversive thing in the world is Art and content so yeah I'm a big fan of of entities and using them in very subversive ways right I also think there are ways to use a defy philosophy around philanthropy around our time around the real world connections we make with other people I think that if the central prop if the basic problem we're trying to solve is one of distributed Trust then let's take that out of the realm of money per se because this problem of distributed trust is that the problem of the hollowing out of our lives in every field in every direction so I don't have the answers right but I but I but I do resist the idea that the only way to fight this is or that the only way that you're going to declare Victory is from some top-down acceptance of Bitcoin or whatever protocol we're talking about as the new monetary system I think that's I I I'd rather not storm the Machine Gun Nest right I would I would I would I would rather fight in another Arena where I think it's we can win without killing ourselves Ben I think you're advocating uh fight fighting smart as well and I think I'd like to think so but this is good advice I I know you're on the same page from a narrative perspective from an end goal perspective as many in the crypto industry and I think you close your article with this I don't think I can help much in the policy battle but I think I can help a lot in the narrative battle and we certainly appreciate all your help on the on the narrative battle and all of the wisdom that you've conveyed in this podcast is there anything given all we said uh you can leave us with is is there any hope because part of this podcast has been pessimistic I think and there were glimmers of Hope where we talked about you know finding a a pack in protocol changes that we can you know strive for in new use cases maybe in in crypto and nfts that are outside of the um the purview of of the nation state outside of the sauron's eye um is there any hope for us what would you leave us with there I'm going to come back to exactly that of finding your pack that you find a group of people who do not treat you as a means to an end that treats you as an autonomous human being in your own right and who demand that you treat them the same way uh I hope you can find that in your family I hope that you can find that in you know a wider Community but wherever you can find it you got to find it because that's how we get through this we do get through this as a pack and you know that's what writing Epson theory has done for me has connected me with tens of thousands of people all over the world all over the world has given me the knowledge that I am not alone so that's the message of Hope Is You are not alone right if you're listening to this there is a community here and it will get us through whatever comes down the pike I promise you that so yeah that's the way to end this well said Ben we'll leave it there thank you so much uh guys Epsilon theory is a tremendous pack to be a part of it's one of my favorite writings on the internet Ben Hunt of course leads that and there's a whole Community around this we'll include some links in the show notes to
