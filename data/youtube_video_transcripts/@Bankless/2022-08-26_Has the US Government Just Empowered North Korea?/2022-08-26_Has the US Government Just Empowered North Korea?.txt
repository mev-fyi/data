i think one of the big challenges of this decision about tornado cache is it raises this question of at what point is ofac going to decide that a neutral tool is being used too much by the bad guys that nobody gets to use it anymore we need to sort of understand where the line is i mean like i said tornado cash was about 30 to 40 according to the numbers we have used by north korea that's still a minority what if it was 25 what it was what if it was 20 right at what point does north korea get to decide hey if we use something too much then nobody in the united states is going to get to use it anymore i don't think we want to empower one of our largest foreign adversaries with the ability to shut down any technology in the us just by deciding to use it a lot right what if they decide that they want to use aztec a whole lot does that mean that even though you know no legitimate uses of azdek have changed right there's still people who are using it for all of the good reasons why we want privacy does the fact that north korea is using it mean that it has to get banned i think that's not a you know a world that we can live in
