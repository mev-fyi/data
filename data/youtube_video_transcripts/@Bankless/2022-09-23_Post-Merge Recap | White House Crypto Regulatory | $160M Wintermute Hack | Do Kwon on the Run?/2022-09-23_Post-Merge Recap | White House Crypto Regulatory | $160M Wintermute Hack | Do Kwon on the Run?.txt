is this cope Ryan are we coping right now we might be coping do you feel like we're coping I think when people are coping they don't know they're coping and I was about to say no I'm not this is not cope maybe that's what people who are coping say hey Bangla station happy fourth Friday of September David what time is it Ryan it's a bank with Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor yet we persevere into the frontier nonetheless every Friday with our morning coffee of course yeah grab a cup of coffee as you uh hear how David and I struggle through a roll-up post merge post merge David what is there to talk about now that the merge is done content any content bear Market because this is going to be a 20 minute episode here yeah the Roll-Ups are just getting actually yeah even though there's nothing happening I bet you we could find a way to make a 90 minute roll up yeah but you know what there actually is a lot happening because there's always a lot happening in crypto even though we're in a post merge world uh number one we're going to talk about the White House they have some words to say to the crypto industry this Biden report just came out and I think people need to know is it alarm time should we be freaking out right now what else we got and we have to reset the hack counter there's a 160 million dollar hack and it's never before seen way of getting hacked uh are you at risk uh no you're not uh but it's an interesting story nonetheless so we'll get into that and of course we covered it last week dokwon is he on the Run where is he Ryan do you know where do Quan is because people are looking for him I don't know he says he's not on the run but I think Interpol has a different uh take on that it sounds like somebody who's on the Run what they would say yeah it does before we get in though David got to talk about our friends and sponsors at Swell who wants you to know that there is going to be a new staking opportunity in town it's called swell Dave and I like these guys so much we're also Angel Investors and they are now in a guarded launch territory so they've started the launch process it's in a guarded launch while they take care of a few more things but what is swell David why is this a new entrant onto the liquid staking scene and what are these guys specializing in yes well it's really going after the Best of Both Worlds between Lido and rocketpool rocketpool of course the only decentralized permissionless of validating staking as a service pool on ethereum Lido a permission validator set and swell as doing a little of both so you can stake your ether with swell permissionlessly if you put up a 16 eth Bond or you can also be uh in the Dow and get voted in as a uh as a trusted staking provider and so you get a little bit of light up a little bit of Rocket pool and if you were lydo came around in in 2020 and so if you were too late for both of those things you could still get in at the ground floor of swell so there is a link in the show notes to go and join the Discord and join that community this is promising to be a community owned protocol so go check out the Discord and help them build this thing out David let's get to markets all right Bitcoin what are we looking at on the Bitcoin price this week can we just get playing this week let's skip the whole no tell us give us the hard truth okay we can hear it we're ready for this Bitcoin not down so bad um it started the week at 19 800 so start of the week below 20 000 ending the week at nineteen thousand dollars a few dollars below nineteen thousand dollars so we are in the 18 000 range down four percent on the week uh not looking so great not looking this is uh not not so great but not so bad typical bear Market week we're at the lows the Bitcoin like flashed down to 17 and a half during the liquidation and then it popped right back up to 18 000 something we're at the market lows like we're not we're not that far off the bottom there was a liquidation event this week maybe some are saying this is maybe fed caused fed induced we'll talk about that but how about ether we are in a post-merge eth world was Hal press right David was the merch priced in uh so ether down 14 on the week start of the week at 1500 ending the week just below 1300 uh I guess the merge was priced in I guess it was fully prep the merge execution was priced in yeah you ready to say that I I guess so yeah what's there's no there's no way for me to like twist this I got nothing here do you know your debate with uh Jordy Alexander on whether like the merchants price dinner or not I still like again I'm you know I'm taking the role of the unbiased moderator David so I can't be in your corner I can't be in jordy's corner I have to be unbiased I will say as an unbiased moderator you're not wrong yet okay maybe Hal press was wrong some of the like the Traders were wrong you were not wrong yet because what I heard you say in that conversation with Jordy was it may not price itself in in the short term you were talking about like post merge you know could take a few weeks a few months but your main argument was in the mid to long run the merge isn't priced in because we have a massively decreasing issuance rate less Supply on the market all we have to do is refill that demand bucket and then prices shoot back up maybe some Solace there I don't think you're wrong yet I don't think anyone can say that it's a it is pretty much a pretty big bummer to see ether go down 14 immediately post merge I mean definitely one part macro which we're about to talk about also the other thing the the new meta is like all right post merge what the hell is next like when you look over the horizon what do you see about that like there's not there's not much there so we're gonna talk about that to you do you know what this has cemented for me though David that we are in a bear Market yeah there's all right we are in a bear Market here it's going to be a sustained bear market right so I think there was some hope that this catalyzing event of the eth merge might uh change things spark something wasn't enough nope and this confirms when good news happens during a a market cycle and the price goes down it's generally you know you're in a bear so bear Market confirmed I think we could be here for months uh I think we'll have to wait until macro takes over and we'll get into some of that story but also there are no big crypto catalysts ahead this is nothing I can really think of beyond the merge yeah so we got that it's gonna be fun times this is a bearish weekly roll up wow it's only like three of those I'm not I'm not really bearish honestly I just think this is the sustaining the bear Market but I'll tell you what did not drop eth price and that was Gensler comments this week I saw this headline had to bring it up I thought that was an onion article this no this is Yahoo finance this is mainstream Finance reporting and with that with the headline ethereum price drops 20 as SEC declares control over the network wow and we've got a picture of Gary Gensler with his fist in the air dictator King style uh controlling the network I guess as depicted controlling the network so if your friends ask you if Gensler is controlling the network right now and if that's the reason price dropped bankless is here to say no that's not the reason price dropped and no the sctc didn't declare control over the network Gensler was just saying things that Gensler says often and we'll we'll cover that later but yeah you can't mainst like mainstream reporting of this you can't uh associate the you know the correlation is not causation here so uh anyway moving on let's let's take a look at what actually happened with East Supply because that is a pretty cool story we're actually not in the ultrasound territory though so maybe that's a bummer but uh tell us what we're looking at here David yeah so we're going to just do a review of The Ether Supply Dynamics post merge uh and you can see that little chart in the center of your screen it is going up and to the right so ether is inflating it's inflating at 0.19 a year which is pretty damn low uh and I see some some bitcoiners and some ethereum bears looking at this chart and be like oh look ether's not ultrasound is not deflationary all the eth people were wrong um but when you see this chart and you go up and to the right Ryan could you go ahead and hit that simulate pal button on the on the right side so we can see what it otherwise would have now look at that so that white dash line line is what ethereum was previously pre-merge and then the blue line at the very bottom is what it currently is and those are very distinct very different slopes and then Bitcoin is about splitting the difference right in the middle there uh the also the other important thing is that since the merge there has been 4.7 000 ether issued where there was previously once 13 000 ether issued a day since merge there has been a net total issuance of 4.7 000 ether issued if we were still in proof of work we would have otherwise issued about 93 and a half thousand ether so that is a net issue introduction of 88 000 ether that has not been issued since the merge has gone in a total sum about 14 million dollars uh forty million dollars not insignificant and how long is it has it been since the merge about seven days right yeah it's been seven days and this is the thing David just just one week into this and ether is not ultrasound post merge on a one week basis but of course it can always catch up right two weeks from now three weeks from now maybe months later and um the the next Bull Run for example takes uh issuance down and deep into the negative territory and makes up for this but for people who couldn't see the lines that you're pointing to you eth was issuing or would have been issuing over the past seven days three point seven eight percent and to your point it was actually only 0.19 and that was get that was as a result of the merge so the difference being we uh issued 4 700 eth with proof of work we would have been issuing 93.5 big difference there big big difference in the numbers it's also worth noting that when gas is like basically on its floor right now right at seven way if we had like a 50 Gray 24-hour period that makes up for like three days of net inflation right and so the amount of burn can is uncapped and so you can burn like seven days worth of inflation inside of a very small amount of time and so as soon as you get out of like the depressed bear Market era of gas fees like you can make up a lot of lost ground in a very short amount of time um is this cope Ryan are we coping right now now I might be coping do you feel like we're coping I think when people are coping they don't know they're coping and I was about to say no I'm not this is not code maybe that's what people who are coping say um honestly I'm not that worried about this like you should only be worried about this in my opinion if you think block space demand will never recover on ethereum well if you think block space demand will never recover you are also thinking crypto is not a thing those are synonymous statements right so I to me like it does not compute it's not compatible like that doesn't work because uh I mean and if if bankless has a fault maybe we have more than one fault David but our fault is that we are Perma Bulls right on this industry and on crypto not over short term one-week time periods okay year long decade-long time periods uh and um yeah it's incompatible to me to be short blocks based demand in that environment but how does each stack up ethereum that is stack up in issuance versus other networks right now that'd be a cool thing to see yeah this is where the ultrasound meme really really takes hold so Bitcoin currently issuing at 1.75 which is issuing 17 million dollars a day Dogecoin coming in and this is in in terms of dollars or the more dollars you're issuing that you come first Dogecoin is the new number two daily issuer in U.S dollar terms inflating at 3.6 percent almost a 0.8 million dollars a day coming in third is ethereum at 0.15 percent issuing seven hundred thousand dollars a day of of currency and so like the the 0.15 percent issuance rate is such a clear juxtaposition on every other like highly issuing money uh currency in in this base like cardano 1.3 Litecoin one point three point seven percent I don't know where Avalanche or Solana is on this sometimes uh the David mihow Gets a bug and he does it like Avalanche is like at eight percent like yeah it's like these are Big differences these are huge numbers yeah I uh I do think all of this will catch up to the price of eth but eventually overnight eventually um a few things with respect to staking rewards uh I saw this from our Network newsletter this was very interesting look at this portion of consensus rewards which are basically block rewards versus execution rewards so post merge the rewards to validators uh saw an increase of 172 percent so definitely went up not as high as some people were saying I saw numbers around like like the high 5.9s to to six um percent apy something like that I mean there was the hope during the the bull run if you use the the Bull Run block like block space demand then you get like double digits uh staking yield um we haven't seen that we're not likely to see that anytime soon but six percent not too bad and um more than half of that is coming from me e and transaction fees rather than pure block space reward one of my favorite things about just the post merge world is how many more metrics there are to look at like there's just so many numbers to talk about as a Content producer I enjoy it yes we we will not run out of content that's for sure um knock on wood okay so this is mevboost.org which is a new website that's very very useful this is all about the block building side of the equation uh and so just a quick recap there's block proposers AKA eth stakers people are staking their eth and sometimes they want to Outsource the role of building a block they are for whatever reasons usually monetary they will say hey someone serve me a block and I will propose that block rather than building that block myself because if you block building is a skill it's a competition Vector for people to compete on and there are new block builders on the scenes these are new entities in the supply chain of building an ethereum block so there's flash bots of course there's a blocks route there's block native manifold and Eden these are all block Builders and they are specializing in how to extract as much Mev out of the block as possible but then there's also things like block route ethical which is only extracting ethical Mev so no sandwich attacks and no other militia stuff there's also blocks routes regulated if you you choose to be ovac compliant you can have the regulated block served to you and these are all these entities are all competing as to how profitable they can build you a block so flashboss is by far the most used block Builder it's it's built almost 10 000 blocks so far producing almost 2 000 ether in rewards for people that have used flashbots that's a block Builder coming in at an average block value of 0.193 ether per block and then you know all of these people are competing on various vectors as to how to make the average block the most profitable coming in first block native at .23 ether per block is the most uh the best block Builder so far in the game but is so so early in this brand new world of block building uh that uh that we will see manifold the one that Ryan is highlighting is a special case they are integrating with certain D5 apps Sushi swap which is why they have only proposed a very low number of blocks 63 but their average block value is 0.6 right that's their deal they are low numbers of block proposers but high value per block yeah what's interesting to me is like um okay so relayers and block Builders they just got jobs on the network they're newly employed and this is the same time we said to all of the miners on the ethereum network thank you for your service your services are no longer needed we will escort you to your vehicle right and like miners left has ended and now we knew have news but thank you thank you though for your service we have relayers and we have Builders as well and the Builder Market is actually like um it's actually fairly diverse like there are a number of different um block builders that are gaining some market share uh on the relayer side of things that's that's been interesting because if you run an actual validating node like David and myself so you set up your validating node and then you get to pick which block Builder which block relayer you actually want and you can pick based on your values so I want maybe an ethical box yeah a builder and relayer you can render yeah grass-fed organic or you can pick maybe something that is in super compliant maybe the over complier block Builder like block uh blocks are out regulated you actually get to choose these things now Dave and I had a conversation with a vitalik earlier this week and he made the point that there are protocol upgrades coming down the pipeline that will actually nullify the need for relayers and so we'll always have block Builders but not relayers which is good because relayers can represent a censorship Vector anyway more on that centralization Vector too yes yes a centralization censorship Vector more on that episode if you listen to it that's coming out on Monday but to your point David there are so many more numbers to look at and the ecosystem has just gotten that much more interesting with with these new relayers and build others entering the network all right well ethereum is building blocks the FED is Raising interest rates maybe Jerome Powell is the guy we have to thank for the lower crypto prices this week the FED just went big again this is their third straight three-quarter Point rate hike so 0.75 750 basis points up this was anticipated I think by the market this is uh of course you know Powell has been signaling this for a while and uh in his comments he actually signaled more to come so the comments I think were a bit more hawkish than analysts thought quotes like this the chances of a soft Landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer that's what he said he also said no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be not as much talk of soft Landing in this discussion talk of maybe estimations of maybe a 0.75 rate hike again in November followed by another half a percent in December all right so we are going up my friend interest rates are rising the FED is really serious about breaking the back of inflation so we are now between uh the new target range of three to three point two five percent from an interest rate perspective so that happened this week and of course markets risk on assets tumbled as a result yeah sick I mean okay so we we merge we look beyond the merge and we see nothing and then the FED says oh you know you want someone to look forward to rate hikes and that actually I feel like it does a pretty good job explaining the price action over the last seven days oh yeah you think Powell was like he saw the merch he's like you guys are too happy uh take this you think that's what happened yeah he's got it out for us yeah that's probably what happened all right so like when the hell is the pivot I was promised a pivot uh I thought like you know maybe election time pivot post post November pivot isn't that November of 2023 no there's the midterms are coming up mid terms oh midterm election okay yeah we've got midterms okay well whatever I don't know anything but like I I was always under the impression that the FED can't raise the interest rates all that much without like bankrupting the United States so wins the bankruptcy happened we're doing it bankruptcy not not at these rates I mean there have been lots of people like um uh Dan Moorhead from Pantera Capital he's like hey the FED has to raise at least five to six percent and they should be doing it now and this is more on kind of the aggressive side and like they have to do it in order to be sustainable so different macro people have different perspectives on this but the line that no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or not uh or how significant that recession would be kind of freaks me out because they their policy on the other side of things like I said last week their policy on the other side of things were like oh we'll just issue money like inflation is transitory we don't know it's like okay sick now we're going in the other direction but here's the thing of course we know that like high inflation is not politically tenable neither are recessions yeah those in power right so you kind of want to thread the needle and get the balance right and right now Powell is in the mood to take a hawkish stance on things but I'll tell you the prices of something is going up and that is the price of a 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S now this is raised to more than six percent for the first time since November 2008 so I have never seen rates in my kind of looking at homes a lifetime I've never seen interest rates this High not even close and they're still increasing which is crazy and if you want to look at how this looks to an average home buyer here's a a tweet the average 30-year mortgage is up from 2.7 percent to 6.3 percent we've got a doubling and that means monthly payments on a five hundred thousand dollar loan last year that's a home payment was two thousand and thirty dollars monthly payments now three thousand one hundred dollars housing prices are down six percent in one month and that is the biggest drop since 2011 this tweet ends recession is an understatement so how much can you keep cranking the vice grip here David before other things break and that's what you know macro analysts like Jim Bianco have been telling us all along they will continue to hike until something breaks or how is the housing market the next thing to break I'm not sure we're looking at you know Bonds in Japan these are other things like not sure when the next thing to break is but um Powell and the FED seem determined to continue this strategy of tightening yeah I can't can't tell if like people that bought a house at the peak of the bull market like in 2021 where are did they buy the top of the housing market yet also the bottom of the of the interest rates of the uh of the mortgage rates because at the same time so like prices are down from all-time Highs but also interest rates are up so like was it a good deal or was it not nice to be locked in right now to like a 2.7 percent fixed loan 30-year fixed loan uh what a gift that is in these yeah but your house is down six percent in a month so you know like pick your pick your poison yeah you can't get everything but if you want some comforting words uh Powell has some words on Shelter uh he said this I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time we're looking for it to come down but it's not exactly clear when that will happen it may take some time here's this one's for you David hope for the best plan for the worst Powell said there you go I don't feel comforted by that at all hope for the best plan for the worst uh this is Stanley druckenmiller not much more good news and what he's saying this is a video quote from an interview series he did he said there's a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for 10 years sort of like 1966 to the 1982 time period that's not a favorable time in American history with respect to like the prices of stocks and equities markets and that sort of thing that is a huge take 10 years of flat yeah oh so I mean I don't know what this all means right but like I I think one thing that we're seeing of course is like when prices go down when it seems like there's bad news on the week or on the month then things like this drucken Miller quotes surface right who knows how long he's been saying this um who knows how long other investors have been kind of saying this so uh there there is kind of an information bias when it comes to bad news always gets magnified during bad weeks in the market I think that's at play um but the question remains I think what would crypto do in a flat 10-year period is that going to happen and if it does happen for equities what does that mean for crypto as an asset class I'm not really sure how to how to weight these how to understand them but I think it's more content we should do on Bank list to figure that out the answer would I want crypto to do during that time I mean of course I want that the answer to be to go up but that's you know you can't ask for that obviously what I wanted to do is decouple do something else like do something different and like maybe that's that's how this like bear Market slowly plays out is like the you know this s p Market which moves slower than crypto markets crabs for 10 years but then four to five years into it we have just another classic growing season in the crypto world uh that's maybe that's what you want to happen David yeah I wanted to decouple sometime later later in the conversation drucken Miller did say like during the 1970s was it was a good time for many companies I mean that was the time when Apple was founded for example Home Depot was founded and of course we we do know that crypto markets tend to move much faster than traditional markets so the pain is more severe the dips are shorter in general uh but yeah we'll have to see this could be Uncharted Territory David what do we have coming up next coming up next the White House has some words for us in the crypto industry is it time to sound the alarm we'll figure that out uh 60 160 million dollar hack gotta reset the counter on that one and what's next now that the merge is behind us what are we going to talk about what's the new meta is there what's the new narrative can we create one uh because uh there's definitely content bear Market going on so all of that and more right

the wallet icon to get started alright guys we are back the Biden Administration the White House just released their first every comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets by that they mean crypto and the Biden Administration charged a whole bunch of branches in the White House to go and investigate crypto and this is the report this is what they came back with David what's some of the summary from this report now there's just different headlines different goals that this report wants to see it out of the crypto industry coming in at number one protecting consumers investors and businesses which yeah I mean I guess that makes sense to lead with especially coming from the White House who are trying to protect their citizens uh this is no secret that crypto is full of scams and exploits and hacks uh how the White House and how the government plans to solve that problem uh curious to see anyways that's number one a number two promoting access to financial services number three fostering Financial stability for advancing responsible Innovation five reinforcing the country's Global Financial leadership and competitive competitiveness six fighting illicit Finance anti-money laundering counterfeit financing of terrorism et cetera and seven exploring a U.S Central Bank digital currency I don't know how much I should read into the ordering of these things but it would make sense that the White House would put protecting consumers first so that's like let's not do things like algorithmic stable coins let's not promote scams um interesting that number seven blast is the cbdc which definitely tracks with all the other institutions or like government institutions out there that are like oh we'll research and talk about yeah think about it let's think about like talk about it yeah um what are your takes on this yeah so when I read this David I guess a few things like stood out for me like just some keywords like if you did a keyword search there were a lot of like words that connote danger or risk or elicit finance and there's also some some CBBC even though there's a section about um competitiveness in American protecting Innovation like there wasn't a lot of meat on the bone in the in those sections and so for me this report was pretty bearish now I didn't go into all of the detail because there are many like branching reports and it's very long but there wasn't a lot of talk about um like the potential of crypto there wasn't a lot of talk about the the value of D5 in our economy there wasn't a lot of talk about how America would lead the way from an innovation perspective and I was left as kind of like a fellow Builder an investor in the space in crypto being like why what's there for me in America like why should I build here it was pretty uninspiring I think for U.S entrepreneurs and Builders um hopefully it's just a lot of like talk similar to the cdbc type talk and maybe there won't be negative action kind of taken but one thing that became clear and this was a take from Jake travinsky the kind of of course you'd expect them to come down pretty hard on like illicit finance and money laundering that sort of thing because this is the government after all but also algorithmic stable coins kind of took center stage in the report this is Jake travinsky uh tweeting this it's hard to overstate the damage that Tara has done to the perception of crypto and DC many policy makers already dislike the notion of a permissionless digital Marketplace and wanted to put all of crypto into a well-sealed box Tara gave them unjust cause to push forward or maybe just cause and I think that's what like lawmakers and those in DC are actually thinking so Tara Luna dokwan the ecosystem the community that that entire thing that just happened you know six months ago oh yeah that 50 billion dollars that we deleted oops I put a damper on on this entire report I mean a lot of people think it could have come out of a lot different if uh Luna hadn't just happened six months ago now how can you be optimistic on quote unquote defy um like when that sort of thing is going on but it was awesome can you help me understand what is this thing for White House releases comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets what does this really mean like are they just issuing a report and like we issued a report they're issuing a report they're issuing some guidance they're starting to develop a posture a policy on kind of what Biden might support what might he not support the things that people should explore this is for themselves though right like here's our report for our own stance towards crypto it's influential I think across all branches of government right so everyone's reading this uh what we're assuming a lot of branches our government are reading this and like okay this is how we should act I think this is how Biden wants us to act or this is kind of the White House's posture I think it's influential in that way um and we're starting to see some legislation particularly on the stable coin front so this week learned a draft stable coin Bill in Congress um this this is all about stable coins we don't yet have the details of what this bill actually is it's in the house right now but um there's talk of bans on different types of payment coins that are not backed by outside assets so similar to Terra U.S uh to Tara and UST that I'll go stablecoin that of course uh collapsed and so um bans on maybe algorithmic stable coins now I have to say we haven't seen the details yet this is all kind of closed doors so we don't actually know what might be inside of these bills but it's kind of alarming that um you know that we wouldn't pick on the the centralized aspects of a Terra and would extend maybe extend the blame to a class called algorithmic stable coins and who knows how far like would Rye be included in that for example which is collateralized back by eth and not really pegged to the dollar as kind of a true natural mechanism well is maker an algo stablecoin I mean it's enforced by code right maybe this uh definition is Broad enough to include maker for example or how about frax which uses a combination and so if these experiments fall under the purview of such a bill um I don't think that's a good thing for crypto like that's a very bad thing that puts us uh farther away from non-state money at least the legality of non-state money in the U.S and Brian Armstrong made a comment about this he said one of the strongest policy Arguments for cryptocurrency is that it's a national security issue the U.S missed out on semiconductors in 5G which is now largely manufactured off offshore it can't afford to have cryptocurrency go offshore as well same for every country by the way and then he continues regulation by enforcement has a terrible chilling effect and rhetoric matters we've already seen a huge amount of crypto Talent asset issues and startups go offshore and he finishes coinbase is a global company but we're based right here in the USA and we'll fight to make sure crypto succeeds here for everyone is too important for America in the Free World and this is why Ryan I was asking you like what is this report really doing what is how is it moving the needle because every time I see a report like this like and we we always joke about like oh the United States decided to have a meeting to talk about and research cbdc's without actually implementing anything and like yes it takes time to do regulation but the crypto industry builds so fast that like we're gonna build faster than they're gonna be able to comprehend this industry and it's that is always going to create a source of friction because of what you just said maker Dao is that algorithmic because that's fully collateralized up to like 300 frax is that algorithmic because there's only 10 of that Supply that's algorithmic and then there's Tara that's algorithmic algorithm makes a bad word they don't even know we don't even know the words that we need to describe our own industry and so like there's so much just chaos and confusion in this space that like whatever regulation or report that they produce I I feel like it's always just going to lag behind what's actually needed I think what's what's most alarming though is if the first principles in the report are kind of wrong right what where we do need regulation and I think we've always said this is where things are centralated centralized they should be regulated yes where they're where there are more decentralized they don't require as much regulation the regulation is the code it's fully transparent it's all Unchained there aren't humans in the middle and and so if they make that categorical error of taking not not mixing up the difference between centralized and decentralized and taking an entire use case like algo stablecoin pointing at that and saying that's the bad thing no more algo stable coins I I just think the implications of sloppy regulation sloppy legislation could impact our industry in a big way and particularly when I say our industry I mean those in the US because outside of the US these experiments may continue to run and as Brian Armstrong said what's going to happen U.S will be leapfrogged right just like they missed out on the 5G opportunity they missed out on the semiconductor opportunity that's what's at stake here um and so that was the White House report there's a house bill on stable coins that's happening there's actually been an earlier proposition of a stable coin bill in the Senate as well but apparently on the Senate Banking Committee we don't have many fans of crypto this was a an article that was released just yesterday right in the Senate Banking Committee is not fans of crypto I am just shocked right um so they asked Senator Brown who's the chair of the committee about crypto and this was his direct quote let's just say there's a healthier skepticism about crypto and banking Housing and Urban Affairs committee than there is in the AG committee that's the agricultural committee he's talking about every single member of the Banking Committee with the exception of one has serious serious skepticism of and concerns about crypto well do you know who the one is David all right one doesn't have concerns this is uh Senator Toomey who's actually coming on the bankless podcast next week and I don't know if you saw this David but he had kind of a sparring match did you watch this video it was Gary Gensler it was so good all right well it's like when politicians make sense it's just like it feels like a weight is off your chest like thank you to me thank you yeah so there was some back and forth between to me and Gensler and a senate committee meeting and gensor is basically saying hey all tokens our Securities are almost all of them that I've seen because most of them depend on the profits of others uh I'm not saying this the Supreme Court is saying this there's something called the the Howie test and Tumi was coming back and saying yeah but not if they're sufficiently decentralized though and Gensler was kind of like dancing around that term sufficiently decentralizing to me said well prophets of others that's just one prong of the Howie test and there are like four are like he didn't say this but the question imposes like are Pokemon cards Securities how about Constantine number goes up is that security right no is the answer to that question and he was pleading he was just saying please give us Clarity there's a lack of clarity for the industry please Gary Gensler and sec give us Clarity and Gensler repeated but there's already Clarity the Supreme Court said so in the Howie test and he's just passing the book for like four minutes he's just passing the buck off to the Supreme Court right everything's a security go ask the Supreme Court but he's just putting words in the supreme Supreme Court that's that's what he's doing which is which is interesting because maybe these sorts of cases end up at the Supreme Court level maybe that's how they ultimately get results where he is where he's funneling them that's for sure it seems to be um and uh and yeah that's that's the White House report that's what's going on in D.C in crypto during the bear Market David we also got a hack this week what happened 160 million dollar winter Mew hack uh this was an interesting one uh and so there's this way there's these things called vanity addresses they're not like ens addresses where you like buy a name they're something where you like you basically mine for an address okay you use like a CPU or a GPU and you produce a bunch of hashes and you try and check for something that you're looking for and so like say you want an address that starts with zero X zero zero zero zero zero zero you can't actually intently make that address you have to just like discover a private private key that corresponds to that address and so that's what winter mute did they they mine for an address with this application called profanity that helps them do this and they got an address that started with like a large number of zeros it was like six or seven zeros people just do these things because it's cool I remember there's like a big excitement when somebody in like Bitcoin land uh in 2017 found an address that was started with flame and that was like super cool obviously you can't share the private keys because they're the only one set of private keys but like people like to do these things anyways wintermute use this app called profanity to make a profanity address which started with like eight zeros turns out the code that profanity used was faulty and so it was very exploitable and that's what happened here uh and so are you at risk of the same exploit if you've used the app profanity you might want to double check but for like 99.99 people you're fine you're fine definitely not worth it to get that vanity address right well it's definitely definitely it's possible to do it in safe ways if you double check everything like all smart contract addresses you just got to make sure you know what you're doing I'm just kind of why why take the risk yeah yeah it's um it's Risky Business uh sometimes in Winter Butte of course they were a crypto Market making firm that's why they had so much money in a hot wallet because this was a hot wallet as well it wasn't cool storage that's a lot of money in a hot wallet yeah it's a lot of money I do think the the lesson here is and this was a a good summary um from a website I found called halborn the profanity vulnerability address generator was abandoned by its creator so this project was actually abandoned by its creator which is not a good sign multiple years ago so when performing high-risk cryptographic operations such as private key generation it is best to use a tool that is reputable audited and still actively supported that is the key takeaway for bankless listeners I think I mean this feels like Common Sense anyways moving on into our big news item of the week which is an absence of news actually uh and so the big meta question is now that we're post-merge like what's the next Catalyst what's the next thing that we're going to focus on uh what next and I think this has been the meta conversation in crypto Twitter lately is what's on the horizon like what do we have to look forward to and I feel like that lost feeling of where are we and where are we going when people don't have an answer to like what is next in the crypto world is like showing up in the price action your prices are down because people feel like they are confused as to like where is the next Catalyst well it's not a supply problem it's a demand problem it's a demand problem uh and so like it turns out post merge that there's like not that much juice to squeeze out of crypto like there's the the merge was kind of it uh and like you know straight up retail just needs a rest and this is just how crypto works like retail comes in they pump up the markets and they make institutions follow them and then they get exhausted right like the nft gas markets are hard D5 is complicated Bridges get hacked so like the retail needs a rest but they always come back retail always comes back uh you just gotta you just gotta let them sit for a little bit and then you will poke that door later there's also like macro fears On The Rise we talked about macro all like for the first like 30 minutes of this podcast but then there's also the pivot on the horizon and so like we have these we have this period of time where like things just got really calm really quickly and really depressed uh and now we're like having to contend with like what's next Ryan what's your attitude with this my attitude is uh this is normal this should be expected we've seen this before in crypto we're going to see it again this is a take from DC investor and he says if you were here from the crypto class of 2020 2022 uh 2021 and are still here in 14 months then I might from that point onward consider you legit this is the great filter he calls it so that's where we are in the market the gray filter whole bunch of people who just came in recently class of 2020 2021 are about to get filtered out they're about to lose leave and so this is an analogy we often use of the difference between settlers and tourists the tourists leave the settlers stay and we build we rebuild for the next cycle and I gotta say David this goes back to kind of probably my main take of the week that we'll get to is why I'm bullish I'm bullish because the builders are continuing to build my friend I have never seen more building activity go on on the ethereum protocol layer for example even just shipping the merge and everything that's next so we just talked to vitalik with but then on the application layer I mean bridge is being built layer twos being built out and hardened defy apps a whole new generation of these defy apps GameFly is still happening in the background nfts like we are building more than ever before I think this Market cycle to me proved that crypto has product Market fit all right in 2018 before defy wasn't sure didn't know for sure it was kind of a guess um and that's why by the way prices of ether like you know 10x higher it's because we have product Market fit but what's going to happen over the months to come is the tourists are going to leave the settlers are going to stay we're going to build and we're going to be ready for the next cycle because I do believe the next cycle will come independent of macro this is not even a bet based on macro maybe macro will help things happen faster but uh I don't think crypto can be stopped due to macra I mean this is a exponential revolutionary you know technology and it can grow past macro and the stock market quite easily it doesn't actually take that much it just takes some real world use cases to completely expand and there are things that are literally next we're going to have the withdrawals unlocked not that that's fundamentally bullish but then there's eip4844 the ZK evm the the gold standard of scalability the ZK syncs launching in 36 days so there are things where I in technical protocol developments that are literally next uh it's not however it's not the protocol that triggers bull markets these Protocols are the platforms for applications that then trigger bull markets and this is the thing that people that stick around during the bear markets are able to observe firsthand that newcomers that come because of a bull market are always catching up on is that like the 2021 bull market was the D5 summer of 2020 and nfts exploded on ethereum and that was the ethereum app layer bull market this is where an ethereum gas fees hit like 600 and like stayed there for weeks what that triggered was another another bull market in protocols that wanted to like also share in this Avalanche Solana Phantom but like it always starts with the protocol and so we are having protocols now like the zkevm out of CK sync polygon like so many of all these seems darkwear uh oh sarkar's not doing one actually um but like and then also 4844 where like the the brakes get Unleashed out of layer twos so these are the things these are the things that are next they're not like fundamentally bullish but they produce the platforms for bull markets to exist on and you're only going to watch that if you were here I remember Ryan going through 2018 to 2020 having having this gut instinct that like I have no idea when the bear Market is going to end but when it does end it's going to end quickly and it's gonna rock it the prices are gonna rock it and when ether broke 400 it broke a thousand dollars like two or three months later so you have to stick around to observe this can you share that story because um so bankless bankless tweeted something out it said um for real how did you actually become um millionaire in crypto like for for those of you who did it how did you do it was the tweet and I actually didn't expect you to respond David but like you responded with your story well what is your story like how did you do well in crypto during the last bear Market uh I got a job in crypto that made it easy to pay attention to crypto so it was my job to stay up to date with the meta uh and so that was I was consuming information all the time like learning learning learning about how this thing works and then with whatever money I had after rent and uh renting food I bought eth like a hundred percent of it and I remember when ether broke down to 80 in covet again I literally stopped I'm not saying that this is healthy but like my friend was like hey let's go on a trip and I'm like dude the the cost of this trip in terms is astronomical uh and so like like you I definitely did like cut off like General like life activity these but it was just because like I I saw these prices in these terms I'm like this is that I can't justify this experience an opportunity yeah and like then eventually after like a very like subdued two years of activity where I was just like working at my companies and eventually starting bankless and consuming and learning and producing content that all came to like I was able to cash in on that rapidly in 2021 when ether goes from 400 to 4 000 inside of 12 months right and so like you can't afford to like not pay attention because like the alpha you get from being ahead of the bull market is insane it's a difference between buying the top and selling the top the ability is not that I sold the top the ability to see D5 like D5 summer before it happened I mean we saw it it was obvious all people that participated in D5 summer saw the 2021 bull market a year in advance yeah I totally agree this is a post that caught my attention from Maddie earlier this week and he talked about some possibilities some things if you were a settler to look out for an actual D5 2.0 he mentions web 3 Commerce web3 social um decentralized science Desai uh the world of atoms where kind of like physical meets crypto there's all sorts of different areas you can take a look at and I love how he concludes his post which is just like I don't really know what the next big use cases are going to be but I'm here and I'm going to watch them and observe them and find out so that's what you have to do if you want to do well in cryptos you can't be the tourists who just comes in during you know the tops of the cycle you have to stay for the long run so I think that's what's next for us David we're gonna keep staying we're gonna keep doing what we're doing with bankless and what is literally next in the show Universal Studios doing an nft scavenger hunt so this is kind of that story the adoption of nfts and creative in different ways Universal Studios getting into it tether once again under the microscope seems to this happens every 12 months or so and do Quan an Interpol notice but we don't know where he is so we're gonna find out all of this stuff and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Juno is bringing crypto friendly

building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications

it seems like it's kind of dead is that a shocker to you not at all uh while I was sad that the merge was definitely priced in uh at least I got this one right uh was a nothing Burger uh like I'm not surprised in the sightest that is some Solace uh infuria as well they are a network that provides a lot of the data to different wallets that you use a lot of the infrastructure node infrastructure that powers ethereum and they are announcing that they are planning to decentralize their infrastructure I think this is a long time coming and very hoped for for many in the ethereum community that we would have more decentralized options rather than just the inferiors and the alchemies of the world do you have anything to add to that David I think when somebody a big protocol like in Furious as we plan to decentralize it's fair to say token because if you want to continue development how do you incentivize that development while also be seeing being decentralize it means a token this is a very key piece of ethereum infrastructure it's a it's a source of critique from external ethereum people because like you know your meta mask hooks into an inferior to relay transactions and if in Frio wants to censor you you probably could so decentralizing inferior is a very big deal so this is a very big step out of inferior also fitting with consensus's new meta of one into tokenize and decentralize as many of its products as possible so best of luck on the journey into the decentralized frontier in fira I'm still waiting on that metamask token though David someday yeah keep on keep don't hold your breath on that one something new out of the Stark X ecosystem they tweeted out bug found and fixed shortly after launch but how it was found in fix is pretty pretty cool the bug was found by Vlad pachok out of matter labs and ihor baron black these are Russian names that I'm terrible at pronouncing and they say in soccer says we deeply share we share our deep appreciation and thank them for alerting us this is an excellent exam sample of good Community spirit and DC investor who who retweeted this saying a ZK sync devs found a bug in the starkware ecosystem and communicated it to them to make sure that it could be fixed before anyone found could be harmed by it respect to the right kind of ethos to move us forward and then ZK sync says being Mission driven means helping everyone in the ethereum ecosystem glad we could help stockware stay secure nice job nice job this is good good move Goodwill clout yeah that's exactly right this is openc excited to share that they just released openc on arbitrim or at least that's going to be happening soon so adding other networks to The Fray I think they they've added polygon maybe Solana if I'm not mistaken yes and now arbitrum so excited to see all of the layer twos join the ranks of an open C supported Network David this is some cool nft news Universal plus nfts and a scavenger hunt what is all this yeah I thought this was it was pretty cool it's a pretty clever use of nfts so basically what they're doing is they are just issuing they're putting seven different QR codes around their their Halloween era like theme parks like you know every Halloween they themed their Park Halloween themed uh and it's a scavenger hunt uh and so people run around the park and they scan seven QR codes and then you get an nft when that's scanned and visitors who scan all seven of them receive a special nft which according to moonpay the crypto payment service that's partnering with universal on this side can unlock additional perks this is what you like if you don't know what to do with your nfts this is what you do you make it hard you make them hard to get and then you make them unlock certain things and access to more things like it's the most basic roadmap for all nfts Universal doing a good job with this and making it fun and I guess congrats to moonpay for partnering with them on that as a huge uh huge partnership tether under the microscope again the stablecoin issuer tether ordered to produce documents showing what usdt is actually backed by this is I think a U.S judge in New York requiring that tether do this and that's all good this is back to what we're saying is if you're centralized you should be under the scrutiny of of regulators like we should know what usdt is backed by and you shouldn't be able to ban it completely but we should have full transparency and visibility here so I don't hate this I'm excited to get the definitive view on what tether is actually backed by because that's always some been kind of a mystery in crypto I will say this does happen every now and then I think the last time this happened was in like 2019 where tethered was like forced to disclose his Holdings and it was like okay it's all there moving on uh but like you said that was a one snapshot in time that's now like three years stale so I guess we'll just do this all over again I'm expecting tether to come back with plenty of reserves like us uh usdc does it every every month right like this or something yeah but it's like that's the way it should be if you're a centralized yeah because so you should have audited Financial reports for what actually backs the uh the dollar here um David there seems to be some back and forth between FTX SPF that is sandbankment freed and CZ they are uh they are buying all sorts of things these are the two crypto banks that have money in this bear market and they are yeah me too it feels that way David um so this is FTX they're in the lead to buy the crypto lender Voyager remember that was the one that went bankrupt some of his assets are still worth something some of its customers I assume some of its software and they're in a bidding war with uh binance CZ from uh from binance so back and forth they go trying to snap up all of these um companies that have failed so hard and take their assets yeah so you said FTX bid was uh in the lead but this article came out before it was disclosed that actually binance's bid was slightly higher than ftx's according to well this article types as some people um so I guess citation kind of needed but so that's what some people are saying uh yeah SPF versus CZ uh these uh two people with letters for names going after it meanwhile dokwan is on the Run question mark this is the headline South Korea asks Interpol to issue red notice for Tara co-founder doe Quan David what is a red notice yeah red notice is an international agreement it's like yo this person if you find or see this person grab them uh and so yeah there's like no hiding from it like yeah in most Western countries and you know most countries I think in the world are in the Interpol red notice list are they not uh yes I believe so so uh South Korean says they've moved to invalidate his passport days after they issued the arrest warrant and then they have a definition of a red nose here is a request for law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest the named individual and hold that person until extradition processes can begin uh not 195 countries um so wow yeah pretty much can't hide can't run what's weird is earlier this week dokwan tweeted this I am not on the run in quotes or anything similar for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate we are in full cooperation we don't have anything to hide he's not on the run yet he has an Interpol red notice after him uh one of these things only one of these things can check out so uh and this is like I can't even believe all of this happened this year do you remember like it was this year dokwan was riding High torching people on crypto talking about ending die um talking about like how I don't know Ryan Sean Adams doesn't know anything about about crypto Mike do you remember that tattoos oh yeah I remember that tweet uh and now like months later there's an Interpol notice for him like he's wanted in 195 countries how crazy how quick that's one of my like Favorite Things bull market shenanigans that happened is uh Mike novogratz gets the Luna wolf tattoo you comment below that this makes me question everything I know about crypto do Quan replies to you don't worry it wasn't much to begin with yes and then all of the lunatics like laugh at Ryan John Adams then Tara blows up and now dokwan's on the run and like and Mike Nova it makes a statement of like yeah this is going to be one of these memories I have like I have to live with for the rest of my life yes between the last like five months I wouldn't believe it if he gave me the script for this movie no wait no no this is cool what is the tribe Community doing uh as a result of the the Rari hack because there was word that they weren't going to pay back victims and now maybe they're changing course and they are going to pay back yeah it looks like it yeah the tribe Dow team has said that they are going to call it quits and this caused definitely a lot of consternation because there's plenty of Assets in the tribe Dao Treasury and the tribe token holders were going to vote to distribute those assets to token holders and then partially pay back people that lost money in the Rari hack Rari now part of tribe but it actually looks like that a vote was passed on chain to fully pay back the victims inside of 24 hours from this tweet so this should have happened by the time you are listening to this uh so it looks like hack victims are being paid out in full before tribe Dow token holders are liquidating all assets the way that it should be so nice job Dallas doing the right thing well I wonder if there's pressure on them or they just decided to do the right thing well any pressure I'm sure there was pressure helium signs a five-year agreement with T-Mobile for the helium mobile launch that is according to coindesk this is huge uh this is from uh tishar from multi-coin helium mobile just launched their own cellular Plans which will combine the helium 5G Network and the T-Mobile network helium Mobile plans will start as low as five dollars per month and subscribers will mine mobile tokens using just their phone that's pretty crazy David what is helium for people who aren't aware helium is this mesh network of like Cellular Connection and so plenty of people some of my friends here in Brooklyn and New York have these little like helium router node things on their roof kind of like where you would put like a satellite dish and so people that are walking by that are connected to the helium Network can tap into your little helium node and then use that node for data so your helium node hooks into your Wi-Fi or your internet service provider and then you bounce that Wi-Fi to somebody who's got their phone out that's local to you and these things are short range I think it's something like maybe a quarter mile or perhaps even much less than that um uh so like but the idea is like many many many people all put these on their houses and so in densely populated areas you can go and like get data from this helium mesh Network helium Network thing I don't really understand the tokenomics behind it this is actually a project that I haven't really dove in too much but a a partnership with T-Mobile is crazy T-Mobile that's nice yeah I I so I think the rough approximation of the token economics is early adopters win bigger right as the token price appreciates so this is kind of one of the use cases for tokens which is how do you bootstrap an entire like cellular network and the way you do that is through token incentives particularly reward the early adopters and so maybe that's what's working out here um I think we should do more content on helium yeah and figure it out in some more detail but yeah it's certainly a big move here it got our attention the founder of Kraken Jesse Powell not to be confused with dronepal stepping down as CEO so getting a new leadership and David Ripley Kraken c o o will be taking over as CEO so that's the news there you go Jesse Jesse's watch has ended as well um did you know David the NASDAQ is planning to launch an Institutional crypto custody service right this is the NASDAQ Stock Exchange which is kind of weird because at the same time Gary Gensler is talking about all your C20 tokens maybe being Securities and NASDAQ is getting into crypto custody so what does that mean I wonder um I think it's a good thing for adoption particularly institutional adoption of crypto I'm glad it's happening during the bear Market where people are more focused on building and not pumpy headlines so that's cool David we also have liquid Collective yeah yeah liquid Collective it's a Consortium of many centralized staking as a service uh entities things like coinbase Cloud a few others alluvial figment and they are all coming together under this liquid Collective I haven't been able to parse out the details too too deeply but I think the gist is that this is a shared protocol shared standard for staking as a service providers to all produce a liquid staking token uh and that can help mitigate some of the concerns around centralized stickers because if they are all like forming one Mega System they're all actually checking and balancing on each other and so that's kind of just here I think more details are certainly needed but definitely interesting uh interesting development out of the liquid Collective and speaking of coinbase cloud they have just launched their platform for web 3 developers and what's cool about this so coinbase Cloud I think of it as like almost like AWS for crypto AWS for blockchain that is Amazon web services which you know many of the websites that use your daily life run on AWS they're they're doing a cloud-based service but for blockchains and for crypto and and starting today apparently developers and this was a couple of days ago now have free and instant blockchain API access from coinbase cloud so free and instant API access and I imagine they are running this kind of a promotion to fuel adoption of coinbase cloud that's a big entrant into the space I'm pretty excited about this yeah big moves in other worlds FTX is reloading they have raised a billion dollars for further acquisition strategies so they've already been buying up all of the blood in the market and they are raising another billion dollars adding to the 400 million dollars that they've already raised in January so that they could buy up more deals during crypto winter damn your moves easy are you going to compete with another billion that's crazy yeah uh this is cool Masari the crypto analytics and media entity they just announced that they raised another 30 five million dollars this time in series B funding and David you've been hanging out at massari mainnet all week what was the temperature there what was the feeling yeah I was actually there just before recording this uh moderating a panel of scaling Solutions Avalanche arbitrum ZK sync and polygon uh decently populated this is always the uh the conference that's like one suits that are one foot in the crypto world uh so can't really talk to them about eip4844 but can talk to them about like generalized scaling ideas so not not too technical but definitely more than crypto curious I would say uh decently populated definitely successful uh it's always nice to see people attending crypto conferences in Bear markets and congratulations to Ryan selkis leading Masari over there raising 35 more million dollars yeah congrats to massari in the race there that's a big one good to have more crypto media companies so we don't have stupid headlines that we have to deal with from like the Yahoo finance one I read out earlier Ryan you know where member Ryan sulcus is like War over Ripple and like Brad garlinghouse yeah guess who was on stage together no Brad and Ryan Bradco yeah it was spicy definitely not I didn't watch it myself but I I remember murmurings about this about how this was going to happen Ripple sponsored the event one of my friends came up to me uh James from fire eyes he came up to me and he's like dude look at my hat and it's like a ripple hat old school Ripple hat huh that's amazing I haven't seen one of those in a long time I guess well it's not old school it's brand new Ripple's still around it's so hard for me to believe that Ripple is still around it's I don't know why they have the market cap that they have it's actually pretty impressive at this point David this is jobs time so while we are in a bear Market from a price perspective we are not in a bear market for jobs because what happens during bear markets Builders build and they need people to help build the companies and Protocols of the future for the next Bull Run David should I read out some jobs go please do Ryan it's my favorite part of the weekly roll-up all right well you should dance then solid World Dow senior web 3 developer Rubicon smart contract engineer Bank list we need a social Lord social Lord molecules seriously a bank list a growth marketer both those are what David non-technical uh economia needs a lead designer a silent protocol needs a full stack software contract engineer to perform a senior back-end engineer big green a full stack developer Missouri software engineer Market data massari also software engineer of media I could go on but I don't have to get a job like David did last bull market last excuse me last bear Mark he got a job and look at him now you could be the next David oh God you just turned so many people just turned it off no no go to thebanklist.palot.com website to get those jobs be the next David or just be be yourself now is the time to get a job in crypto we should say instead of a get a job in crypto we should say become a crypto millionaire Yeah by getting a job in crypto is that how during the crypto bear Market it's just like it's one to one stay tuned for David's book of 10 easy steps guys coming up next of course we've got questions from the nation and some hot takes on Twitter from uh Hayden Adams dropping the spice this week spicy this week yeah we'll get to that and more but first we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible rocketpool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eats with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your ease and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating notes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there zksync is an ethereum layer 2 Network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge Roll-Ups in the ethereum virtual machine enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible ones we haven't even seen yet crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world but crypto killer apps need ZK sync as a platform to build on first it's generally accepted that zero knowledge Roll-Ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology and zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of cryptoeconomics so if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof Foundation which gives your users the best ux possible check out zksync's website at zksync.io and yes there's also going to be a token so give them a follow on Twitter too at zkasync questions from the nation a reminder you can ask the question on Twitter follow bankless HQ on Twitter get your question in we usually publish a post on Wednesday reply to that post with your question it may come up on the roll up here is Ben Brown he's asking the question could you help explain the value of running a full node even if you don't have enough Eve to be a validator you providing any security benefits the network and how would that play out if someone attacked or censored the network Ben is asking here David why run a node if you ain't getting paid if you're not a Staker or validator is there any point there are so many reasons why one would want to run their own node and I think the the easiest one to explain is that if you run your own node you can point your metamask your wallet provider to that node and so your node natively connects to the ethereum blockchain or whatever blockchain you're talking about in the same way that every other node does and so it's a first class citizen it's hearing the same transactions it's seeing the same data it's hearing taking in the same blocks as all the other nodes in the in the world and so your you have an ethereum node in your house in fira you don't have to use inferior you take your wallet your meta mask and instead of using infuria you point it to your node and then when you write a transaction there are no middlemen it's going straight to the ethereum network because you are broadcasting your own transactions there's plenty of reasons why you would want to do this but it's one of those it's it's going Max bankless and so there are no intermediaries separating your transaction from the ethereum network and so this is this is why running your note is like part of the bankless philosophy like having the option to run your own node is having the option to permissionlessly transact on the network it's nice that we have things like inferior but it's critical that we can route around them if we need to and that's what running your own node does that's like the first use case for me that comes to mind as to why someone would run to run their own node um what use cases come to you uh come to your head run well ultimately it's it's about that it's going full bankless and taking complete sovereignty but also I will say there's a systemic importance to this of more people running their own nodes because it is a is a check on other validator power right so if you don't want to run the ethereum software on your own node for example you don't have to it's kind of like a vote in uh in the ethereum network right and so um like it's really the non-staking nodes are an essential part as well as staking notes of course but non-saking staking notes are an essential part of ethereum's defense and security it's kind of how you vote as a citizen inside of the network and so this is the problem if individuals don't have the ability to run their own nodes and somebody else has to run and for them from a Data Center and they lose their vote it's kind of it it's it's sort of like um you know some people vote in all of their local government elections right some people don't but imagine if you didn't have the ability to vote in your local government election that would be a problem that would mean you're you're no longer in a democracy there's no longer you know some notion of the people the people rule you might be in some different type of a network you might be in a monarchy you might be in A A A government controlled by an elite few and that is the that is the difference between running a node it gives you the ability to vote in the network itself take for example if like two big entities like coinbase or Lido had like the Army march in even though light was actually 24 people but say for example there's one person uh the Army marches in holds a gun to these people's heads and say hey install this new uh client on your validators and make the ethereum blockchain update to this client the the think of like nodes as like minority power so all like two like two-thirds of East Acres have a gun to their head say hey uh install this ofac version of ethereum and like now we have two-thirds of proof of stake validators going in that direction it's the nodes that don't install that software that actually have the say because then we'll have a chain split and the community is going with the non-ofac version of ethereum and that version of ethereum will win if the community says it will and the community says that it will by running that node and it's the same reason why Bitcoin one versus Bitcoin cash in 2016-2017 is because the Bitcoin Community chose to run the Bitcoin as we know it node software and also like bought that version of Bitcoin and prompted up the market price of that version of Bitcoin so like running your own node is like how you have minority power over each stakers no matter the no matter the size of the stake this is a question I think that's related it's from Matt why are mobile phones not the ultimate device for solo staking they're always connected on Wi-Fi or cell if the landline doesn't work in their battery feed for them lasts hours in case of electricity shortages what about this idea why not stake on a mobile phone it seems like this would be the ultimate computer for a validator or Staker for someone to run their own non-staking node itself yeah it's a really good question and there's definitely the possibility of mobile phones becoming staking and the timing of this question is actually really interesting because we just recorded an episode with Italy buterin where we talked about this where not only can we reduce The Ether requirements for staking nodes potentially down to like eight ether but we can actually reduce the hardware requirements down to a cell phone so why can't we do this today I don't know what the exact bottleneck is uh bandwidth I don't think is the issue CPU power definitely could be an issue hard drive space perhaps an issue but then as soon as we get into light clients which are like clients that don't have a lot of like data stored with them but are still fully self-sovereign clients like then we do start to unlock like cell phones this is a thing this is actually if there was an app you could just download on your phone that was just the staking yeah right it's just so much easier just one one click and you have it and you're running a stakey node on your phone that sounds pretty that ass yeah what you the bigger concern is like you won't you're taking your phone into like wherever you're going right so if you lose your phone you're gonna need to be able to recover those accounts abstraction David you know social recovery we'll get there I'll figure that out it's not overnight one of the infinity problems we have left in this space takes of the week let's talk about the first one this is from Joe weisenthal he says I genuinely think that with the merge now having happened much of the institutional crypto space think VCS Etc they're now going to turn sharply against Bitcoin the Ponzi scams and fads built on ethereum are now ESG and this will be used as a regulatory cudgel against proof of work chains so Joe making the case that because ethereum is proof of stake doesn't have the energy consumption baggage that Bitcoin does it will now be the institutional crypto chain what do you think about this I mean this is one of the things we've been saying for a long a long time Joe weisenthal of course co-host of the odd Lots podcast he uh out of Bloomberg so this is crypto skeptical he's cryptos yes he's definitely crypto skeptical but definitely also pays attention uh really close with like Nick Carter and people like that like the academic side of crypto uh but yeah like Bitcoin has a extremely uphill battle to fight with this whole like energy consumption thing and I don't know how they get through that here's uh maybe how they do get through that David this is a take from Dan held notable bitcoiner long time bitcoiner I would call Dan a maximalist uh and he tweets this say no to bitcoin fundamentalism and then someone asked the question of what is fundamental fundamentalism look like Bitcoin fundamentalism and it's saying things like All-Star immoral according to Dan lending is immoral VCS are immoral making money is immoral this is uh maybe Bitcoin hardliners softening a little bit getting more pragmatic is that what this is looking like to you yeah I'm actually an email correspondence with Dan about potentially scheduling a show because I I reply to this like hey I would love to talk about Bitcoin fundamental mentalism versus Bitcoin rationalism this fundamentalism term is new and I think that's a strategic not using the word maximalist because I think Dan held is would self-identify as like I'm I'm fully focused on the Bitcoin ecosystem maybe he wouldn't call himself a Bitcoin maximus in the same way we don't call ourselves ethereum maximalists um but like other people call us that and other people call Dan held that so if we do get Dan held on the show I would love to see where he draws the line between Bitcoin fundamentalism and Bitcoin maximalism because I don't I'm pretty sure Dan hell is going to ride proof of work uh or die like that I think that I strongly held belief I do too he's going to ride Bitcoin or die probably but I will say this is a narrative pivot for the Bitcoin fundamentalist Community or the Bitcoin Community as a whole um they're definitely looking at this and saying hey people don't like us like y'all are crazy Corey clipston you're crazy uh this is a take from Hayden atoms of course the the founder of uniswap in my opinion thinking about ethereum haters as a singular group is not particularly useful he says most people outside of crypto Twitter are not haters or like ores they're I couldn't give less of a  about ethereum except for how it affects things I actually care about tours really overusing the oars me but I love it I mean yeah I'm just reminded of that line that like the opposite of Love isn't hate it's indifference uh so like a lot of people just don't care about crypto except for the fact that we're consuming a ton of energy except a lot less these days until we build stuff for them that they care about yes exactly notice exactly another take by Hayden you want to read this yeah crypto people blame others for being anti-crypto but it's because one crypto has elevated horrible spokespeople yeah uh two crypto industry spends too much time fighting and arguing both internally and accidentally for theoretical Futures rather than actively demonstrating value in the present yeah I'd say that's an accurate summary although I will also say that crypto very much needs to look into the future to see what it will become because there are potential many many potential versions of crypto and we need to make sure that we find the right one so you do have to look into the future yeah I agree and I don't think Hayden is saying don't look into the future I think what he's saying is let's build let's build something really useful this is the Carl call during the the bear market for sure um David this was another take and I enjoyed this tweet out of bank list as well it says what's your most cancelable take we got a lot of good cancel it takes Ryan says it's okay to have a bank account hey don't repeat that don't repeat that it's not for the roll-up okay that was just the cancel we'll take but seriously it is okay to have a bank account I have a bank account David is a bank account uh what's this take from John yeah this is John and he says John from Delphi who wrote that insane reports on both ethereum's roadmap and roll up so very well-informed guy and he says roll ups today mostly aren't actual Roll-Ups and one of them will likely suffer a major hack at some point which will make people question the whole plan to begin with there's also a picture of a guide like dropping a grenade into into down a stairwell it's a pretty good picture what do you think he means by that Roll-Ups aren't actually Roll-Ups is it because we have some relaxed security assumptions yeah if you want to go to l2beat.com.org oh my gosh right yeah so there's all these different like risks that we need to like plug uh and so there are like arbitrum one optimism dydx Loop ring all of these things still can be upgraded they still haven't burned the private keys right and so that still that still needs to happen uh there's still like fraud proofs that are needed so there's like six or seven or eight different like pieces that you need to have complete before you call yourself a roll-up and John is just saying Roll-Ups are just like incomplete they are missing pieces before they can fully call themselves a roll-up I will say though well he's totally right uh still yet to have a single roll up having having a big exploit and like almost it seems every single crossed layer one Bridge has gotten you better not gone David because things could change quickly I know there was a an exploit uh bug that was found on arbitrum earlier this week we didn't fit it into the roll-up but uh but that happened so these types of things can happen for sure and I I do think that um it is probably true that some of these Roll-Ups are kind of like they're side chains with a path towards a roll-up future right until they fully take care of upgradability State validation validator failure all of these risk scenarios they do have some risks they operate a bit more like side chains now the difference between side chains and roll-up is they have a path to get there the other side and be fully secured by ethereum they actually have a future they actually have a path to get there they actually have a future uh let me ask you the question though David what do you bullish on this week my friend Ryan you know that merge video that I made that like 15 minute what is the ethereum merge video yes and it got like 20 30 000 views and got us a bunch of new subscribers and it was like very edited and like you know how you know how we're like how long are we at right now we are at one hour and 31 minutes into the weekly roll up and like we keep every we keep on talking about how like yo we like we have to trim down these goddamn weekly Roll-Ups and then we do it once and then we never do it again same thing with the podcast we record a podcast with vitalik and we just need to talk about everything so it's an hour and 45 God damn minutes part one part two part two two-part episode because we can't do short episodes you know you know how this is a problem yeah I know that's a problem yeah why why are you talking about it now yeah so I've got like four of those videos like in the hopper uh for 15 minute videos yeah one is 18 minutes once 12 minutes one's like three minutes what is ethereum what is eth why this one's my favorite why is crypto full of scams uh I'm I'm known to write very long essays but when you take these long essays and you read them really fast into a teleprompter and then give that to your editors and they may make a YouTube video out of that all of a sudden David's infamously long essays turn into very short YouTube videos wow yeah so all that's coming uh on a brand new bankless YouTube channel uh and so this is coming out shortly soon so stay tuned for that um this is going to be the hyper YouTube optimized side of bankless and your boy is pioneering it I feel like this is the point in the show where we should edit and like subscribe to the new YouTube channel with a big button if people are watching us on YouTube do we have that capability yet is the channel oh it's  you're totally right no it'll be out like next Wednesday or something yeah almost all right stay tuned though stay tuned well I'll talk about it next week too for all the people that are sticking around Ryan what are you bullish on uh just like I already said it the building the building that's going on I've never seen a time where more building is happening in crypto more developers you know the thing that they always say is like following follow the developers right it's like if you follow the developers then you know you follow them regardless of what the price is I mean people can be bearish if they want but like I'm going to be here following the developers and what are they doing they're working on the eath road map that looks better than I've ever seen episode where Vitality goes through it coming out on Monday layer twos the building that's going on across all of the team like ZK team ZK evm fasting happening faster than anyone thought uh building on optimism building on Arboretum defy that's being built out I think there will be a D5 2.0 it was not the D5 2.0 that we sort of saw the moon yeah it'll be a real D5 2.0 which um you know has all sorts of new ideas that we've not even contemplated nfts are building it's all of these new discoveries ahead of course this is building nfts we're building like so uh I just feel like when you have this amount of talent and you know developer capability in space like being bearish on crypto right now is like okay cool like be bearish on the internet be bearish on Humanity be bearish on software and code like where did that get you the last 20 years go be bearish on those things that's fine spicy Ryan I'll be holding uh it's gonna be okay and I'm excited that you know there's still a bankless audience for us on on the other side of this because we're going to come out stronger as we follow the developers as we keep building uh David what do we have meme of the week meme of the week let's do it let's look at this uh I thought this was great so this is uh actually gonna be kind of hard to explain but we have uh two dudes and another dude and one dude is explaining to two dudes and they're at a party uh and then the title is when I accidentally use personality a with friend group b and the solo dude is like I'm stoked that the ethereum proof of stake upgrade was successful looking forward to tracking my staking yields over the next few weeks and then the other two dudes who are both wearing football sweatshirts saying proof of what what the are you talking about French and then bankless the bank list Instagram DMS this dude who's talking about proof of stake at the party and goes bankless says hey how's the party and the guy says horrible and he's just crying he's just held up yeah I guess this meme Works more when you look at it you know what it's funny to me because it kind of works in real life like do you have like I have a whole bunch of internet friends where I could celebrate the merge with right but like I don't have that many in real life friends who just care at all about them about ethereum and like if I brought up to my like in real life life Normie friends hey the merge was awesome this week what are you talking about get out of here nerd like so I I don't know if this is like you or maybe David your life you've better integrated kind of like your in real life friends with your crypto friends and they're one in the same but like for me it's very much two different groups so my mom's birthday was the day of the merge uh and so I called her up and I was like Mom do you know what day it is and she of course thinks I'm talking about her birthday oh no I hope you were in that moment I hope you pivoted no I was like she was like uh yeah it's my and I go it's the day of the murder oh God David but okay but my mom remembers when I had like these GPU miners in different corners of my dad's house until my mom being like the liberal environmentalist that she is she always like this is consuming how much electricity and so if she goes and so she goes what what's what's the merge and she goes and I tell her this is the day that ethereum mitigates all Mining and it goes proof of stake and we eliminate all of our energy consumption you know what she says that's great I love them you're also happy birthday Mom and then I wish her a happy birthday okay perfect get ordering on that David well that that was a gift to your mom then didn't know that the merge and inspired effects were all all about uh a gift to your mother but that's great David um should we end it here so we do have a Moment of Zen and This Moment of Zen is coming out of uh Gabriel Haynes he's this uh if you're not familiar with him he's this uh absurdist meme Joker account on crypto Twitter and it's pretty funny but first round is gonna read you some disclaimers of course eat this risky gotta tell you none of this has been Financial advice all of crypto is so is D5 you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot my friend told me that he's waiting for eth to hit 500 before he buys and I said to him well eth only hit 800 because suzu and Kyle needed to liquidate their entire portfolio at the bottom so it's very unlikely that we get to those numbers again unless there's some sort of catastrophic liquidation and he says to me well you know what the macro is getting bad the macro is gonna send SPX to 200. you're a goddamn Barista sir not a macro
