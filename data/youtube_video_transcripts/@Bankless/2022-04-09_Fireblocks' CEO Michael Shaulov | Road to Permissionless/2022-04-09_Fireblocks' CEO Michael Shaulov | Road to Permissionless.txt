talking to michael shaw from fireblocks and we've had michael on the bankless podcast before and fireblocks is a self-custody software provider for so many just massive institutions but also what is new with fire blocks and you're going to hear this in the episode is that they have not only onboarded so many institutions over the last six months but they have spun out or spanned out and onboarded different types of companies companies that are focusing on gaming companies that are focusing on nfts so fireblocks is no longer just for institutions but the new types of clients and the new types of business relationships that fire blocks has made in the last six months has really uh really cracked the branding away from just being institution focused and really focus on just being a financial service provider for basically anyone that wants to get into crypto which is kind of everyone these days yeah absolutely this is really the bridge from institutions to d5 from institutions to crypto tapping to those big pools of capital i think that's going to be a big story as we head into permissionless as well so with that introduction we want to take you right to the podcast with michael from fireblocks all right bankless nation we are here with michael shawlov the ceo and co-founder of fireblocks we've had him on the podcast before but that was almost a generation ago in last august of 2021 crypto is an entirely new beast here and this is once again the road to permission list where we talk about some of the the leading panelists and and conversations and talks that's going to happen at the permissionless con at the permissionless conference michael welcome back to the show great to be back and uh you know thanks for uh making the opportunity to host us yeah yeah and and in the last six months since we last talked the conversations around institutions and crypto institutions and defy has really really picked up so i just kind of want to pick your pick your brain up as to what has happened in the last six months can you kind of just give us an update in the fire blocks ecosystem but also perhaps we should start with what fire blocks actually is can you kind of speed run us through the 101 of fire blocks what is fire block so uh we provide infrastructure for financial institutions that are working with cryptocurrencies and digital assets enjoy speaking nowadays some of the stuff that we've expanded on is basically moving outside of the just the institutional market to other businesses such as uh web 2 companies streaming companies gaming companies and so on so you know there's that this is how the stuff that they is actually happening as probably people know but fundamentally the infrastructure that we provide helps those companies to deal with multiple things the first one is really how to securely store the assets in a in a fairly accessible way so basically the entire secure world infrastructure the second aspect is all the ability to transfer security those assets between counterparties what we call the firebox network and the third thing is really all the access into the defy and nft world that i think we've pioneered at least like you know on the institutional side in terms of securing providing the compliance providing the controls for people to allocate a lot of capital interact with those protocols interact with smart contracts uh under uh the the requirements that uh they have as a as a more sophisticated entity that's in a nutshell uh what we do uh we currently service uh i think probably last time we talked if it was in august we probably had around the 500 clients i i would assume we now have 1 000 clients or 1 000 customers that are actually using our platform right so the growth was exceptional um about 260 billion dollars is being transferred basically from a transaction standpoint being uh transacted over the the platform the pipes that we provide um and yeah i mean i think that the most exciting part is really the use cases that we are seeing up out there and helping to shape and support 2x growth in six months is absolutely gangbusters that's that is insane growth and i definitely think that is probably why the eight billion dollar evaluation that you guys got on your recent raise is is certainly justified we're gonna get that into that in a little bit but just as a high level recap crypto's growing up it's interesting more and more people around the world is also institut interesting more and more institutions and of course we all know that you know custody and private key management in crypto is always a dangerous thing and so that's really where where fire blocks comes in first with the custodianship but also with making sure that um your guys's clients are still hooked into the powers of defy and all the powers that that defy enable uh are there any like really awesome clients that you've landed in the last like six months like who which are your clients really really excited yeah i mean we've landed a lot of uh super interesting clients that uh came on board uh i think uh you know a lot of the fintech uh clients and uh that joined the the you know our our client list and we now enable them to you know both interact with uh uh you know generally speaking with crypto but really starting to venture into the into the defy space um even you know under the regulatory requirements that they have with the stuff that we're doing on the permission defy uh one of the most recent and really exciting projects that we've helped execute is actually with a anz bank from australia that uh i think they announced it last week where they launched the anc stablecoin stablecoin australian dollar um so that's actually the first stable coin that i think is issued by a major bank and the the exciting thing over there is that it's uh it's actually you know supervised by uh by the regulator you know there are things that are you know whether exciting or not exciting depending what side you are but for example one of the use cases that you can now start paying taxes you know with that uh stablecoin which is you know sort of a really know you basically can understand how not only the institutional coming in but really major governments are now starting to look at leveraging this technology for like you know their bread and butter yeah that's that is a brand new use case that i don't think i i've i've heard before is uh tax approved stable coins from a whole entire nation state and as i alluded to before and as we all know the crypto industry moved so quickly and we talked uh six months ago and how how would you gauge the new level of demand that fire blocks has gotten from new clients and is there any difference in theme from these newer clients are they asking for different things than the clients that came before it now that we are into a little bit more of a maturity cycle in in crypto has there been any sort of trend as to what your your newer clients are looking for yeah so i think that uh look fireblocks has always been on the cutting edge right this is what we are continuously trying to push ourselves against so i think our are always our newer newest and most cutting-edge clients they sort of lead the way for the more mass-market clients and uh we have quite a lot of i would say the mass market clients that uh are currently really like a lot of clients that are really doubling down on what i think was the the the the newest and shiniest things uh maybe half a year or a year ago such as you know uh participating in uh in defy uh um landing and boring you know with compound and ave things that about a year ago were actually emerging for the institutional base operating with stable coins uh for payment use cases in terms of uh payments and payouts across payment service providers and banks and so on so you know a year ago it was almost like hard to imagine that institution will actually double down into this i think half a year ago we probably seen the first movers that were looking to adopt this and i think now uh those are almost like you know the mainstream use cases that we are chatting about and enabling uh clients i think that the really cutting edge right now is all the notion around nfts and you know how deep and wide you can go with it uh the areas that i'm most excited about beyond i think the the things that we see you know i think that most of the hype so far was around there sort of um you know art right i think that what we are actually seeing is a lot of use cases around gaming and you know metaverse that uh you know the things over there are amazing um i think uh there is such an amazing product market fit in terms of the applicability of this technology into what's going on over there i also starting to see use cases coming for web2 companies where content is becoming uh i would say tokenized and and and you're able to apply sort of economics and i think those are the emerging use cases that we are doubling down into and also on the payment side i think somewhat over early days but in emerging economies we're actually starting to see almost like you know the holy grail of crypto of pay-ins right that as a as a use user you can basically show up in a point to sell in your grocery store with a non-custodial wallet and you know pay for milk so this is some of the things that we are working on you know which are uh on the you know very cutting edge yeah so when i hear fire blocks my mind always goes to you know an institutional service provider you guys work with banks you guys work with funds uh you guys like make it easier for these big institutions to get into crypto but what i've heard from you just now is that there is a newer cohort of customers that are more like fintech a little bit more on the play to earn gaming side of things a little bit more the uh the creator economy side of things uh how how would you describe just like the the uh spreading out of the of these services that you guys are are working towards you said you got fire blocks is always on the cutting edge right always on the frontier how many new types of customers really are there like what are the different industries yeah i think that it's continuously increasing but i think that just interestingly enough there is a slight misconception around that where we've been positioned uh both traditionally and uh at this point it's true that we are sort of like you know best known for uh servicing some you know some of the folks like bank of new york melon and galaxy and some of the you know the the the marquee accounts uh in the space but uh those probably represent around that i don't know 10 to 20 of our clients today and they probably also represented somewhere between i don't know 20 to 30 of our clown clients a year ago right i think our our our main client base was always somewhat the emerging uh startups the emerging hedge funds the emerging allocators and uh um because th this is really like you know the people that have they have no alternative right those are the people that have to come to us for for for us to enable them to secure their operation because no one else has the flexibility and the infrastructure and unable to move uh as quickly as uh as we do so um that's why we are so intrigued by for example gaming right that it's uh and the metaverse right that uh all the game fight use cases um i think you know we are probably the one of the only providers right now that support running right that is you know one one of the primary blockchains that is used for game five we support nfts on solana we we do all those things that if you if you're serious about what you're doing and you are developing and exploring the cutting edge of this space uh you know we are here to service you one of the uh the tropes that we always hear in this space is the institutions are coming the institutions are coming but michael if you tell me that you guys have uh 2xed your client base over the last six months or so my mind starts to to turn to how the institutions might already be here how does that land with you are the institutions coming or are they already defined institutions right i think that some of the more traditional banks uh if you refer them as institutions i think that they are still coming right some of them are actually you know at the door in the uh in the club or you know sort of like you know making their way in and some of them are still trying to figure out what what they're doing um i think that the more i think that the asset managers i think that uh the um the the hedge funds and other um more i would say aggressive or nimble institutions are already in the game a lot of them um but and i think we might need to basically change the lingo a little bit because we always use institutions right but i think what we are starting to realize is that we should actually just use the word businesses right because um in some way i think it's it was it's been always the thesis around web 3 but i think we're already seeing this happening today when people said 15 15 years ago that every business will be an online business and there was a question of why a coffee shop will be an online business which was i think a legit question back in 2005 or 2008 i think now it's clear why you know coffee shop is an online business right and i think what we're seeing right now is that a lot of those retail businesses a lot of those web 2 businesses they all becoming web 3 businesses or they're contemplating how to do it and i think it's anything from tokenizing their assets to actually taking their treasury and starting using the new rails to be more efficient to you know uh leverage the yields to streamline their processes and i think it's going to propagate well beyond the traditional institutions and i think that honestly it's what will happen over there is that also some of those institutions unfortunately that are still uh are are late to the party they will might be somewhat interme basically disintermediate and and uh one of the other things that has been very very relevant over the last six months or so is this uh regulatory conversation so many businesses are paying attention to crypto and that's made the regulators start to pay attention to crypto how has fire blocks adapted or changed or just like navigated this very very um relevant and and increasing steam of a conversation when it comes to regulation are you is it a concern for you guys or is it more concern for your customers or just what's how are you guys thinking about this growing attention towards regulation we view this as mostly as an opportunity to be honest i'm not going to disregard the fact that there are concerns but i think that the biggest concern is actually lack of clarity okay the second biggest con basically that's i think uh priority one right to make sure that there is clarity priority two is really to make sure that the regulation is aligned with with the technology right which i think that in many cases uh there is uh a discrepancy uh between uh you know when when regulators are forced to move fast and then they sort of default into what is uh already known to them or basically their best practices from the old world and then we're getting some very weird uh you know uh regulations uh but i think that the journey speaking i actually view this uh in general as an opportunity um for multiple reasons uh the first one we are engaged with a lot of regulators across the board uh and across the the world and uh we are putting a lot of effort into both expanding the regulators what we do and we and you know how our clients are using us and what this technology is so we're putting a lot of effort into education that's first and foremost the second thing is that we're really trying to think through what or how we can leverage this new technology not only to comply with what's important for the regulators because i think we can all appreciate that anti-basically like money laundering you know terrorist financing um consumer protection all those things are are bad things that i honestly don't want to see them in an ecosystem that i'm active and i'm enabling right now the main question is how do we actually taking the technology and we're basically improving on that to give better protection for for people that are more seamless and are much more intuitive and i think that um blockchain and digital assets are actually have properties which will allow us to develop a more resilient world right this is basically the promise that i have and i think that we've done some of the work around the you know avi arc recently and some other projects that we are currently involved in around the around the identity and unchained kyc and and things of that sort that give give me a lot of confidence that you know in the next 12 or 18 months not only that we will be able to create a better wall world so to speak but also a world that will still already have some mvp uh proof points within regulatory sandboxes so firebox is a base in new york so you guys obviously have to adhere to u.s regulation but you said you recently just mentioned that you onboarded a an australian bank and australia has a different set of regulations and from what i hear regulations are a lot more friendly in australia how does it work when a u.s domiciled uh custodian like fire blocks works with like an australian bank uh how do you guys manage like the the multiple layers of compliance and regulatory because because it's two different states and do you guys are there like uh nation states that you guys like really prefer to work with just because it's easier just like first clarification is that firebox is not a custodian we're we're a custody technology provider right so um we we we are ourself right for the 99 of our business are not required to be regulated and our clients need to be uh our clients under you know specifically depends on what they do right they might need to be regulated having said that it's clear that we whether it's uh whether the regulator need to be aware of what we are doing and how we're providing the technology to make sure that the funds and the operations and the you know compliance and all that kind of stuff for secure or uh [Applause] or specifically the way that the language around custody and that jurisdiction is is is uh drafted uh we need that to be you know sort of consistent um there are jurisdictions well let's start from the from the end right i think the us i don't think it's a secret right that the us is probably most behind at the moment right um and unfortunately this is because uh i think that there are a lot of different regulators i think that a lot almost like you know every serious institution will be regulated by multiple entities and so on right and i think that also uh there are political reasons why things are moved somewhat slower there are jurisdictions uh for example singapore switzerland germany you know australia is on the path of uh executing that that i think there is a much better clarity over there i think each one of them has their pros and cons in terms of uh the frameworks that they provided but uh we definitely see uh more traction and more openness to do business and go and and sort of like for businesses to to transform and innovate when there is a regulatory clarity so we were just talking about regulation but also fire blocks really allows so many companies to get their hooks into defy get that sweet defy yield but you guys are also onboarding gaming and nft companies and when it comes to the permissionless conference those are basically the three tracks of content that we have to talk about at permissionless we have the institution and regulatory we have the uh the metaverse for for gaming and nfts and we also have defy and fire blocks is just so relevant to all three of these tracks so it's very very obvious why uh i'm very excited to hear what you have to say when it comes to the permissionless conference michael and so first question about uh permissionless is just are you excited for permission i think it's the conference that i'm most excited about uh you know i think uh sort of uh as you said it's like it's it's the uh you know epicenter of everything that we do in in one place and uh you know that build on built built upon the foundations of uh you know the previous conferences that were uh that were awesome um and we're really looking forward to you know interact with the thought leaders in the space and all the you know folks that are coming to innovate and build the future um and we are excited to to basically meet them in a conference we're also looking for a lot of new talent that uh we hope to interact with and you know potentially see if they can come and join us what kind of talent if somebody's looking to get a job in crypto and maybe they have their eyes on fire blocks specifically what kind of talent are you looking yeah i mean our uh you know what we are mostly looking for is uh you know areas are mostly areas in go in the go-to-market domain so whether it's marketing business development uh sales that's like one area we're also looking for people that will join our compliance teams support teams uh customer success teams so more technical people in general and and also clearly awesome product managers that you know potentially have financial experience and they are excited to learn and and sort of unders you know sort of make their jump now and uh sort of join the the future and sort of apply all the things that and all the expertise that they have from traditional finance and to move over to you know i think the next what will be important in the next 30 to 50 years well fire blocks recently raised 550 million dollars congratulations on that michael and so you guys have a massive war chest so i would imagine there's a bunch of uh opportunities and jobs for the ambitious and the hungry people who helped to want to build out the world of web 3 with fire blocks uh when it comes to just business development and business connections and and finding other clients who are you looking for to connect with a permission list so i think uh first and foremost i think uh you know the ins the financial institutions that are coming in to uh understand whether you know whether it's uh those are new institutions those are new uh businesses or institutions that were set up or more of the traditional or fintech institutions that are coming in to learn more around what this opportunity uh is and how they're going to interact with the defy space uh but uh more importantly we are making a lot of push into use cases around gaming and nfts so really interact with the innovators over there i think every time that we every time we meet a company that is doing something in that space we learn something new i think that also for a lot of those companies because a lot of the talent that is sort of being funneled into the space they are not always crypto native right and where we can help them is to understand how to reduce the friction how to play in the ecosystem how to connect to to other players understand them explain to them where uh where they can find the resources that would just make their journey and execution uh more streamlined and make just make them successful so i'm really looking forward to interacting with all the i'd say people that are innovating and building the exciting stuff that uh hopefully we'll be discussing uh together and uh half a year from now certainly and michael you're no stranger to conferences i think you've been to your fair share of conferences do you have any advice for uh uh people who work for companies that are going to permissionless or people that perhaps have never been to a crypto conference before what what piece of advice would you leave listed i think just uh you know be the conference interact with people you know ask questions uh make sure you meet a lot of people and ask them about what they do and uh and and uh what like and what do they uh envision the the future is going to look like and just generally speaking you know enjoy the event uh and the you know and the parties and everything that those conferences uh have to offer well there is just a few months left to the permissionless conference so michael i look forward to chatting with you there as well and uh thank you for coming on and uh sharing your your thoughts on this road permission thanks so much david you know i'm looking forward to
