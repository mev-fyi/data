is Spotify rolling out token support what we are looking at is sign in with a wallet inside a Spotify mobile experience wow once you connect your wallet apparently it changes the behavior of spotify and unlocks certain experiences token gated access to music content so Spotify that's awesome for Android users only maybe it's not going to be available for Apple they want to do their 30 tax on all nft transactions these sort of stupid gatekeeping just cannot stand because a competitor will just be like fine if you want to charge we'll just support Android and then maybe I'll get rid of my iPhone
