[Music] hello everyone welcome to overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley today on the show we are talking about rumble kong that is the project we are highlighting this week face fight 58 we're gonna talk about why we're talking about corporations in the metaverse of course the big big news is that artifact has been acquired by nike uh pepsi also launched an nft let's talk about the reactions to all of that also i have to touch on melania trump launching not just an nft but an nft platform on solana just a couple words to be said on that and i want to end this episode with something i really haven't done before which is i don't know i'll call it an alpha alert i am a part of a project that i think is really really awesome and it's still super early and i want to highlight it to folks so you can do your own research and look into it for yourself to decide if you think it's worth anything if you think it's interesting i hope you do i certainly do uh but that's at the end of the show xerion is the perfect place to view the entirety of your crypto portfolio all in one spot not only does xerion aggregate all the tokens across all of your wallets but it also displays the nfts that you've been

supercharge your defy experience and enrich your nft lifestyle that's z e r i o n slash bankless everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infiniti decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy five hundred dollars of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse so kicking it off project that i want to highlight this week is rumble kongs as i said i was really excited to see that this project popped this week because i had marcus blacia who it's becoming a running joke at this point i cannot pronounce his last name even though he told me how to pronounce it when he was on the show he was on the show last week two weeks ago he is the director of marketing for the sandbox and he is also a co-founder of rumble kong's the project that's seeing this spike this week so why is the project doing so well first of all what the project is is a 3v3 basketball game where the avatars that you play with in this game are nfts and they are apes kongs they're called and they're looking to launch a game in 2022 play to earn model they have steph curry and paul george have wrecked rumble kong league merch before when we talked to marcus he said no he did not pay them to do that that was an organic thing that happened because the players happened to support the the game but the thing that made them pump this week was the news that they had raised four and a half million dollars to fund their project moving forward uh the the big name investors in on this you had caa sports caa creative artist agencies one of the biggest agencies in the world honestly for talent so caa sports is in audio collab is in animoca brands is in and amoka brands you may know as a parent company to the sandbox and a mocha has invested in axiomfinity they've invested in dapper labs they're major and the thing that i thought was so interesting about this announcement especially given some of the later news that we're going to talk about here today was the team seemed to really emphasize that this was not an acquisition and specifically in their announcement about this investment the team wrote quote this is not an acquisition we are not selling our souls to corporations and we will continue to develop the greatest project in the web 3 space and bring sports to web 3. so they they really want to emphasize this is again an investment and that presumably these investors are getting their money paid back at some point but that the the project is still controlled and uh owned so to speak by the founders and really by extension the community because that's obviously such a big emphasis in this space so uh if you're a rumble kong holder it sounds like nothing is going to change in your day-to-day they really highlighted that this money was gonna be used for three things they said they're looking to expand the rumble kong universe they said their ambitions have gotten bigger and bigger as this project has gone on so they're thinking beyond just a game they're thinking streetwear and you know all sorts of other kinds of merch and and things they can do to make this intellectual property that's that's beyond just a game something that's interesting about that to me is sort of an inverse of what you maybe usually hear when these projects have road maps so many projects launch and they're like and then we're gonna do merch and then like somewhere down the line in the far distant future we're gonna make a game this is is the inverse of that they came out saying they were a game first and then have sort of backed into streetwear so money's being used to help expand the universe they they have said don't worry the game is our first priority we want to make sure we see that through properly they say they're going to launch next year with a game they are looking to use the money to expand the team presumably to make this rest of the expansion of the universe possible and really they said hey we're using this money because it helps open doors for us and gets us in front of industry titans they seemed to allude to the fact that the the that they could have raised money from a lot of different people and that the investors they chose to bring on they chose intentionally because they were folks who had the right connections for them could open the right doors for them i think that's the way to do it if you're gonna raise money make sure that if you're a hot hot item that is right if you're in a hot space like web 3 and you're a hot project and you're choosing to raise money that you're bringing on investors that can provide more than just the money but who can provide the experience the advice the networks whatever you need and that seems to be the approach here so i'm very friendly to rumble kongs i don't know enough about the project i'm not a holder of it but i i really liked marcus he was a great person to talk to and um just really professional in all of our in all of our conversations so go marcus go rumble kongs that's some big news of the week but the really big news of the week of course is the fact that artifact is getting acquired by nike this is huge news there seem to be two reactions to this news and they go something like this the first reaction is holy this is obviously a huge deal this is a the next level of a web 3 company getting recognized the fact that you have nike one of the biggest most visible brands in the world not just investing in not just collaborating with but literally acquiring a pretty new company in the scheme of things and buying them outright and and also referring to them as a brand they kept saying hey we're buying the brand artifact so they're they're really looking i mean they bought converse i think they bought eddie bauer right like nike has bought big high value brands in the past and now it seems like they're basically putting artifact in that category that's a huge deal it's a huge win for the space so that's the first reaction the second reaction is some version of  corporations  this  you and your engagement in our uh scrappy space where we're all friends we don't trust you we don't want you here apologies if you have kids nearby i should give you the the cursing warning uh you know and i think the the reality is probably we should feel somewhere in between these two i'm personally really excited about this but on the screw corporation's front two tweets to highlight uh betty nft we've talked to her on the podcast before she's the co-founder of the dead fellas project her tweet on this was it would have been cooler to see nike collaborate rather than consume but i'll reserve judgment until things unfold and i'm open to being wrong so would have preferred to see nike do some sort of partnership sort of what we saw with adidas partnering with board apes for example as opposed to just coming in and buying them outright but uh she's open to being wrong and seeing that nike is doing something beautiful and meaningful with artifact the comments in that tweet were very like yeah screw this nike's immoral again kind of get out of our beautiful web3 space with your corporate greed whatever um other tweet this is from janie musings jamie co-hosts a podcast called two board apes with zeneca 33 who i've had on the podcast this is just a show full of connections to people we've had on the pod so far jamie musings tweeted how long before nike tries to say 10ktf shop can't do what they're doing because they have some patent that's being infringed so 10 ktf is also a sneaker designer they do backpacks it's like accessories for the metaverse and has that similar streetwear vibe and two artifact so uh again expressing some hesitation around how good it is that a big brand like nike super multinational corporation is now entering the space and buying up what was sort of a i don't know indie player i say that not in the sense that they were they were a big presence in web 3 but obviously we're sort of like the the cool outsiders here in web 3 or that's how we like to think of ourselves um a couple notes on artifact you know i think it's not a surprise that they got pegged for an acquisition from the standpoint that they are major players in their space and the team has been at the forefront of culture for a while now um chris lee who is one of the co-founders he worked with anderson pack and nas and rick ross and like rappers back in the day in various capacities he then moved on and started designing skins for video games he did skins for counter-strike i actually was listening to an interview with him earlier this week where where he had a good quote he said if you want to understand nfts get into skins and counter-strike or get skins and counter-strike basically you know making the case that many of us have made or not not me because i'm not into gaming but i've heard many people make which is of course that skins and things like fortnite and fortnite and these other games are really the best way to get an introduction to digital ownership and why it matters and just to finish chris lee's journey he basically went from he designed skins and counter-strike and i guess was doing very well at that and then he decided to put one of those skins onto a sneaker and it like went crazy on instagram people loved it and so that that is sort of a short explanation of the journey to artifact and to this to creating especially digital sneakers which i know much of the outside world looks at that and it's like what the heck why is this worth anything some notable moments they did a drop with fuocious the nft artist very popular nft artist earlier this year they did a collab with fiocious where design and art was put onto the sneaker that drop did about 3.1 million in sales which is crazy and of course important to note that along with the digital sneakers if you own the digital sneakers there are opportunities to actually get physical irl sneakers as well so this is not a digital only play really it's it's it's big news it's a big deal for the space it's a big win it puts headlines about the metaverse and about digital goods into headlines around the world sort of like the 69 million dollar beeple sale did so you're gonna have plenty of people from the mainstream confused about it but it's just another drop in the bucket of of this becoming the mainstream honestly okay the second corporate entrance into nfts this week that i want to highlight into the metaverse this week that i want to highlight is pepsi pepsi launched their nft it's called the mic drop genesis pepsi launch something like that it's the mic drop launch it's actually in partnership with vayner nft which is gary vaynerchuk's nft business and i happened to talk to avery akanani the president of vayner nft this morning we did an interview together that interview will be airing next week but she mentioned the the pepsi project she said that a lot of brands that they're working with right now the smart brands at least which if they're working with vayner of course and she thinks they're smart is to just learn this space and that pepsi's intention she mentioned they have an upcoming launch with coach the intention of these brands at this point is really just to learn it's not to make a bunch of money out the gate i think that's a misconception in my opinion of the nft space in general is we think that everyone who enters it just wants to get rich fast because i think there are a lot of people who enter it who do just want to get rich fast but it it sounds like a lot of these businesses a lot of these brands that are getting into this space right now they're not looking to make money on their jobs they're just trying to learn it learn nfts so that they can have they can build a long-term strategy for this so she said pepsi has a long history of doing music activations and working with musical artists and they that's really a been a focus for that brand so they're celebrating that with this music drop so certainly that they will want to they'll want to monetize nfts in the future but for now these nfts are free you just pay gas fees for them it was actually very funny to see on the pepsi the pepsi tweet announcement about this project they're like it's free plus gas they have a little part of their website that explains like how you buy eath and ethereum and the comments in the pepsi tweet just being like what are these words what are you talking about again the mainstream encountering this web 3 world and just being like what the f is going on uh they're launching 1893 nfts they said that's because 1893 is the year that pepsi was born and the process for this drop was they launched a white list that folks had to sign up for i think it was december 10th and then the project itself dropped december 14th so uh 1900 or so nfts we'll see what happens with those nfts over time again this is pepsi according to avery and any this is pepsi's attempt to start to understand this space much better so that in the future they can have a more robust nft program that they build out i will say last thing that was funny about the the twitter thread when pepsi announced this and and this ties into this you know negative feeling that many of us have about corporations entering this space meta as in facebook right the meta twitter account replied to pepsi and said uh this is going to look great in the metaverse like i don't know i guess the pepsi nfts and it does just have that like ultra cringe factor of like when your parents first got on facebook and they were commenting on your pictures or like commenting to each other or the first time you saw your parents like interact on facebook and you're just like oh god like boomers it didn't feel a little bit that way to have meta you know have facebook basically like being like this is gonna look so great in the metaverse pepsi and it's like these giant corporations who are entering the space there's a little bit of the cringe factor it was also funny uh but hey it's a sign that we are making it so i will take it on juno is your new

partnered with larval labs to create more metaverse friendly renderings of me bits which is awesome we are also partnered with a sundance award-winning filmmaker to build the first dow that will own a feature-length documentary film we have a ton of cool projects down the pipeline and are really looking for cool people to partner with on this so go to blockblock.io to subscribe to our newsletter and be kept up to date about what we have going on and also to check out open roles we have available we'd love to have you apply come work with me coming out blockblock.io okay the last it's not corporate but the last sort of the outside world joining the inside world moment that i have to call out is of course melania trump has announced she is launching like i said at the beginning not just an nft series but an nft platform via melania trump.com actually a fairly beautiful website i'll give her that and look there's a lot of jokes being made about this because it's kind of hilarious i don't know it does just seem so funny there's been some misconceptions floating around people were saying that she's taking a hundred percent of all secondary sale royalties that's not true it was a misreading of the solana contract she's taking a 10 royalty on them people were making fun of the fact that in the announcement it says that a portion of the proceeds from the sale will go to foster children and will go to her i guess be best is the program she started when she was in the white house to help foster kids and and support children in general and then uh and so people were sort of like a portion of the proceeds like why isn't why aren't all the proceeds going there etc etc agreed with that the funniest thing to me maybe this is just mean but you know it is what it is is the first nft they're dropping is i guess they worked with some watercolor painter some awesome artist whatever great but the the painting is basically of melania's eyes and it's called like cobalt it talked about her cobalt eyes or something and to me if you're doing a charity project to have the artwork be of your own eyes oh god it's just the most like trump thing ever right like just so just so narcissistic and cringy to me i will say i am currently working with a pretty famous politician who's looking to do a charitable nft drop and we had joked about like how embarrassing or funny it would be if we had used likenesses of this politician as part of this as like the artwork for this drop we were like oh yeah how cringy and embarrassing would that be and then of course you have melania trump come out and do essentially that so that is honestly what stood out to me about the melania trump drop but again all of these things are just proof points that this space honestly is still early i will say one thing on the on the this space is early it's a point that i made i think in the interview i did this week with frank but just because you are early in a space doesn't necessarily mean that all valuations are low i think we sometimes use the that the term we are early sort of interchangeably with prices will go up and i think in some cases that's really true actually in the case of something that i'm going to talk about right after this but i don't think it's universally true that uh that prices are low simply because we're early i think there's a lot of hype in this space and some of the growth is very much being priced in but we are early obviously in terms of most of the world has not caught up to what's happening in this space at all and eventually they will and nike pepsi melania trump all jumping into this space is just an indication that we are on the right track in terms of this being a fledgling and um just incredibly impactful space i don't need to tell any of you all that we all get it but emphasizing it of course okay i really want to talk about matter m x t t e r and i debated significantly right i seriously debated whether or not to talk about this because it is a project that has been launched by blockblock the startup where i'm chief of staff and i've always wanted to be very intentional about not having conflicts of interest where it ever feels like i'm just shilling a project for block block on this podcast for the sake of it but the reality is i really i think this project is awesome and i think there's a lot that's worth highlighting about it and it felt just as wrong to not talk about it simply because it's blockbox project as it would be to talk about it because it's blockbox project if i didn't believe in it so i want to talk a little bit about this i've talked about it on twitter a bit so some of you may be familiar with it but i wanted to go deeper into what matter is so i have described matter as art blocks meets nouns dao kai turner who's co-founder at block block and who's really the one spearheading this project i think sometimes cringes at that explanation but i do think it's a helpful way to orient ourselves as to what this project is matter is a generative art platform so art blocks obviously being the most well-known generative art platform but unlike art blocks where the artists who make it onto the platform really need to be coders as well and they need to have coded an algorithm that generates art for them essentially i'm probably not getting that precisely correct matter allows artists to work in a much more natural artist way yet still create generative art so what i mean by that specifically is that artists digital artists will often work in photoshop and they work in layers and what this allows an artist to do is to create many layers of their work and then feed that into this algorithm that will then create generative art out of those layers as opposed to the artists themselves having to code the art output so much more artist centric and artist friendly in terms of the way that the generative art is created and that was super important to kai that's really what we put front and center as we talk about matter is the is the artist centricity of the whole project i want to talk about generative art because i think that's the piece that makes me so excited about this project honestly but before i get to generative art i'll just explain a little bit this second piece which is the noun style comparison so many of you are probably familiar with nouns doubt but the premise of nouns doubt is that generative art there's a new piece of art that is released every day there's one per day and there will be one per day from now until the rest of time and i think it's like every fifth piece or or at some inter interval the art piece that is created gets put into the nouns dow treasury anybody who buys a piece of artwork through nouns dao is part of the dao right and now is a voting participant in the dao and and so there's this dao component with this generative art component and what we're doing is the artists that come through matter again mxtter the artists that come through matter it's a similar mechanism in that for 14 days one piece of their generative art is released per day and then on day 15 there's a lot there's an auction with you know many more pieces of art there's like a public auction sale that happens um with several pieces of art all at once and the proceeds from the sale of the art whether it be during that 14-day period where one piece is being released a day or that 15th day where you have many pieces being released the proceeds from that in part go to fund a dow so you also get well if you buy a piece of the artwork you get to be a member of the dow and then there's treasury being built up in the dow from the sale of these works the artists also get you know the bulk of the the proceeds from the sale of the works and the dao's mission is really around supporting artists supporting up and coming artists obviously the members of the dao will have a will have the say in terms of how that looks and and how it's shaped but the goal there is that you have this treasury now to buy up more art from artists that you want to highlight and support etc so this i don't know call it social justice component this component of supporting artists was really really critical to kai who feels very strongly about bringing in new voices into the art community and supporting artists so kai turner he's the architect of this whole idea he himself is an art blocked artist so he's been friends with eric calderon who goes by snow fro who's the creator of art blocks and so he was on art blocks early on as an artist and this was really born out of seeing i guess you could call it a gap in the market and he's put together as kai always does i've mentioned him before in this podcast something really thoughtful and something really beautiful the reason i am really bullish on this whole concept is first of all i happen to love the art that has been coming out of this first drop we're doing so the the first two pieces have now gone live it's been a collaborative drop with uh gare from crypto geisha and mendez mendez an artist out of spain and the two have worked together to put their layers through this essentially algorithm together and create these artworks that are i think really really cool but i'm also just incredibly bullish on generative art period and i wanted to give some some numbers on this i think the the art market has boomed over the last x number of years contemporary art has been a great investment if you've been investing in it over the last number of years the reason for this is the reason that we've seen nfts boom it's the reason we see a number of asset classes boom and it's really a story about income inequality right which is that you have a certain fraction of the population who is getting wealthier and wealthier to the point that they don't even know what to do with their wealth and so they have to find alternative investments to put their capital and art is a great intern alternative investment to many people it's a better story than just talking about the stock you bought and it's also less subject to the whims of inflation so if you are worried about all the money printing that's happening in the government art feels like potentially a smart investment it has an international audience it's it's at least a way to diversify out of simply the stock market and and other more traditional investments so the art asset art as an asset class has done very very well contemporary art as an asset class has done very very well but digital art is still a really small percentage of the overall art market and i don't believe that that will always be the case i think digital art will increasingly become a very dominant portion of the total art market i don't know what that time frame will look like but it feels like an inevitability to me so to give a couple of numbers i think nfts and digital art generally uh comprised about 12 of contemporary art sales in the first half of 2021 i think that that may have gone up a little bit in the second half uh certainly we saw some huge massive nft sales in the second half and 12 is a decent number right considering that digital art has historically been sort of a non-existent factor in the art market but it's still really small if you believe that digital art will someday be probably half if not more than half of the overall art market as i happen to believe because it just makes sense given the way the world is moving the other thing is nfts made up about five percent of contemporary art sales at major auction houses this year which again if you're an nft skeptic like much of the world that sounds maybe too high i think that number will go much much higher as again digital art which really requires the blockchain and requires the proof of ownership that nfts bring just become a part of our everyday lives and the nuniverse becomes a bigger part of our lives so investing in digital art to me makes a lot of sense now we've obviously some seen some pfp projects managed to make it into these auction houses your board apes etc but i think that you'll ultimately land in a place where a lot of the art that's really that asset class art that's making it into auction houses etc that like art investors are interested in is by i hate to say it like this because it sounds dismissive but by real artists and so and i think generative art is this burgeoning sort of field though it's been around for a while within the digital art within the nft art space so i think there's a lot of room for generative art to grow in terms of the overall percentage of the art market and i think you know i talked earlier about are we early and i think are we early is really a question of when you look at prices it's how much more room for growth is there in a particular space right i don't know how much how much room for growth there is within the pfp market maybe some and you know we'll see how it all plays out but in the art market i think definitively so so matter is exciting to me because i think a i think it's a brilliant new take on a generative art platform allowing it to to function in a way that's very convenient for artists and very natural for artists i think the art it's generating is sick and it has a really awesome community component in the form of this dao in the form of paying it forward to future artists and other artists and it just feels like it has all the ingredients it needs to be a really amazing platform and product and i'm so grateful to get to be a part of the team doing it i will say like i've had very little influence over this project i've done a couple things on it with the team but i've mostly been focused on other other things so i have no like personal investment really in it other than wanting to see block block do well and i really think it's worth checking out it's matter.rtmxtter.art you can go check out the first couple of pieces that have gone up for auction the public sale it's all public like you can bid on it now but the the bigger sale will be going live on december 29th where there's more art up all at once and let me know what you think if you check it out and like do you agree with my assessment are you an art connoisseur who's like oh you've got it all wrong carly let me know would love to engage with some folks on twitter about this because it is something that's cool for me nfts are now getting me into art in a way that i never was historically and i'm excited to see what comes out of it and i really want to track the generative art space in particular so thank you as always to everyone who listens if you enjoy this podcast please give it a rating and a review on apple podcasts
