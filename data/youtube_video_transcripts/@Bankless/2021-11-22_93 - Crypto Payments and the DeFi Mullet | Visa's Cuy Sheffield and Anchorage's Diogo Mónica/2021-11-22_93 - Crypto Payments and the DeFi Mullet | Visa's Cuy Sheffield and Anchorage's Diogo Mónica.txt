[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david all about the d5 mullet today we had kai sheffield we had diogo monica from visa and anchorage respectively and they know what they're talking about with respect to fintech and payments they are from the companies that work with all of the companies in these fields uh what a fantastic discussion we had i really liked the uh this the back and forth that kai and diogo had their their dynamic between them as guests was phenomenal and i think that actually lends itself to the dynamic between their companies right there's a lot of back and forth between visa and anchorage one really isn't complete without the other visa is this gargantuan payments network whereas anchorage does all the custody for all the things being transacted so together they really illustrate a very complete picture of what it looks like to do payments to do custody in the fintech world and really have a very deep understanding of the problem set that exists with tradfi integrating crypto and crypto payments and how to solve and route around those problems and really create a new payments paradigm that's based off of these new global payment rails yeah you know one of the themes from the conversation was um diego was talking about this fork in the world in in the road where previously crypto has been thought of as mainly a retail sort of phenomenon and retail use cases and that has changed it's it's now not just retail now there's a massive business to business side of things that uh is being tapped into and like the value proposition of crypto within the fintech and payments industry is now we're talking 2021 is now self-evident so it's no longer the the champion internally who's struggling to help his or her organization understand crypto now they all get it and so this episode may be incredibly bullish on the next steps that fintech is going to take in crypto we already knew coming into this david that the the exchanges of the world the crypto banks as we call them were becoming a bit more like fintech and now we're very clearly seeing and i think this podcast illustrates how fintech is coming closer to crypto as well um yeah it's just a really fascinating discussion that was a key takeaway to me and another cool takeaway to me was actually having kai explain how visa payments work okay so like when you go and you buy your starbucks coffee right what's actually happening in the background and if you buy it in europe how are the banks interacting and how does visa sit on top of that and where is payment actually settled and we i think we have made some cool analogies between how that world works in the traditional world to how crypto works that um have really helped me understand things so that was cool as well yeah such a fantastic learning lesson right then and one of the mental models i have for this space is that like bitcoin ethereum crypto at large it's like a mined virus right it's got its tentacles going everywhere and the more tentacles it has the more it can grab and pull itself in and what is visa other than something with the most integrations the most bridges to almost everything in the world and it's it's a huge milestone for visa to successfully integrate to payment rails on crypto and bridge them to the entire rest of the world uh and so like this this growing leviathan that is crypto is really like now reaching inside of visa to access visa's network to grow to the rest of the world which you know just makes me bullish makes me bullish absolutely and i think we're going to talk about this more in the debrief because one of the themes i want to talk to you about david is something i was struck with is oh my god this is so inevitable now you get these major fintechs and institutions on board visas on board okay we're people concerned about regulation okay these guys these institutions aren't going to let regulation happen in a negative way for their investments they see the value proposition that they could bring so if you guys want to tune into that full conversation that dave and i are about to have stay tuned for the debrief that is available for premium members and you could subscribe there's a link in your show notes with that i think we should get to the interview but before we do we want to thank the sponsors

governance bankless nation we are super excited about this episode what is fintech doing in crypto that is the question today it's a thread we've talked a lot about at bankless but i feel like we haven't pulled on quite enough well today we're doing that what are the squares the stripes the paypals the visas doing it seems like they've woken up to crypto here recently they've got hundreds of millions of customers they perfected many things user acquisition user experience so what are their plans we got to figure that out we have kai sheffield who's the head of crypto at visa of course you know visa they issue those plastic cards you carry around with you in your pocket kai is one of the biggest crypto champions i know certainly the biggest in visa we also have diogo monica who is the co-founder and president of anchorage digital anchorage it's kind of a bridge between the fintechs i was just talking about in large institutions they do crypto custody they do d5 stuff everything that the fintechs can't do currently gentlemen it's great to have you welcome to bankless great to be here thank you so much for having me well fantastic let's start here you know david and i uh have a thesis that we we talk about a lot at bankless and this came about like a year ago from a blog post uh i wrote in the bankless newsletter this is called the d5 mullet thesis guys all right and i want rona want to run this by uh by you guys so last year at about this time we started noticing that many of the the fintechs were playing a lot in the crypto space starting to talk uh much more about crypto you know the stripes the robin hoods the plaids the ants the the squares our comment at the time was like fintech is kind of user experience but it's still almost like lipstick on a pig and the pig is the banking system right the fax machines and the the old legacy pro payment processing system that underlies this thing and what we observed last year is what's really interesting is the top five apps fintech apps at the time um they were all like supporting crypto right uh the banks were below them but the top apps all supporting crypto fintech apps uh were um you know we're doing the crypto thing and so we came up with this this concept this thesis as we call it which is what we call the d5 mullet thesis okay so this is fintech in the front you got the bank in the front everything looks nice in the front but the parties in the back right you have d5 in the back and our thesis at the time and still is and i think it's played out over the last year a bit more is that this is how the fintechs would come to crypto they would sort of perfect the user acquisition but they would slowly start to replace that old legacy crusty banking payments layer with crypto okay so i want to ask both of you because i feel like uh you know you have the front row ccr you would know better than us what's actually going on what are your thoughts on the d5 mullet thesis are you believers kai why don't we start with you sure so i i'm definitely a believer in the mullet thesis and i'm a proud uh mullet you know myself uh so i i see i think you kind of have to start with what's been happening with crypto companies where i think many years ago crypto companies weren't really a part of the the fintech conversation it was kind of seen as this separate thing you had these crypto wallets and exchanges you know they weren't really considered you know fintechs uh in the popular sense and then these companies you know the exchanges like coinbase and ftx and others were growing rapidly and they were acquiring customers you know they were getting billions of dollars of assets on their platforms and you know they started to get pretty ambitious and look to expand and to get into payments themselves and so that's what we really saw first was when we set up our crypto product team in 2019 it was because we recognized that crypto exchanges and wallets had the potential to become major players in the fintech and payment ecosystem and they were looking to start to build products like debit cards and credit cards and giving more traditional fintech and payment features to the core you know customer bases that they had acquired and that they had a ton of engagement uh and activity on their platforms and so we started working very closely you know with these crypto wallets helping with fiat on-ramps and fiat off-ramps and kind of giving them a path and a bridge to start to look more like you know crypto native neo banks and i think that was really the first piece that you know crypto companies were coming more into fintech and banking and then you had you know neo banks and traditional fintechs you know recognizing the success that crypto companies were having you know with their core crypto features and saying wait a minute shouldn't we be incorporating crypto into our core products and so we think these two worlds are going to continue to intersect more and more oh i totally agree with that by the way and that's something we've been saying for a long time in fact like uh two two and a half years ago on bank list we started calling what everyone used to call an exchange a crypto bank all right we used this you know this small lowercase b for crypto bank but we started to recognize that hey it's not just about trading that's what an exchange does but these crypto banks the coinbases and geminis and binances and ftx's of the world they're going to move into all of the other money verbs including one money verb i know you guys are interested kai which is which is payments let me ask you a question before we get to uh diogo's take on this um do you and does visa sort of see that as an opportunity or a threat with the crypto banks you know becoming more like fintech and and um entering into say the payment scene how do you guys view that we think it's a tremendous opportunity and i think really the the challenge that that we see and that i think a lot of crypto companies have recognized is we're a long way from direct merchant acceptance of transactions over public blockchain networks and there are a lot of challenges for them to do that you know particularly in in the brick and mortar you know merchant ecosystem we know how difficult it is to get merchants to add new acceptance points at the point of sale and then to get consumers to change behavior where you're used to buying coffee you know tapping uh your phone with apple pay and now you know you're supposed to scan a qr code which is not particularly in the u.s not really a form factor that most customers are familiar with plus you have the challenge that crypto is increasingly becoming fragmented in multi-protocol and so if you have many different blockchains and now you have many different second layers just this idea of accepting crypto what does it mean for a merchant you know what's let's say you want to accept usdc are you going to accept uscc on ethereum on solana on stellar on algorand on arbitrary like how do you have the right qr code the right acceptance point do i have to tell the merchant which network i want to pay with usdc over and they have to give me the right qr code for it we think it's going to be a long time before most merchants have the capability and most consumers are changing behavior to the point where they would want to transact directly and so the value that visa provides is you can have the same familiar experience of tapping to pay with a visa credential whether virtual or physical that works at 70 million merchants across the world you don't have to ask the merchant do you accept crypto do you accept this network and have to go through extra steps it just works and now you can have that credential pull from a balance of a stable coin from a balance of a crypto asset and so it gives you access to liquidity of the assets that you have but without a merchant having to change a single thing and so we think for the next several years we're going to see most major crypto wallets start to bring to market you know crypto linked debit and credit card products that consumers are really excited about and are starting to use them and use them at scale and we think that's a huge opportunity of for growth in our business so a tremendous opportunity for kai that visa sees in the uh the d5 mullet uh what about you diogo so you've got a broader aperture you're not just looking at visa but you're working with a lot of these fintechs and institutions at anchorage are you a believer in the d5 mullet thesis and do you see it how do you see it playing out with other fintechs i definitely believe earn the d5 mullet love the analogy i will also point out that if there are pictures of kai with the mullet i would love to see them actually that can be arranged sir we can make these please kai is such a believer that at some point in his life he must have supported one and so i really want to see those that's the mental model that i have throughout this whole conversation is kai with the mullet so without that let's just uh you know i i generally believe that the d5 mullet works because what's happening is is the following it is for these fintechs when when when the first win for the fintechs is that regardless of the crypto products themselves when you add crypto as a feature to your platform folks like square have figured out that it increases engagement in all of the other products that they have built into the product so that is the first one you just by adding crypto and by adding a feature you increase engagement and if you have loops strong network effects or strong loops every single user that comes to participate in this feature stays for the network so that is extremely important in the first one the second win is a square cache is proven and love to see that they're constantly still to this day and presses me every time they're on the app store number one on the on the finance section you know makes me particularly proud but it's really interesting that square's proven that they can make a lot of money with this and that there's high revenue potential of adding crypto products and obviously trading and offering crypto services to consumers so that's the second one the first one is obviously engagement and current products second when is revenue and the last one is public publicly traded companies companies are on the market there's definitely a recognition of the market that is valuable for them for them to be innovative and for them to actually be on the bleeding edge so the same way that when you add blockchain to your name your stock rises adding a crypto strategy that is legitimate not just lip service also increases the market cap of the company so think about this when when when what is on the other side of the balance on the other side of the balance it's just been that it is different it is weird for the majority of these large players and people believe that there was some regulatory risk or some risks of them actually adding this to their platforms and that is proven not to be the case over and over and over again especially as companies start becoming regulated you know anchorage is the first and only federally chartered crypto bank so there is a bank that can actually do custody can do staking can do governance of all these default protocols that is just the clarity that these institutions need and so now that we have removed the potential downside it really is just when when and thus every single fintech will go down this path and the ones that don't will just find themselves losing do you know diogo i think we're starting to observe this in real time david and i we do a weekly show we call the roll up which is like a rundown of things happening in crypto and we were just observing the the paypal earnings report that just came out with their quarterly earnings you know uh 13 revenue growth something like this and all they could talk about was crypto okay like it's just like uh you know what else would the fintechs talk about if not crypto these days it's it's they're getting almost we often say in bankless um you know crypto pays you to learn about crypto right like we mean that literally right number goes up air drops come in um more opportunity comes your way well it's starting to pay these large fintechs to learn about it early as well and that's why i'm sure it benefits visa from being on the cutting edge but of those three points those three wins that you just mentioned diogo i get the revenue piece and i get the last piece tell me a bit more about the uh the engagement piece because that's kind of new to me why does adding crypto to a fintech platform a venmo a square a stripe or whatever else why does that actually increase engagement in customer retention yeah we can definitely try to guess why that is um and but the reality is that it does and so the outcome is obvious and since the outcome is obvious everybody's trying to follow and i will point out that these platforms have also seen the same type of behavior from the majority of the features that they add to the platform the flash here the feature or the most interesting the feature the highest engagement they get on these other core portions of their product and so think about it less of a crypto specific component but the fact that crypto is so um so so obviously something that people want to talk about and so obviously something that is marketable i think it increases further than just traditional product features that you'd add that incremental it feels like it's a step function it feels like it's something that is obviously bringing in the millennials and bringing in people with connection to crypto and thus this becomes your home and you're a lot likelier to use these other products that square and paypal and all these other players are using because now they're part of your crew so there's this uh getting ahead and in the public markets they're clearly in uh but also for consumers they're in and so really there's no downside to this it is an obvious strategy at this point it's been proven over and over and over and it really is win-win-win yeah so so one thing maybe i would add on this is that you know i feel like for a long time people in fintech and people banking they looked at crypto and the volatility and it was a bug it was like oh this this asset class is super volatile and then at some point this switch turned where a product manager who's responsible for how many daily active users can we get in our mobile app looked at crypto's volatility and it's like this is a feature that people are opening their crypto apps to check the prices a lot more than they're opening opening their bank mobile apps to check the balance i have not heard that anymore and i think volatility is is a major driving factor of that but it's fun and interesting and exciting and it's got this just repeated consumer behavior and if you could take someone opening your app multiple times a day each time they open the app is a touch point where you can then be able to try and push them into another product upsell and be able to build that loyal customer base and i think that's something that we're starting to see kai some might say another word for engagement then is addiction maybe some of the people listening can can relate in the number of times they check their block folio and crypto prices during a given day no but i'll jump in and say that uh it really speaks to this competition for your home base right this one app that you have to use across all of your finances it's not just about equities it's about equities and crypto and your cash and all of it from one place and all these fintechs now are in competition with one another so once somebody adds something that i want to check on my portfolio to their home screen i have one less incentive to go open some other application that only gives me a slice of my my my whole exposure or my whole um my whole market exposure right and so once you start thinking about it that way and we're competing you need to include everything you need the superset because not including something means that engagement will go somewhere else and yes sky's absolutely right volatility is one of the aspects of um how much um how much have i made today or how much have i lost today there's there's both those components that we see on wall street bets that are human elements that are definitely at play here and i think there's also this notion of just the consumer demand what a lot of people don't realize is banks and and fintechs they can see that directly even if they don't have crypto in their core products they see how much money flows from their consumers to a coinbase or crypto.com or an ftx you know they see the card volume they see the ach volume and so it's it's very clear to just say okay there's a trend here my consumers are interested in these products they're sending funds out of my core product to a third party that's offering access to crypto and i think that there's this this fear that what if they don't come back and it was one thing when they were sending money to a third party that was providing access to crypto and that was it and they were only providing access to crypto you're always going to come back for your debit card and for your credit card and for your loans but now that those companies that they're sending money to that provide access to crypto are offering debit cards or offering lending products like there's the potential that they build a new relationship and so you know with that data and that insight plus the benefit that you get from engagement it's because it becomes a very strong business case uh for you know ford thinking uh fintechs and and banks to say this should be a part of our product roadmap so there's the carrot but there's also the stick of like what if they don't need us anymore it's absolutely right in this fight for who's your home base every single every single company is competing for it the same way that we were saying that every tech company becomes a fintech now every fintech will becoming a crypto company so that is a very clear flow because all of them will have to have these types of these types of products and it's particularly interesting kai's point around volatility there is one aspect here that people are adding to their platform and also realizing that it has massive advantages which is there's a lot of different products being added but if for a moment if you think about crypto rewards on credit card so credit card rewards that are crypto based so bitcoin um cash back equivalents things like that there's an interesting phenomenon that is happening here which is people only really feel the upside and what i mean by that is the following the volatility of crypto is bad because if you invest a thousand dollars and now it's worth 500 you have lost effectively 500 but now if somebody's giving you something for free instead of airline miles in points if somebody's giving you crypto the volatility means that you're incredibly excited because you got something for free there's a lot more valuable today and if it goes down there's not as much of that sting of this was actually my money that was invested here and so the volatility for something like crypto credit card rewards only really works one direction which is on the way up and that is just absolutely fascinating as a phenomenon that then drives engagement new types of products and it can really help people with savings exposure to an asset class for free in a dollar cost average way just by using a visa credential how beautiful is that that we're helping people in a way include their savings and exposure to a very high growth potential asset class without them actually feeling the downside because effectively from their side they're feeling that i got it for free so there's a lot of these like smaller phenomenons that are working on the background that really speak to engagement that really speak to stickiness they really speak to the sense that this fintech that i'm engaging with is on my side and helping me with my financial goals you know that i that that point right there diogo is like super interesting to me because i've long we we talk about tokens so much um but we don't often like delineate right there's like like stable coins there's also like um you know crypto monies like ethan bitcoin right but there's also this class of tokens that are loyalty points effectively right these are not securities these are these are the equivalent of like airline miles like you do something that the platform wants and the platform the network gives you some sort of a bonus and it feels like man the the credit card in the payments industry has done a lot with this over the years what does this look like in erc20 form in tokenized form when that's unleashed inside of open finance and i can't wait to see the experimentation there i know you know some like um you know maybe crypto.com with their their car they they have some of these things like their cro token that maybe this resembles some sort of the loyalty point but but it seems to be the case that every every company that wants to reward a network of users is going to want to have some form of of loyalty point credential are you seeing much develop in that space i i would just say that crypto backed rewards on card programs is becoming a major major trend and i think we started to see this in 2020 and i think first for consumers it's as simple as i didn't get on a plane you know for a year and so my existing airline miles just meant less to me because it wasn't something that i was using well they literally expired don't they i and and i don't even know because i i don't know exactly how much an airline mile is worth and it's hard to track what is the value of that mile i highly doubt becomes more valuable maybe it becomes less valuable over time and there are restrictions of where i can use it and when you compare that to being able to earn crypto back and for consumer who is either already into crypto and excited about they're checking the price every day and they know exactly how much their rewards are worth and they're excited that the rewards can appreciate in value or for a consumer who may be more risk-averse and may say you know i'm not ready to invest my money but it's still fun to have some skin in the game and have some exposure and through the purchases that you make on a card be earning bitcoin or another you know crypto asset back and so just if you look at the math of if you've been earning one and a half percent back uh in crypto on your purchases you know over the past year you probably would have paid for many things that you bought and i think that that's becoming more and more of a mainstream customer value proposition and at the same time it's also interesting to think that crypto companies they have a different business model than a lot of traditional you know fintechs and neobanks and because of how profitable you know crypto trading businesses are they're actually willing to offer even more lucrative rewards in a dollar term than most other programs would and so i think there's a real possibility that if you read the the points guy blog and you know if you're one of the there are people who spent all their time figuring out how to optimize you know card spend to get the best rewards back we could look at that in nine months to a year from now and say the top 10 card programs are all crypto backed rewards because they're incentivized to pay out a higher amount to acquire customers get them into their platform introduce them to crypto have them start trading where they can monetize uh and because if you factor in the appreciation of the assets that people are earning you know it becomes a lot more than two and a half or three percent back and so we think this is a major major trend that many of our clients are paying very close attention to and have you know plans to to participate in once again crypto paying you to use crypto i think there's an interesting analogy here where the airline miles model where these companies issue these credits and they use them as incentives if you want to take the worst most dystopian future of what a a top-down central bank digital currency would look like where it's restricted based off of like limitations because they want to control you it's also highly inflationary because they print it out like the worst case of a cbdc actually starts to look like airline miles as we know it today and direct juxtaposition on the other side of the things you have exactly what you guys are talking about with crypto crypto rewards so like one you have the most top down most controlled most restricted currency being issued and then on the other side of things you have crypto which is freedom money if you will money that appreciates money that's scarce and so the incentives where exactly what we've been saying of the incentives of crypto actually rewards and incentivizes this sort of behavior like no wonder this engagement is being tapped into by these companies they're starting to put all the patterns together and actually formulate products around these things and uh i would go to you know to ryan's point it's uh pretty interesting to see that what is the next step so kai is absolutely right it's uh we've seen a ton of demand on crypto back rewards because of this component around access to an appreciating asset versus a depreciating asset in the form of miles but the next step is really the at the core of this uh web 3 phenomenon and crypto phenomenon which is and to quote chris dickson right web one was about read web 2 is about read write and web 3 is about read write own what's happening is that these companies are now starting to instead of just issuing you know the top assets like bitcoin and ethereum they're giving them rewards of a token that actually will accrue value of the network that is being created and so it's not that you're just being you know rewarded with an asset like bitcoin that might appreciate in the future no you are directly being rewarded by your active participation in this ecosystem and by participating more you get more points that represent at some point value of the network that is being created and so it really speaks to this web 3 read write own you are owning the network that you're creating and it just creates such strong bootstrapping effects of these networks because you want to talk about your friends about this whatever crypto neo bank that is rewarding me based on the points even though it's not bitcoin and it's not one of the the assets you believe that these points will actually have more value because you believe this network and this service in this particular platform will have more value so that is the next step is really how these companies are using these tokens that they issue to allow clients and consumers to have some of the value of the network that's being created accrued to them yeah there's a fascinating potential and component of governance there as well where you can imagine a future where you know today you know you might have a card program that has rewards that might rotate in different categories or you might get different rewards for different merchants well who decides what those categories what who those merchants are well there's a product manager and that product manager might have a focus group and they might go out and do some partnerships and they're the rewards that you got like you could choose then they'll look at the data of our consumers you know opt again are they using it is it driving lyft versus a community approach where you know why don't you ask the customers and imagine if you're earning a token you know back on the card and then that token gives you governance where you then vote on okay you know which categories you know should we have rewards in for next month and you know the people who are the most active users of that card program who have spent more on that card have a greater say in the direction that rewards go than someone who's barely used the card and so i think that there are these really fascinating ways that you can have more community ownership and participation in helping to design these products and so i think this is still very very early but there's a lot that these you know fintech and crypto native neo banks can can build on there oh my god the d5 mullet is the best isn't it that fits right into the same themes that we've always been seeing in crypto where once you add in a token you actually give your community a platform to stand on and actually it turns into a reciprocal relationship between the company and the community rather than a top down like here's what our products are guys this is in uh this crypto industry is inherently a retail driven industry the only reason why institutions are here is because retail's here and where previously in the the legacy world the tradfy world uh the comm the the people the retail the communities are very very separate from a lot of the companies that are like visa itself or the the companies that would be something along the lines of anchorage like custody but now that we're all in the same we're all in the same place but your guys's jobs uh kaya visa and diego at anchorage is actually to make things pretty invisible to retail to make to just do a lot of the the hard work and make it behind the scenes and just make a really good ui but that also drives a lot of questions and so kai i have actually a ton of questions about some very basic stuff about payments and how payments work and so i actually kind of want to start with these very very broad questions kai when visa is coming into the space coming into crypto which is mostly about assets less about payments yet visa is a payment provider what do people in the crypto space generally not understand about payments and then also vice versa what do people in the payment space not generally understand about about crypto oh my uh how much how much time is it do we have try to think where where to start uh i i think first it's it's really important to understand that the existing payments ecosystem actually exists in multiple layers and so the core like visa net you know that most people are familiar with today is really this instant you know high throughput authorization system that works at 70 million merchants across the world that can exchange messages you know between a merchant's bank and a customer's bank and it enables you to go anywhere in the world that visas accepted and you could be you know in spain and at of a local merchant and have a card issued from a bank in san francisco and the price i think that's and that's a really important thing i want to delineate just just real quick right here where visa is not an asset transfer network it is a messaging network where ethereum and roll-ups and payment channels they actually do transfer assets visa just transfers messages of approval method messages of authentication this is correct so yes so there's a separation between authorization and settlement in visa's network and you know core payment networks that exist today and so the core problem that it solves is how can you have a merchant that's halfway across the world that you can go to and you can pay with a card that was issued to you by a bank in san francisco and that local merchant you know in spain doesn't have to question who is this bank that issued this to you is is this bank what's their financial position like are they actually gonna pay me they just know that there's a guarantee that they're gonna get paid that it's going to work and so visa solves that global coordination you know between over 15 000 banks across the world both on the consumer side and on the merchant side and those banks represent 70 million merchants that can now you know accept cards can i ask a question here kai it's like because this is really interesting for crypto people um think of each of the maybe if we think of each of those individual banks as like independent chains right and independent general ledgers right they're all kind of independent some are interconnected in different ways but they don't really talk to one another they can't really uh you know transact information what you're saying is visa is basically the bridge the connector the network on top of all of those disparate chains is that a way to think about it from a crypto lens exactly that we help 15 000 banks be able to talk to each other in real time 24 7 all over the world and be able to have trust in those messages and knowing that they're going to get paid now then you actually have to move the money and so you can authorize a transaction in real time but then you have to settle that transaction and so you have to get money to move from one bank to another bank and so visa actually uses you know dozens of different settlement networks across the world you know from fedwire to eight local achs and rtp networks uh depending on the country to help coordinate the settlement of funds from one bank into another bank and so that's where when we look at at public blockchains today we really see them the core use case that we think particularly stable coins are playing is they are new settlement layers there are new ways to move funds between two entities and they have properties that some existing many existing settlement layers don't have today and one great example that is very practical this week is public blockchains don't have bank holidays and i got an email yesterday from a crypto company a crypto card program it was actually two days ago and i think it was smart of them to send this email they reminded me that if you'd like to add funds to your card it's a bank holiday for veterans day and you're not going those funds are not going to show up on your card they wanted to make sure particularly crypto people it's like what's like they were making sure everyone's aware of that and you don't realize that between now and the end of the year you know not only do banks in the us only move money on on weekdays but they're actually four week days before between now the end of the year when banks can't actually move money and so even though you have this global real-time authorization network that can coordinate you know 24 7 between banks all across the world we are constrained in terms of how money can actually move to settle transactions over that network based upon when banks are open and when bank wires can actually be processed and i think that's what's really interesting about public blockchains is like i mentioned we think it's going to be a long time before consumers completely change their the form factor and the behavior of scanning a qr code and that merchants accept it but we think that there are real problems that public blockchains can solve making it easier for an issuing bank you know to be able to settle with visa for visa to be able to settle with an acquiring bank when we can do it over these public global networks that work 24 7 and don't you know take holidays off so kai i was trying to this week i was trying to actually get uh funds from one uh bank account that we have by the way you know bank list does have a bank account unfortunately we'd really wish out loud okay so like we really wish we could escape the banks but we still have to pay for like merch and like some of your subscriptions and you guys pay with banks so we still need to do that anyway i transferred the funds this is an ach payment on sunday okay uh it took until today for the bank to actually receive those funds the other bank on the other side so i could you know pay off pay off this credit card basically um and it must have been because of that banker holiday but what was going on this is an ach transfer payment so what's going on behind the scenes is a lot of networks are talking to one another but ultimately this ach transfer payment it settles on something called fedwire which you mentioned and this is the settlement layer for banking system for in particular it's it's interesting because this settlement layer i believe is a mono asset so it only supports us dollars right it is provided by i believe the government or some consortium you know but it's kind of a government provided thing and it is almost like the ethereum for all of the bank chains if you will to settle on top of that's kind of how i think of it is this does this analogy kind of work to you and if so then what you guys are saying is visa can settle to fed wire it can also settle to other settlement networks but now we're just saying hey we can settle erc 20 stable coins to ethereum too so we're basically just swapping out some of the uh some of the underlying infrastructure that backs this whole thing so you know test some of these analogies is this roughly am i in the ballpark here i think it's it's definitely in the ballpark and the other important distinction here is this varies based on the country and that you know these you know tend to be domestic very local uh payment rails that central banks uh and and banks operate and so it looks different in different countries and in the us does not have a real-time you know payment system uh that is central bank you know operators a the fed is working on fed now and they will in the future there are other countries you know like brazil that have you know real-time you know payment networks and so to me that there are these two things that are happening in parallel one is a a number of approaches to modernize existing you know bank operated payment systems to move to more real-time models uh from some of the existing models today in the u.s and then to figure out how do you get every country to upgrade and improve their payment infrastructure and then to connect that payment infrastructure together so that you can do cross-border payments and then separately in the mullet land you know we have these like new open public global networks and many of them that just work everywhere but there's still fragmentation between them and how do you cross over you know from existing fiat on a bank account to a stable coin held on an open public network and so we think it's great that there is competition and innovation happening where the development of public blockchains at stablecoins is providing a forcing function saying hey like people are starting to think about maybe there shouldn't be bank holidays that i can't move money on and when you have these alternatives it can then spur kind of more focus on how do you improve existing rails and i think that you're gonna see both of them coexist and solve different problems for different you know client segments but it is incredibly complex how money moves today and i think crypto is bringing a whole new class of entrepreneurs and technologists into really just rethinking what does money movement look like across the world and by the way one point that i want to make to david's assertion that um crypto is primarily a retail phenomenon this is the fork in the road that makes it not to be the case it was absolutely primarily retail phenomenon but it's no longer just a retail phenomenon and part of the reasons are because institutions benefit from the rise of stable coins from the rise of different settlement networks and you know the visa partnership uh with anchorage that we have around stablecoin settlement uh is just a great example of that we see so many of these large fintechs coming to anchorage because they look at their core business and then they look at stable coins and they look at the traditional payment system and they look at the t plus two federal holiday everything and then they say hey there's something here that i can do that is not a consumer product that is highly value accrual to my company which is i can use these settlement layers to create efficiencies in my own businesses and we're seeing more and more of these use cases so the road is for it crypto has independent utility for institutions that is not directly related to the fact that consumers want to hold these assets and so you know david you're absolutely right that's how the phenomenon started that's how it evolved that is still a big portion of it but we're seeing this fork in the road and i'm seeing more and more everyday use cases that are very much squarely on the b2b internal settlements internal efficiency side versus you know the consumer support side thank you crypto is definitely growing up and diogo i want to pick your brain a little bit about how anchorage fits into this conversation earlier ryan talked about how all these different roll-up chains you know all a bank is is a ledger right that's that's what a bank does it manages a ledger on behalf of his customers what is a roll-up what is a blockchain itself it's another form of a ledger but now especially in bull markets we have all of these extra ledgers we believe there's a blossoming l2 ecosystem that's coming to ethereum and notably visa is not actually a custodian it doesn't actually hold any funds it just messages funds around and so what's what's anchorage's role in a world where there's many many different ledgers all over the place and custody kind of needs to happen on every single one what's the back end of anchorage look like here yeah at a high level to continue with these analogies part of our role is to provide a regulated integration between public ledgers that are on the blockchain and the ability of having fiat on-ramp from the traditional world to the crypto world so it really is a portal the way that i described anchorage these days is yes we started primarily as a custodian a regulated custodian but today we have a federal charter out of which we provide the infrastructure the apis and the prime services for any institution to do custody to do execution buy and sell to do staking to do governance to participate in defy to lend borrow so it really is the access to institutions to the crypto space we only work with institutions we do not have a retail presence so our clients are folks like visa and kai and i and the team work really um closely together and kind of building products that are you know b2b potentially b2b2c where their clients finally on the other end but anchorage is really the infrastructure that is regulated as a bank that has these apis and these prime services so you can actually build these types of features on top and at the end of the day for us it doesn't really matter if you're doing you know a credit card that is crypto backed credit card or if you're doing buy and sell for your consumers or if you are trying to provide staking yields to your consumers or lending yield to your consumers or offering dollars backed by crypto collateral or just an execution play it doesn't really matter we have the apis the platform regulated as a federally charted bank arbitram is an ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use defy and nfts and now it's live and has over a hundred projects deployed gas fees on ethereum l1 suck too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us and that's why teams like arbitrary have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on ethereum cheap and instant arbitrary increases ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience go to developers.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom and if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps being built aren't arbitrary many d5 applications on the ethereum l1 are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrom and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two there's so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so go to bridge.arbitrum.io now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the defy or nfc experience that you've always wanted living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defy apps all in one spot ledger live is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into all of the default apps and services that you're used to using ledger live you can stake your ethan lido swap on dexes like paraswap or display your nfts with rainbow you can also use wallet connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defy apps that keep coming online defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab a ledger download ledger live and get all of your defy apps all in one space guys in the beginning of this industry especially with bitcoin bitcoin was all about oh eventually we'll be able to purchase coffee using bitcoin that clearly has not has not evolved in that way and not only even with the advent of stable coins we are still are not actually seeing stable coins being used to purchase coffee i believe kai i heard you say somewhere along the lines that the average stablecoin transfer is ten thousand dollars meaning like people are doing very different things than purchasing coffee if the average stablecoin transfers ten thousand dollars and so in addition to all of these various chains all these l2s all these various different ledgers we also have all these various different currencies there's usdc there's usdt there's also the coming world of central bank digital currencies so how does the combination of anchorage and visa where anchorage is the backend custodian visa is the payment network how does that actually span the gap between when i pay with apple pay at my local grocery store because what i actually don't even know what the currency is that i'm spending at the grocery store if like i'm spending usdc on the crypto side what currency am i spending in my normal trad fight like i actually don't know these things how do these world of many currencies many chains bridging the way to the typical payments that we're used to or consumer payments how do you guys as a pair of companies help uh span this gap yeah so maybe i'll start and i think you know the first the the environment kind of pre-crypto and that most people are familiar with is you have you know many different currencies across the world and you could have a consumer who's spending you know from a on a card that's issued by bank and the funds that they have on that card are in one currency and let's say they're traveling they're going on vacation they're spending and the merchant that they're spending at has a bank that's in a different currency and so you know what visa enables is that the issuing bank of the card holder can settle to visa they can send us dollars and then visa can send euros you know to the acquiring bank the merchant's bank and so visa manages conversions between one fiat currency and another fiat currency so that issuers can pay us what their currency of choice acquires can pay can get paid in their currency of choice to provide you know to the merchant now what we're seeing is not only do we have many different currencies we now have different form factors of existing currencies and so when we look at a stable coin like usdc or usdp like this isn't really a new currency you know it's still dollars it's just a new form factor it's another way to represent those dollars that runs on a different payment rail in a public blockchain and so in the first example you know it's a bank as an issuer that is sending funds in dollars to visas bank and we have many different banks that we work with and then visa sends euros from our bank to a merchant's bank that they receive in euros now as we see that this this landscape of crypto native companies that are starting to work with visa emerge you know companies like crypto.com uh where they're building their whole business as this kind of crypto native you know card product you know they're saying wait a minute we're holding some of our corporate treasury in usdc we pay some of our employees in usdc like consumers are spending from a balance of crypto or usdc why do we have to convert that back into traditional fiat in a bank account just to be able to settle the obligations that we have with visa and today we can't receive usdc from one of our clients to a traditional bank because traditional banks don't support usdc they're not plugged into public blockchains and so we have integrated anchorage in to visa's treasury systems as a crypto settlement bank and so now we have an account at anchorage where we have a ethereum address that we can provide to a client and we could say instead of having to send us a bank wire you know to our existing bank account and paying us in dollars you can pay us in dollars in the form of usdc that you can send over the public ethereum blockchain to the account that we have with anchorage now let's say it's a crypto.com you know cardholder crypto.com prefers might prefer to pay us in usdc but the merchant their bank doesn't know anything about usdc they don't know anything about crypto they don't they can't receive crypto and so the same way that you know visa manages conversions and works with banks to convert dollars to euros we think we should have the capability to help convert a digital dollar the form of usdc into a traditional dollar that we can deliver to a bank and so we work with anchorage to be able to do that and we think that this is going to be incredibly important because there's gonna be a long transitionary period i think a lot of people think in these binaries of like you live in a world of just traditional fiat bank accounts or you go completely crypto and like everything is in uscc on public networks for as long as we can see there will be traditional fiat and there will be digital fiat and so how do you have those two work seamlessly together and have a consumer experience where i don't have to ask and see does that merchant do they know what stable coins are can they accept them i pay with my card how i normally do and everything happens seamlessly on the back end where visa makes sure that we accept the right form of currency that the the issuing bank or the crypto card program wants to send us and that we pay out the right form of currency you know that the acquirer uh the merchant's bank wants to receive and so anchorage plays a critical role as a part of our treasury infrastructure to be able to support these conversions between form factors do you know i laugh kai because um simultaneously like you know one day i'll have to actually write a physical check like one day of the week right to just run the business and like that same day i'm just sending money through a crypto transaction it's like seamless right so like even for me this transition period is like you have to have a foot in both worlds so i totally understand the value proposition there i i want to get back to you with with another question kai but before i do uh diogo do you want to add anything to that about kind of you know the role that anchorage plays or you know build off of what kai was saying yeah it's a perfect example of um us using our platform and our regulated charter and the fact that we're a bank to really bridge traditional world in crypto world so that products like this can be built i think one of the interesting things here is that we talked about paying with crypto but the reality is that the consumers don't really care about paying crypto and they are finally they are the ultimate decision makers of what what is successful what's not successful it's about convenience and so the reality is that it's incredibly convenient to use your phone with an apple pay or to use your visa credential in the form of um of a card that you just touch and it doesn't really matter what the form factor is at the end of the day if what you have is a crypto wallet from which the the money is spent then you are using crypto for payments and so the the actual technicality of the fact that there is no direct crypto transaction between the final consumer and the actual merchant that you're about to pay for your coffee is irrelevant and in crypto we are just very technical in nature and so we care deeply about the end to when transaction happen on the chain but consumers don't their experience is i have a crypto wallet i have crypto and i spend it at a merchant nothing else matters it's the experience that is the best that ends up winning it doesn't really matter that it is actually a transaction that's directly on chain it doesn't matter to the merchant and clearly does not matter to the consumer so i want to point out that this is what's happening there is crypto being used for payments absolutely but a better proxy is not the number of unchanged transactions that are happening on bitcoin that are directly settling between a consumer and a merchant it is really the cards that actually have a relationship with visa and the volume altogether of cards that are actually backed by crypto crypto on the back end that is actually the true volume of payments that are being done with crypto so that is actually should be the shift of us when we monitor crypto adoption for payments that is not direct settlement is how many cards are being backed by crypto on the back end yeah and just a data point on on that i'd say in you know our fiscal year which ended end of september 30th uh we saw over three billion dollars of payment volume coming from crypto linked uh visa cards and you know the broad scheme of the you know over 10 trillion dollars that visa does is very very small but that virtually didn't exist you know a year and a half two years ago you know that that was not in the billions of dollars and so we see this growing at a very very fast pace and as more crypto companies issue credentials as consumers you know find the value prop particularly with crypto rewards we think that that's going to become a a very significant number so kai i want to ask this because like so for many in the crypto industry who've been a believer in what these technologies could bring we felt sort of like prophets in the wilderness for a while right like just no one believes us yeah there's that crazy guy you know whatever um i i want to hear about your story because i know you've been a believer in crypto for a while and a champion within visa for a while now you're talking about the value proposition using crypto for for stable coins as a settlement network like to me at the way you articulate it and point it three billion in transaction volume like it couldn't be more obvious now the value proposition couldn't be more obvious now and i'm wondering if that's the case within visa um i'm also wondering about the journey because like that hasn't always been the case and i you know there there has to be some some resistance i think from like the old ways of doing things and and kind of the the existing established relationships and crypto is kind of a scam and it's for drugs and criminals and it shouldn't you know can't be used in this way uh and public blockchains aren't the future we have private blockchains can you talk a little bit about your journey do you feel like somewhat i guess vindicated and are there still any um are there still any objections do you think or is like are is visa and fintech are they kind of all in on this crypto journey at this point we are definitely all in uh i'd say that you know my journey you know when i came to visa yeah i didn't know anything about payments so i've worked at a startup called trialpay that visa acquired it was my first job out of college i was playing number 100 uh and i i was just what does visa do i i was just learning about visa as i came into the company and i happened to go down the crypto rabbit hole with some friends that i was living with in san francisco and so i had this really unique opportunity to learn about visa and payments and learn about crypto at the same time and that was you know really this was a a 2017 mullet uh environment where yeah i was there that was before bullets were cool i was the only person they were not good 2017. the weird guy in the office it was looking at there were people that i got to learn from at visa who'd been at visa for for 30 years they knew everything about payments i'm like i'm never going to know more about existing payment systems at visa than they do but they didn't know anything about crypto they just hadn't spent any time on it they kind of you know they either just didn't they didn't care and it just wasn't that interesting to them and then i was spending time with people in crypto who knew everything about kryptos like i'm never going to know as much as you do about crypto but they didn't know anything about visa and so it was was very clear that the future was going to be some intersection of the two and so i decided i want to spend the next decade of my career trying to build you know at that intersection and we made a little bit of progress every week for four years and you know that's you know it's it's amazing that that when you do that how much uh can happen and i think it's also you know along with the entire industry moving uh visa is very much a you know partner-driven company you know we've we've got tens of thousands of partnerships like we really rely we coordinate between fintechs and banks and merchants and so as our partners started to care about crypto you know we start to care about crypto and said that this is important when our you know some of our most forward-thinking innovative um you know partners are deeply investing in it it was very natural that that we wanted to to be alongside them and and help and find ways that that we can add value and so you know i was just the the annoying crypto person uh inside the company just talking about it you know every single day oh we've all been there and i actually one of the things i did i i created a newsletter i called visacrypto weekly uh that i started probably like i think it was beginning of 2018 and i strategically sent it out on sunday nights because i was like you know people are more likely to check their email and read a few things on like sunday night than like monday or tuesday and it started with 10 people who were just curious about crypto uh within the company and over time you know we grew it to i think we when we stopped those at 500 people and so it was just trying to really focus on education and i think the more people learn about crypto the more that you can explain it and translate it in the context of visa in the context of payment systems the more natural that it was that of course we should be involved and i think also visa as a company we've really evolved from you know we used to visa the company was visa net the card network but over the past few years it's really been about how do we become this global payment infrastructure company and participate and add value to many different payment flows so what about the 100 trillion dollars of b2b payment flows that's a huge opportunity that we could start to participate and add value in and so we see ourselves as kind of this network of networks and how can we be a connection point for clients to move value over all different networks that emerge in the future and so that's a much broader perspective than just the card business and i think that's where the opportunities for crypto particularly stable coins if stable coins are going to become better bank wires we would love to be able to to be at the forefront of helping our clients leverage stable coins for some of those use cases so i've had a lot of fun and i've gotten a ton of support internally and at this point we are all in we are in the crypto business we are very excited about the opportunities that it presents for us by the way for bankless listeners there's probably some hidden career advice here anytime you can serve as a nexus and bridge two worlds together you will do very well particularly when one of these worlds is growing so fast so i know david and i are always telling you hey quit your job come join crypto come join us on the journey there's also the possibility within your existing company within your existing role you can serve as a bridge to crypto in all aspects whether it's finance or the metaverse or nfts or otherwise uh anyway keep that keep that in your hat listeners i hope you picked up on that kai i want to go down a very quick hopefully short rabbit hole but usually these rabbit holes aren't that short uh with regards to payments in the in the traditional world payments are more far more reversible than in crypto so how does the immutability of these transfers on uh on actual blockchains does that like ease any frictions for visa does that add any problems how does that change the game when it comes to payments and visa so when in in the context that you know we are working with anchorage uh and you know really focused on using uscc and public blockchains as settlement layers it's it's not a a major issue because you know fedwire and you know other large settlement rails like uh they are not easily reversible and you have to be very careful when you use them so i i don't think there's a huge distinction there i think there is an important question for consumers about you know reversibility and i think that you know there is a a value proposition of card products um to be able to know that you know if you sign up you know for a subscription you know with you know a website online and if you literally can't cancel that subscription and you know they keep charging your card like there's someone you could call and you could have you have that that charge canceled and you could be able to you know have have some recourse and ability to to get your your money back and i think that that solves a real problem in in a number of different use cases where if you switch entirely to you know you're going to make payments for everything in stable coins you know it'd be like you're going to use bank wires for for everything uh and there are certain payments where that makes sense and others where you'd want to be able to to have some some recourse and so i think you know what's exciting to me is that there's just so much innovation happening and there'll be different products across the spectrum and if someone wants to go entirely crypto native they can but there are trade-offs yeah there is no clear here's the product that you use that is better on every single metric you know for both consumers and merchants and so you know we're excited to be able to offer products that are very easy for merchants to accept because they already accept them today and very easy for consumers to use that provide some benefits and guarantees and recourse that consumers have which we think will continue to be valuable particularly for people who are scared of you know don't get the address wrong like you know what if you're scanning a qr code what if there's a new type of attack and someone there's a man in the middle and they put their qr code in there and you send them your stable coins you're not getting that back and so i think there's a long way to go to have crypto native payments to the core of paying over a blockchain be as convenient and consumer-friendly as card payments are right now and you know a lot of people in crypto we get so focused on the tech we don't think about you know an average consumer and what they care about is you know being able to trust that the payment's going to go through and you know if there's some issue having someone to be able to call and i think that's a major problem that that card solved today but but david to your point i think your ansics are absolutely right not for the payments use case but it is very clear that many fintechs that come to us that have some kind of uh consumer funding that they are dealing with t plus two they are dealing with finality problems of networks like ach they are dealing with these issues because it is a consumer a bad consumer experience to fund an account and then have to wait five days for it to actually be withdrawable and we see this constantly on exchanges where funds can might be used immediately but they can't actually be withdrawn and all of that has to do with a natural lack of finality and with a reversibility and the fact that they can be clawed back so there's many other types of use cases for which the fact that you know when the rc20 token is final well probabilistic in nature but you know with strong probabilistic conviction um from a stochastic model of number of confirmations we believe that it's there it can't be clawback it can't be taken away this is actually a major shift and it's interesting because because of this issue we have created a whole market and a whole set of complex systems that companies like square and stripe do around underwriting they are dealing with a system that will only guarantee them that the money will be theirs um you know x days from now yet they underwrite for that period of time using their own risk models the ability of uh paying immediately or in the case of square cash being able to do an instant payout and actually withdraw the money immediately when in fact they're liable and they're taking on the risk there so there's a whole complexity to risk analysis and underwriting of these types of use cases because the systems do not have instant finality and there's many use cases by the way in the traditional financial world where people say why is this deeplit plus two why can't we have a blockchain do this instantly there's many use cases for which the financial institutions actually want those two days they want those two days to have the time to do something in case it goes wrong and so it's part of their built-in risk model so they'll actually push back because they don't want the technology to be instant but there's many use cases for which consumer experiences are just so much better when you're using something with instant finality because if i can guarantee that in a few minutes all the funds are there and they're they're not encumbered in any way shape or form and i don't actually have to run a very complex underwriting process to allow those funds to be used then that's just a dramatically better product experience which ultimately makes the company distinguish themselves from their competitors i think one very practical example in use case uh you can think about is like paying your credit card bill where you're paying your credit card bill with an ach bank transfer for your bank account let's say someone is like right up to the limit of their credit card they're about to max their their credit card out and they want to be able to to pay that out and and get access to it well there's some risk that what if that payment doesn't go through it could take several days and so you might have an issue or say hey we're we're going to wait to make sure that payment goes through before we're gonna give you more of a credit line and so that's where it's exciting to me to say well what if you could pay your credit card bill with a stablecoin and there's instant fidelity where that issuer can know that they have that money and so at any point of time you know if you want to create you know have more credit uh more of a credit limit you can pay down your credit card you know instantly you know with a stable coin instead of having to wait you know a few days for a payment to post via ach and so i think there are like really interesting ways that that can come together kai that that literally just happened to me this week like i was wait waiting for five days and like our merch wasn't shipping because i was just trying to transfer some funds to a credit card to pay off a balance and i would have loved to have just pressed a button and sent that an erc20 stablecoin and there's a lot of these points of friction throughout all of our daily experiences and so the way that i think about this is just another tool in your toolbox if you are an institution if you're a fintech if you're a company trying to build some type of product where money is being moved then you want to consider this as a tool in your toolbox you might consider the traditional financial world if you're directly access to fedwire maybe you don't actually have concerns about finality but for everybody else not a lot of people have direct access to fedwire then this is a tool in your toolbox that you might actually use guys there's a we definitely want to get to the cbdc conversation but i want to speed run us through this nft conversation because recently visa purchased a crypto punk so congratulations for for owning a crypto punk uh and i want to go through the story of how that process happened kai why did visa decide to actually buy a crypto punk uh and what did you learn from that experience what was the goal of that and then also will fit in how anchorage helped out in that process as well so i think what's really exciting about you know nfts for us is that visa has been around for 60 years and so you know we have participated in major commerce transformations you know over that time and so you think about you first you know the the origins of visa it's you know you're selling physical goods in a physical location and we helped to move that from cash and check to an electronic uh payment yeah then you go to now there's this internet you could do e-commerce and so now you know you're selling you know with a digital storefront you don't have to pay rent anymore and like have an open location but you're still mostly selling physical goods you still have a factory you're still manufacturing you're still shipping and the storefront is digital and the payment is digital or electronic now we see nfts as this you know really brand new phase of commerce where it's a digital storefront and it's an entirely digital product uh that you're selling and we think that the potential that this has to just increase the velocity of commerce is tremendous when you can sell something to someone across the world and have it minted instead of produced in a physical factory and then have it delivered to a crypto address instead of shipped to a mailing address and have that happen instantaneously and then have whoever receives it be able to own it and resell it if they'd like to someone else all across the world the number of transactions and the amount of commerce that can happen we think could be you know beyond anything that we've ever seen before and so that's when just nfts are a new generation of e-commerce that has tremendous potential but we want to help make it easier and so we want to help merchants and brands be able to figure out how to sell nfts we think consumers should be able to buy them with a visa card on file you know as easy as buying anything else on e-commerce and so we are very much focused on how do we help accelerate the adoption you know of this category of commerce but to do that like we need to deeply understand it and so you know that was the the goal for us is let's just learn by doing and and we've been very focused on building a crypto native culture at visa you know we like to experiment we believe that the only way to truly understand and learn about crypto is to use it so everyone on our team uses crypto like that is a core part of you you just can't figure out you know what impact crypto is going to have in your business if you've never set up a wallet the same way you wouldn't have been able to figure out what impact the internet's going to have in your business if you never had a dial-up connection and you never surf the web and so recognizing that it's early you still have to go in and experiment and so that's what we wanted to do you know purchasing the crypto punk you know we knew crypto punks were this historic artifact you know that was one of the first mainstream successful uh nft projects and we're like we should collect this the same way that visa collects you know old you know first generation card processing machines and kind of cuff links that dehawk handed out we've got this whole archive of really cool things that we've collected we're like crypto punks deserve a spot and so you know we wanted to add it to our archives we want to display it in all of our innovation centers in our offices and have it as a part of a visa's collection but we're like how do we do this how do we buy this as an institution and so i ended up you know sending a a message to diogo and i was like hey like we want to buy a crypto puck like can you help us with this and and we went down many different paths of you know it would be very very difficult for a large institution like visa to do it on our own uh and so that's where you know it anchorage really stepped up and we're an amazing partner and it's one of the reasons why we chose them in the first place is because of their ability to execute on new initiatives like this so maybe diogo you could talk about kind of how you actually did it uh and you know the role that that you played in it i mean starting from the receiving a text from kai i don't know i think it was 2 a.m or something i don't know what guy's doing it to him thinking about these initiatives did he have the crypto punk selected at that time or was it like just like hey i've got you know possibilities i got a budget for one what did did you guys have your heart set on one it was more like we had i had identified a buyer i identified a seller and so a seller that had a collection of crypto punks so we were kind of limited to what selection they had so sauce is more about we need a punk you know at this point eddie punk is like amazing to have and so how can we work with this known seller in anchorage to help it's interesting because if you're an institution the types of things that you're thinking about are very different from a consumer experience right obviously the where do i keep this thing in a way that it will be there in a way that is potentially regulated in a way that minimizes my risk of not just loss but my risk of having something bad happen to it but from another perspective consumers don't usually care about who they're buying their art from and institutions kind of do and so from a perspective of who's the who's the buyer do we know who they are um you know where this source of funds is you know all of the all of all of this until how do we pay for this how do we get the ethereum to actually pay for this how do we execute and turn fiat into ethereum and how do we settle this transaction how do we take ownership of it and how do we store this for the long term so there's quite a few things institutions need to think about quite a few things that you have to consider from a risk perspective until you actually get this done so from my perspective what i did was i received the text kai said hey we want to buy a crypto punk and we're like i was not thinking of having an nft product that is not part of my roadmap uh but you know let's let's do this this sounds fun so i think the in2 went kai i mean keep me honest here but into win it was like two weeks a week and a half to two weeks and to win from first text of i i have an idea to we have a punk and we can announce it and we have a specific punk and it's been purchased and been settled the interesting thing here is that the moment we announced uh that visa had bought a punk and that encouraged helped every single one of my clients and every single one institution out there would would punk senator and ft just reached out to us so now we actually have quite a bit of a treasure trove and a significant percentage of all the punks on the market no way that's fantastic hey thank you for uh increasing the poor price of cryptocurrencies yeah david says as he uh looks at his punk in the background no that's it's it's a beautiful punk by the way so congratulations it was one of the most effective you know marketing initiatives that we've done really just raising awareness of a visa participating in this space and i think what we found is like the same way that it was crazy to think in the early days of of twitter and facebook that you'd have major brands on these new platforms talking directly to consumers we think there's a parallel of you know being able to have an institution or a brand collect nfts and have an nft collection that fits with that brand's identity and using that to build relationships authentically with these communities that are forming around nfts we think is is a new way to to do kind of social media management uh and and marketing and so that was really exciting yes but we wanted to make sure it was authentic yeah we didn't want to just come in and say let's do a visa nft drop and hey everyone visa selling in nft we wanted to say like let's pay homage to the role that these historical you know valuable projects have played in the communities that they've built and let's say we see you and let's help introduce you to the rest of the world and use that to inspire others to say build on these new technologies and these these new form factors yeah that's really cool i'm glad you did it i mean to many in the crypto industry to me it was like a signal it was basically like hey crypt you know visa's here we're crypto native we we know what's going on right so that was a signal and stuff the second signal was like uh oh my god visa must really trust kai and the crypto visa team right to be able to get the budget for 150 000 crypto punks so you guys have definitely earned some legitimacy and credibility internally and that's a signal in and of itself guys we don't have too much more time but we want to touch upon this at least and this is uh cbdc's central bank digital currencies okay so china has a strategy we had a gentleman by the name of richard turin on he wrote a book called cashless told us all about china's strategy and basically they're letting their tech companies eat their banking system okay so like the the wechats and the alipays are doing that and um one benefit of that is they've been able to roll this out across a very broad population mobile payments qr codes you mentioned that a few times it's all qr codes it's very easy very accessible payment fees transaction fees are down to like a you know fraction of a percentage for each transaction a lot of good things um crypto uh you know the cryptocurrency industry would say yeah but the trade-off is complete centralized control okay like you don't have the freedoms there's no property right uh concept in this and so i want to ask the question to you guys because visas it sort of feels like it's in the center of it and definitely diego the institutions are as well what strategy do you think the us will ultimately pursue in the central bank digital currency rail will it go the way of china will it go a public private type relationship or will it continue to do what i feel like it's doing which is like shrugged shoulders and not really very much spin wheels yeah spin wheels what's your take here uh kai so so i think first china is a very unique uh you know country and market you know for payments and so it's it's very hard to draw direct parallels from china to every other market and i think it's very clear cbdc is a major focus for them reportedly they started in 2014 you know they've got you know a lot of engineers they've got like a hundred thousand engineers building complex infrastructure and so this is very real in in china uh then you have the rest of the world looking at this and saying what should we do and we think it's going to have to be more of a a public private partnership for them to be successful and i think first too often you know one of my frustrations has been the conversation around cbdc and stable coins and how to regulate stable coins is kind of happening in a vacuum people are like just focused on cbdc and like how do you design cbdc it's very academic and abstract and like you know what are the monetary policy implications and then it's oh okay how do you regulate stable coins where we think stable coins represent this really interesting environment where you can see what are the use cases what demand do consumers and businesses have for a digitized form of their fiat currency and increasingly it's not to buy their coffee like i think that's been one of the challenges with cbdc is what problem does it solve for consumers and what does cbdc look like as a product and that's something we're very focused on and we're engaging with you know every major central bank across the world you know doing research and helping them think through this but how do you position it you know how do you differentiate it from a bank deposit you know who can offer a cbdc wallet i think that's a critical question is it only a bank that can offer a cbdc wallet like only banks can have accounts at the fed or is it any fintech or developer can build a cbdc wallet and i think what has made stablecoin so exciting is this developer ecosystem is the composability is the new use cases like d5 and nfts that have really driven it forward and so i would argue that for cbdc to be successful it has to have many of the same properties that stable coins have had and there are paths and the imf has talked about this concept of synthetic cbdc where you know you could you know have a stable coin that's backed by reserves you know at a central bank but still have it run across you know multiple different networks and so i think that we are still very very early and there's a lot of work to do on what are the use cases uh you know what does it look like as a product what role do banks play what role do payment companies play and so we're really committed to just being a partner to central banks to help them think through it and frankly help them learn a lot from the stable coins and the existing private sector initiatives diogo what's your take on the same question how will central bank digital currencies turn out in the u.s i think as we all know there's a spectrum between decentralization and full centralization cbdc is definitely as we now live on the on the right side of the spectrum in terms of full centralization i think invariably what comes out of a cbdc is going to be positive for crypto i do agree that it needs to have the characteristics around transparency and around access that stable coins do and if they don't then it'll just likely look like more of a fedwire v3 than really a cryptocurrency as we know it and so that is the likely outcome here and i think the regulators are talking about who has a cbdc account and can consumers have direct relationships with the banks that's actually one of the biggest conversations that is being had more that and less about the technology less about the openness but our role at anchorage is going to be bridging these worlds if there is a cbdc then and if there is a transparency and ability for us to have access to it maybe we can be the ones to wrap it and actually have it be available to all of these other networks whether it's solana and ethereum etc and have a central bank digital currency that is also exposing crypto and can be used by smart contracts so that's i feel like a really good outcome that is in between these two worlds it's not a full cryptocurrency but it gets to benefit smart contracts by having a federal reserve backed um proxy and deposit but still be available on smart contracts and so i think that would be a great outcome for for us if it does pan out kai diego it's been an absolute pleasure to have you guys thank you for taking us through the d5 mullet i want to conclude with this question so some of the crypto natives listening to this might be a bit skeptical okay because crypto natives uh come from the ethos of decentralization right the cypherpunk ethos and here's visa which is a centralized company and here's anchorage which is you know serving the institutions and they're getting in on the crypto space too uh put their mind at ease like we've talked about all of the wins for institutions and the fintechs in crypto what are the wins for crypto natives in having some of these institutions and established fintechs come to their world what's your take kai yeah so so first i would highly recommend you know anyone who is deep into crypto go and learn a little bit about d-hawk and learn a bit about the origins and the history of visa and i think what you'll find uh d hawk predicted a lot of the things that we've seen in crypto in the 60s the 70s d-hawk you know talked about decentralization talked about new types of of and and kind of precursors to dolls and and so there are these components that are kind of in visas history and core dna that just has a lot of parallels to to what crypto looks like today now i think one of the major roles that we play is you know for crypto to continue to grow and to become mainstream you know it needs to be convenient for consumers to be able to to access uh we want to be one of the best on-ramps into crypto where you can easily buy with a visa debit card and so we think that's a major major role that we can help play for the industry uh to move funds you know into crypto and then to let consumers be able to get back out and spend it at merchants and so you know we think that we can accelerate you know the growth and adoption of crypto across the world in a way that very few organizations can and we're absolutely committed to doing that diego what's your take same question yeah i think there is a common question for for us which is in a world where self-custody and be your own bank is part of the ethos and how things were created why would i use a platform that is centralized around a traditional delaware c-corp and the answer to that is that you're focusing on the wrong aspect it really is not about centralization decentralization i believe it is around the gatekeepers in the traditional world there are gatekeepers to access fiat and allow you to transfer fiat in crypto world as long as there are no gatekeepers as long as you can integrate directly with ethereum and bitcoin and anchorage does not allow you to this cannot stop you from doing so then we still have the ability of doing self-custody and people will still be able to always do it while benefiting from the fact that anchorage is specialized it is not centralization it's specialization the reality is that very large institutions and even consumers really can't do the type of custody that is necessary for private keys that are completely irrecoverable and are storing trillions of dollars and so i think it's a lot more about specialization than centralization and as long as these companies can allow the permissionless innovation that has happened in crypto over the past 12 years and can act as gatekeepers to these networks then these things are not against the ethos it is not self-custody or centralized custody it is about both you can keep some of your assets on your own and you can keep assets on a centralized entity that is specialized in doing the right thing then finally i just want to say that institutions do have a legal requirement to use third-party custodians and anchorage is the only unambiguous qualified custodian in the united states because of our occ chartered bank and so sometimes these entities don't even have a choice they can't really do self-custody not only they don't have the technical talent in the ability but they can't from a regulatory perspective do it fantastic guys thank you for guiding us through the d5 mullet it's been an absolute pleasure kai diogo take care thank you for having us guys fantastic conversation action items for you today we will
