[Music] welcome to state of the nation david and i are super excited to have you tuned in to this special episode where we are talking to the founders of three arrows capital a fantastic very large investment firm we're talking about their rotation into ether the asset david they're pretty bullish man what's your take on this episode it's always funny when we bring on guests who haven't historically been eath maxies and then they come on and they're more bullish than us like both of us put together yeah that's exactly what happened suzu and kyle davies of three arrows capital they are famous for generally just getting things right having incredible reads on so many different things all at once on-chain metrics you know mainstream media and narratives you know crypto twitter look man they make the trade you wish you made but they do it six months in advance like almost consistently every time it's how i think about them yeah and and so let it be known like traders can be successful and and these guys have been one of the uh most successful trading firms and perhaps in crypto history period question mark i don't actually know but it definitely it definitely feels like that and so they have a lot of prowess a lot of clout and so people definitely pay attention to what three arrows capital is doing and recently they have gotten very loud about their ether rotation there was a very big podcast that went around on uncommon core with uh kobe a multi-cycler uh crypto trader uh and and suzu who's one of the one of the guests one of the two guests one of the two founders of the three hours capital about the flipping right ether flipping bitcoin and the ether trade and the just the magnitude of both kobe and suzu uh publicly talking about their conviction about the eat flipping was a big deal in of itself and so we got kyle and sue which is actually the first time they've actually ever been on a podcast together we got them both on to talk and go into more detail about this ether rotation this massive just price run up of ether we are at six green weekly candles of on the ether us dollar chart and the ether bitcoin chart uh ether just painted a 1 000 ether weekly candle last week with it's when its previous uh 2017 all-time high was one thousand four hundred and forty dollars uh so painting a one thousand dollar weekly candle is absolutely insane and we asked i asked uh sue like sue let's let's try and measure the magnitude of this move like and i asked him do you think this is the biggest event in crypto's history and he said yes and that that's bullish that's pretty much how the podcast went a lot of a lot of that back and forth a lot of bullishness um guys we usually do state of the nation live recorded we weren't able to do that this week just because of time zone conflicts so this is pre-recorded and playing to you right now but this is just a fantastic episode about the eth trade a trade that uh i think is the one to make if you don't have enough exposure to eath right now and certainly the three arrow capitals folks do as well just a few other things before we get in what's new in the nation in the bankless nation this week we just dropped a fantastic episode with vitalik on legitimacy guys i can't say enough about vitalik of course but this episode specifically if you don't understand legitimacy you don't understand crypto that's what i walked away from that episode with it's kind of the theory of everything it answers many of krypto's frequently asked questions and i think you need to wrap your mind around the episode metallic was just brilliant at laying out the case for what legitimacy it is and why it's so important in crypto david any other reflections on that episode yeah i frequently say that the crypto vantage point over just the world at large not just the financial world the macro world but almost almost the whole entire world the the perspective and the position of viewing the world that crypto gives you is really advantageous and i don't think you can get that in any other industry and that's really well embodied by this particular episode with vitalik where we just answer some very fundamental questions not about crypto but about the universe the whole the whole goddamn thing and it just happens to apply extremely well to crypto and answer some of crypto's like most frequent like you said the free most frequently asked questions and you know a a composed theory of everything uh which is embodied by legitimacy i think really does a good job helping people understand why things are what they are in crypto uh and i think the the the the fastest way i could explain this this podcast and how it relates to crypto specifically is that crypto doesn't have any real world assets ether bitcoin they're all virtual and the reason why these things are valuable while still not being real or at least tangible is because of legitimacy and so that's why ryan says if you don't understand legitimacy you don't understand crypto so if you listen to bank lists you basically have to listen to this episode yeah you have to there's no other choice guys also um one last opportunity we want to share with you our friends at upshot are running a beta promotion for bankless badge holders upshot of course they are becoming the zillow of nft pricing so you know how zillow has a zestimate so you can see the price of your nft they have that as well and they've opened the beta to bankless listeners you could basically do like a hot or not which nft do you like better which nft is worth more and you earn from directly from the upshot protocol from your appraisal that's what you're doing you're saying this nft is better than that one and you're earning usdc and upshot tokens as well so make sure you check out what upshot is running you can go to app.upshot.io there's also a link in the show notes david are you ready to get into this episode man absolutely before we do i gotta ask you the question i ask everyone what is the state of the nation today sir the state of the nation is rebalancing all of the crypto world seems to be rebalancing uh there seems to be just a massive inflow into ether and i think that also comes from outside of crypto and so is there some institutions that i would not yet consider part of the bankless nation but they are rebalancing into ether and therefore rebalancing into the bankless nation all the same meanwhile we have uh you know long time bitcoiners uh rebalancing into ether generally people are the this massive trade this massive move into ether that people are making is really people who were perpetually underway ether and just did not have a a measured amount of ether exposure and they are now rebalancing their portfolio into ether if you've been in ethereum since you know i since i got into into 2017 ryan you got in i think in the into into the world of crypto in 2016. if you've been paying attention to ethereum you have been waiting for this moment and if feel it the fact that it's actually here kind of feels like a unicorn but uh regardless it's here the unicorn exists and people are rebalancing into ether now all you have to do is ride that unicorn right david rebalancing is the theme for today david remind me to tell you the story i actually got my first dm from a bitcoin maximalist that said actually i have changed my mind on ether um off to share that story with you maybe we'll share it on the weekly rollups but uh anyway stay tuned well for what it's worth suzu shared similar stories on this episode so there's more where that came from yeah i don't know how rare that's going to be but my first one ever so sort of exciting stay tuned for this fantastic episode we're going to dive right in but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this bankless episode possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uniswap dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol what does that mean synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks traders can use the quenta exchange which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics traders on cuenta can trade synthetic tokens like sbtc s oil or sd5 because quinta is powered by synthetics traders experience zero slippage on their trades no i didn't mean low slippage i meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform no slippage on your trades you can also easily short assets with isynths which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects if you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform and not found in the legacy world check out quenta.io if you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral go to www.synthetics.io where you can stake your snx or ethe and earn fees from synthetics bankless nation we are super excited about our next guest we have suzu and kyle davies they are legendary crypto traders founders of the legendary crypto fund three arrows capital we are talking today all about their eath trade guys someone said you were bullish on eth is that true definitely true definitely not untrue well well welcome to bank list we are excited to dive into this this is going to be a really exciting episode i've heard actually this is the first podcast episode that the two of you are doing together is that right wow first time all right well this is exciting you know before we dig in and i think the the context for this episode is all about the eath trade that you guys have been talking about but dave and i want to get a sense of how you guys think about crypto so the bankless platform is like i would say almost notoriously long time horizon right so it's like buy and hold here the crypto money assets d5 is going to be big buy and hold we place a lot less emphasis on the trading side of things but you guys are traders can you talk about how that's different and how you approach uh crypto from a trading perspective how that's different from maybe narrative investing long-term buy and hold we'll start with you sue yeah i think it is actually similar in a lot of ways uh probably more similar than it is dissimilar i i guess the one bigger difference would be sort of reflexivity and seeing when certain ideas or certain narratives are sort of best best positioned to take shape so a good example is like you know if you're denominated in eth but it's late 2017 or early 2018 you know even if you believe in it you you may think also that icos just have millions of eve that they don't really know what to do with and they need to pay people with so that that kind of you know may may make someone who's a long-term believer in eve think still that they have to first go into stable coins for a while and then buy the bottom or or or buy when it's you know been flushed out so i think just like being aware despite the long-term view or the midterm view what what the short-term actors are most likely going to do uh sort of just thinking about uh those kind of flows is something that again keeps us apart i guess so kyle what would you say to that uh yeah i would say it's uh we're much more similar in your mentality here uh in the sense that for the better part of two years we've been like long right so uh maybe 95 of the time we've been like pretty close to almost a full allocation long uh it's just a question of what we denominate in and what we um you know it and how what the composition of our book looks like so just so happens right now that you know we we're extremely overweight eve um but uh it's not like we were you know we've been long crypto like all the way through right and that's that's actually i think something that really sets apart three arrows from a lot of other uh trading firms or market makers uh long only funds they're long only for sure but for like uh individuals or trading firms people that don't necessarily have to be long uh and have to make a decision we we made that decision we made the decision that we uh you know we do take a core long belief in in crypto as well so when you're going long it sounds like there's like almost two layers to your strategy right so you have sort of the the long strategy where you've got these fundamental assets that you denominate in maybe that changes too sometimes that's bitcoin sometimes that's eth but it's always crypto and then you have like trade optimizations at the at the second layer as he was saying when a narrative's time is right or when in assets as time time is right you flip into those trading positions to optimize is that a good way to think about it kyle yeah i think that's reasonable and and part of that i think uh we like we're involved in uh the funding trade uh so spot versus futures looking at that basis um we're involved in you know in uh primary investment across a number of different uh other projects as well and so we have a reasonable pulse on you know what we think is going to be big when and like if the market gets a little overheated and i think that's why you know we're not just uh like a blindly long a single you know a particular asset for like a long period of time where we're rather saying the book is long but now how do you want to denominate and how do you want this composition to look like i see i do see a lot of resonance with at least with my mental models and maybe some of the things that we say on on bank list where we talk about uh you know uh maximize your exposure to the crypto monies and that's what we call basically bitcoin and eth and then also speculate in the app layer uh and that app layer could also be you know um not not actually applications but also applications but also perhaps um you know just seed investments into actual you know companies and teams uh sue when uh you mentioned that you know you you uh when we were talking about 2018 2019 you were talking about all these icos that had all this ethan didn't know what to do with it and you integrated that into perhaps your model about the markets you and your and your trade you know generally speaking more generally what signals or or indicators do you guys really pay attention to like where what what sources of information do you really consistently look at to inform your trades that's a it's a really tough question because it honestly depends i mean we try to be as intuitive as possible actually and as kind of as macro as possible so i think you know with some smaller trades it can be more it can be more finesse or bit more quantitative but with like bitcoin or ether allocation or bitcoin dominance it's really the whole it's really the whole i think environment that we're in right now so i think that we're in a backdrop where bitcoin has 3x off its previous all-time high you know 20 to 60k and it's running into a lot of resistance a lot of people selling at the 3x all-time high and this isn't a backdrop where ether has had probably its strongest tokenomics uh upgrades as a base money that it's ever had in its history and also in a backdrop where across many retail on-ramps and also just emerging market on-ramps eth is already outpacing bitcoin as people's first buy in fact doj is actually outpacing bitcoin in some of these on-ramps as well so this this environment uh is incredibly bearish for bitcoin dominance uh and also it's an environment where now after the flush out in eve uh and i would argue that there's been basically three flush outs from 2018 to now uh three distinct waves of flushouts there's pretty much no one that has eath that doesn't know why they have it like everyone who has eat now they really put in a proof of work to have that ease right because you could have lost it so many ways you you could have sold it all to dollars at the bottom or near the bottom you could have sold it all to bitcoin uh during the bear market you could have sold it all to like even to applications right like has outpaced a lot of applications by a massive margin now as well so i kind of see that as sort of a massive scarcity play now that's happening where eth is scarce versus not just like against fiat but also scarce against the bitcoin the very overweight bitcoin people but then also even within ethereum itself a lot of people don't have enough uh ether because they either thought it was frothy when you know layer ones were pumping then they sold to dollars a lot of people did that actually shockingly uh that i found out and and so that whole environment is just very conducive to now and you're kind of seeing that squeeze the articulation as to everyone who's holding eth can articulate why they are holding eath is is not something that i thought about that's that's a pretty cool perspective um kyle the last time you and i talked was actually in november of 2020 and we were talking about on my other podcast pov crypto pod about how uh three hours capital was rotating heavily into into bitcoin and really maximizing its bitcoin exposure while reducing its defy and ethereum exposure and this was coming right after um you know defy summer right d5 summer was definitely cooling off uh and that was the right move bitcoin was like 10k at the time and that's and then you know just three or four months later it was then 50k uh and and so um let's start i want to kind of let's start that kind of our conversation uh there where we left off in in november you guys were overweight at btc and underweight ethic that trade worked when you rebalanced your portfolio next after that after that trade worked uh what did you rebalance your portfolio into and was that was that the east trade that you guys find yourselves in today or was that was there a middle trade between now and then uh so the first thing i should say is for application layer for d5 uh it's a completely distinct group it's defiance capital they have their own capital allocation and they work with teams and they're long only so for us if we believe there is going to be uh you know cooling off of uh alts or defy or whatever it may be uh we're not selling meat um so we are uh very much we have to head for something else um so that's that's a lot where uh you know we actually had a short on eighth um but that short was not a naked short it was short against you know a large portfolio of applications right um with the thought being that we still want to win deal flow we still want to work with teams we still want to be long-term invested in applications so this made sense um and dominance ran all the way up to uh 73 um i was calling for 20 75 i think we got almost all the way there um but uh but yeah and then uh i think the the next big uh portfolio allocation was leading into the uh coinbase uh yeah uh like about a month before that we were looking at it thinking uh this would be extremely bullish ethereum basically um for many reasons but uh but basically this is when we started to think it would you know it was time to start moving that allocation around and then uh you know a little bit before uh we went you know very very overweight what was the connection between coinbase and ethereum can you elaborate on that for bitcoin dominance uh like it takes a certain kind of narrative for a law for for bitcoin dominance to work but part of that is not uh capital raises or uh because any time there's a capital race people have to make a decision and any time there's um you know like for example anytime there's applications working people have to make a decision or and anytime there's a decision there's some uh sort of diversification that happens and people look at on-chain metrics and they look at many different things right um and i yeah so around a coin based ipo where they've got you know the largest u.s exchange with many different assets on it and a lot of their marketing is around uh you know people trading those assets and um yeah i i think by and large that was going to be a like a big uh ethereum bold case sue anything you want to add to that yeah i think also you know the coinbase shareholders they're very overweight i think in general too just in terms of both philosophy as well as their own coin holdings i would suspect so i think you know i mean in late 2017 i think brian armstrong himself said he owns more ethereum than bitcoin um and and so i think i think coinbase like carl mentioned is very bullish for e because it's it's it's sort of their it's sort of their bread and butter almost at this point sue in august of 2020 uh you on on a podcast again i also think uh pov crypto pod you said that you thought it was unlikely that eth would ever flip in bitcoin uh but recently on the uncommon core podcast with kobe and hazu you and all the other guests seemed pretty convicted that ethereum would flip in bitcoin at some point in time do you remember what the catalyst was that changed your mind on this and when did this happen for me i think it was a number of factors one is raul paul i think actually it's quite influential in my thinking just seeing his idea that new high net worth investors coming into the space institutions they ultimately respect network effects and they respect uh the size of the network and the utility of the network and so i think when people start looking at it that way if that's their framework and they don't come in assuming a monetary maximalism will take over the space then i think that if you start putting metrics side by side for each of the networks in each of the coins then i think ethereum stacks up very well and i think there's also something to the idea that that people want a productive store value as opposed to a non-productive one i've heard that quite a bit in people i've spoken with um where you know they don't put a whole lot of nonprofit suvs in the portfolio if you're a pension fund you don't even put gold in a pension fund but you do put productive assets like commercial reads like like you know things that earn a yield and so there a lot of people are really interested in what happens with ethereum once it has a yield no now that it has one people are seeing it and i think too that um i mean if you asked me back in august 2020 i would have said that you know it looks like sailor is going to be the first and then there's going to be a lot of other companies that do this uh putting bitcoin in the treasury but you know it's already it's already going into mid q2 and it's still not that many companies that have done it right and the the kind of price action doesn't appear like there's a lot of treasuries doing it and so once you see this kind of skepticism toward this just like everyone's going to hold this in the treasury then the sort of the game is open again and and the you know the the the kind of battle for store value continues and and so that kind of made me think that um if these things are all true then one you know retail already likes eth more than bitcoin because they resonate more with the internet of value as opposed to digital gold and then two is institutions want to own what other people own and on top of that they also like productive sovs and then thirdly you know we've already had a nice bitcoin run and we already had sort of a activation of supply you know above 60k that that kind of really puts the pieces in place i think for kind of seeing that uh kyle i definitely want to get your opinion on uh if you think ethereum is flipping bitcoin but before we get there sue you said that um you know you're seeing just a lot of interest in pre uh productive assets over non-productive assets and uh perhaps positioning a trade base off of that but but what do you personally believe do you personally believe in productive assets over non-productive assets do you have an opinion on such a matter i i do but i think it's it's not as relevant what my opinion on it is at any moment it's ultimately what people decide right like if people if we're in a war time and no one then there's very low activity but then then the bitcoin then the bitcoin monetary maximus argument can be the most valid because then people really do value that slight decentralization edge that bitcoin has over ethereum right as a like as a base money and and so but but if we're in an environment where people are not going to be able to quantify that value very well uh of how much more bitcoin is decentralized than ethereum just like you know in ethereum smart contract space too most people can't quantify the difference between ethereum's uh you know decentralization and solana or some other chain then you are going to have a lot of people be quite okay with that and i think it ultimately depends on what users need crypto for and what people want to use them for and and i do think that um in a much larger percentage of cases than people right now believe that is going to be a preference for ether um so sue i i think some of the bear case around ether up to this point is um part of the case that yes people recognize that ether will become a productive asset stake it is enabled but you just mentioned another crypto network called solana right and there's not just solana there's you know cardano there's a binance smart chain all of these things many of these are staking assets right and so all these other layer one assets can become productive assets as well when they're staked but you made a distinction which i think is important you called eth a productive sov asset which means of course listeners will be familiar with store value asset which implies some level of monetary premium right and bitcoin of course quite famously has a fantastic monetary premium people believe it is a store of value the bear case for ether up to this point is has been i think that um even if ether becomes a productive asset people won't value it as a store of value it won't will not have a monetary premium has all of these competitors these other layer ones that can also do the same things it is doing and you know it's not bitcoin bitcoin is crypto's reserve asset has the store of value property those use cases won't flow over to ether i want to ask about that the store of value-ness of ether specifically and whether you think that is a moat that other layer ones can't overcome and how it has started to achieve this in your mind can you reflect on that sure i think it's first of all it's very hard to just come up with a new store of value right because it's not just about the tech it's also about the community and about the coin distribution about the genie coefficients about how do people work to get the supply that they have and how do they value it uh so i think that in a way it's quite beautiful for ethereum that has been done proof of work up to now because each ether that has entered supply it has been costly um and and that process has made it so that supply has decentralized out and that is going to be a huge struggle for a lot of proof-of-stake networks where you know the the a fairly smaller number of participants are going to have more of the coins and it's very hard to distribute away so i think distribution ethereum has a huge edge i think um also in terms of in terms of the the competition for smart contract block space i do think that any time you have smart contracts actually being deployed on chain and being used whether that's on ethereum or another chain i actually think that's very bullish for ethereum because it goes against the entire bitcoin not blockchain argument which is that blockchains are not that useful the only use case of blockchains is money well it turns out not and then you know with interoperability and with sort of uh bridging of assets across chains you you know ethereum stands to be in very good shape in an unchained world because uh there will be a huge number of participants who do value the highest decentralization for on-chain activity and more so there will be a lot of developers that build applications for that so i think it's it's almost kind of ironic because i think despite the whole eth killer narrative it's actually i think these have been actually very good for ethereum because one has pushed the application progress very quickly it pushed the scaling progress very quickly and two i think it's that it's shown the world that there's actually a lot of demand for on-chain space like you think about bsc right bsc has shown that if you if you did have lower fees then here here's what users would actually do if they had this uh so so so our take has been up to this point that there are two crypto assets that are emerging as a store of value bitcoin and ether right and others could emerge as a store of value but like not anytime soon and probably not this cycle does that take overstate you know what what you're saying do you think other layer one assets could become astora valley in the future i think doge i think doge arguably is is starting to look like it could be because it's got absolutely incredible volumes right and it's got absolutely incredible memes as well so i don't see anything also very old also very old and very decentralized so i don't see any reason why it can't be and i do think doge is something too where it definitely helps ethereum in a way because it just chips at this idea of bitcoin monetary maximalism because bitcoin monetary maxim wants to say it wants to assert that 21 mil supply cap is the reason why it has any value it wants to assert that uh you know these are all the reasons why it has value but meanwhile doshas comes in with no cap and and outperforms and it also kills the narrative that you know there's no alt that can beat that can be up in sats well actually you're up actually a massive amount in science in doge so that that kind of just the presence of doge i think has been one of the biggest bearish bitcoin dominance cases because now everyone sees doge and they're like okay then i don't have to just you know denominate in stats i don't have to just i can also just see what what's fun and i can explore all these different assets and so that i think is also becoming a story value i mean it's also very cheap right and it's very usable so it's i mean granted not many many people are using it but it it it does offer a different niche um but you guys aren't long doge right where are you we are not we are not long dough why what's the difference um it's it's something we may belong in the future uh but it's definitely an interesting asset that i think caught everyone by surprise as well call that people by surprise but i think it does show the power of i think it does show the power of memes right and and it and it definitely contributes to ether's meme being more stronger than ever because with the ultrasound money meme now it gives space for ethereum to come in and say uh well we are actually even lower inflation and uh you know you get a natural yield from holding it so so the that kind of contrast is going to be very stark for people when they when they checked out the space kyle before i asked my next question to you do you have any reflections on what we've been talking with sue uh recently yeah the only part i would add is a deflationary asset is is really going to resonate with a lot of people um i think there's like there's this point where you're you know you're bullish ethereum the network and uh you say especially you see all the fees that are happening on it and then but you had to ask about the value pool and it's just a speculation on that but once you can see that it's a deflationary asset uh or it gets i mean it's no longer a meat it's just like it's actually deflationary and i think that will um that that moves a lot of people the needle for a lot of people kyle some people are still skeptical that deflationary acid is actually going to happen we are still in a pre-implementation world of eip-1559 and of course the uh proof-of-stake to pre like the proof of work merge has not happened yet um so some people will say yeah there's a ton of execution risk in taking the position that you're betting in a deflationary asset what would you say about that um yeah i mean there's i i definitely believe in uh you know discounting execution risk but that's like what makes a great trade too right or a great investment so i mean if it was fully priced in like i don't know maybe he could be 15k right now so um i don't know where it would be but um by the way yeah it'd be a very different investment wait 15k is fud too what's what's uh if it's if everything is priced right i think 15k is bud but wow i do want it i do want to get into is that specific number but first i want to and to ask kyle uh kyle sue here was on on that that podcast with with kobe and hazu talking about the inevitability of the flipping do you agree yeah yeah i definitely do i think uh the closer it gets to um like it just has to make a run at it um especially the nice thing about the current state of the ethereum roadmap too is uh there are events happening in like two months and like seven months out so even after one five five nine like there there's no cell catalyst like there's you're still waiting for the just the next one right like and it's within a reasonable uh time if it's like years out yeah it's a little bit different story or if there's you know we're post uh like in a post proof-of-stake world then now you need to price it and just believe it's going to hit you know the you know the the correct whatever uh you know p e ratio or however you're valuing these things but uh but free that yeah you can just execution risk if you believe in it you believe there's less execution risk great trade for you yeah yeah ethereum seems to have a lot of arrows in in its quiver and we've talked to a decent uh we've danced around the subject around like mainstream media and you know public narrative with this current like ether move and and overall how you guys position your trades uh and and i kind of want to attack that subject a little bit more directly so how are you guys waiting mainstream media and its current like uh understanding of this space the bitcoin and the the bitcoin trade the ether trade the the everything else trade um but also uh more specifically uh do you guys consider like the energy consumption part of this perhaps this ethereum move late uh as of late or do you guys think perhaps that's not here yet i think it's not quite here yet because the merge hasn't happened so i think you will actually need the merge to happen before the mainstream media will pick up on it uh because that's just the way media is um so i do think that that'll be another great catalyst i think also it's like a it's a big contrast to late last year right where you know fbtc went to 0.042 on the beacon chain activation and also on d5 somewhere and that was kind of like a like it's kind of like a premature move in a way because that was right like when bitcoin was about to get you know sailors gonna buy absolute monster load of bitcoin there's a lot of you know high net worth and corporate buying a bitcoin and and so that was almost like a it was too early because it was too far away from eip 1.59 that was more just an idea at that point uh that was getting traction but like also like now we are in the midst of you know the media picking up on the fact that you know ethereum uh may become more deflationary than before and the media is picking up also on the fact that d5 is not just uh it's not just a small meme anymore it's not not just a niche it's something massive right we have you know we have global governments looking at how to you know deal with dfi and how to encourage it even and so i think that that that kind of backdrop and also nifties as well i think you know we haven't discussed nifty's yet but i think nitis is incredibly bullish for either because now culture uh culture is now native to ethereum and i think once you get culture as well that's actually when a lot of people wake up because they say well i can be bearish on bitcoin as a store value because i think it has no use but i cannot be bearish on culture existing on ethereum i just that that's an incoherent position to take right so i think the fact that you know athletes and and artists and musicians are are you know getting very active in the nifty market that brings incredible cultural prestige to the idea of ethereum as a settlement layer and and that i think is actually incredibly difficult for anyone else to fight against either because that that does have a lot of network effects i i want to say something about this and ask a follow-up on this because um this is something dave and i have been talking about for a while like the most bullish thing for ether is to be understood and i i still feel like we are so early in the cycle of the world actually understanding ethereum and ether i mean you look at like uh google searches and bitcoin is way up there ethereum's almost nothing nfts have done something but people stuff and associated nfts with ether as an asset i i'm curious how early you think we are it feels like mainstream understands what bitcoin is like bitcoin digital gold people on wall street can articulate that if you ask random person on the street he could probably articulate that as well but they do not understand eath or ethereum and this is where i see much of the upside so if you consider that eip1559 is going to happen proof of stake is going to happen right the majority of the the bull case upside is actually the world understanding these things and for the first time understanding the asset and i'm am i overstating the case here i feel like the world is maybe like five to ten percent of the way to understanding ethereum and there are very few people who actually know about eip 1559 and fee burn and that issuance is going to drop deflationary like there's a very small cult group that knows about it now um am i overstating the case how early are we on that sue maybe you first i think we're very early in terms of people getting a proper understanding of ethereum i think nowadays even most i mean like even skeptics they roughly understand how bitcoin works but just in terms of the basics of how ethereum works it's a more complex chain and there's a lot of activity going on so um a lot of skeptics don't even realize that a lot of the skepticism that they have toward bitcoin they can't use on ethereum uh in the same way so i absolutely agree with you i will say just as a slight counter to that though is that i do think that retail they're naturally much more drawn to ethereum in the first place because they already don't resonate as much with digital gold and they also they you know either they participated in icos back then or they you know nowadays they participate in you know some other activities but i do think that there's something very fascinating about the fact that i think retail has been more overweight either than a lot of institutions up to now and i think that they've been right as well and that kind of actually is almost like a fractal of like crypto itself where retail has also been ahead of institutions and also has been right you know d5 was invested in by retail mainly uh during its first run-ups and and and so that kind of almost like makes it that much more powerful in a way that it is grassroots individuals and and as opposed to entities that have been capturing a lot of these moves i gotta say retail being first is one of my favorite things about crypto it's just great i love it hey bankless nation i hope you're enjoying the interview thus far in the second half of this conversation we go into the specific details of the numbers behind the ether trade like i said in the intro eth is on its sixth weekly green candle in a row both against the dollar and against bitcoin and i asked sue to help us measure the magnitude of this move and his answer was a really fun one and then at the end of this conversation we zoom out and have the conversation about cryptocycles uh sue and kyle actually have differing opinions about what the future of crypto cycles looks like sue thinks that this is generally going to be perhaps the last cryptocycle kyle is not yet convinced uh and then we get into uh price predictions where sue unlike most of our guests sue did not dance around the the issue and actually gave a specific number of what he thinks ether could run to in the short to medium term stay tuned for the second half of this episode but first before we get there we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in

mobile now at metamask.io and start swapping so i want to get into this actually the details of this current ether move and specifically the ether trade so so right now ether is on its sixth a weekly green candle uh both on the dollar and on btc uh ether just painted its biggest green weekly green candle ever um at almost a thousand dollars in one week absolutely massive for for an asset that's previous all-time high was 1 400 uh it's up 25 in the week uh meanwhile like ether btc is point over 0.07 which it's only been a higher uh or it's only ever been higher versus bitcoin for like i think a total of five or six months in all of its lifespan how do you guys explain this massive move of ethereum like and and also can you help us measure its magnitude because you know crypto's crazy so sometimes crazy things are actually not all that crazy because you know we're inside of a uh we're inside of just a crazy world so it's hard to measure craziness um so so can you guys reflect on that how how big is this move and why is this move happening uh kyle let's start with you yeah um well i think there's a real power to prove like a proof of lindy so um before something like hits an all-time high again especially after a big flush out uh there's always a question of you know is this a dead cat bounce or is this uh you know what is the value of this asset and that's not correct like that i mean lindy just means is it alive right that's the definition but uh but actually people don't realize it until you start breaking all-time highs so uh so for if bitcoin did it first right versus its 2017 all-time high but for ethereum now um this is like when people wake up this isn't you know when people capitulate or they take profit like this is when this woman people that were in ethereum that heard about it that uh had some money allocated probably lost a bunch in 2018 um this is when they they they load up um and that's i think what we were saying like anytime we're looking at uh all-time highs um it gets me excited because same goes for like nfts uh you know you we saw uh crypto kitties and uh in 2017 but then we saw nothing for a long time right but now we see an emergence again this is a proof of blending like that the the likelihood of a big nft boom again or like a continuation is now actually quite high right whereas just as of last year was demonstrably lower right so um i think that's uh that that is really important actually um so kyle what about this right so this almost seems to be playing out almost in a similar way to the way uh 2017 played out i don't know if you think that it's kind of a fractal to 2017 or not maybe you could comment on that but the one thing that's different is uh ether right now is approaching half a trillion dollar market cap right this was not the case when it started its run in 2017. so isn't it going to take a lot more money more capital bigger buyers in order to to move the price in the way that it did in 2017 any reflections on that and where is this money coming from i mean there is just so much money in the world these days and people were saying the same thing about bitcoin when it was like 10k and anytime i went to 10.5 people just thought it was gonna get crushed again and then it went straight to like 55 like all the way up to 60k right so um i think that is much more remarkable in terms of the volume of dollars that went in to buy bitcoin um but yeah there's just so much money in the world like if you have to ask yourself like where where's the incremental dollar to go in this i don't i just feel like that's the wrong question um and and the i mean the answer here is going to be it's going to come from bitcoin and it's going to come from uh dollars basically right um but i i just feel like if you have to think of like who the incremental buyer is every time that's what's gonna that's just you're looking for reasons to sell and you can and if you're looking for reasons to sell you will always find them it's uh this particular argument to me never holds weight like who is the incremental buyer because yes obviously at the top there's no incremental part but like did your analysis truly bring you to like a good conclusion there or not i think that is uh yeah well said so let's talk about the the magnitude of this move and in my opinion this ethereum uh move both versus dollar and versus bitcoin is perhaps uh one of crypto's largest events ever in its 12-year history would you guys agree with that kind of like bold statement uh let's start with you yes absolutely i think that it's broken key 2018 levels and it's it's at the point now where like i know people that have flown around the world to move their bitcoin cold storage to buy either like i know that that sounds kind of insane but i think that that'll continue if it gets to point one right because in the previous you know near flipping cycle you know there were a lot of talks about bitcoin og's moving to ether and bitcoin cash and this kind of stuff and that like then turned out to be a panic and people say well that's repudiated or that's refuted right um but with this key i think the key break was probably 0.05 and then 0.06 a couple days later um you know you you kind of can't it actually it actually kills off a lot of arguments against sort of a more pluralistic distribution of value in in the crypto space um it's definitely making a lot of people wake up right because now if you're an allocator you look into space you saw even the banks right jp morgan they were putting out research about how bitcoin you know analyzing digital gold theses and then they put out another thing about you know just covering the ethereum uh bull run and then saying how you know there are actually a lot of reasons why ethereum might outperform you know the clients are demanding it and the coverage is also demanding it so i think that um and actually i strongly believe i mean mark cuban i think a great example of someone who was skeptical on crypto as a whole but then seeing the adoption of ancient activity through d5 and nifties came came to realize that this was the next inheritor of sort of big tech vision i was speaking with a with a billionaire big tech investor the other day and he was saying how the reason he allocated to crypto uh is purely because of the idea that you know he's been along all these you know big tech internet stocks for many years now and he thinks that um it cannot continue uh in that direction for that much longer like there he's asking himself almost like who's the incremental buyer sort of in your speak but he but he's almost thinking like you know if the generational trends move uh toward a more you know distributed future then it's still very early because no one understands this yet right very few people truly understand this as sort of the inheritor of of the new internet uh so so i think that um it's it basically allows like price is the best predictor of price and price is also the best uh you know it it makes all the narratives it makes people listen to all the narratives so it makes people try to understand and that process is making a lot of people wake up in an allocated so are you seeing maximus capitulate then or are they going down with the ship i mean it's tricky right because if you're if you're if your brand is a twitter bitcoin maximalist then you can't really capitulate in public because you'll lose followers but i'm sure privately a lot of these people own a lot of eth actually um and i think they're not incentivized to talk about it but they they definitely do you can see it in the price action on some of these exchanges um you know the fbtc volume has been incredibly high on bitfinex for instance it's been about a third of the eighth volume on several days you know that's people who currently own a ton of bdc selling that bdc specifically for ether right it's not it's not dollar it's not dollar based buying so um but yeah like um that that kind of also goes along with the idea that um like i always found it funny right like either people they they used to always hold a lot of bitcoin because they'd be like well the market is irrational i need to have some bitcoin just in case and the bigger people out of them they hold a lot of ether because they're like well the market's irrational i have to hold some ether just in case so it ends up being like everyone's 50 50 but for different reasons uh you know that that kind of a lot of people are like doing pascal's wager there now and they're just saying like even if this is like not what i believe in the market i don't like i prefer weld so i just buy the one that the market wants like i don't kind of fight against it i actually think the hardening of uh ether's monetary policies bringing some of these sound money people that have been bitcoiners for a long time over because the one one criticism that i think had a lot of validity from the bitcoin side is like what's ether's plan for issuance into the future right and you know ethereums would say things like minimum vial issuance and they would say yeah but show me the code show me the demand and now that's starting to to harden do you think that's part of the the transfer here the issuance policy being you know formed and articulated well uh i think for sure part of it i think like kobe mentioned the previous one like there's always a camp that thinks that ether is just too uh centralized there's too much control by the core devs and so it can be captured and then once governance is captured then the whole chain is kind of it doesn't have that credible neutrality um so i think for those folks they they take a very philosophical stance against ether but i think yeah i agree with you for a lot of people who just say you know ether is really not optimized for ether holders which has been the case actually for ethereum for quite a long time i remember in 2018 i think one of the big odc desks they put out a paper saying like ether inflation is just way too high we need to lower the block reward from three to two ether three to one ether and you know after some time they ended up doing it and neither price went up um but you know there was just in the beginning because it was growing so fast and utility there was never that concern for the ether holder because they were already getting like you know the i think for the core devs there's this idea that well you're already up 200x you're already up 100x what else do you want like i'm just going to not even think about what either holders want but i think the bear market what it brought out was sort of a like a renewed kind of showing point that ether had to be a proper store value kind of a repudiation of jeremy rubin's idea that you could economically abstract ether out of ethereum so you know if people kind of heard that and then we're like well definitely that's not going to happen and here's why it's not going to happen so i think bitcoin some bitcoiners who saw that were like okay well now uh this is an investable asset because people are last they're at least committed to this being an asset uh as opposed to something other than an asset because there were quite vocal people in ethereum who said eath is not an asset like to make it an asset would be to harm ethereum's goal right that was actually a very popular view in 2018 yeah it was right on kyle any reflections on what we've been talking about so far for me it's all about on-chain activity to be honest like uh defy summer was fully incentivized um but then it came back and it's still uh and the yields are still good and uh sometimes it's even happening on other chains that are evm compatible right so anytime i see on-chain activity uh i just feel like it's it's a bold case for you um i don't really care where it is especially since the first bridge people always build is to ethereum and everything is evm compatible these days so yeah for me it's all about on-chain activity for ethereum i can't remember where i heard this sue maybe it was on the uh the kobe podcast that thoros capital is the the largest single holder of ether uh is that true and if that is true or regardless if that's true or not when is this trade over win win sell question mark definitely not largest but i think i said one of the largest one in the largest i think that is definitely true i've been trying to figure out what qualifies as one of the largest and i made sure we bought the needful amount to qualify um like i was just saying kyle like it'd be such a shame if we bought like these other coins and then we didn't have enough ether like and then and then it went for this move like that would just be like it'd be really sad actually like i would actually shed a tier well welcome aboard guys so so um but you know like the cool thing about e32 is like even as the market gets more efficient whatever like you you can kind of imagine a world where you still have a lot of yields for it you can put it in d5 and get yields you can stake it and get yields there's just so many there's so much activity happening right and there's so many ways to use it i think that's really attractive whereas like now with edc like the gbtc trade is dead it's actually negative and then with bdc as well it's just it's just a very inert kind of thing and originally i thought that wbdc would be more bearish for ether than it was because i thought like each chain would just like lionize bitcoin as like the store value collateral but that really hasn't happened at all people do prefer the actual native asset even on bsc people prefer bnb uh and and and so that kind of preference for the native asset that kind of that kind of native asset nationalism i think i kind of underestimated and i and i do think that what wbdc actually did was convert a lot of bitcoins to ethereum because they just put their bdc in there for the years because they saw their friends getting it and then they're like wait a second like this is actually it's actually kind of cool and i need to own some of this like ether instead and and and so that that actually is what actually happened so there's this reserve asset quality to it on on d5 yeah go ahead kyle yeah i think one of the other uh like ultra bold cases for me is um people realize this past year that they could store their net worth on a theory whether in and maybe not even in ethereum for like a lot of people don't steer it on stable coins right they'll happily earn their yields but that would then become like their primary source of how they would store maximize and earn their net worth like on their nest egg right and then naturally yes of course like once you're using it like a platform and a network like of course you go like buy it right like at some point if you're you know have a high risk tolerance you buy a lot if you have a lower dollar you buy a little but like you're right um and i think that is maybe the the like single most pivotal pivotal moment let's say in the past uh year and a half where people uh both created a lot of net worth but also happily store like a large percentage of their net worth just like in the ethereum network uh are you guys east maxis now eath holders for life kyle you have do you have an opinion on this we're crypt okay so we are on chain uh in crypto maxis and have been for like like a while right um and uh if ethereum we believe is like undervalued given the uh you know the amount of activity on the network then yeah like we're probably going to be overweight ethereum right um so yeah like i i i mean if they if things were to change like they were to realize its value or if the on-chain activity were to slow down or if another network where that was not evm compatible were to gain traction then like maybe i would change my thesis but um yeah for like for the time being like i really don't see that at all like everything has to be edm compatible to be you know for people to want to interact with it basically right now right so i think i i actually i think there was this like idea uh and and there still is this idealism that at some point people will interact with blockchain and have no idea what's on the back end right um and this is still a beautiful vision but the reality is like the only way to get even close to this vision right now is for you to be evm and and and for me anything that is is is basically just theory sue anything to add yeah i think that um i mean we definitely always try to pride ourselves on being as sort of bayesian as possible so like with new information coming in you you always have to change kind of a bit how you want to be positioned so like you know if tomorrow uh chinese government comes out and says bitcoin is the only accepted currency then you have to go buy a lot of bitcoin uh you have to probably sell your ether to buy bitcoin um but you know so there's always nonzero events that can happen that make some assets more bullish than others and i think that that's always true so um i think that the risk reward for ether is actually even better now than it was before it's arguably a better risk award now than it was uh during the deeper market where i think you really have to be a true believer and kind of be a deep tech thesis driven investor to to to make that trade because you're getting dumped on by everybody right at that time so i so i really like applaud the kind of thesis driven kind of investors that that went in at that time but i think also like my hope is that they don't kind of just want to you know sell for their 10x 20x to 30x now and then and then move on because i have seen a lot of people do that and i the thing i tell a lot of crypto natives too is like if you if you look if you just talk to natives all day you'll just see people around you and then be like these are like like everyone's too rich now we have to sell because everyone's too rich but like actually no you happen to be in the bear market of one of the best assets in the history of assets and you bought it with your friends like you actually deserve to be rich you don't have to be ashamed of it you can just prefer to keep staying rich right so that that kind of ptsd from the bear market i actually think has caused a lot of people to sell too early on the way up um and and and so i think that um like for us we we we think that you know ethereum has reached the critical mass point where people can't ignore it and the scaling is coming in a variety of ways even if it doesn't come purely on ethereum it'll come through uh side chain type solutions it'll come through other solutions and and on-chain activity like cal state is very good for the entire ethereum bowl case and so i think you want to give that time to play out uh in sort of the fullness of that vision like right now there's still a lot of talk about cbdc's and this kind of stuff like i actually think that a lot of these will be ruled unconstitutional by a lot of jurisdictions and a lot of like judiciaries and what they'll end up having is you know governments if they want to do ubi like they don't have to create a cbdc they can just like do it on a public chain and then you know whether that's ethereum or on another chain like that that happening is also very bullish for ethereum right it's also very bullish for on-chain activities so i think there's still a whole lot of like misunderstanding even now with the ether at 4k about what it is and what the true vision could be um so i like to see a lot of those things properly play out like to see a go deflationary um i i do think that there will be a lot of trading opportunities as you get closer into flipping as well because um there will be a lot of emotional stuff right like some people will be selling to bitcoin some people will be selling the dollars some people will be buying more and and so i think that that will be very volatile like i don't think that will be not volatile but um i think we're nowhere near those points yet uh where we are now so i think we spend actually quite a lot of time it i think to some people it may seem simple that we're just talking about like long bitcoin or long ethereum um but uh there's this illusion of diversification right and um you can spend a lot of time hunting for like the right alt or the right this or whatever and then buy like six of them and then wanted some more and then buy like six more of them and before you know it you got a portfolio of like i don't know 20 different like random like positions that you may or may not believe in uh whereas if you had just like decided to denominate your portfolio in eth you would have outperformed everything right so i think we spend a lot of time just trying to figure out you know what are you denominated in and to what degree are you denominated in that um and then yeah like we happily trade around other positions too but uh that is by far the most important well said guys look if flipping that would be a major event right the first time uh that uh bitcoin was flipping by another crypto asset where does this leave i guess you know two things one where does this leap bitcoin and then secondly where does this leave other eth killers uh kyle we'll start with you um yeah i think the problem with uh let's say other uh layer one smart contract like blockchains is they uh they may or may not have more activity but the amount of fees being paid on them is tiny compared to what's being paid on ethereum and that's part of their value at right high tps low fee whatever but like actually for me the whole value of ethereum is the like sheer volume that people are willing to pay in fees the on-chain activity right and so for me like i like i'm i it's all about that it like yes if there's a flipping that maybe you get a higher monetary uh premium to it uh that i think would be like the obvious case but um but yeah like everything when i think about eat like eat killer or like other layer ones everything comes back to like well is it evm compatible because if if so then i just buy more youth and is it like uh how much like in fees is being paid there and if it's like not very much then like okay i don't really care like so uh or maybe it's good for some other narrative reason but it's not like a like an sov kind of asset david calls himself a fee maximalist i've heard him say this before and i think that's kind of what you're saying too see what about you so if bitcoin loses the throne does it lose its value proposition as sort of the the reserve crypto asset all the liquidity that comes with that throne and what's the fate of bitcoin after that let's go go ahead sue um i'm still undecided on this i talked about this a bit in the kobe podcast also and i i lean toward it being short midterm quite bearish for bitcoin because it would be you will have a lot of people who effectively sitting in bitcoin saying that wow this is like a stale long almost like i i have this long for this thesis but it's been disproven because it's not the most high liquidity and it you know so that would be quite a scary moment for them and i think that then that would be the real test for the ethereum community like will they then sell back to stats and stack more sets or will they really just hold each and if they do just hold each then then i think that that's it's gonna be very hard to attract additional dollars into bitcoin because then at that point um like i was just speaking with one of the one of my good friends in in ethereum and he was saying how you know if flipping bitcoin the the wrong question is like is it bearish for bitcoin the next the right question is how many days would it take doge to flip bitcoin next because he said he flipped bitcoin very quickly in early 2018 and then xrp came right after right and almost flipped it and so like he's saying like that like if he flippants pick one he says you go all in on like whatever is the third coin at that moment because that's like kind of like the obvious trade that would happen so i do see that it's kind of being like highly emotional and highly disruptive time if that were to happen like you're kind of alluding to and i think there'll be a lot of interesting opportunities for sure at that time um you know i think long term it's a different question i do think that like i still believe in all of bitcoin's core um core kind of strengths but the ultimate question like kobe said on his podcast is like does the market demand these things right does it demand bitcoin caliber decentralization does it demand fixed supply does it demand uh this kind of fixed issuance with like basically very few upgrades and and you know this kind of ossified protocol does it demand this and that that's also something that only the market can answer right that can't be answered by any individual because the needs of any individual are not relevant for the market the market and society if it demands an on-chain future then that will be very likely in the form of ethereum as a store value and if it demands uh a more austere version of that on chain of that kind of the future that's maybe more you know regulated and then more like government friendly and unlike custody uh you know uh friendly then it'll go toward more that camp so i think like the the bullish bitcoin dominance case has kind of always been the pro custody pro kind of um you know regulated on-ramp case that bitcoin has has generally done better in but even now you know ether had now has all the same on-ramps as bitcoin does on those same things right either also has cme and ether also has the greatest skill trusts and the etfs and and so that that that that definitely does make it very very hard uh for people to attract incremental dollars into the system when you have this uh compare contrast so one more thing i would add to that is um i think the bitcoin uh like the the heart of the bitcoin narrative is about self-custody too right but if you look at the the like main thesis of the past year it has not been about self-custody it's been about like centralized custody right so this uh i think is a huge problem actually for for for bitcoin it is not a beautiful future to have centralized custody with regulated onramps it is a beautiful future to have self-custody and so yeah if that were to change then i think it can be a wonderful store value but if it is like in centralized places i don't know it kind of defeats it it hurts the narrative a lot thanks for the win so zooming out is this the last cycle that crypto is going to see do you guys have opinions on this kyle let's start with you um [Music] i i think that there are more cycles to be honest uh i think sue has a slightly new one he's got a different answer than me um that's why you have both of us on that right so uh yeah i think there are more cycles i just think we're nowhere near the top of this cycle like like an ethereum bull run is not the top of the cycle like we gotta there are other things that are gonna be but it's not an ethereum like on-chain bull run like that's not it yeah i think it's also it comes down to how you define cycles right like um i was thinking avi at block tower about this and he's like you know like your super cycle theory has already come true because there are people talking about like bitcoin versus ether and the only question is which one do they buy it's not a question of like is crypto a scam it's only a question of what do you buy what percent and and so we've already made it like we're already here guys like it's already super cycle uh because no one is even saying it's a scam anymore right and and so you definitely will always have drawdowns i mean even in normal bull markets and equities you you have drawdowns and and i think that i mean d5 arguably against eath is already like in a bear market uh for for some time now uh you know i think it's down like 40 50 percent in eath uh and and so there's kind of always a bear market everywhere and there's always a bull market everywhere uh and i think that that'll be kind of the you know i think in 2018 2019 i predicted that we will see all coin correlations go very low and i think that we're really seeing it now where i think just like the last two weeks the realize all coin correlation has gone to like 30 or something which is like the lowest like ever i can't remember the exact number but that is is a sign of maturity right it's a sign that like there's no concept now of like an alt season like nowadays you see like some days is up 12 percent and a lot of ultra down in dollars and and so like that that kind of uh you know i think doge is contributing to that too where like doge can be up 20 everything's down and and so i think that that kind of decoupling of coins versus other coins is very healthy and um you know after this continues more and more i mean single stock correlations in most healthy stock markets are around 30 as well so you can definitely have markets where uh you know one coin gets very frothy and then it cycles over to another coin or you know all coins fall back you know 20 30 40 but i don't think you're gonna get a 90 fall in either again like i don't think you get that chance again um and the reason why i believe that is because i think the structure of cycles is that it's very often the market gives you that one capitulation and then it's over right so like com you get that 95 down in amazon and then you don't get that you don't get that ever again and then even the dip buyers they're hoping for that 20 dip in amazon they don't get it and they don't get it for like years and you know eat this bull run has been exactly that for a ton of people where they like keep hoping for that proper you know bear candle and like that capitulation and massive liquidation and the locations come but then there's spot buyers that buy right up you know and they wreak and it engulfs a red candle in like two days and and so um like i said like i don't think we're anywhere near the point where you have to be thinking about um going like very conservative um i do agree with him that that point may come but even if you don't look for that point i don't think you have to worry as much because this is now an institutional grade investment right it's not it's not an investment which is a caliber of like we can fall 95 right like after 2017 icos having that much supply and having to dump it to pay their employees like yeah you actually can lose 95 now i think we will not have a 90 drawdown again um i think that that actually is a very contrarian view in crypto because of the nature of cycles but i think that if you zoom out of crypto itself and you put it into let's say overall disruption and tech cycles max payne is actually shallow dips uh because it gets everyone who's been used to bigger dips just to not own enough of the asset that they need to have right guys this has been a really fun episode and you guys are fantastic um thanks for guiding us through the thesis here a little bit in the trade we've talked super cycles no more 90 drawdowns we talked about the flipping sue i want to end with this question because you said 15k earlier in the episode was fud 15k price of eth that is what is a realistic price uh for eth in this build bull cycle for for this trade that you're making what's not fud sir i think we'll go over 25k at least um i think also that you when when the price comes off the block top if there is one i don't think that it will be the style of the old one because i think that um if you if you think about the way that 2017-2018 market microstructure was it was very inefficient right there was very like poor liquidity at that time like bitfenix was 12 below coinbase for instance so like some would argue like the actual prints aren't even real right the 1400 print isn't even real and some of these prints aren't even real um whereas now the market is incredibly efficient the volumes are incredibly high crypto volumes are now already higher than exchange volumes on stock exchanges you know binance volume is higher than uh chinese stock market volume coinbase volume on some days is higher than you know nasdaq actually that might not be true i think it's higher than some some things ftx volume is incredible i mean like in the derivative options market volumes are just absolutely insane and i think that all that stuff that's not coming back right but that's not going back to the way it was because now people can get higher yields people can do things all this kind of stuff so i think that um in general my experience in bull markets is that it goes higher than the most ardent believers believe it will go and that is actually the max payne because they sell it based on a dollar view based on the fact that they can now buy a house they can now buy five houses they can now buy a boat they can buy a bigger boat and then they and then so so max payne is actually them like having been believers but then not making you know the full move of the full move because they think you know they're too focused on their own life basically in terms of like what that money means for their own life um and that's actually the entire story of like pretty much all good assets right all good assets get priced out of so so i think another point kind of back to the like idea of why i think ethereum is such a strong investment because it's one of the few assets i think that is going from many to few in the sense that the you know the wealthier people are trying to figure out how to get more of this from many people whereas a lot of like other coins it is few people who own them and they want to sell them to many people and so this like few to many and many to few i i think is very bullish because it shows the quality of the asset um kyle give us your price prediction before we uh before we head out i'm with sue almost so i i got nothing new to add to that 25k would be a nice target for that um i think for that to happen you need to see uh 1559 happen on schedule and you need to see proof of stake um you see those two things 25k is reasonable david what do you think of this we did an eath bowls episode and even our most bullish bulls this was in december their top was at 20k uh now we're at 25k pretty incredible david what you got last question yeah sue this is a complete complete slight well slight change of subject but you often say this phrase prefer wealth and i actually haven't really completely integrated what that means and so i'm just hoping to ask you directly what does prefer wealth mean there's this idea of like log wealth and linear wealth right and the and the idea of this i mean we kind of saw the twitter fights about it with paradigm and then sbf where spf is saying like i prefer linear wealth and then paradigm saying no all humans prefer log wealth it's just a question of how log and all this kind of hilarious stuff and that's kind of where the preferred wealth meme came out and i think for me what it means is that um [Music] when you make a investment decision or a trading decision you do the one that is to optimize for wealth as linearly as possible because that is the truest uh form of wealth and also that you don't try to let like life things come into that it's almost like a venture approach right like if you make a venture investment in something because it has no liquidity and it has no market to market you don't constantly think about how do you sell it like you just you just write it up and down you just prefer owning the thing itself and i recommend people to view crypto in the same way where it's you've done this investment into it and you just let that sit in that actual bucket uh and you don't think too hard about what this can now buy you in the real world or what this i mean like obviously make sure you don't go broke right and make sure you take care of yourself and definitely fine to spend but you also have to have some part of your brain thinking deep tech venture long-term thesis because that's but that's the whole point of being in investing space in the first place right and so i think that you know that's been kind of my i guess my like lesson to people on twitter which is that you know it's it's actually it's actually totally fine to own assets and if they go up you can keep owning those assets especially if you believe they will continue to make you wealthy there's no need to let's say um um like like basically have this mentality that uh you're constantly looking for when to cash out and when to dump and and when to kind of um start spending the money that you've created you can just grow wealth basically prefer a wealth denomination in crypto money assets i think that's what we're saying i want to end with this quote from from sue it's pinned to the top of his twitter right now if you don't understand crypto and refuse to learn it's going to be a tough century for you i love that i would say the same thing about ether it's going to be a tough century unless you understand this asset this asset
