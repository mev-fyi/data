[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we are here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today oh you know just tending to my fields um there's been a new craze in liquidity mining and yield farming and so that's kind of captured my attention lately it has been attention grabbing uh and we get into that a little bit with our guest uh yeah what was your take on this yeah charlie noyes really smart guy and i was constantly reminded during our conversation with him is how young he is and that's kind of what gets me like so excited about the future of crypto and it's it's a part it's a is a part of the future of crypto that's not coming in like one year not coming in two or three or four years but it's really the whole generational shift is that these young young individuals and i consider myself young and charlie is even way way more young than i am are going to come in as crypto natives and be thinking in crypto native terms and are going to really get familiar with economics with finance with complicated crypto economic systems and they're going to be that's going to be their first monetary system and i think charlie is a good representation of somebody who's coming of age as uh as these crypto platforms like bitcoin and ethereum ethereum are being understood by the greater world and so i'm very bullish on this younger generation of people that's coming up being crypto native and being able to speak crypto before they're able to speak traditional finance so do you know how old alexander hamilton was when he joined the revolution i have no idea 21. sounds like charlie right i mean sounds like charlie we we we think of many of the founding fathers as you know people like george washington ben franklin and we see them in wakes and that sort of thing we forget that so much of the revolution was fought and won by the very young alexander hamilton 21 lafayette 19 years old these are the vanguard of the revolution and why are they doing it because they think differently because they're exploring new opportunities and uh exploring the the infinite white space of what could be uh and you know charlie is is in the revolution for those reasons so his story is fantastic we also talk about some pretty in-depth subjects so it it starts off kind of higher level but then we get into something that is super important and rarely discussed in fact i've never heard it discussed on a podcast before and that is the economic security of bitcoin and ether and whether those assets ether and bitcoin need to become money in order to succeed i won't spoil it for you but that is a fantastic section near the end that you absolutely have to to check out it's not 101 level or or 200 level this is 400 level material i think you're really going to enjoy this important stuff uh to back up the thesis your thesis for this space yeah and what ryan's talking about what we were talking about in the podcast with charlie the minor extractable value component of these systems is really an unsolved problem in the crypto space largely being spearheaded by ethereum researchers and um and so i i always keep my keep an eye on what what they're doing with the whole mev world we'll go into it in the podcast and make sure that we can explain it but i think it's going to become a regular topic in the bankless podcast because of just how important it is and so i'm looking forward to future content that we in future guests that we bring on to discuss minor extract extractable value because it's a it's a crucial topic yeah and i think you will be most equipped to uh think about this if you've listened to a bunch of the other podcast episodes this is episode 26 but people forget we sort of started this sequentially for folks that are new to bankless go ahead and go all the way back to episode one if you need to and start listening uh because it's sort of each each of these episodes builds on the last and i think you'll get a great grounding just by starting with one and moving forward all the way to episode 26 which is where we are today david before we go any further we should talk a little bit about our sponsors the first sponsor i want to tell you about is ave ave is a defy protocol that you absolutely have to check out what can you do with it you can lend you can borrow banklessly all on ethereum so you could do things like lend dye to the protocol it will magically transform that die into an interest bearing die account not just dye all sorts of crypto assets on ethereum you can also borrow against it ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well and they've recently released avonomics which is their token economics upgrade you can read more about it we will include a link in the show notes so avenomics grants key decision making to ave token holders it creates more safety and economic incentives to reward critical growth one of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked ave becomes a collateral of last resort you can find out about ave avonomics start using the protocol ave.com that's aave.com for those of you that have been transacting on ethereum you've noticed that the gas prices have just been insanely high you know 60 way on a good day and sometimes all the way up to a hundred way which is really reducing the amount of activities that is really feasible to be able to do on ethereum this is where our newest sponsor loopring comes in loopering is a zk roll up scaling protocol for ethereum for both trading and for payments zk roll ups that stands for zero knowledge roll ups it's basically cryptographic magic it allows you to combine activity and transactions into one single bit of information which means that massive amounts of transactions can be bundled into a very small chunk of information which reduces the gas per transaction at loopering.io you can find a zk rollups-based exchange and also a payment mechanism all with the same security guarantees of the ethereum l1 blockchain which is really important so loopering and zk rollups allows you to scale up transactions tradings payments into thousands and thousands of transactions per second but with the same security guarantees of the main ethereum blockchain which is just incredible in september loopring is releasing the loop ring wallet this will be a mobile smart contract wallet with zk roll ups tucked in natively i'm really excited for how this is going to impact the adoption of ethereum the rest of the world will be able to experience venmo type transactions but with the same amount of truthlessness and security of the decentralized future ahead of us so if you're a trader that's being eaten alive by gas fees visit loopering.io to get onboarded into ethereum's cheapest and fastest exchange all it requires is an ethereum address and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free and transferring ether and erc20 tokens on the platform is completely free if you visit loopering.io enter the code bankless in order to get the highest vip tier for six months so check that out there's a link in the show notes visit loopering.io enter code bankless alright guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with charlie noyes of paradigm bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to charlie noyes as part of our venture capitalist series charlie is a partner at paradigm he is former pantera he's an incredible thinker in the space we've had many back and forths on twitter in the past he's just a smart investor i want to emphasize before getting into this of course these are his personal views he's not speaking on behalf of paradigm the fund but he has offered to share his personal views and i think those will be very helpful as we think about the space charlie how are you doing doing pretty well um thank you guys for having me i i know we can debate pretty frequently on twitter but i do think uh you know this is a really high quality resource for the community um i'm excited to be on here yeah the advantage of a podcast of course is we can carry those things into conversation format and everyone gets to kind of hear about it um you know charlie what i think would be super helpful for our listeners is just to set the context uh and set the context in in two places you know maybe first your background and then second uh some of the background behind paradigm because both both backgrounds i think are are fairly unique uh in this space right so i was looking through uh your linkedin profile charlie and um you've got a very interesting like background and you started as a research scientist at usc and i think you're doing that during high school uh then there's there's a point where you went to mitb you dropped out uh then there's this gap of three years which i'm going to assume but hopefully you tell us that three year period is where you maybe discovered uh crypto and then the resume sort of continues where you're principal at pantera capital of course we had joey krug on a few episodes ago we'll include that in the show notes and then in i believe 2018 or so you became a partner at paradigm which for folks that don't know is i think one of um one of the most interesting crypto funds that are out there it was co-founded by uh the the co-founder of coinbase fred erisum uh it's got some other notable names great research coming out of it and one notable thing one of many is that paradigm was actually one of the first funds i believe to raise from a major endowment so in 2008 the yale endowment that's a 29 billion dollar fund an institutional fund you've heard the institutions are coming well they came in 2018 and they invested in paradigm so that's a little bit of background from my perspective but i want you charlie to help fill in the blanks maybe maybe starting at the top how did you go from research scientists at usc in high school to uh partner at paradigm so i might need to update the linkedin and i might have taken a little liberty with research scientists on the title there but i think at the time i was i was like 13 um and i was i was in high school at that point working in a lab at usc um that was doing some interesting cryptography research related to um some of the earlier snpc protocols um improved around them like spdz but um i actually was into crypto at that point so when i was like 11 a a few years before um i was you know selling software on the internet um and made a paypal account uh in my mom's name and then at some point they requested her social security number and she was like there's absolutely no way that i'm giving this to you to go use on the internet and so i started using bitcoin um and for a couple of years i just thought it was kind of incredible um i mean like at that point in my life you know it was like the only payment rail that i could actually use on the internet um and eventually um i think in around like 2013 um went from kind of a user casually interested um you know mining on my own hardware kind of before the asic era to getting really into the more theoretical and research side of it um and wanting to understand sort of like the basis of these systems um and then got further into that um you know through some early opportunities to do research both related and unrelated to crypto uh cryptocurrency cryptography um and then once ethereum came out uh i wanted actually to dive in full-time um but decided to leave high school to go to mit instead spent a year there realized i was going to miss the boat if um if i didn't leave and decided to leave mit to join um pantera along with joey you guys had on um it's a friend of mine um so yeah that's kind of the early origin story all right so we talk a lot about um the unbanked right in crypto in general but uh i've gotta i gotta be honest charlie i've never thought about the unbanked preteens right like the kids that are like between i don't know um i guess eight or so when they start to get semi financially literate and uh 18 who actually are kind of locked out of the financial system and you came at this um because you were you were locked out of paypal essentially and krypto was like the only lonely bank i guess the only finance only the only money you could really use at any level of scale that's crazy to me yeah i mean it's kind of a wild series of coincidences i think like um you know many of the people in the space at this point it is still so early that you kind of have to have a reason to be here and i think most people have these kinds of backgrounds where it's just a really strange sequence of coincidences that led you to being you know deeply interested in internet money and programmable internet money and want to spend all your time on it um but i got super lucky with that and then i ended up at pantera i spent an awesome year there with joey and uh and then in early 2018 um i'd met matt who i got introduced to also did mit undergrad and fred at the time fred had left coinbase the year before um spent a year thinking about what he wanted to do next um him and matt got together and then pulled me in in early 2018 and i decided to leave and go start something new with them so what's also cool i think charlie is um we i think there are a lot of uh millennials of course and you know gen x and you know maybe the odd boomers though that that listen uh to bankless and and tune into the bankless nation uh you are a representative of of gen z sort of this new generation do you think gen z is going to just grow up using crypto just grow up crypto native similar to the way the millennials maybe grew up with the internet and became digital natives um i think it's very possible i i'm not sure that it's as much about crypto as it is about sort of not having learned bad habits around what money is uh or could be um but to be honest at this point i don't think that crypto is sort of like more millennial money than venmo uh i do think that we have the opportunity uh with young people to um show them alternatives before they learn bad habits and i think that a lot of the aversion to um cryptocurrency d5 kind of this whole space that you might see from uh older folks more frequently than than young is is largely bad habits and kind of um you know ways of thinking they get reinforced over many years um so i do think young people are really um they're like there's a reason that the space is broadly really young um but i'm not sure that it's so much millennials you know inherently love crypto as it's not as hard to convince them that this is just a much better experience than they get anywhere else and that should really be the north star so let's turn a little bit to paradigm you guys made headlines when in 2018 you you got uh raised 400 million dollars um one of those investors as i mentioned was um the yale endowment so the institutions definitely came um but can you tell us a little bit about the thesis of of paradigm so we we've talked to uh many folks in the show everyone has sort of their way of thinking about um crypto their paradigm if you will of crypto right whether it's you know this is the internet of value or we'll we're building web3 and our goal is to decentralize facebook or there's the fat protocol thesis uh which was you know famously came out in 2016 and 2017 was sort of a guiding theory there are token maximalists we've talked to there's people who believe in fat money that uh reserve asset money systems will be sort of the kings of crypto how would you describe paradigms thesis so i think it's it's difficult to sort of encapsulate in a one-liner um and there's certainly no lack of disagreement you can just go watch us on twitter um or you know healthy debate internally i think that you know at the highest level there are a couple of core theses that we hold um and and are somewhat non-contentious you know in terms of public blockchains are very interesting um they're a novel form of technology the idea of crypto economic security um is novel and there's something fundamentally interesting about the intersection of um money finance and technology in a much more natural way than we've seen you know in on sort of the internet has to exist today um beyond that i think a lot of the sort of uh more specific theses that have floated around and at different points you know risen to prominence or or been kind of the meta of the space um are probably too zoomed in to to point out individually but i don't know one that we're probably quite well known for is you know the general belief that uh futility token or utility tokens or futility tokens you guys had a great quote on this earlier um and that you know ultimately the ability to create value durable long-term value um is sort of like the core maxim um that we should organize around and you know to be honest i think especially with respect to d5 and more of the frontier that idea has taken longer to proliferate than i i would have expected but um i'm not sure that it's actually sort of uh an out there idea anymore which is really exciting so charlie a venture capital firm is composed of many different people each with their own you know unique ideas and i think when all those unique ideas come and coalesce you generate like the thesis the generalized thesis of the firm but each individual person has their own thesis that may not uh that that may conflict or contrast with other members of of of the peers of a venture capital firm so how do your specific beliefs contrast with your peers at paradigm like what do you believe as a thesis that uh maybe other members that paradigm don't that you disagree with that's a great question um i'll i'll pick out one that you know we haven't been shy about publicly debating and say i i'm probably more concerned about the long-term security of existing protocols in particular ethereum but not specific to it than some other folks on the team as as kind of an urgent issue um that we'll be confronted with quite soon and not in 10 or 20 years so i definitely want to pocket that one because that's that's the topic that we definitely want to go into uh but on a grander scale how how would um what what are there any examples of just like generalized like attitudes towards you know what is investable versus what's not like equity versus tokens um that that is a constant like what are the constant themes of conversation and paradigm that that are uh frequently in debate so i think that one um and probably the like eternal debate is to what extent we can rely on reflexivity um or rather kind of assume that uh reflexivity will work out uh rather than work against us and i think that there is there's many names this idea goes by um circularity self-reference recurrence i i like reflexivity the best to describe it but um you know the core idea is sort of just uh is is embodied today in in d phi and sort of how far um different protocols are willing to push um for example yield farming very highly reflexive idea um or make the assumption uh that they can sort of circularly support value or to what extent they can um and at least personally i've been very much on the side of not wanting to lean into sort of highly reflexive um security assumptions mostly is how i would characterize them um but at this point i think those are the most interesting experiments that are getting run um and you know i suspect that like it'll take a couple of years to figure out the set point but it'll be very interesting to see what we can create so a comment on that reflexivity i think uh our listeners might be more familiar with the term that me and ryan use on this podcast which is memes uh reflexivity is like a meme right where and and bitcoin at its uh at its core is like a reflexive asset where there's a little bit of game theory involved where like you know if everyone else buys bitcoin like you better also be buying bitcoin right and so do you believe that at the core of these things there is a reflexive component that it's a part of the fundamentals of these systems yeah absolutely um i think we'll get into this more later in the podcast but i would say with absolutely 100 and i don't think it's it's debatable actually um but i i actually meant on a more micro level um when you get beyond sort of these core layer one protocols which i think are in some ways substantively different from for example applications built on top of ethereum um or rather distinct from them that sort of the amount of reflexivity that we have to uh we have to lean into for these things to exist in the first place or are comfortable leaning into um is quite different and so i think you know the simplest example of this would be ethereum miners are paid in ether um it's entirely circular the cash flows are denominated in the thing itself um would we be willing to sort of accept the same maxim for a d5 protocol um which earns cash flows in terms of itself or perhaps is lending protocol collateralized um by by its own asset and we could get into kind of like the notions of like you know moneyness versus equitiness um the differences between uh monetary premiums and cash flow evaluation i suspect we will but that's i think kind of like the that's a very abstract debate that has been playing out for years and i expect will continue to play out for a couple more and i think like one of the most interesting areas of the space to watch right now i i would imagine that this debate that you're talking about is is one of the many debates that all the partners and members of paradigm have and so when you guys are debating about subjects like this like going back and forth sharpening each other's sticks trying to get a grasp on the understanding of things like over time how does that debate like evolve inside the firm and like because at some point like action needs to be taken as a result of like the opinions formed in a debate so like how do how does paradigm go from like debate to action like what does that process look like it's a great question um i think one feature that uh we only started to notice more recently um in discussing some of these ideas more externally is how much uh we develop like an internal nomenclature that's almost inscrutable to anyone else and then when you start tweeting about it you spend as much time clarifying what you mean as making the point that you want to and which gets us into trouble um but you know in terms of like forming an investment lens right um i think diversity of opinion is critical um but more than just diversity of opinion sort of like uh open-mindedness infinite open-mindedness and a willingness to sort of consider that you know the shared investment lens that that we arrive at as a team um is going to be um more considered than you know any one individual's opinion um and in an iterated game sense um you know a willingness on the part of the individual to believe that we actually should act as a group um basically that um even if you know our shared investment lens might not agree entirely with my own personal views um then i'm always willing to um extend the benefit of the doubt to my partners and colleagues that over time where i'm wrong you know they'll help make sure that we don't make the wrong decision so so charlie just talking a little bit more about investor education and by the way we're just talking about yams just now so if you know if listeners are totally unfamiliar with what the heck we're talking about uh go check out stay the nation i think episode nine uh it came out by the time you're listening to this it will come out last week where david and i try to make sense of what the heck yams are so you can get caught up on that a little bit but so it appears to me like you guys paradigm put out a report called bitcoin for the open-minded skeptic um and that's not a report for the crypto native right it's mostly review for uh people like us but it it seems to me to be the case that bitcoin is almost like the uh the bitcoin the the the gateway drug right for institutions getting into crypto like it's 20 20 now and they're finally starting to become comfortable with bitcoin as a store of value asset as like a digital gold as like something that's not just for criminals um would you say that's the case like bitcoin is the is the gateway drug if you will and then from that uh institutions will will start to get interested in other areas in crypto yeah i think that's generally true it's certainly the most legible narrative right the one that as of right now um has been around the longest sort of has the most both i think uh has the most social credibility just to be frank right and in many ways is the easiest for a new entrant to the space to underwrite especially um you know one working at uh sort of a long-term institution or investment partnership um and yeah the the bitcoin thesis my partner matt wong wrote it i think it's a fantastic synthesis of many of the ideas that have brought new folks from those areas into the space um and probably the most legible narrative um to them today and i do think that you know once you're here once you're kind of willing to make the leap of faith you pretty quickly recognize how interesting the rest of the space is um some folks decide to dive head first some just decide not to um write off kind of everything everything else or the space as a whole but i think that from any perspective it's just hugely net positive to see even the bitcoin narrative alone becoming more legible and credible to a much broader group so there was this uh meme this narrative going around in 2018 the institutions are coming right that's like the beginning of 2018 uh on the back of um on the on that tail end of the of the bull market um i i maybe want to ask uh you what you think about like are the institutions coming because it it sort of didn't pan out the way the hype uh said it would in in 2018 although you guys managed to raise from uh some pretty large institutions in 2018. now we're in 2020 are like are the institutions coming or have they been coming all along i think they've been coming all along um and you know it's it's i don't think it would be unfair to say that the narrative that institutions were coming didn't pan out the way that some of us might have hoped um but i don't think it's the case that they're averse to it or there was some binary event that broadly flipped people that were or could have been positive negative we just realized that some things take time and i think that we have seen a slow uh maybe slower than we would have hoped but steady drip of folks coming into the space um you know from traditional institutions um and i expect this to continue personally um and you know if i i think my main takeaway from kind of having observed this process over the last few years in particular is that this is going to be a multi-decade game um and every time it feels like we found the thing or the narrative that will be legible or what will be kind of like you know we'll define crypto's legacy or this era of crypto's legacy we found out that it's probably going to take longer than we thought um and and i think i think that's just like pretty much broadly true of everything in the space so charlie i want to pivot a little bit and talk about tokens and then get it kind of get into a more uh current uh d5 protocols d5 topics but i want to first start with the progression of tokens as we've come to know them right so 2017 was kind of more or less like the birth of ethereum to the rest of the world like ethereum 2015 2016 we didn't really know no the world didn't really know what it was or what it was going to do in 2017 we kind of started to figure it out because we realized that the erc20 token standard could be pretty interesting depending on what you do and that was like the birth of utility tokens which we've called like futility tokens so uh futility tokens like they sucked then uh are do they still suck and what kind of like progression have you seen in the the concept of tokens uh that really makes you optimistic or or perhaps less so so i think that futility tokens will always be futile you know uh i think the vitalik wrote the defining blog post on this in like october 2017 if i remember correctly and we didn't listen to him i think more people are listening to him now you know tokens that that give ownership to decentralized protocols are i think wildly interesting um there's many different facets to them you know your ability to participate in governance uh is a feature of some others are really just strictly ownership in an act an economic margin that the protocol can extract by virtue of adding value to the world the ecosystem whatever you want to call it um now i think that you know to the specific question of futility tokens it's kind of unfortunate that the economic model was just like so bad in 2017 to be honest uh and it felt like you know talking about sort of real protocol cash flows uh was more or less shouting into the void i certainly don't feel that way now i think that that's kind of just become implicitly or just very slowly uh kind of like the shared perspective of everybody in the space or at least that's been my kind of observation in d5 and that's super encouraging because you know for a new founder um really anyone that wants to start something in the space it's really important that sort of the standards as to like what should you be pursuing are you know at least not feudal to your earlier point and and if there is like anything in hindsight that i'm disappointed uh you know about with respect 2017 it's that there were probably some really great teams and ideas that just kind of shot themselves in the foot and i hope that doesn't continue to happen so since 2017 there's been a lot of iterations and innovation behind token designs over the last three years what innovations have you seen that really make you that that turn something like a futility token into an investable asset the turn of utility token into investment asset it's a pretty specific lens on it um i think just generally not not necessarily sorry just to clarify but not necessarily thinking of like futility tokens and i think maybe it's helpful to define your utility tokens really quick to me i define you futility tokens as something that suffers like the velocity problem where it's just like a medium of exchange it's an inferior form of money in one specific use case yeah yeah it's it's like you spin up a candy store and then you print a token and say okay pay me in this token and that's that's right but you only get the token by exchanging other currencies for it and the market for your candy shops uh you know currency probably is not super highly liquid so um right absolutely i mean that's kind of like the core that's kind of the core problem right like uh that's just not a workable economic model it's not conducive to success there regardless of how successful your candy store is it doesn't really matter for the currency because it's probably unlikely that people are going to be willing to grant that a candy store's proprietary currency becomes a global currency competitive with like bitcoin or you know it just it's it's unfortunate this is the this is the reason we don't denominate money and settle debts in chuck e cheese tokens it's right there i mean like yeah you can use it you actually think if you if you twitter search me like at charlie noyes chuck e cheese tokens i have uh there are a couple of tweets do you know i still have a few so um i don't know if they're still good but for my childhood in my coin collection i'll i should check on that maybe they've appreciated in value yeah um so so as an economic model like we've basically totally scrapped futility tokens like no one's making a a token like this anymore uh so between 2017 2018 when we thought that they were all the rage and now where we understand that they are bad what specific innovations have you seen come to replace um the futilitiness of tokens in defy yeah so i think basically the two dimensions are one real protocol earnings and two um flexibility so to the former point i think maker dow and auger pioneered the idea um that you know a just a decentralized trustless protocol could generate earnings um or rather a cash flow stream in the way that it adds value to the world right um basically like not not really dissimilar to um any other traditional company except again they're trustless you know decentralized protocols so of course it's like could not be more dissimilar in practice um but i think that was like the first they were the first kind of uh like fundamental innovations on this dimension how it should be done how you could think about uh how you could think about that as you know tokens being sort of the discounted future value of protocol earnings um and that's basically through osmosis enter the rest of the space um and and that's how people think about designing tokens today and that's awesome um the second dimension that is different i think are is the flexibility dimension so especially more recent experiments like yfi is a great example um are you know certainly not taking like a bad or fundamentally incorrect economic model to a static idea they're taking uh like a credible economic model uh to kind of an undefined um idea with hypothetically a lot of future flexibility now like as to whether you know any specific one of these efforts will evolve into um something real and meaningful you know that can that builds and and can extract durable value i think that's an open question but the idea that we have a good enough idea of what we should be shooting for to evolve towards it rather than sort of starting with this like very static idea for what you're going to do which like 2017 white papers basically it's like throw your idea down on the table and never change it is i think quite important um because inflexibility is potentially as kind of harmful to progress as bad economic models by the way guys charlie mentioned yfi token if you haven't check out episode 25 where we talk with andre and uh i finally figure out what yfi token actually is and what it what it does it's a great episode on that um i guess charlie you know what would be interesting i think is i i'm assuming that neither you nor nor paradigm would say that everything happening in d5 is good and investable um right that's kind of your job to figure this out for um like for people for investors right i mean i think to the earlier point they are separable dimensions like something can be good and not investable or not good well something that's not good is probably not investable but good is kind of separate from investable and i think that's um uh that's important to keep in mind okay so let's talk about that lens let's use the lens of investable well uh we go through some i guess categories and maybe we'll start with the um investable and good right like good investments i suppose or things that you guys are betting on or you personally are betting on as you're speaking on behalf of maybe your personal opinions here um and maybe we can go through some of the things that are public that paradigm has invested in most notable at least to me is probably uh uniswap which listeners will know is a liquidity robot automated market maker that we've talked about a whole bunch on bankless why is uniswap a good investment what was the thesis behind uniswap yeah so i think unit swap is built on a fundamentally interesting idea concept the x times y equals k or constant function market maker um and the team going after it is incredible and very long term oriented and the very high level way that we think that we thought about it think about it and really you know would say is kind of the definition of investable is credibly able to build long-term value um in unit swap's case i think you know there is you can imagine a future in which um the innovation i think we're already seeing this play out to some extent and makes it so easy to create markets that we can run more experiments that allow us to create more markets run more experiments et cetera et cetera and that it's almost in some sense a platform um an economic platform as opposed to an individual product so what's crazy about uniswap is i saw just on last week's seven-day volume if you annualize that is something like 36 billion in annualized volume that they're doing now are you like is that surprising to you those kind of numbers i i did not think we would be anywhere near where we are today for the next year i thought it would take a lot longer definitely it's been why why has it not like why has it been so fast it's a very it's an interesting question um you ask 100 people you're getting a hundred different opinions i think at the heart of it people realized how interesting defy is and that it allows you to run experiments on a pretty large scale really quickly and iterate quite quickly it's kind of funny to say considering that you know one of our biggest concerns is also the difficulty of writing solidity and getting your contracts audited and the deployment cycle being so much less iterative than traditional software development but from a financial perspective you know the speed of of iteration composition uh like remixing and remastering of all these different protocols and products is just unbelievable and i think that you know at its core that's really what's driving this kind of growth hey guys going bankless is a journey and you don't have to do it alone so here are some fantastic bankless tools from the sponsors that make this show possible as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on wrap directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage so so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5x6x 8x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this on bank lists that will include the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off charlie i want to i want to wrap the unit swap conversation on a bow with this last question you talked about a potential you know uh gaining upside uh exposure to uniswap via a fee via into the protocol uh but we've seen people love uniswap and also love these like uh deep new new uh liquidity mining yield farming d5 protocols based on their credible neutrality right so like uniswap has a fee that goes to the liquidity providers not the team right and then you know the the yfi token is if you know fair launch no vc founders reward and so uh what as a fee model or some value capture model for uniswap as a mechanism for upside exposure to the protocol seems to get in the way of uh it also being a credibly neutral protocol do you also see this problem or or am i overlooking i see the tension certainly um i think it's an unavoidable tension and that's why you know the i throw the fee out quite hypothetically i don't know if that will be the mechanism of value capture um and i think it's important to remember here that uniswap as it currently exists no one's gonna force you to move um no one can force you to move us for the team and to the extent that this uh that that kind of value capture or any other is unacceptable to the community they won't move or they will fork the protocol um and so i think there is both voice and exit um in that dynamic now that being said you know does a fee erode the credible neutrality of the protocol i don't think so there's any kind of value capture mechanism i don't think so i think we need to figure out a sustainable way of funding these things and the clearest answer is for their earnings to be directly tied to the value they create again you know to the extent that users don't want to pay it or it's not the best venue they'll go elsewhere um and so yeah it's it's a tough question to answer and one that i think where everybody is going to bump into um i'm not sure what it looks like long term but you know i believe wholeheartedly that we need to figure out sustainable funding for the application layer and i believe that that probably looks like protocol fees in some form broadly um but maybe it doesn't maybe there's an alternative so charlie tends to be the case where sometimes first movers win right and sometimes it's the second uh winners who win right it's not yahoo it's kind of google who sort of solves it another interesting category i'm curious your thoughts on is uh the decentralized stablecoin category so um all of us love die right um like a pioneer um you know four or five years in the making really set the d5 market off but you guys have recently invested in a i guess a die alternative or die compliment um certainly another stable-ish value protocol called rye if i'm pronouncing that correctly through reflects your labs do you think a second mover can win here and what's sort of the thesis for rye sure so before answering i do think it's important to point out you know we we led the most recent sale by the maker foundation of mkr tokens as well as underwrote um the majority of the toxocratic credit auction that took place uh after black thursday for mkr so you know we have been uh for years supporters of maker and continue to be um that being said i do think that reflexer is pursuing an alternative path rye is of course most comparable to die but the way that we think about it is as offering an alternative to die that does not rely as much on governance that is not pegged to one dollar which um you know is a core maxim that maker governance is uh trying to maintain um and i think as maker continues to grow some ideas on the roadmap are going to be controversial with some uh factions of the community specifically i think real world assets is you know one of the the most obvious and even today you're starting to see some um i think version two uh usdc and wbtc etc being included in the protocol um you know i i think maker has a very bright future i also think that there are that there is room for experimentation um and that those dimensions are important to give users choice along and that ryze approach of you know baking an interest rate directly into the price of the asset taking only ether collateral and minimizing governance uh is very interesting alternative so how would that fit into the d5 universe that we know today and then also as d5 develops how how do you think as a building block how do you think that fits into the future of d5 well it's a very different user experience right um so rye is a dollar stable asset but it is not a dollar equivalent asset meaning the peg of rye will change every minute or however frequently they update um their basically target rate feedback mechanism so i think that the answer to your question or how i imagine playing this out this playing out is that rye probably is a better fit for more financial use cases than die in some respects which is you know as collateral for some other derivative um it's not really important most likely to the owner of that or the protocol that uh that implements it that die remain equal to one dollar um or rather that rye does it's it's actually probably preferable that it have sort of minimal um dollar purchasing power volatility from like a financial mathematics perspective you know in terms of what's what's ideal for that use case on the flip side it's probably not a great ux and something that maker governance has been very averse to is taking die off of its one dollar peg um to implement a negative interest rate like to the extent that die in your wallet 100 die is floating and you know next week is one die is 98 like 98 cents and like will be forever rather than a dollar um it's a very different ux and i think that's probably the core dimension along which they're going to kind of differentiate so speaking of things that track a dollar but don't actually act as a dollar ample fourth has kind of taken this the the world by storm recently because of its insane run up from an 8 million dollar market cap to a 600 million dollar market cap down to a 200 million dollar market cap and and charlie you tweeted to something as ample fourth was retracing the insane run-up uh it was a screenshot of the price of ample fourth with a big red negative 40 and you quoted it saying nature is healing uh and so can you go into your perceptions on ample forth and perhaps uh why you may be alluded to that it shouldn't really be worth all that much yeah so i mean you know ample fourth can be worth whatever people want it to be um and i could be wrong about this in the same sense that uh you know it's true of ether or bitcoin i think the reason i tweeted that was you know ample fourth is an accounting trick right um the price uh remaining one dollar while that while balances change uh in perfect proportion to that is really just flipping price and supply so whereas um you know most assets have a variable price and a fixed supply or rather one that doesn't depend uh on maintaining a constant market price ample fourth does the opposite which is expands or contracts the supply to maintain a constant dollar price but what this doesn't change is the market cap over time so um i you know i don't mean this in uh kind of a condescending sense but ample fourth is an accounting trick right and i think uh something that concerned me was that it seemed like there were a lot of people that didn't understand this and i think that although it's very interesting to see kind of like how the market treats this asset um there's a difference between people playing money games because they're fun and they understand what they're doing and thinking that there is like like something else is happening for example with ample fourth okay so a uh brother a cousin of ample fourth is this new uh yams token asset right so it's the same thing as ample fourth very similar we've gotten into the subtleties earlier but the distribution is different so instead of um vcs owning it and founders owning it in pre-sale it's basically uh defy uh individuals individuals that are in d5 particularly i mean let's be honest the whales who have the capital to to put in and start receiving yams is that any different to you does that have a better shot at becoming money i mean no definitely not but my hope is that this might not be true yams is more ironic than it is misleading and i think there's nothing wrong with running fun experiments because everybody's going to meme them because they're hilarious experiments um i mean i think well i don't want to say there's nothing wrong with that rather i think about that quite differently than the idea that we would say for example apple forth is going to take over the global financial system because there's like i i don't know there's something different than an accounting trick is happening um so your question on yams like do i think it's it's any more likely to like become a viable form of money than ampliforth like not really but in some sense i think it's probably better that people are treating it like like a highly reflexive money game than um then it seems like people are being misled about it but you know obviously you kind of have to pick where you draw that line for yourself so so we started this out charlie by talking about like uh some of the good things you see in d5 and something you know investments uh rather than some of the bad things or bad investments um what's your take just in general on yield farming is that good for defy is that a kind of a like something that's investible i think yield farming is broadly just an incredible innovation um an incredible idea that's going to be around forever and you know i i was quite negative on it uh or have been publicly especially on twitter um because i think that you know yield farming as an idea is different than sort of its implementation in any specific context or protocol um and in the same way that like you know three percent per year ether inflation is far different than 100 000 percent despite the fact that if you take the limit you know to infinity they're equivalent um like there's sort of a similar idea here in yield farming where like it's there's no bright objective line between what i would say like kind of seems somewhat reasonable and what doesn't but any individual implementation of it again you kind of have to pick how credible you find it for yourself if that makes sense um i guess in short i would say it's a great idea i think it's it's going to be super important to the future of the space and it's not going to go away i think that it will take a while for people generally to figure out like how to use it in an additive you know long-term sustainable way to build durable value and that a couple of the use cases or implementations today um do seem you know kind of at odds with that with that long-term thinking so charlie earlier in this conversation uh we we said we would get back to this and and now is the time um because i think it's a really interesting discussion and perspective you have on i think maybe um two aspects uh one is when we're talking about base layers like a bitcoin or an ethereum economic security is imperative and you also you talked about reflexivity and the hazards of i guess betting the farm betting the base layer on reflexivity and an another term for that that we've used often on bank lists is like the moneyness of a given underlying layer um you know i'm trying to agree with that for what it's worth okay i think they're essentially the same thing so let's talk about that and in fact that there's like a concrete reason that they must be the same thing okay so that's what i want to dig into and but while we dig into that let me just you know tee this up for listeners so they understand this is by the way an ongoing conversation i feel like you and i have had over the years on twitter on this first time we're doing a podcast about it but the the basic problem if i could state the problem and then maybe you could um you know iterate and what the problem is is the value of let's take ether for example the same is true of bitcoin the value of ether um has to go higher in proportion to for for economic security uh reasons so the value of ether is basically the the economic security of the network and the question is where a question is what happens if the value of all the tokens on top of ethereum starts to far exceed and outstrip the value of ether does ethereum become unable to secure the tokens on on top of this and i think there's a lot of implications that fall out of that the one implication is on ethereum there could be things such as free rider tokens that um consume the economic security bandwidth of ethereum but but don't really pay it forward um another implication is that there's some scalability limit on ethereum and you know that's in proportion to a concept we've called economic bandwidth that you know the the ethereum token economy can't far exceed the value of ether or else the network becomes insecure and i think the last maybe implication that we could dig into is um doesn't this mean that ether must accrue a monetary premium in order to be a global financial system so is that kind of the problem statement would you add to maybe the problem statement or how would you talk about this i think it's a great problem statement and you know i think this is such a tough uh issue kind of deeply entangled in so many different like highly illegible and frontier ideas today that it's it's really really hard to talk about honestly um so but i would say yeah i think at a high level that's that's a really good problem statement um and then you know i think one immediate reaction to the way that you would put it one hypothetical or pathological case maybe being the value of all tokens on top of ethereum um vastly exceeding the value of ether or the security premium that it can pay is is that's kind of a binary question right it's kind of uh it it can sound like we're asking well well at some point you know will there be a big double spend on these assets on top of the chain and and it just feels very like maybe this could happen but you know are we ever gonna get there it's kind of a threshold like maybe people just won't do it in the same way that on bitcoin like you would expect to see selfish mining but you don't in practice um does that kind of make sense the the issue yeah like so one way i think of it is like um the us has um the strongest military in the world i think you know most most people would uh agree with that um other nation states um are up and coming um but how much is enough to pay for u.s military defense is it one percent of gdp is it five percent of gdp well you don't know until you're attacked so absolutely it's you don't know until you're attacked that's that's the the exact i think issue that many people take with the kind of high level framing that you laid out which again i totally agree with but um i think you know something that only became uh apparent more recently is that uh i don't believe it's a binary question i.e when do you get attacked um rather that um it's ongoing and the um like today we can see empirically that uh mev is driving um so at least socially undesirable um kind of things to happen can you talk about any gas fees for folks that aren't familiar with that so maybe it'd be helpful to zoom out right on like two the two kind of ideas that i personally consider core to um this platform security question right um and the first is a paper uh written by some folks at princeton um called uh on the instability of bitcoin without the block subsidy um and it's a fantastic paper it's worth reading um but the core idea contained within it is that um transaction fees are not additive to security um and actually more specifically any transaction fees which are proportional to the value of transactions are not additive to security so in the context of ethereum a good ex like all current gas fees are not cannot be assumed additive to the security budget an example of a fee that could be is a constant amount of ether burned but we can get that later um so that's that's the first uh very key idea can you just explain briefly why not because that's the entire thesis of of bitcoin it's bitcoin security model transitions to uh transaction fees only so yeah the rough answer is that transaction fees non-constant transaction fees those which are proportional to value which is true of bitcoin uh transaction fees today ethereum gas like um are create minor extractable value inherently um and so that's the second kind of key idea um behind this broad security question what is minor extractable value it comes from or is first defined in a paper fantastic paper by phil diane called flash boys 2.0 and what it looked at was the dex transactions uh how bots front run them and specifically it looked at application uh it looked at application behavior which created opportunities for transaction ordering to net a profit meaning you know if i can be the first one to get a liquidation in um i can make uh money doing that or if i can front run someone's trade on uniswap i can make money doing that and they looked in this paper at empirically there are arbitrage bots that do this which are not miners but the point that they made in the paper was that actually this value is entirely extractable by miners meaning um rather than these arbitrage bots bidding on transaction fees to try and you know get priority or try and get the ordering that they want so they can front run you or liquidate you or whatever um that actually what miners should be doing is simply censoring all of those transactions and extracting the value themselves and so you get into a system where either you expect minor censorship or such that there are zero transaction fees or if they are not the ones extracting the value themselves then there is a very strong incentive uh to uh revert the chain basically for consensus to become unstable because some blocks are wealthier than others yeah so to to reiterate that there is and we can really see this with a lot of the liquidity mining that's going on in d5 there's a ton of volume going through uniswap and sometimes we see blocks that have you know 5 10 20 ether being paid as a fee and it's in the miners best interest if there's a a 20 ether fee block that only has two ether issued as a reward and so the discrepancy between the fee and the reward is so large that for the next to revert the next block right the next like five ten blocks there's an incentive for miners to you know uh reorg the next 20 blocks to go backwards to mine that 20 east reward fee so they can take that from themselves is it this is right right that's that's sort of a very pathological right um okay so that kind of attack is what phil diane calls a time bandit attack in the paper which is basically uh it's not just the current block that you're in um and how transaction ordering within it um you know impacts the amount of value you can derive uh as a minor uh from you know publishing it but that in fact it creates an incentive basically for consensus to become unstable because you would rather to your point reorg the chain then continue extending it so what implications fall out from this charlie so yeah to take it back to the earlier point on transaction fees right like a very core idea and in fact one that vitalik has especially recently been quite vocal about in public is the notion that transaction fees as we currently think about them are not additive to security um in fact you know they're at best not additive and at worst create med and an incentive to revert the chain um sort of big enough that it actually starts to happen in practice um and so you know in the case of ethereum i think the the kind of net vision for the future that i take away from this is uh ether has to be money right um and and that's kind of uh that's kind of the base case that uh that needs to happen for this thing to be secure and it's the same argument as in bitcoin so that was kind of a poor way of stating it um but rather i think so i think that sorry i think the path that you got there is interesting i want to come back to ether has to be money in just a second but but also you mentioned vitalik and sort of um your transaction fees not being enough is are you bullish on eip 1559 sort of the burn mechanism is is that necessary to prevent mev yeah so that very uh interesting um question eip1559 does not prevent mev um so what eip1559 does do and i'm super positive on it is that it creates a base rate fee that all transactions pay and this fee is burned a fee is the wrong word it creates a base burn um and that burn doesn't accrue to um uh miners right so that's awesome where earlier i had said proportional to value fees are not additive to security because they are mev eip1559 base fees are additive to security um you can invert the previous logic to say they're not proportional to transaction value and therefore they can be additive to security does that make sense um i think i've got it so now does uh eip1559 get rid of mev no um because there are still tip auctions in it which are basically the same kinds of priority gas auctions as all transactions participate in today and so even after eip1559 to the extent that any individual transaction has um you know creates an arbitrage opportunity you would expect there to be a tip auction in exactly the same way as there's a you know priority gas auction uh bidding today over it and so and you need that to establish priority um either in times of congestion or just when a transaction contains mev so the point here is uh any transaction which today bots get into a bidding war over the ordering of you would expect that's still to happen after eip1559 is implemented however it does uh for transactions where that's not true it's a very good thing that rather that they burn the base fee rather than paying um a transaction fee got it so and so how about validators so uh proof of stake rather so that basically means that the the minor and the holder of the eath become one and the same i would think that would give the holder of the eth a longer time preference let's say we don't want to start front running everyone or that destroys the value of ethereum and my ether so we don't want to do that whereas in bitcoin with proof of work like the asics are a separate token if you want to think about it definitely so i think it might be helpful first to like take a step back and consider the same question in the context of proof of work this is something that ryan and i have talked about on twitter before um and you know what i said about eip1559 that you would still expect to see auctions happen for transactions which contain mev afterwards right is not actually precisely true um you would expect that to happen unless miners start extracting uh value from them right rather than arbitragers participating in uh or bidding in gas wars over them that miners simply censor those competing transactions and extract all of the value themselves right which is completely separate to eip1559 or any other fee question so does that kind of make sense it's like there's to the extent that miners are just running the default guest implementation and minor config like they're not going to do this and so far today up until today they haven't and that's why arbitragers get into gas force but if miners decided to start extracting it themselves well there wouldn't be any gas wars because they would simply censor any competing transaction and order it however they want yeah i told that makes me totally get it for proof of work and then yeah for so proof of stake actually uh the same logic holds which is an individual validator determines transaction ordering within a block and so they can choose to do this [Music] in exactly the same way what does become more difficult are time banded attacks at least beyond the finality window and so i think you know there's enough uncertainty around what proof-of-stake will look like in in eth 2.0 for for me to comment on sort of like or you know imagine that i have a perfect vision for how all of these concepts translate um but at a minimum the potential for uh you know the incentive to for validators block proposers to censor transactions uh still exists and will still be a problem and the bear case for this is that the stakers who are staking eth who participate in this uh you know mev uh mephi uh capture our it's the game theory is that you know any staker that doesn't do this loses to the stakers that do right and so the the value and in fact the losses compound over time and the losses over time right and so like while proof of stake advocates are concerned about um mining centralization in in proof of work mines yeah the the miners so the proof of work advocates are are concerned about a capital uh centralization and proof of stake and and this uh the the activities being described here where some stakers will be able to extract um extract capture the mev and some seekers won't definitely is concerning when it comes to a decentralization perspective is this right absolutely yeah and um so to my earlier point that this thing vitalik's been talking about a lot i think i can show you guys the links afterwards to include but he has some great comments uh deep in twitter replies and on a couple of uh medium posts about um potential solutions and i think something that that people are not broadly aware of is like how bad this problem could be in the sense that the solutions at least those that we currently imagine are like kind of a radical departure from what ethereum looks like today um and you know it's um so i think the point here is both that this is kind of becoming more and more of an urgent problem and like the solutions um you know some combination of proof of stake and everything going on to roll ups which i can get into more uh are like a very kind of radical departure from what ethereum currently looks like and especially considering the timeline to eat 2.0 or how long like it seems like at least to me it will probably take the defy ecosystem to migrate like i i think this is the problem that anybody who wants to see if wants to see ethereum succeed long term should like be concerned about so charlie is it not so i feel like it's also a problem for bitcoin though except one difference is it's an it's a largely unacknowledged problem right it's a bitcoin yeah 100 okay so like i'm definitely gonna get i'm definitely gonna get tweeted out for this but like uh yeah i mean it's a completely unacknowledged problem in fairness to them you know like the inflation schedule isn't gonna like drop to zero for a long time but like certainly people don't seem to be bitcoin people however you want to define that don't even really seem to be willing to like acknowledge that at some point it will exist so entirely separate to the question in ethereum but i completely agree okay so so here's how i kind of like summarized i think i may have tweeted something like this like a long time ago but like the dirty little secret of both both camps the ethereans and bitcoiners the bitcoiners don't want to admit that it neat that they need their block space to be valuable and they need to deal with the mev problem in order to be well actually that's uh sorry i i i think just to you put it very concisely there the problem they have to deal with is that valuable block space is mev well there you go that's another dimension yeah and then but the the thing that um ethereum advocates don't like to admit maybe present company excluded give us a pass on this is that eth needs to have monetary premium so it's issuance policy matters it needs to become a money because if you become a money to the extent you are a reserve asset and a store of value you kind of paper over uh some of these problems now is is that true because like we we started this whole thing with almost the the conclusion that we've reached which is these assets need to become money like they need to accrue a monetary premium or the whole thing doesn't work long term yeah so how do we get i think we're super we're super down the rabbit hole at this point yeah but i'm gonna add even like one further nuance and then maybe we can we can zoom out and kind of like consider the whole picture right um and the nuance to ethereum i think it's awesome that you brought up the bitcoin analogy the nuance to ethereum is that phil diane's paper um flash voice 2.0 showed that application layer behavior can create mev right and so for ethereum as compared to bitcoin the problem certainly exists in both systems right the instability without the block subsidy or rather that any proportional value transaction fee scheme is mev um and it's just that in ethereum we have the further complication of like what every transaction is doing whether it be moving a bunch of tether or trading on uniswap which creates an arbitrage opportunity in mev uh is kind of like in some sense worse or at least could be than a simple transfer and i think like james prestwich summarized this pretty well in in a tweet the other day uh you can't write a script that finds all mev so it doesn't exist sorry that's the rule um like that's kind of the problem that we're dealing with here that we don't really even know or can know like how bad it is yeah i get it and i think you know on the on the on the bitcoin side too it could become the case that that assumptions change binance is buying mining rigs right what if binance becomes a very large centralized finding facility and then it it can maybe extract some of these mev sort of um you know uh capabilities in its crypto bank but but let's let's let's zoom out again uh and talk about charlie why why sort of the summary is these assets ether needs to be money bitcoin needs to be money and by that again we just mean store a value asset for this whole thing to succeed why why is that the case so i think you know i'll try and give like the one or two sentence version um we know that we can't fund protocol security with competitive transaction fees or not uh non-constant transaction fees um and we know this from the paper on the instability of bitcoin without the block subsidy which applies equally to bitcoin and ethereum we know empirically that uh mev quite a lot of it exists on ethereum today and we know that the amount of mev that exists is a function of the behavior of applications on ethereum um so we net out from this saying well um we can't assume that transaction fees are additive to protocol layer platform security at layer one um we know that applications running on top of this platform can parasitically add to um you know the incentive to destabilize its consensus process and so you kind of need to assume two things uh in my opinion one that the base asset is sufficiently valuable um to basically socialize the security of the platform as a whole to such a degree that it it just doesn't seem like feasible to corrupt um and secondly you need to assume that there is a way to constrain the amount of uh parasitic application layer behavior to like not eventually topple over ergo these things need to be reflexively valuable exactly and so there's one there's like one point here which i'm sure is going to get debated um which is that you know eip1559 the base fee that is burned is additive to protocol security um even more so in a proof of state context right so maybe ether doesn't need to be money if like fee burns far exceed you know the amount of mev um or you know we don't need a perpetual black subsidy because the amount of uh the fee burn exceeds the amount of mvv like empirically that's not the case right because base fee burns scale in the number of transactions that happen on the platform whereas like any two transactions can have zero or a billion dollars of mev within them um and so uh i think like state rent eip1559 base fee burns are great because they're additive to platform security like the vast majority if you break down on a pie chart in my belief will need to be like the moneyness or the ability to um socialize platform security with a monetary premium because per like personally again i don't believe that fee burns state rent etc will like be sufficient to cover the cost of mev or parasitic application incentives which is why i think possibly we've come to a similar conclusion maybe from slightly different angles which is like the open financial system of the world again to the extent that there's only one or one becomes dominant will have at its base layer a store of value monetary premium type asset it can't maintain first place unless it does but let me ask you a question about alternative base layers so cosmos for example that is a tendermint anyway is a paradigm investment but i want your personal take on this cosmos is very clear that atoms the token behind the cosmos network are not money never intended to be money inflation schedule uh and such also sort of makes that true um you know protocol validators can can vote on issuance lots of things uh make that true can it exist as a base layer without becoming money i think what you just said about mev and other you know approaches um might mean you you think it can you think a cosmos is viable without atoms being money yeah i think i'm going to walk back a little bit to the ethereum case first and say my belief is that ethereum can work if ether is money and can socialize like a sufficient security budget for the platform right like i think that's a necessary um component but to be honest i don't know that's necessarily enough or that it's not the case that sort of parasitic application incentives like compound on one another to the point where it doesn't matter the monetary premium doesn't matter it's still overridden by sort of the asymptotic mev behavior of the platform so you know i think that's kind of like a contentious statement um i don't think that it's the obvious conclusion the obvious logical conclusion i think it's very possible that ethereum does work and remains secure economically secure long term and that's my hope but i also believe like it's possible that it doesn't um and so what alternatives at that point seem credible and is that where a cosmos and atoms kind of you know fit in they're not trying to be money but you know they could develop some sort of premium outside of like some sort of economic security outside of being a store of value exactly yeah um and so the the sort of cosmos holistic thesis maybe not specific to atoms although you know we could we could talk about sort of the hub the cosmos zone that they secure sort of the their specific dynamics but the cosmos thesis as a whole is that like in short if we figure out that we can't socialize the security of a general platform general smart contract platform by deluding a monetary premium then every application may need to pay for its own security and if every application needs to pay for its own security then like what's important to interoperability is shared standards um shared languages and like the ability to interoperate uh and for a smart con a comparable smart contract ecosystem to develop without relying on the homogeneous security of a shared-based platform and so what cosmos is is not any one blockchain but rather basically like a set of standards by which to uh create many of them and like allow them to interoperate uh without needing to share security the difference between an empire and individual city-states has been an analogy yeah i think that's fair i also think that the cathedral and bizarre kind of idea is fair from a security perspective um which is you know in cosmos like uh any individual application security could fail um and that will have ramifications on the broader ecosystem but there is not or there shouldn't be any one individual application whose security is like literally critical to the ecosystem's uh survival right in the same way that to be honest like in ethereum to the extent that it becomes insecure ether is not able to pay for the ethereum platform's security like we don't have a platform left right so the central point of security of ethereum it rests in this one single asset ether and it's one single mechanism for uh providing consensus uh which is proof of stake right and so since everything has the security of all platforms and all applications on top of ethereum rests upon those two things it becomes the one single point of attack or capture or coercion versus like a more distributed system where there are just a mesh network of of platforms and protocols that all kind of stitch themselves together where failure in one of those applications is relatively compartmentalized uh in relation in in comparison to if everything is built on top of one blockchain is that is that the right representation yeah i think so that's um it's actually a very nice way of putting it so charlie i want to finish this with one last uh line of questioning before before before we wrap this up um the madasa test net uh spun up last week and if everything goes according to plan it should be launching in november which which means that phase zero staking of ether goes live in this year hopefully fingers crossed uh and after speaking with a bunch of you know eth2 devs they are all sort of on board with this concept of compounding progress where phase zero took a really long time to get to if you want to if you want to count the maximum years it's it's five years since the genesis of ethereum did it take us to get to phase zero but phase one no one really thinks that phase one is all that far after phase zero and phase two all these things are happening in parallel meanwhile we have eip1559 and the burning of ether and of transaction fees which is guesstimated to be arriving sometime q1 q2 2020 uh 2021 based on the uh conversations that have been going on with the eip1559 implementation team my question and and uh what i'm trying to get out of you is going back to the conversation of reflexivity inside of these crypto application crypto networks and how that will impact the broader sphere so if we are just a few months away from staking which is a core pillar of the eth value accrual mechanism and maybe just after three or four months after that does eat burn go go live and then maybe three four or five months after that do we have sharding and scale uh do you do you and do your partner's app paradigm think about this uh this bam bam bam one two three four knock down the the obstacles for for ether's value proposition happening in pretty quick succession and and then um making that keeping that relevant to the reflexivity of these systems how do you guys think about all of these things tied together um so i think i'll make two controversial comments uh on the ethereum roadmap um i am more confident that it won't fail today than i was a year ago i also think there's uh a greater than 50 probability that we never get charted execution environments uh or any eth2 roadmap beyond phase one um how about one so how about 1.5 charlie do you know that the idea of 1.5 is basically like what we get is um proof of stake and then e data availability data availability and then everything scales with roll-ups yeah so that's that's why i say greater than 50 i think you know i'm not sure that it's legible to everyone yet like why all of what we talked about with respect to mev um and application layer incentives is kind of an input to um this question but it's not purely about feasibility of execution environments or like that roll ups are enough you know with ef2 data availability and proof of stake it's also about like centralizing mev extraction into roll-up proposers um and i think that as of right now like that i'm not sure if it's the more likely than like the original eth2 vision but if not it's like pretty quickly getting there i think um and i think eth1 5 you know roll-ups uh with sharded data availability and basically just execution of fraud proofs on the beacon chain um is a very similar model to cosmoses if you imagine that like the hub uh you know provided like a shared layer for um fraud proofs uh you know at least of uh the ones that chose to the idea here basically just being that like in the eth one five world it's important to remember that roll-ups can't talk to each other without making um idiosyncratic security assumptions right if there's fraud on one roll-up it can impact another to the extent they're inter-operating and so it looks it looks a lot like cosmos um to be honest and i think i don't know it'll be very interesting to see how it develops um i i don't feel like there's enough clarity yet for me to be really confident in like how it will go both in terms of like how eth2 will go if we get one five or um kind of the original you know full charted execution vision um but i think it's very interesting um and especially the extent that you know what we're currently seeing with d5 kind of continues and maybe even honestly we start seeing minor censorship in practice like that could push it to this must be the vision for ethereum going forward that's what i would look for if in the next year or two we start seeing miners not follow uh protocol or start extracting value themselves censoring transactions which is quite possible then i think we get eth1 5. very cool charlie we could spend a whole another hour i feel like talking about these things and going back and forth about them it has been a pleasure to talk to you sir i think you've got a depth of understanding that folks listening to bankless need particularly with topics around economic security um you know monetary premium and mev so we want to thank you for joining us thank you guys for having me i mean to be honest i'm just like a very delayed and less eloquent repeater note uh of vitality i would just drop all the links to everything that he's written i feel like we all are to something yeah so yeah but all of us together kind of generate a mutual understanding of what the hell vitalik is talking about it takes a village uh it's like the crypto equivalent of simpsons did it right exactly exactly all right uh bankless listeners this has been charlie noyes want to leave you with some action items today um the first thing you should do is read some of paradigms research one of which we will include bitcoin for the open-minded skeptic that is sort of an intro to for institutions primarily on why bitcoin is a meaningful asset secondly let's include some we'll include some links to uh articles that charlie mentioned one on the instability of bitcoin without block rewards and then the second the article from phil on mev will even include some vitalik comments that charlie will send us after the show the third thing david we are at 93 five-star reviews my friend do the math how far are we from 100 yeah really really far so we need everyone's help to get to a hundred the bank list nation recently passed uh 10 000 subscribers and the fact that there's only 93 uh five-star reviews on our podcast makes me a sad boy so if you could go to wherever you listen to your podcast and give us that five-star review so we can get the bankless gospel into as many ears as possible we would really appreciate it i think we're going to hit 100 right after the show david i've just got a feeling uh risks and disclaimers everyone eat this risky crypto is risky bitcoin is risky everything we talked about around yams and deep fly are very risky you could lose what you put in we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks so much [Music] you
