we're going to read bitcoin's prisoner's dilemma in the growing ecosystem of money games on ethereum which i have released on bankless tomorrow wednesday august 26th uh but i'm recording it today all right so this is a conversation as to some of the um things that underpin this entire industry mainly scarcity and how that kind of can be framed as a game now this is a frequent topic of conversation that we've gone down the whole of in the bankless world and this is just the next iteration of this we start with bitcoin because it is the foundation of all these games and then we go into how these games are being played and how it's different on ethereum and all of that so let's go ahead and get started bitcoin's prisoner's dilemma and the growing ecosystem of money games on ethereum monetary musical chairs bitcoin is a game of monetary musical chairs the 21 million bitcoin cap creates a game theoretic standoff between those that do and do not own bitcoin in the bitcoin game there are 21 million shares and anyone is allowed to sit in as many chairs as they can because of the supply cap when a buyer purchases bitcoin with no intent to sell a chair is permanently filled but there is a price for everything we can only assume that everyone could be convinced to offer up their chair so that the price so long as the price is right the current number of open seats in the bitcoin network is a function of the number of bitcoins left to be mined 2.6 million and the number of btc available on the secondary market which varies based on price the higher the price of bitcoin the more willing people are to stand up from their chairs and sell it to the highest bidder here's a nice little graphic one guy is defecting we'll get into that bitcoins game you are a player of bitcoin's game whether you like it or not bitcoin has a few qualities that forces everyone to play the game the choice to not purchase bitcoin is just as significant as the choice to purchase bitcoin the choice to not purchase bitcoin is a valid move but it's a move nonetheless by not purchasing bitcoin you are claiming that there will not be much demand for bitcoin in the future or that you're uninterested in crypto investing whatever this is why the term no coiner exists it expresses a group of people that have chosen to cooperate with traditional finance and defect from bitcoin's game defecting from bitcoin's game is a risky move choosing to not purchase bitcoin is a belief that others will not purchase it as well what if you're wrong cooperate or defect the prisoner's dilemma is a foundational scenario of game theory which shows why two completely rational individuals may not cooperate even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so in the prisoner's dilemma two prisoners are captured and questioned separately they each have a choice to make strike a deal with a prosecutor and write out your friend for a reduced sentence or don't confess in order to stay loyal to your friend while hoping that your friend does the same do they cooperate with their fellow prisoner comrade in hopes that their comrade cooperated with them or do they defect in order to save themselves while betraying their comrade into time in prison there's a further explanation available in the article in bitcoin the choice to cooperate with the prosecutor is to choose to remain inside the walls of traditional finance and shut your eyes to the possibility of a money outside of the rules and regulations of the nation-state fiat regime the choice to defect is to deploy your value and wealth into btc in the belief that its qualities as a money are superior than the fiat alternatives and that others will also do the same the bitcoin game bitcoin game players are incentivized to defect as early as possible due to the nature of the btc hard cap gotta claim as many seats as possible in bitcoin there are seven billion prisoners instead of two and instead of the risk of jail time the risk is not is owning a smaller percentage of bitcoins the more players there are the larger the incentive there is to defect because you really want to defect early here there's a lot of capital at stake there are three outcomes to bitcoin's prisoner's dilemma and it is as follows if everyone cooperates with traditional finance then bitcoin will not receive sufficient demand for price appreciation it will not become the world's global reserve currency if everyone defects then bitcoin will receive significant demand and will appreciate in price it will likely become the world's global reserve currency if some defect while others cooperate then it so some will be able to purchase cheaper bitcoin than others as they got to purchase first the lagards excuse me the laggards are at risk that they have that they will be forced to purchase bitcoin when much more of the 21 million bitcoins have already been claimed coordination game one of the greatest features of the cryptocurrency markets are their inherently global nature everyone with an internet connection is capable of playing bitcoin's game everyone is a player bitcoin is a game that incentivizes people to play it and it is also playable by everyone some players can sit down in many chairs investment firms hedge funds central banks governments or any capital preserving entity are able to purchase much more than their share of bitcoin bitcoin attracts tech savvy developers along with bleeding edge investments funds that can understand bitcoin's monetary musical chair value proposition those people are able to move quickly in order to ensure their seated position and not that many people need to defect to bitcoin in order to significantly appreciate it in price three types of investors plus one more from this prisoner's dilemma viewpoint i see three bitcoin and investor types emerging those that want in number one these are the sound money revolutionaries the digital nomads the freedom seeking inflation escaping westwarders a lot of these people are all in and they turn into evangelists that recruit others to defect as well these people are bitcoin's greatest weapon an army of marketers that are all financially incentivized to convince people to defect from fiat and join the ranks of hard money type 2 those that don't want to miss out these are the people that see the growing category of the the growing first category and want to hedge their bets on missing out those that manage people's money and have a fiduciary responsibility to generate a diversified portfolio digital assets included those people often have just a little exposure to bitcoin but enough to matter also there are many people in this category no coiners these people are the prisoners that cooperated with the traditional finance in the prisoner's dilemma they either decided that the bitcoin value proposition wasn't enticing enough to motivate them to buy or the whole world of cryptocurrency investing is just not on their radar either way they are sticking to traditional finance stock markets bond markets real estate cash savings whatever these prisoners are hoping either implicitly or explicitly that their fellow prisoners will cooperate with them and not defect off to scurry off to buy bitcoin behind their back fiat money is the embodiment of the no coiner also peter schiff victory bonus the last group of people the forced bitcoin purchasers aka adoption with more and more people defecting into bitcoin and away from traditional finance the pools of btc owners in the first two above groups grow larger as do the companies that support them this growth grows into network effects where people don't necessarily need to express an opinion about cooperating or defecting but instead they purchase save store or spend bitcoin in order simply because it is the best option available to them they don't really think about it as investing they just need to get something done in their life and they use bitcoin and btc to do it bitcoin is just now the air that people breathe the water that in which we swim at this point bitcoin just is like the internet once there is enough of these people bitcoin's game is over if this stage is reached those that have chosen to cooperate and stuck with traditional finance have fallen victim to their defecting comrades they are the last purchases purchasers of bitcoin in a stage where bitcoin has become less of an investment because one bitcoin is now worth 10 million dollars and instead it is treated more like savings these people are forced to join the last group of bitcoin adopters as they uh are required to own bitcoin to pay for some product or service when they could have purchased bitcoin 10 years earlier at a much reduced price austrian money the game being described here is at the core of austrian money this is how every single hard money asset works if there are strong restrictions on the printing of new units then the game is destined to be played there is no opting out of the game bitcoin's game is an ancient game that underpins all economics scarcity and the management of scarce resources is at the heart of the human condition the fact that bitcoin seems like a foreign concept to people is a litmus test for the current economic status quo that this world has fallen into fiat money and money printer gober has created the illusion of a world of abundance with limitless production this unfortunately is an incredible mitch mass mismatch between the world that we think we live in and the organic natural reality in real life things are scarce in real life value cannot be printed bitcoin created the system to return organic scarcity back to the world but bitcoin is just the start money games a while ago i wrote an article called ethereum the money game landscape in light of the resurgence of different types of games yield farming liquidity mining rebasing etc i think it's timely for those to to read if you have not yet it's linked right here in summary ethereum is a platform for the construction of money games the defy applications that we all know and love are individual wealth maximizing mini-games that are played on upon one single large board which we call ethereum every single money game on ethereum operates with the same structure of bitcoin's prisoner's dilemma but with more create creative and modular rules ether and the fight for 32 ether for a validator node is the same game mkr is a game of maximizing mkr ownership yams and wifey are the fight for the largest share over each over each's treasury is the same game ample and ample fourth is an accumulation game and currently ave is winning the game today is the day that ave flipped maker in the most value deposited into its vaults that's pretty cool when the ability to freely print new units is removed from the equation nature and economics takes over ethereum is a platform for democratizing scarcity and as a result we have seen an explosion of scarcity games being played on ethereum the so-called bull market that everyone thinks that we are about to embark on is going to be underpinned by this phenomenon wealth maximizing scarcity gains excited to see these mmo money games being built and played on ethereum the experiments going on with wifey ample and yams is incredibly fascinating but i'm willing to bet in a few short years we will look back on these games as early primitive designs that will ultimately be a part of a much larger bigger games different parts of each game will be repurposed and reconstructed into new games which will attract more attention more hype more players and more yield this is the story of the next 18 months of ethereum also don't forget about the ethereum game the quest for 32 eth the choice to play the lower risk east staking game versus the higher risk d5 yield maximizing game is itself a game that is a choice that you have to make eath staking is coming and more and more are pre-ordering the eath staking game at some point in time the east staking yields will return higher yields than the d5 yield maximizing games and those people that are playing that game will have already won and that concludes this reading of bitcoin's prisoner's dilemma thank you
