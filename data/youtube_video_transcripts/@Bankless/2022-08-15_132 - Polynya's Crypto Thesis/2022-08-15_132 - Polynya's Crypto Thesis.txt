this conversation has been a long time coming welcome to bank list where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a special episode for you today polenia's crypto thesis polenia is a crypto anon david and i have called this individual polynya in the past turns out that is not how you pronounce his name and uh we did this we did this conversation in kind of a unique way do you want to describe that before i get into some of the the takeaways here yeah we've always wanted to host polenia as one does who has a podcast with a writer who's writing very informative technical literature uh also definitely one of the most in-demand podcast guests that's out there but we could never have them because they were so anon that even their voice is too far doxed so ryan and i spent about five hours across two days in discord with polenia doing a written interview as if it was spoken uh and then we turned that into a script and we got a voice actor to come and speak and give polenia a voice uh so that is what you are about to listen to here on the episode today uh some takeaways for you number one who is polenia this uh crypto anon what is it like to be an anon in crypto and why did they choose to become anon number two pelenia's investment thesis i was particularly interested in this david where will the value accrue the layer one uh the layer two different tokens alternative layer ones and also polenia tells david and i what bankless got wrong in the thesis a little kind of correction and a change number three the long-term relationship between ethereum the layer one and its layer twos and roll-ups is this a parasitic relationship or is it symbiotic we talk about that number four polenia also steel man's cardano an argument for why um maybe bankless shouldn't give cardano such a hard time we get into the the puts and takes of that as well um david there's some implied knowledge coming into this episode that i feel like when we start to bandy about terms like l1 and l2 um that's maybe easier for most bankless listeners l1 of course is like the ethereum layer or the um the blockchain layer of things l2 is sort of the roll-up and we use these terms l1 and l2 but there are some other things that are maybe less common knowledge even for seasoned bankless listeners such as eip-4844 this term proto-dank sharding and this other term dank sharding david could you give us a quick explanation of some of these terms and why they're significant maybe how they relate to ethereum's roadmap yeah i think really the thing to emphasize here is eip-484 which is the thing that we talked about the most with polenia and this is of course is a part of ethereum's roll-up centric roadmap philosophy uh eip4844 really enshrines rollups as a first-class citizen on ethereum and you can actually kind of see in the moment where i have this like aha moment like personally um about like what 484 does and that's really there's like this link between layer two usage and layer one usage and it's in ethereum's current state so like your transaction on arbor drum or optimism or whatever shows up somewhere and with block space demand on the block on the layer one so block space demand on layer two does carry over does translate to block space demand for the layer one not at a one to one relationship is like a ten to one or or seven to one relationship in rolex current forms with uh eip4844 it a little bit breaks that relationship in that transactions can scale on rollups without there being too much more data going on to the layer one so roll-ups are like relinquished from their bond to the ethereum layer one and like there can be ten times more transactional activity on a layer two that doesn't actually put a larger footprint on the ethereum layer one so four eight four four really takes the breaks off of layer 2 scalability and allows them to really just go wild and that's with this call data opcode but really it's the idea that layer 2s are free to scale without having a larger and larger gas cost on the ethereum layer one one way to think of it is it makes it ultra cheap for layer two transactions to post onto layer one like massively more cheap 100x we're talking about so or a thousand x even and eip four eight four four is also called a proto dank sharding because it's a skinny down minimum viable product um release that is tentatively scheduled for the next maybe release after the merge we don't know yet but it could possibly be coming in 2023 and this is all part of ethereum's big push towards scalability and uh seems very achievable i mean it's not a massive undertaking to implement this so we actually expect it to come relatively soon and again this is an order of magnitude increase in terms of roll-up transaction throughput or cost decrease you think of it that way too of like roll-up transactions costing a small micro fraction of a penny rather than you know 10 cents or 20 cents as it costs today proto dang sharding of course is actually a name coined between proto-lambda who is a person in uh the the ethereum space and dank rad uh who is uh it works at the ef but the name actually works out because it's proto as in like you know early dang sharding later comes folding sharding which is just the full manifestation of this full vision and you just add another order of magnitude of scale onto roll-ups so much scale that like we can't even comprehend the level of scale that it's going to bring but that is uh don't hold your breath for ding sharing it's not happening anytime soon uh 20 24 and beyond uh but this information is just going to be really really useful to understand as we go into this episode with polenia uh because this is what they focus on and so that having this in your brain as you go into this is going to be useful so with that let's get right to the conversation with paulenya but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications it is the new era for social media we all have toxic relationships with our web 2 apps we want to break up with them but we can't these applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us lens isn't a social media app it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user in crypto we say not your keys not your crypto and on lens we say not your keys not your profile with lens your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use and instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create so in order to get started there is a secret code word in the show notes enter that code word in the google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to e so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum notes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there arbitram is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts

long time coming we're super excited about it and we're thrilled to introduce you to our next guest paulinha paulina is a pseudo-anonymous writer an investor a crypto researcher as well they call themselves a crypto hobbyist but i'm pretty sure i've learned more about blockchain scalability from this crypto hobbyist than i have from 99.9 percent of the so-called experts in the space pelinia coined the term modular blockchain and has been super influential on about a hundred different crypto topics most notably on rollups it's where i learned most of my no roll up knowledge from polenia and is also quick to point out though that roll-ups are no longer their main focus fellinia welcome to bankless it's great to have you on hello there ryan david delighted to be on bankless all right we gotta get this out of the way and talk about the meta of the podcast uh so this is the first time we've done a podcast in this format from bankless listener as well so to preserve your privacy you're an on right now and we are having this conversation through a written chat log but your voice is being reenacted right now by a member of the bankless community thank you eureka john for doing that is it cool that we're doing it this way is it kind of weird pulling ya i've i've written dialogue for fictional characters but never autobiographically so this will be an interesting experience my personal experiment would be i'd try to write it as a screenplay it's something new for you too isn't it and what do you think well autobiographically was the wrong word but you know what i mean yeah this is certainly a first for us but the crypto world always throws fun curveballs and we like to be flexible here at bankless just curious in an ideal world who would play you as a voice actor anyone like either fictional or non-fictional huh let me think um i i'd say my ideal choice would be maggie chung okay so i'm looking up maggie chung right now for the listeners who aren't familiar who is she well you got to check out her work maggie chung is an actor from hong kong some of her best work is in the mood for love irma vep and hiro interestingly some of maggie's best work is in the silent moments where a lot of the emotions are conveyed through subtle gestures and movements i i suppose that's why i'd like to hear more of her voice i should say her voice is pretty captivating too but excuse me excuse my simping um by the way she had a cameo on tarantino's inglorious bastards infamously cut from the final film okay sorry i'm done okay well we have some new movie recommendations to check out as well so thank you my friend uh we're going to talk about crypto but first we kind of want to talk about you the anon because this is super fascinating to us why did you decide to be an anon in crypto and is it hard sure um this is one of my many pseudonyms there are many reasons to going on it's mostly a clean separation from my various hobbies uh going back this is actually my third and on crypto itself uh the wonderful folks from refinance will know my other crypto anon which i also used on steam since 2016. i kind of messed up there you know crossing wires between the two and ons specifically for pallinia it was a pretty simple objective to raise awareness about sustainable scaling strategies it comes from a time when the prevailing narrative was something like cardano will release smart contracts soon with 1 million tps and there'll be a mass exodus from ethereum overnight i could barely believe what i was seeing and decided it would be fun to do my little bit and to bridge the massive information asymmetry the plan was to write a few posts and then disappear obviously that didn't quite pan out given i'm here rambling on about so so yeah it's just difficult to cover different hobbies and then move on to the next one without any baggage if you will yeah but this has to be difficult juggling different lives switching back and forth is it hard the trick is not to juggle too many lives at the same time but to move between them most posts on my blog were written in q2 and q3 2021 at that time this was my primary hobby since q4 2021 i barely have one blog post a month so i can move on to other things i'd say at any given time i only have two or three active anons it's it's not too difficult if you plan it out and uh remember to be strict about the time you spend on each um each and on in community has its own challenge i i'd say for crypto it's um not sure how to put this but uh the general hostility you know i mean i've never had an anon on some heated religious or political venue but it's it's pretty fascinating how angry people are on twitter yeah certainly we're all all too familiar with it on our side as well uh so paulinha i've gotten the hint that you've actually got this very rich life outside of crypto you've apparently written dialogue uh you i think you might be a film or tv connoisseur obviously you've played some games on steam i know you're anon but can you cast a little light on the life that's behind the twitter profile all right um without giving too much away um my primary interests are in the field of arts entertainment and culture also happen to be my primary day jobs so to speak but just like my anon's i keep moving between different projects in my work moving to 32 hour work weeks has been tremendously more productive and also at least for me i i know 32 hours may seem absurd for some but but yeah also it gives me more time to indulge my hobbies of which there are many uh i'm generally more inclined towards humanities related topics but um i have no idea myself what may interest me next so so i'm making it up and uh playing it by ear and and trying to make the most of my meaningless existence i think you've definitely left some breadcrumbs of your strong interest in culture and arts on crypto twitter and our on our youth finance um but to hear that you work a calm 32-hour work week uh with these seeming intent on experiencing the many facets of human culture that the world has to offer it seems to be at odds with a very technically adept persona that we find on crypto twitter so how did you become so technically minded and why bother with the drama of crypto twitter when you could be out touching grass ah my my persona is a bit of an illusion a fugazi um back in 2020 when i first started writing comments on re finance and rcc i i used a completely different tone uh more of a curious observer more of a neutral tone but at some point in summer 2021 again i realized crypto calls for a more unique strategy uh i decided to create a new blog with a new name and go on the offensive with hyperbole bombastic statements um it worked too well and the posts went viral within a matter of days in reality i i'm not technically minded at all i i couldn't write a line of code to save my life heck i couldn't read a line of code to save my life so i suppose the skill i'm employing here is understanding a topic that i actually have no idea about or qualifications for and churning a narrative out of it um crypto twitter drama huh uh i i kind of regret that one um i stayed away from crypto twitter for the longest time focusing mainly mostly on my medium blog and reddit but got so many requests eventually buckled under pressure and uh the account grew quickly and i stayed due to inertia and many asking me to and um i could see my presence there was not making not an insignificant impact um but anyway uh i think i've had enough now and lately i've only been on twitter a couple times a week okay so maybe you're not technical but you have this insane ability to synthesize highly technical content and make a mental model out of it from our perspective the reader's perspective the listener's perspectives it feels extremely technically well-informed and makes you appear that you've worked in related fields prior to crypto something like computer science hardware architecture distributed systems design where did all of that come from are you are you just one of these like really smart types that can absorb information extremely fast i'm not sure um i think it probably comes from being curious about different topics and moving between them i i definitely don't have an innate talent um probably just experience in identifying the important points to get an overview of the situation i think i've observed that everything we do is complex some things like computer science may seem more complicated and extremely technical than something like i don't know woodworking or something but despite appearances once you're interested in a variety of things to me it seems everything is more or less equally complex one thing um obviously there are some incredibly complex projects like building apollo 11 or burj khalifa that needs millions of people to collaborate but i mean what an individual can process whether it be the chief architect the chief scientist there's always a broad overview that one person can understand relatively easily you know i think the other thing people like about your voice is that it feels like non-tribal it's so it's almost scientific in its approach so you come at things from a neutral perspective you're building on first principles and these are economic and technical and i think people find that refreshing the fact that you're not a crypto shill you almost seem to have this like love-hate relationship with crypto and you appreciate its virtues but you're also quick to call out the vapor and the fluff why do you have this love-hate relationship with crypto well i i wouldn't say it's a love-hate and relationship um i just have a different opinion on things in crypto uh some things in crypto are very cool while most of it is embarrassing really which is what you would expect i mean it may seem refreshing because crypto is deafened by very very loud shills i mean do you feel the same oh i definitely have a love-hate relationship with krypto crypto i feel like has attracted some of the best and most genuine most human forward people in the world like we've got some of the biggest brains of our generation legitimately but it's also attracted these cult leaders scammers like these short-term think thinkers and sometimes i'm embarrassed to even be part of this industry and other times i couldn't be more proud to play a part in it but i guess i would say the reason i'm still here is because the good outweighs the bad at the base level i think that's especially true the protocol level the cryptography level crypto is a technology that i think will bring tremendous freedom to the world it's probably the most important thing i feel like i could be doing with my time and uh maybe that's where we should turn the conversation next fellainia let's turn the conversation to crypto yeah i hear you um though i'm probably a bit more on the neutral side than you are also not sure if the good outweighs the bad in its current state but cautiously optimistic if you will in the long term okay let's start there then uh because that's a distinction that's probably worth talking about david and i as listeners know we're ultra optimistic about crypto over the long run and i want to hear your bear case for the space like in what ways could this crypto experiment go wrong i'm not talking about the current state we both agree there's a ton to build and lots to do but in the far future how do you think this whole crypto thing could turn out badly for us crypto is a blank slate that can be used for good as much as much for bad i know that's kind of an abstract opinion and also satisfying our innate gambling instincts can be looked upon as a productive valuable use case but subjectively in my humble opinion um thus far crypto hasn't really done enough or as vitalik once asked we haven't earned it simultaneously fintech and banking continue improving and in some developing countries you have solutions like alipay in pesa or paytm which are ridiculously simple and convenient i mean it's not just fintech or banking it's pretty much everything really um like y'all said on a roll-up recently bullish humanity um a majority of humanities not actually on crypto but in democratic institutions public corporations cooperatives who are doing their very best to improve things and they're no less well-intentioned motivated and talented than other crypto people now we live in a prosperous time in history um by many a measure and it's quite possible we get to a point where i'm not sure why crypto's needed um my bold case is that crypto seamlessly integrates into the traditional venues and fills the holes uh not not holes but let's say gaps which in certain niches and crypto is uniquely qualified uh i'm not sure if that makes sense but my idea is something like not bankless but better banks in the very far future i'm so bullish humanity that i think will solve our trust issues and get rid of trustless solutions trust is inherently highly efficient and scalable and that's what's got us to this place achieved remarkable things and in the first place the best optimization is better trust not trustless i sometimes joke okay the half joke ethereum will succeed when it's no longer relevant okay so what i what i'm hearing is that crypto is currently neutral at best when it comes to the value it's bringing for humanity but we're we're still early so there's still potential there meanwhile our our tradified banking system is actually getting meaningfully better over time and actually providing new value to the world banking the unbanked connecting people financially and we share this idea that crypto will become the back end to the current financial system that we have but i failed to see a world where the banking system becomes systemically superior without crypto crypto it's like tugging the banking system by force to become better by its mere existence and now that crypto exists banks must compete with it and only in crypto can you codify can't be evil so it forces banks to not be evil because there's this can't be evil alternative i don't see a world in which we like produce a bull market in human trust that isn't supported by this underlying trustless system it's the fact that we have the option to run trustless systems at the base layer is is what creates a flourishing of human trust on layers on top of it do you agree with all that generally agree um but i don't think crypto codifies can't be evil in quotes at all um so far we've seen a hell of a lot of evil things happen tons of scammers grifters opportunists the the traditional systems have checks balances and protections but there's none in crypto so i'm not sure i really understand what you mean here yeah yeah yeah okay so i definitely not all of crypto obviously can't be evil upgrade keys for example means that the window of still doing evil is very very open but some parts of crypto have been been elevated into a can't be evil status i'd put uniswap there other d5 protocols there uh that's what's got people so excited about unit swap in 2019 we all realized that there was this can't be evil liquidity primitive that would be in our dfi toolbox for like the rest of time so our idea is that the can't be evil toolbox grows and grows and grows exponentially and that is something that the banking layer will have to contend with by exactly what you said becoming better banks ah that i agree with um i definitely think technologies like uni swap can improve banks exchanges and such and and i don't think we're focusing nearly enough on these proven valuable use cases yeah so i i actually think we're we're fairly aligned on that part like maybe bankless veer is a little optimistic in tone sometimes right no one has ever accused david and myself of being too bearish on anything in crypto but i actually think we arrive in in much the same place as what you're talking about paulina um okay so philosophy aside what i love about you is that you're also an investor and as an investor you've got this value accrual thesis for crypto as do we and i think your thesis your value accrual thesis is unique and it's kind of contrarian for many others i've heard so let's get right to that what is your thesis for crypto uh yes uh at the end of the day all of us want to see greater financial inclusion and options for all but mildly differ on what might be the best way to achieve it i i don't have a strong thesis um i'm also not much of a crypto investor my first impression of bitcoin was that it doesn't make any sense as a medium of exchange um this was back when it was the main narrative but i thought it's the greatest ponzi the world has ever seen you see the the fatal flaw of ponzi's before is they had a perpetrator maybe ponzi is too harsh but i mean it was the first how should i put it uh let's let's call it the first non-productive collectible without a perpetrator so my thesis was pretty much we love to gamble and this is the best one yet that was a while ago i haven't owned any bitcoin for years for a variety of reasons for the longest time i was out of crypto markets but i got kind of interested again in 2019 with the rise of defy combine that with eip 1559 and proof of stake and there was actually something new and interesting here an alternative economy anchored by a productive asset of course i was watching bankless from day one since i found out about it on refinance aside from ether uh i really don't find any asset in crypto investable and even eath is far too volatile for my tastes um so sure plenty will make a ton of money on speculation alone uh but making money is the least interesting thing about investing for me um and investing aside um my actual ideal uh let's call it a wish um is to see protocols blossom without tokens or governance or just just immutable protocols that exist as a public good for all wait hold on if investing isn't about making money that making money is the least interesting part of investing then what about it do you like about it that well there's no way to say this without sounding like a pretentious knob so i'll say it it is about efficient allocation of capital and what matters most to me as in to say the future is a better place when we can allocate capital more efficiency efficiently and you intend on allocating capital to places that you think are good yeah pretty much i mean good according to me anyway um as far as i mentioned earlier my focus is in areas of culture arts and entertainment but there's a deeper layer to it it's in independent forms of art and entertainment that are innovating a curious thing about these fields is there are pioneering works that often go underappreciated because they're kind of far ahead of their time but they make an impact indirectly on society at large um well getting off topic here but my point was investing in such works gives me a lot more satisfaction even if i barely break even than a sure shop trade like say shorting luna or something oh my god david we found someone who's in it for the tech oh thank god well there's definitely a context to it and i'm obviously speaking from a position of privilege i mean that's a relative thing i don't have any extravagant needs so i can afford to invest my money in things that matter to me just wanting to get rich is absolutely fine okay back to the tokens and governance thing uh do you see a possible universe where ethereum has a blossoming app layer that doesn't involve tokens or application governance and how would you see this future come about when we have so clearly seen the coordination power of tokens work its magic for better or for worse like how would you see this app layer this governance free app layer manifest um as much as i'd like to see more experimentation on that front i i doubt it's gonna happen um people like tokens i think they're here to stay for better or for worse um maybe we'll see some protocols do very well without a token we shall see all right so personal investing aside i guess um why don't you tell us your best guess for like how all of this plays out all layers of the stack how do you rank order parts the crypto tech stack on what captures the most value and i think we can start broad here polly and i like l1 assets or the app layer maybe we'll start there l1 assets for the app layer which will accrue more value and why i i expect the app layer to capture the most value with one caveat money is the best application if the l1 asset is great money then it's likely to capture a ton of value the thing is aside from bitcoin or ethereum most l1 assets are abysmal money often by design some of them are even proud of this so it it's probably going to be more of a case by case thing it's also important to clarify that the app layer does not necessarily mean the app token we've seen recently uni swap capturing more value than ethereum but none of it goes to the uni token holders okay let's quickly make this about ethereum just for a second which captures more value eth either the asset or the aggregate ethereum app layer it depends on how the ethereum economy shapes up and if it's largely financial in nature with all the high value settlement happening on l1 then there's a good chance that eth captures a ton of value rather more or less than the aggregate app layer is hard to say but it's hard to imagine it'll be much more if at all an alternative outcome is most value is through consumer activity on rollups in which case the aggregate app layer definitely captures more i have no idea how it's going to play out but thus far it seems crypto's lasting use case is defy so by current trajectory there's a decent chance eth becomes a very valuable asset all right so the money piece money you said is the killer app and you mentioned bitcoin was the best ponzi game you'd ever seen so between bitcoin and ether which is better money that's an easy one uh more challenging question please ah okay you are a bankless listener but but seriously like tell us why you think that i'm assuming you think eve uh is it the same reason that david and i think that yeah pretty much i mean your listeners know it well so i have nothing to add or okay maybe let me attempt a devil's advocate let's say there is a chance that a bunch of wealthy people continue to believe in bitcoin and it remains the most valuable asset but i guess that doesn't necessarily mean it's better money no yeah i mean i guess they're tackling the money problem in different ways right bitcoin through maximum ossification and the memetic narrative around all that and ethereum by making its block space more valuable and generating this internal economy for eth demand and i definitely know which one i'm betting on but why'd you also say other layer ones suck at being money like do you think that changes over time i mean there was a time when eth was a much worse money than it is today oh yeah definitely i'm sure any l1 that builds a strong social layer will focus on economic sustainability eventually four years ago eth was pretty much where most l1 assets are today the ultimate goal was to be money the economic bandwidth whatever but you're not going to be good money in the first place if the asset has high inflation and no viable plan for economic sustainability i mean we also believe that a decently high amount of decentralization is needed for an asset to become money at least on on the layer one and like do you agree with that and do you think alt layer ones passed this decentralization test yet depends uh how do you define decentralization here i would say anti-corruption resistance uh like an inability to tinker with the dials around issuance and block rewards that's important um having a large group of block producers i haven't turned into a small group of powerful cartels even like the ability for the average joe tecky to run a node to validate the chain as a check on block producer power all these are important it's censorship resistance it's uptime in the event of catastrophe are you got to have a reasonable distribution of supply and more distribution is always better i also think you need defy on the base layer because a decentralized money with a centralized banking layer isn't very useful at all and this is one of our main criticisms of bitcoin there's no defy there's stuff like that hmm that's an interesting question uh i i definitely agree all of those are very desirable properties and some of them may be required for good money like like say uptime but i'm not sure if some others like the average joe running a node has any direct correlation on being good money or if there are big cartels running the show it may not matter if the average joe thinks the cartels are trustworthy i mean indirectly i can see that it makes for a more resilient network in extreme conditions and thus the base asset is better money but yeah i don't have much of an opinion about it right away fellaini a second ago you said it depends on how the ethereum economy shapes up if it's largely financial in nature that if word sticks out to me ryan and i have this thesis that all financial transactions will push out all non-financial attract transactions by their very nature like financial transactions are worth something and therefore they these transactions can afford higher gas fees than non-financial transactions so the the idea is that ethereum or any crypto economic network really naturally concludes as a financial system no matter what its initial state is because you know limited blocks place supply the ones with higher gas fees push out the ones with lower gas fees and the ones that have higher gas fees will will be financial in nature by their very nature so it seems to us that ethereum is destined to become financially dominated and it's on chain activity like financial stuff will be they significantly dominate dominant block space purchaser do you agree with this idea or do you see a place for other blocks based consumers that aren't finance stuff i agree with the idea i think it's inevitable high-value financial transactions price everything out um i i'm looking at a scenario where d5 remains a niche category and there's maybe something else some novel applications on rollups let's say which achieve mass adoption of a billion users in such a scenario it's possible these applications accrue more value than the finance stuff that's more of a hypothetical um i think everything we have seen so far points to financial apps being the dominant use case anyway ah okay so like maybe d5 dominates on the app layer as the majority consumer of block space on the on the layer one but maybe something like gaming takes off on layer twos and then it's layer twos that compete with the d5 layer one to consume block space so maybe it's like the aggregate level of gaming on a layer two actually does compete with d5 layer one block space consumption is that a strong possibility important to note that um after eip4844 roll-ups are no longer competing with l1 applications they have their own dedicated space and fee market so let's consider the example of a game that has its own roll-up it has well it's actually a volition but anyway it has its own consumers and it's a multi-billion dollar business that makes more money than all of d5 combined it pays ethereum some negligible amount of that but that's about it come to think of it so rare is kind of like this and they pride themselves on their web to like and quotes experience and their customers pay with their credit cards and so on and many don't even know what ethereum is like i said after eip 4844 it won't be competing with l1 apps either i i don't think this is likely though it does seem like financial applications are the lasting sustainable product market fit for ethereum dapps that'll accrue most value long term but there are other possibilities worth considering okay so uh and getting back to the original theme of this which which captures more value the ethereum map layer or eth let's talk about layer 2 value capture execution layers how strong is layer 2 value capture potential when compared to the ethereum layer 1 or the ethereum app layer and maybe this answer changes as to whether it's a generalized roll-up like optimism or arbitrarily or a specialized roll up like starcx which is what silver is versus a zk roll up et cetera how do you think about this this deck there are a lot of different dynamics at play here uh let me try to boil it down basically the highest financial transactions will accrue the most value and those are going to remain on l1 um likewise the l1 dapps will do the bulk of the high value stuff since financial apps need generalized composability it's probable whichever l2 focuses on d5 also accrues significant value mostly through mav but you could have a different l2 with a thriving ecosystem but lots of low value transactions with very little mev or transaction fees specialized roll-ups are going to be very efficient and capture no mev in very little fees but they may be very lucrative on the strength of the application's revenues alone and then you have eth being used as money on l2s and all l1s alike that could capture a fair bit of value too this is where i'll probably cop out and say this is a complex topic with many possibilities so it depends on the nature of the l2s their app layers and nature of the space and so on okay so let me see if i can i can summarize this if there's a generalized layer 2 that focuses on d5 and it becomes the d5 layer 2 that's probably pretty valuable because it comes with high value paid for its gas fees it comes with mev potential this is probably the highest value flavor of layer 2 that's possible and after saying this it kind of sounds like the layer this layer two is the closest fractal from the ethereum layer one itself so that kind of just makes sense and maybe there's a layer two that's mainly about like social applications or something like whether it's a generalized or app-specific roll-up it doesn't really matter because these social transactions whatever they are don't come with mev potential so that layer two can't capture mev because there is none and a chain like this sounds like it captures little to no value and then there's like these application specific chains where perhaps the chain itself captures little to no value but the application itself does but then it becomes dependent upon the nature of the application itself and what it does and how much value it can capture is this all right and also does this equation change when it's an optimistic roll-up versus a zk roll up that sounds about right um in reality it's probably going to be a mix and match of all the above and a lot more there's also a dark horse scenario where an l2 builds an awesome money that is genuinely innovative and the l2 asset becomes the primary collateral in its ecosystem instead of eth i think world coin is attempting a pure money play as an l2 there are also some scenarios possible where l2 is basically free to use but each smart contract on it pay a small commission to the l2 so there there's a lot a whole world of possibilities here um i can't think of why the equation would change whether it's an optimistic or zk roll up all right so this is important so in the past david and i have been really bullish on l2 demand for ethereum block space as a driver for each value accrual and that's the simple idea that the burn leader board which charts the ethereum apps that buy the most block space on ethereum so the idea is that the top block space consumers on that board will no longer be the open seas and the unit swaps of the world but they'll start to become the layer twos like in optimism and arbitrarily the zk's but i think you've said this idea could be completely wrong that after proto-dank sharding in eip-4844 which could come as early as next year by the way ethereum block space purchases by roll-ups could drop down towards zero in other words it'll be extremely low cost for roll-ups to use ethereum and purchase theorem block space and this is great for roll-up users of course everything gets cheaper but it also removes a source of value accrual for eat the asset can you go into that idea a little bit more okay so i think many disagree about this so take everything i say with a grain of salt today the arbor trims and optimisms may appear on leaderboards because ethereum is not designed to support roll-ups it's still in a monolithic state if you will so roll-ups have to pay unnecessarily high fees due to high-value defy or nfts or whatever that's bidding up the global gas price basically eip-4844 introduces a dedicated data layer to ethereum with its own fee markets that can 1000x the current utilization of today's rollups put another way basically rollups can expand 1000x capacity all the while paying ethereum a quite negligible fee now once this 1000x is saturated the 1559 like mechanism kicks in and it gets bit up but it's still expected to stay stay negligible and then dank sharding comes and expands that capacity by 20x and through the decade dance sharding continues expanding 100x over the next decade as bandwidth and storage gets cheaper and not to mention you have off-chain data options for validiums like data layer and or zk porter that are targeting some very high data bandwidths to basically millions of tps yeah i know tps is a pretty useless metric but you get the idea so in short there's going to be an abundance and ever increasing data capacity so uh one silly in a hyperbolic analogy would be data layers are like a vast ocean with roll-ups as cruise liners on top you'd expect the water to be pretty cheap and the cruise liner will capture much more value but there's more to it you have the settlement layer the l1 we know and love which will interoperate and bridge assets and that's going to capture more value in the long term though the real driver of value accrual would be eth's use as money on all these l2s and indeed also all l1's side chains and others and maybe even meet space someday but yeah like i said many disagree so make of it what you will so this is actually pretty divergent from how we've been saying on bank lists we've been saying that as people migrate to the layer twos and layer twos begin to dominate that layer twos will become the dominant buyers of layer one block space and what you're you're saying is almost the opposite of that that eip four eight four four and then later dink sharding makes layer two's consumption of l1 block space largely negligible even as layer two block space demand goes up so l2s won't be dominant consumers of layer 1 block space in your opinion yeah yeah pretty much meanwhile you you'll still have the high value financial transactions that'll remain on l1 they'll continue to dominate l1 transaction fees it's possible years or decades down the line the l2 data fees aggregate it to be something substantial but it's probably going to require a different paradigm okay so you're assuming that l2 demand doesn't increase by a bunch of orders of magnitude after it becomes so much cheaper and i gotta ask the question is that a valid assumption because it seems to be the case with technologies whether you're talking about bandwidth or processor speeds or energy that whenever something we like gets cheaper we just find new apps to use it so why wouldn't block space be like that you know it's kind of like people in the 1990s saying oh my 56k modem is fine what would i ever do with broadband like there's not enough apps for it uh and i get everything i need without a 10 megabits per second connection i'm fine with my 56k modem oh no no i'm assuming that l2 demand does increase by several orders of magnitude to match the increased supply like i said post eip 4844 rollups can expand their capacity by 1000 x of today's activity all the while continuing to pay negligible fees to ethereum it's only after this 1000x capacity is saturated does the 1559 like mechanism kick in but by then we'll be ready to expand the capacity again with full dink sharding but there are deeper factors at play here i don't know how deep we want to get into this but basically it's it's much much easier to scale data on a data layer than execution on the rollup assuming there are no other bottlenecks you simply add more data sampling nodes and your data capacity increases this is very much unlike execution layers where adding more nodes actually reduces bandwidth which is the chief bottleneck for data layers also increases much faster than compute which is the chief bottleneck for rollups so i actually had a thread about the dynamics on how compute advancements are slowing down on a cost basis so there are many factors at play here which ultimately result in data being the relatively abundant resource okay so let's assume all that is true that l2s do not produce high fee revenue for ethereum since data in this world is so plentiful in uh you know post tank sharding so does that mean that l2 tokens themselves accrue all of the value and if so is this bearish for each asset i think we're going to see some innovation with how l2 tokens accrue value the obvious candidate would be congestion fees plus mev but i have a hunch that in the long term the most efficient fee markets and mev mitigations may leave an l2 with a competitive advantage i mean an advantage versus other l2s where users pay a high cost both in congestion fees and mev it could be that some l2s build strong network effects or have other special features or higher security where users are happy to pay a bit of premium then there's also the alternative mechanisms like i mentioned earlier maybe you have an l2 that has no transaction fees but instead takes small commissions from the dapps deployed on it so i can see this go a lot of ways and some l2 tokens become valuable especially the ones with network effects and a thriving financial ecosystem worth noting that while data may be abundant and not that expensive there will be larger entities bridging in and out roll-ups will be interoperating with each other and so the settlement layer will probably remain pretty busy definitely not bearish for eth as eath will be the primary money used across most of these l2s some will definitely push their own assets but eth just has a much larger economic capacity and any roll-up that outright shuns eath will be at a massive competitive disadvantage it's also important to note that roll-ups are entirely additive to the broader ethereum ecosystem actually i've also previously argued so are alt-l-1s and side chains they induce new demand that wouldn't have otherwise existed given ethereum's limited capacity it's kind of like the budget airlines boom you know people were worried that budget airlines like ryanair would kill air france or whatever but in reality they just ended up expanding the overall demand for air travel including the premium carriers okay so you just said that eth would be the primary money in layer twos why like why not stable coins or why not layer two native assets the the the tokens or why not bitcoin uh straight away not bitcoin because currently there's no secure way to bridge bitcoin and i've seen some designs for trust minimize bridges to bitcoin but uh what i've seen it's it's mostly going to be a one-way bridge definitely a good idea for roll-ups to build this and start swallowing some of that bitcoin but eth is much easier natively secured by rollup bridges like i mentioned eth just has a larger capacity so it's just a better economic collateral than anything in this industry barring bitcoin but yeah maybe a rollup comes up with a brilliant money design and it gains serious value i do expect to see stable coins play an important role but the usd may be an awesome medium of exchange but it's quite a poor store of value also the standard unit of account but again a poor store of value so for a lot of the use cases we expect in d5 we need something more sound like ethereum a bitcoin juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your trucking account with juno you can send money from your juno checking account straight on to a layer 2 like

click the wallet icon to get started okay i want to zoom out and integrate all of this because this is actually new for me the bankless thesis has been that layer twos are bullish for the layer one because aggregate block space demand for layer two translates into block space demand for the layer one with four eight four four this becomes not true and necessarily so it becomes not true because if there was a relationship between layer one and layer two block space consumption if that relationship was preserved this actually limits layer two scale so we need to decouple the relationship between layer two and layer one block space to fully like take off the breaks of layer two scalability but then that begs the question how do layer twos remain aligned with layer ones if layer twos are only consent consuming the minimum amount of layer one block space therefore contributing the minimum amount to layer one security meanwhile they are hosting this massive burgeoning gdp on top of them and the ethereum l1 doesn't have a share of that does that make layer twos parasitic to the layer ones and your answer is no because first ethereum will be money inside of these layer twos eth is a money network effects are too strong for a single layer two token to penetrate and two trade between these layer twos will route through the layer ones either directly or indirectly via bridges am i understanding this correct in most cases it's going to be a symbiotic relationship it's it's notoriously hard to build large economic security economic bandwidth and liquidity across many assets to the point only bitcoin and ethereum have succeeded although some may argue that they are both pretty negligible in the grand scheme of the global economy um by paying a negligible fee to ethereum the roll-up gets fully secure access to all this liquidity and insecurity it's a huge win uh meanwhile ethereum also wins because it wouldn't have supported any of this activity anyway but there are there are definitely edge cases to consider let's consider a scenario like you mentioned where you have a massive l2 and its token is some significant fraction market cap of eth let's say 20 or so there's um two ways to look at this firstly this is activity that ethereum is unable to host anyway so there's no real loss there from the other side the rollups perspective they're paying such a negligible fee to ethereum that it doesn't make any sense for them to risk losing access to all the security and liquidity that brought them so much success in the first place but on the other hand if they contributed a significant amount let's say 50 of its fees to l1 then they would be well justified in spinning out their own l1 so it may turn out that low value accrual from l2s is actually for the best look i i think at the end of the day all this is a bit of a red herring and any activity outside of the ethereum l1 is net additive to the industry at large and the broader ethereum ecosystem in specific because ethereum l1 wasn't going to host this activity anyway so there's this frequent meme or critique out of some of the alternative ecosystems out there cosmos definitely i think but also others too um that the ethereum model forces slayer twos or ecosystems to pay rent to the ethereum overlord or more specifically more nefariously ether holders themselves does the four eight four four model take the wind out of the sales of this critique okay this whole pay rent in quotes thing is is quite absurd ethereum provides the highest quality settlement services and rollups bid for them it's as simple as that by the way i'm pretty sure with cosmos you have chains paying some portion of their fee to adam no i'm pretty sure i saw some chain planning to pay 25 of their transaction fees to adam anywho 48.44 is explicitly designed and and later full dank sharding too of course designed so rollups pay as little fees as possible i'd expect a busy successful roll-up will pay less than one percent of its fees to ethereum long-term though you may also have ghost chain roll-ups that pay a lot more because they fail to accrue value themselves in this world where the majority of crypto economic economic gdp is hosted on layer twos what does the layer one look like is ethereum just like a marketplace for liquidity and trade across these various layer twos what would remain on the layer one what remains on layer one is the majority of the cryptoeconomic gdp of course the world is highly unequal and this is very directly reflected in crypto come to think of it i'd even argue crypto will remain even more inequal with the absence of any social welfare or redistributive mechanisms so basically the top 1 entities will be responsible for 99 of the gdp financial institutions billionaires governments and and the like will always choose the most robust the most secure space and that'll always be ethereum l1 when you're transacting millions of dollars you couldn't care less if the fee is one cent or one hundred dollars so even if you have 99 enormies on l2 it could be that 99 of the economic activity in dollar terms or e terms remains on l1 um it's also important to remember the l1 itself will keep improving and expanding capacity with with one of the splurge road map items being upgraded to an enshrined zk evm roll-up so you think that the current d5 blue chips like unit swap maker ave won't have to uproot themselves and find new homes their primary headquarters will always be the ethereum layer one yeah you can definitely think of ethereum l1 as their home base their their headquarters it's it's where their protocols and most of their liquidity will live the challenge then is seamlessly making all of this available to the various l2s um i've seen some interesting ideas from the likes of maker and ave in development to address this and i'm sure more will come another possibility is they deploy their own roll up and make that their headquarters while while still being fully secured by ethereum of course but this will only be possible for some protocols where atomic composability isn't a big deal what kind of defy app do you think would be most suited to have its own app specific layer two like the uni chain for example are there certain kind of defaults in which this would make sense uh i haven't really thought about it um though i actually i've actually discussed this with a couple of d5 protocols the main thing you lose is atomic composability with other ethereum l1 d5 protocols although this is only partially true because technically you can have a zk roll up that settles every slot that can compose with l1 well at least one way for now i'm not sure if a uni-swap chain makes sense though um because it's atomically exchanging assets that already exist but i just now realized that a uni swap chain might make sense where it connects assets from all l2s in one place maybe but i i i don't know clearly just a shower thought all right so to tie off the scalability and value accrual topic just now in a recent podcast we had with olaf from polychain he's investor of course um he said this and it kind of stuck with me it's all just chains and bridges that's what he said and what he meant was ethereum is nothing special it's just another chain any chain has a path to become an l1 like ethereum and he expects many to start to follow ethereum's path ethereum is not special in this way he even expects bridges to start to have smart contracts enter the value of cruel games starting to compete with ethereum on that level and this is uh very different from the bankless thesis the bankless thesis believes we're more likely to see a power law winning chain as a settlement layer with a globally significant monetary asset at its base and currently we see ethereum as the primary contender for this role though the bankless thesis is completely open to to others uh taking that role and taking that throne and in this world there are many chains and many bridges this is still a multi-chain world but only a few of them get to become a global monetary asset and serve as the world's settlement layer maybe not even a few maybe just one maybe two um and i believe that these are the tool dueling ideas in crypto maybe from crypto's inception you have chains versus bridges you have that thesis versus the crypto money thesis on the other side it's kind of like cosmos versus ethereum the core thesis for the space which do you see as more correct or is there some space in between these two why not both i mean that's that's what aetherium delivers the best money and the best chains and the best bridges thank you pauline yeah let's get into some fuss up fun stuff can you steel man the cardano ecosystem what are the best properties of cardano this one's easier than you may think it's it's it's by far the largest l1 outside of bitcoin and ethereum with a strong philosophy of inclusive accountability i'd even argue they skew closer to bitcoin than ethereum as to how cheap and easy running their nodes should be they have a very enthusiastic very engaged and uh probably third best social layer generally okay i'll just say l1s are basically cults and and the cardano cult is pretty dedicated um their validator distribution is the best in the industry better than bitcoin and ethereum in its current state and they also have strong teams working on rollups like orbis and melcometer and probably the most activity happening around next-gen scaling solutions outside of ethereum and tasus i'd say cardano is the best position to be the number two settlement layer for roll-ups after ethereum but no idea if they can pull it off hmm have we on bank list been unnecessarily mean to cardeno okay okay why not a lot of it is definitely well deserved hoskinson's a bit of a bell end and their shills are obnoxiously loud uh well at least during the bull markets i'll have to say as obnoxious as crypto twitter generally is some of the most polite discussions i've had were with cardano people um they sincerely believe in their mission of max maximizing decentralization um keeping nodes easy to run and following on from bitcoin while avoiding ethereum's mistakes at the same time making cardano the laughing stock is undeserved um they are a real project with real research and development and they have a strong community now personally i'm very skeptical it'll ever amount to anything so anytime an ada she'll make some bombastic statement please don't hold back all right fair take but i'm going to wait until i see some block space fees at least let's talk about colton crypto obviously this industry is especially tribal of course would you say that tribalism in crypto is a bug or a feature what do you see as a role of cults in this industry i mean what else is there so so everything in crypto is a cult i mean i i think there's definitely a clean distinction to be made between productive and unproductive assets and there's definitely assets that are not ponzis and communities that are not cults so far there's nothing in crypto where a vast majority of its value isn't derived purely from being a cult i mean the whole all l1 mania was driven purely by an expectation to accrue as little value as possible i mean would you what would you call this if not a cult i mean but maybe that's what society is built on cults most of our earliest institutions probably started that way i'd say there's still a distinction to be made but but let's move on as we uh wrap this up let's zoom out a little bit and this will be a two-part question if you could snap your fingers and change one thing about crypto and you can't just like delete all the scams in the short term ism what would it be uh it feels to me like there's this general delusions of grandeur you know people think that they can reinvent the wheel from scratch or whatever um this is rather naive as we've have for millennia evolved and developed systems and and done so in an extremely diverse and decentralized manner too often we see crypto protocols throw away these basic learnings only to fail miserably and then to start to incorporate some of this wisdom in a haphazard manner i think crypto would be a lot better off to be more humble and pragmatic um take from traditional avenues what works and build on them improve them and of course to integrate with the traditional avenue where it makes sense you want to build solutions that work for everyone not just a few holy warring purists so you want us to get practical pretty much or or at least don't do stupid things that have been proven time and time again to not work through the eons yes i love this we often say on bank list we're speed running the history of money and finance and human organization and we're not saying we're speed running all of that only to throw it all away i'm saying no need to speed run it let's just start from where we already are i mean imagine how incredible our accomplishments as a species has been that we can build something like a blockchain in the first place i mean don't throw it away build on the shoulders of giants okay the second part of this question is to zoom out even further if you could snap your fingers and change something about the whole entire world what would it be probably a terrible answer but i wouldn't change a thing damn not even world peace i mean sure i can point at a hundred different things that are bad unfair or even selfishly everything that causes me suffering personally but this is the human experience it's an absolute miracle we exist we shall grow learn and improve together well said the human experience is irreplaceable and life is an absolute miracle and it's been a pleasure to share this miracle in space and time with you polanya last thing then we want to open the mic to you this is the first time you've been on a podcast you now have a human voice and the entire crypto community is listening what do you want to say to them as we close oh i i don't have much more to say um okay okay maybe just enjoy yourself make sure you're entertained um the pleasure has been mine i'm eager to see what pelenia sounds like outside of posting on twitter well from the perspective of the listener it would appear that you've spent about 45 minutes with us chatting but in actuality it's been about five hours in discord together so pauline thank you so much for your time i would be shocked if it were only 45 minutes ryan and i are currently in debate as to how long this transcript will actually turn into audio length uh sounds like i'm taking the underside to you both yeah i think this is over 60 minutes uh easy but we'll see i really have no idea and that is the fun part so let's wrap this up paulinha thank you for joining us on bankless and also i want to take a moment to give you my personal thanks you taught me something brand new about ethereum in 2021 and stretch my understanding of crypto through your modular blockchain thesis we made an entire podcast about this thank you so much i really appreciate it and i hope you stay with us in the years ahead thank you and for everything you've done to educate us by the looks of it there's a whole lot of educating still left to be done and i'll be cheering from the sidelines all right action items for the bankless nation some education of course we'll include a link to our modular versus monolithic blockchain show in the notes this is a digest of everything pelenia taught us about blockchain scalability and rollups last year go listen to it i consider this required listening if you want to understand ethereum and roll up scalability we'll also include some links to polenia's top articles make sure you read them to understand their full thesis hey polenia it's time for me to do the risks and disclaimers but would you like to do them instead wow has anyone done this before you'll be the first but it's a thing that we're going to start doing i'm honored or or at least whoever is pelina's voice okay risks and disclaimers crypto is risky you will definitely lose your mind just kidding okay risks and disclaimers crypto is risky you could lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
