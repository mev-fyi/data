monolith.xyz all right bankless nation i am here with kevin chu from rally kevin welcome to the nation thanks for having me all right so let's start with rally uh what is it reality is a social token project and what that means is that we work with a kind of broadly defined creators so this could be musicians it could be twitch uh streamers and esport athletes it could be writers it could be newsletter newsletter communities it could be a discord community we're working with all types of creators who want to start their own digital business and use a token to create commerce and reward their loyal fans and uh and participate in this new crypto economy yeah so it seems to be that the world of content creation inevitably creates community right and we've seen this all the way back to just like you know people in bands like people with who play music they have fans that go to their shows now in the crypto world we have like newsletters like bank list where we have our discord channels like anthony cesano has this as well seems to be like any type there's any anytime there's somebody who's producing some sort of content some sort of media there is also this like paired community that goes along with these these things and then there's also like it's twitch streamers i think like in gaming streaming it's just a massive world where there's just uh communities and fans around content so in a world where there's always this paired community how does rally bolster that well that's exactly where rally fits in so you know fiat payments make sense if you're if it's just a one-way sort of model right so like television or broadcast great i give you a service or product and you pay me for it right and that's uh great you got u.s dollars or any other fiat currencies and it's great for for those types of transactions um if you all live in the same country and use the same currency where crypto makes a ton of sense is when you have people from all sorts of different countries using all sorts of different currencies uh and you also have two-way interactions right so let's say you've got a you know let's take the inner circle community for for bank list and you've got uh active community members who are moderating uh discord preventing spam preventing bad behavior they're contributing you know content ideas or article ideas you know to the to the editors and other content creators in the bankless nation you know those types of uh those types of participants while they're not creating the overall you know sort of umbrella of content they're actively participating in our community and if you can reward them with a with a social token for their for their contributions that is a unique form of action that can happen uh using this new uh you know using crypto and so instead of you know you david taking ten dollars out of your pocket and sending it through paypal to you know to a moderator which you know it's like a one-time transaction the other way now it's like hey we're all going to participate in all own a piece of this new social token economy and yes some of the fans are going to use that to pay for content or pay for a service that that person consumes but other people may contribute every once in a while and earn some tokens then others will will potentially just be a capital provider you know into the system right and so it enables a global community of participants in two-way interactions that happen in communities to all come together and all be aligned towards growing a new economy together so we we speak often on the bank list program about the inherent coordinating tools that ethereum provides the world right and a token especially the token almost is the coordinating tool right like if the ave protocol the uniswap governance governance happens via the token right and it's also the thing that people like obsess over right like at least the monetary ones with with the price like people people just focus on tokens and it seems to be that what you guys are doing is you guys are integrating the focusing power of a token and you're putting it into the hands of content producers who are who inherently already have this fan base but it seems to me like it's it's finding ways to tinker with incentives but specifically the incentives of fans right to allow and allow the expression and the uh contributions of the community to actually be uh unlocked or enabled am i am i on the right page here yeah that that's exactly correct i think we're you know i i want to you know lie and say there's an absolute you know blueprint for exactly how this is going to work for the next hundred years i think what's really exciting about the space right now is there's a lot of experimentation there's a lot of communities where there's different levels of participation there's you know these lurkers there's the once in a while contributors there's active moderators and so forth and then there's the founders or active employees of the community um and tokens kind of bind everyone together and allow commerce to happen in a unique way uh in these digital communities uh and oftentimes these digital communities have people from you know dozens of countries that are participating in them and crypto becomes an easy way to create a way to bind that community together without worrying about some of these traditional financial rails that are dependent on you know banks and others to facilitate yeah and definitely in a world where online communities seem to be um really needed these days uh we we ran a piece on the bankless newsletter called squad wealth and it was how how like the groups form like via the dm chat like the group chat like the discord server the telegram room like uh groups and just squads as they called them appeared because of like you know just shared with and for any reason why any group of friends would show up in the real in the outside world but this happened now it's happening here and and i'm really interested in just people for forming based on shared interests right shared goals and that and and it looks like rally's going after the shared interest of like content producers um let's go through the lifespan of of the user story right and maybe let's start with a content producer why would a content producer come to the rally platform and mint a token and what would they then what would be the initial like reasons why that token would be useful to the content producer right so let's take a let's take a content producer like um fan hots so he was a former professional esport player and uh played for a blizzard game called heroes of the storm and um the world class he's he's the most followed first most viewed most followed person on twitch for um for the game today and um so the way that he thinks about it is that he says well you know his fans are always requesting him to do different things in the past he's taken paypal payments and he does uh subs and doughnos what are called donations you know on his channel and that's all been fine but he's got you know fans from 60 different countries that actively watch and and uh you know participate on his channel and he's got a very active discord that he's got moderators and other people that contribute a lot of time and effort to help his community and so he uses crypto in a couple ways one is you can use crypto to uh pay for certain types of digital interactions with him so he uh so he's in gaming there's obviously a little bit of a lot of fun and entertainment to happen so people love picking champions that they know he's really really bad at or just aren't bad at the meta you know in the game currently and so you can pay him tokens to play those champions and he'll do it and it's kind of a funny you know thing that the whole community kind of laughs at um so that's just traditional commerce so that's just taking things that he used to do in paypal uh but now he's able to do in crypto and he takes you know you can convert btc you can convert you can convert usdc etc uh into fan coins and uh and you could pay it he earns enough money when he doesn't need a cash out right away so one of his benefits is he can say well gosh we're getting close to the end of 2020 i don't need that cash today i'm going to keep it in my cryptocurrency maybe in 2021 or 2022 i'll convert it back into us dollars to pay the bills and pay taxes you know at that point in time so there's he's able to use this um currency for traditional commerce uh and time shift you know taxes and other things probably the most important thing is that we have commun what we call community activity rewards at rally so our creators are the equivalent of a bitcoin miner or a ethereum validator they're the ones that are providing the work uh in our network and so when we do rally admissions um on a weekly schedule right now the creators that contribute economic activity into the rally network they are proportionate to their contributions rally rewards right and that was really rewards don't just go to the creator it goes to the entire community of people who hold for example fan coins and so you know he's he's transferring his commerce from paypal he's paying less fees to uh to process international transactions and so forth and he's earning you know crypto rewards on top of it so right now for rally if you're if you're moving about a thousand dollars of commerce onto the rally platform today you're earning about twenty five hundred dollars you know for that commerce so not only are you you know i was listening to your rs you know the rac um you know bankless uh topic and he's talking about how artists get 12 of a transaction well you imagine getting 250 of a transaction i mean that's that's uh or 150 of a transaction that's what's possible today with with in the relatively early stages of social tokens and i'll have another example of of a content credit called mizzy and mizzy is a body artist and so she she paints body art and she's just absolutely creative and fantastic at what she does and she has a special channel on discord where she has certain types of body art that she'll share only on her discord channel and you need x number of busy tokens to gain access to those channels and uh you know it's a way that she can screen and say hey here here are my true fans and i'm gonna share you know some uh some pieces of content you know with you guys that i'm not doing on stream and it's a great way for her to create kind of unique access with bands that are long-term holders of her you know currency so she's using it both for transactions you could pay her and say hey i want you to paint you know diva from overwatch you know next um great you can do that from commerce or you can if you're just going to hold and maintain a balance of her tokens you get access to certain your token permission channels right and so there's a number of different experiments that are going on and creators are using this to uh you know engage their fan bases offer kind of different slices of fan base um you know access and of course you know better monetize and create a better business online uh with our fans that are spread all throughout the world okay so it seems to be that rally is leveraging uh payment technology which obviously crypto does very well uh just to sidestep you know traditional payment rails it seems like it's leveraging uh a platform that's a patreonesque where there's permissioned entry based on the the status of the if of a content consumer right uh and that status is probably defined by the token which is also a new crypto economic primitive and the token is doing something that the content creator whoever mints the token uh determines right like and so like i'm assuming the the creator unlocks access to some of their content based on the state of tokens or the what those tokens are like the the relationship between the token and the holder uh which but that kind of draws my attention to like all right well there seems to be a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built in order to express that like patreon-like behavior like if we're using a discord channel if we're using a twitch stream uh like there needs to be integrations right like discord needs to be able to look at your like your ethereum wallet or your rally wallet and see where their tokens are and that's just not that's just discord right like what about twitch like it seems to be there needs to be a bunch of technological infrastructure to be built out where is all that technology going to come from well we built out the rally protocol level right and so this is where so we have a number of uh technology that we're that if we think about rally as not just a simple erc20 we think about it as a whole layer of technology that makes it really simple to do a number of things so first of all rally is really targeted towards the next 100 million people in crypto right if you know how to use your metamask and you know how to get ethan to you know your non-custodian wallet you know great like if your audience is 100 that you know rally may not be you know the very best for you but if you have a bunch of up new users into crypto maybe they're they've they've done a couple of transactions but they're still sort of unfamiliar with the broader crypto landscape your rally you know rally is meant for first-time users and crypto unfamiliar people to get into crypto for the first time and not have it be this very high barrier sort of experience right and so from the time that you see a creator saying hey you need one of my tokens to participate in this event that i'm hosting you need one of my tokens to you know participate in this commerce um or get access to this uh uh piece of content that i'm i'm creating for you uh then from that time that you see that's the time that you can create an account get provisioned your first crypto wallet uh swipe a credit card and make that transaction 60 seconds or less is kind of what we designed for our rally so we kind of vertically integrate a number of different um you know technology to make it easy for first-time crypto users to get in and participate with the creator in you know in their business the second thing that we do is that we create a very sophisticated layer of what we call automated market making by using a primitive uh called token binding curves so this is similar to a nexus mutual we don't bond to eth but we bond to the rally governance took it and so every creator that comes on board and they make their own token first of all it's a no code way of doing it so you get started within a few minutes uh you meet your token that token is bonded to rally uh and what that does and in that token has its own supply and demand you know sort of dynamics that govern the pricing and market behavior of that token but a very important thing is that you don't need to go set up a unit swap uh pool and get lps to contribute to that pool to allow for exchange of those tokens you don't need people to appear to pure trade them at the same time you can trade with the smart contract that has what's going through the bonding curve so there's always liquidity for a token even if you only have five fans that are you know participating in your crypto economy those five fans can easily transact with each other with 100 liquidity 24 hours a day no need to set up a unit swap you know pool uh to do that the rally token provides liquidity and the rally network basically takes on you know all the liquidity challenges and and taking on the ability for creators to cash out or fans to cash out if they they need us dollars or fiat uh the other thing that we do then of course is a very specific set of apis and data pipeline infrastructure so that other consumer applications can easily integrate tokens and commerce into their websites into their products without having to figure out you know how to create their own erc20 tokens and deal with uh you know metamask signings and so forth so a layer of apis and infrastructure that allow uh today uh for a number of different uh applications to be developed on it you talked a bit about discord and twitch and so there's already a community of developers that have created twitch you know overlays that plug right into obs software that create discord bots that allow um communities to use creator coins inside of discord uh in a very simple way so you know it's all about creating that ecosystem and some really cool technology that makes it really really easy to get into crypto assets and use it not just in a purely crypto sense but inside of other consumer applications while still maintaining the composability that an erc20s you know enables if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well i hear you say that you guys are building out or there's a developer ecosystem building out a plug-in so that goes into obs that can trigger an event based off the state of a token exactly so like exactly say for example that we're doing a live stream on the bankless nation in the bankless ecosystem and we use obs i use obs yeah so maybe there's like a rally token yeah maybe maybe rally token and like we say that like if you send a token to this address with this uh piece of info with information in the data field we'll make the data field that data field show up on obs in the live stream on screen so that's all that's like something that we could do that's exactly right so yeah if you be able to to do a live stream for example and people who want to support you know the bank list you know stream can do that they can have their name pop up and say hey you know current is supporting david or or the bankless nation with you know 10 bankless tokens and uh thank you so much for all the great you know knowledge you guys are creating etc and that can happen and that could be an interactive experience that happens right on obs wow that is really really cool okay so if let's let's talk about how people get would get their hands on the tokens right or i guess where that turns the the conversation to the community like where's the incentive for the uh community to step into the world of the content producer other than just like you know i'm a fan of of uh you know a music musician or i'm a fan of some streamer and they have a token and i find out about that is there any other like additional incentives like how do you how are you corralling the the consumer side of the equation well you know right now we are a little bit more focused on creators but our where we want to go with this is yeah i'm a huge i've been making video games for 11 years before i started uh the rally project and uh what i really wanted to i've been making games where people pay real money for virtual currency in virtual assets and you know people have been asking me all a lot you know i started that when i started command 15 years ago why would somebody pay you real money to buy a digital sword you know for use in the game i was like well you know it turns out it's a massive business that's 150 billion dollars don't ask people anyways people are there people are doing that and and what was the genesis of the rally project was i wanted to take these very sophisticated tools that we were making you know uh in games and gaming contexts and basically abstract it out of that game experience and give it to any content creator really any person anybody that wants to start um and create their own token within a few you know and create their own token without having to to do any programming or code so there's a there's a couple of games like roblox which is going public soon in the united states um that started this you know that company started about 15 years ago where uh it enables anybody to make their own game and do it without having to to do a bunch of complex software development um and so that's what rally does we we basically help you create today a virtual occurrence a social token um that's a real cryptographically secure token and anybody can do it and so i think for users over time uh if you just if you have like a twitter and you got 200 followers and you want to check out and create your own uh rally token for your small your community that's just getting started you can do that and if you're you know a massive celebrity with 100 million fans you know globally you can also and you don't want to have a team of engineers build out a you know figure out your own crypto token great you can use rally to get started and use your get started within a few minutes as well that's that's really really cool and i remember on our jessie walden podcast we had on on bank list and jesse runs the variant fund and i know that varian has has invested in the in the rally project the the whole thesis of that uh podcast through line was like the the big tent mentality of crypto is why crypto's going to win right and like what crypto is and what the d5 summer it what is and was and what all this mania is around tokens is its excitement about uh being able to have like have and coordinate larger communities larger groups of people right uh and it seems to be that rally is really spearheading that effort on the on the community engagement with content creation side of things so that that's really really exciting and really cool to see this project come out let's talk about where the state of the project is now like where are you guys in development so we think about getting to uh v1 uh pretty soon so v1 is so the rally project is relatively your complex piece of technology so we talked a little bit about uh our yield delegating vaults uh you and i privately but we use uh we integrate with the urine project and and what their vaults do to basically hold the rally community treasury and so we created something called yield delegating vaults because from a regulatory perspective we never wanted to take people's money and invest it into rally directly but we say hey if you're already using uh you're in finance and you want to delegate your future yield you know then you get uh some of the networking missions from from the rally network so there's a really interesting way that we create a community governed treasury uh on chain and uh and that happens through the urine project uh and then we have a liquidity mining rewards as any good d5 project would do and so this is what uh enables any creator that's creating a token that's bonded to the rally token uh it enables them full liquidity through your swap and balancer and we have about two and a half million dollars of liquidity across those two decks you know today and it's a really cool way to enable just uh kind of mark mark the price discovery as well as the ability to exchange and bring new people into the community or let existing people exit out of the community if they need to uh and then we have what's happening on what we call the rally you know side chain which is an ethereum their private chain at this point in time but what it does is that it's computationally intensive to do some of the calculations that we do to create these creator coins and bond into rally tokens today uh and so we do that on a side chain and then there's no transaction fees so if you want to do if you want to tip like let's say the bankless nation a dollar uh worth of creative coins you could do that without paying a dollar in gas fees you know on the ethereum to do much smaller transactions that you know the average uh you know person in america or really in the world you know like they're not doing d5 whale type of transactions that in affording you know 200 you know way you know kind of gas prices they can do you know much smaller transactions and have that be very practical and of course we were very um uh excited about youtube but also all the l2s and some of the other kind of bridges that are coming out there and you guys did a great job covering uh everything that's happening in that ecosystem so you know the whole the destiny of rally is in the next 12 months we'll roll up the side chain uh probably through a couple of l2 uh technologies um to uh on mainnet and then you can take your create a coin and put it into a compound or other protocols and and other things like that but today we do all of that on the side chain to enable uh much smaller transactions no trans no gas fees uh and uh in producing that so rally is a little bit trusted today and there's a bridge that that kind of acts between the main net and the rally side chain just like you know some of these e2 you know our uh layer two bridges do as well and so it works very similarly and so all that combined together is the rally network and that's uh that's all live today with this one exception of not being able to exit yet from the side chat so that'll happen on december 8th and i'll say that while you can't exit onto your main net we do have you know we partnered with a couple of other crypto projects to enable like usdc exits and things like that so you can because there's full market price you know there's a there's an ability to exit through right so somebody's offering the the on off ramps yeah yeah but there'll be a trustless way to exit out of the side chain on december as well that just makes like perfect sense too because like the layer two wars are still going on like an optimism has still plenty of releases to do and like you got but you guys can't wait for things to like get you know polished and perfect and so like while you guys are in development and still kind of in in your early phase and not yet you know taking over the world the like the trustlessness of the doesn't really seem to matter to me at this point like uh it's it's not the right time to be like really hammering on like is this the most perfectly trustless uh infrastructure because like especially when we are working in like the world of uh communities around content producers like how many market caps of dollars is really going to be transacted on a day-to-day basis like what's the real risk here plus what's the real reward of waiting for the right roll-up implementation right down the line that just makes perfect sense to me that's exactly right and that that's our that's our feeling you know it's certainly by the time you know if we start getting into the nine nine figure you know sort of us dollar values you know i think we'll be very very focused on on establishing full trustlessness in the entire network but today i think some level of trust in the network uh as much transparency about what's going on is is kind of the ethos that we're shooting for um your guys is like uh um big and when you folk when you wake up in the morning like you guys are focused on getting content producers like getting community people getting infrastructure built and like it's other people's job to worry about that yeah and so like that's not even the problem that you guys are trying to solve that's right and that's why i think the the coolest thing that i think we're doing is uh our community activity rewards yeah let's talk about that yeah which is you know the the creators themselves are basically the creators and communities are uh doing the work of like a minor or an ethereum validator and we don't need that because we're not trying to be a layer one blockchain we're trying we inherit the security of other layer ones primarily ethereum right now uh and so we don't need to worry about consensus and we don't need to worry about that kind of stuff and rewarding people who are doing that valuable work for the network we you know people pay gas fees for that the what what creators do and what the communities do on on rally is that as they're creating economic transactions on rally they're earning the rally emissions as their as their reward and right now the rally network is um for the creators that are active on it a creator doing about a thousand dollars of economic transactions in a month through the rally network is actually earning about twenty five hundred dollars uh you know for those transactions about 150 more than what they're actually getting in transactional volume so you know what's really cool is that creators um who've been screwed in the past by a lot of middlemen like rac talked about how you know artists get 12 of uh you know of music revenue yeah i mean it's uh it's you know creators creator whether you're you know you're on facebook and you're creating content and you're doing zero percent of that or you're on some other you know platform and you're creating valuable content and experiences you know crypto is a great way to say hey i'm gonna take control of my own economic destiny it was all about the bank destination right and i'm gonna create a you know something that i actually own myself and i could port i could bring with me to you know whether it's a twitter or facebook inst you know other platforms where i'm you're creating valuable content for those other platforms but i'm always going to own my own crypto economic destiny and token and control that and that's i think something really powerful for people who want to uh who think about running a digital business today uh whether you're a musician whether you're you're a blogger whether you're a podcaster or a youtuber or a streamer um your crypto i think it's going to be a really powerful way for all of these creators that you know have fans and audiences all over the world to um you know create something new that they totally own themselves and will control and in in rally's case right now you can you know if you're making a thousand dollars in in subscription revenue or donations or other support from your fans you know with the rally rewards that are going on right now you're making about 2500 you know today so it's a very powerful way to reward you know creators and others um for uh taking their digital uh transactions and moving them into crypto and for a lot of our creators it's uh you know this is this is turning into their primary your line of business and it's uh it's really rewarding to see cool fantastic i'm really really excited about rally i really want to see it coming and do really good uh good for the world uh so kevin thank you for coming on and introducing raleigh to the nation thanks for having me if people want to learn more about riley where should they go is there a discord server what's the website give us the uh give us the deets yeah rally.io is is kind of where you can find out a bunch of information this chord is probably where uh you know it's we're a pretty active discord community so that's always where the most interactions happens we have a very active blog that we try to update once a day um with all the different happenings that are going on and in this course is kind of where all the the crypto geeks all we all hang out and kind of talk about changes in governance to the to the economic protocol of rallies so these are all the places to find us rally.io is a great way to connect to all these other places cool well thank you for coming and sharing all that information about it let's let's uh see what this world of content production incentivized by tokens can really do thank you david cheers
