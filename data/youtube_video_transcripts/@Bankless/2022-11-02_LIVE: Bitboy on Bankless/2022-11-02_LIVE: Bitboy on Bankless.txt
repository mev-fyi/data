why we're having this conversation is uh bitboy this is Ben Armstrong the guest who's about to appear on the podcast went on a rant about uh my glasses I think this rent was mostly unprovoked you

episode episode uh but he replied we got something scheduled we did a quick gut check with the bank list community and said should we bring bit boy on the podcast you know something for entertainment purposes for advancing the conversation forward uh I was prepared to not do it if the community didn't want it to happen but close to 60 percent of the bank list Community said yes bring Ben on the

bitboy AKA Ben Armstrong AKA bit boy the crypto influencer who doesn't know who the f I am at least didn't two weeks ago he is a ceaseless Fighter for the people bit boy welcome to bankless yeah um well thank you for having me on I'm glad we could uh make this happen I I think really the problem was is when I read your tweet I didn't have my glasses on and so I didn't exactly read what it said correctly wait so you are a glasses wear yourself and yet you're criticizing glasses is this uh where is this criticism coming from what do you what do you have against glasses bit boy well I've been ashamed obviously um well you know this goes back to when I was in the third grade and people are going to be shocked to hear this but I did things for attention back then I purposely I know I know YouTuber YouTuber was not a career choice back then it was only circus clown that people thought it was going to be but uh basically what happened is I failed my eye exam on purpose so I could get class classes and and go into the third grade for shock value for my class and then my parents thought I actually needed the glasses for years and in the fifth grade I lost the glasses multiple times which actually spurred on the fight that I believe ended with a divorce between my dad and my first stepmom are you serious that's actually true story that's actually a true story I think because I saw you post in one of our uh I think it was during the SPF uh Voorhees and David was like uh bit boys posting in our chat right now and what if you're one of your posts was um I tragically that you hate glasses so much because it caused your parents divorce yeah well that's not really why I made the comment about your classes but yeah that is actually a true story that actually did happen so maybe in my heart I do have some you know natural uh instinctual resentment towards classes it's kind of a Freudian thing then yeah it must have been it's my fault though I shouldn't have failed the exam in the first place well can we talk about so I I want to start here actually with the glasses uh ran by the way sorry rant I don't know if that's what you'd call it but it's fine that's what they call it in the chat it was a rant okay so it was a rant uh and this is uh this is what it was I think most people listening to this uh probably saw this video including me I was really surprised to see it the next day uh and then you tweet it out it has to be said the suits have taken over crypto no denying that man and I won't stand for it f bankless f Ryan s Adams F the horse they rode in on we stand for the people not the elite not the lawyers not the billionaires one thing is for sure I definitely don't represent douches it was really so this this rant about like um bankless about uh me uh was this like spur of the moment because it kind of looked like in this rant you just like scrolled up on my new profile yes a dude in a sports jacket with glasses on and you were just like yeah F this dude in particular was this like where did this come from was this spur of the moon like why did you say this I was I was left very confused about the whole sure encounter well first and foremost um you know people know I I get hot you know I I get heated over stuff um I you know that's just how I'm built and why is that because I'm super extremely passionate about things and so what got me really riled up was you know when me that's the first night me and SPF got into a little argument um over you know basically them trying to steal uh some of our political backers out from under us and you know all of a sudden you have this tweet where you say you know pit boy does not represent crypto I mean these are the people what's that said yeah I'll show the Tweet that's what I said please dear Lord and any lawmakers or adult three in this tweet there's no big boy doesn't represent us either talk to Jay travinsky the blockchain association dcg ties talk to Miller cwl don't know anything about them talk to coin Center they're fine people um which you know that's no shade at J travinsky I don't know him personally blockchain association's doing some good they're great by the way Jake is fantastic I'm sure uh Miller works at the D5 uh fund doing fantastic work in DC and I'm kind of surprised you actually don't know about these people I know you're doing a lot I would call them personal Heroes well I I know Jay travinsky I know coin Center I just didn't know uh Miller cwl all right so you saw this tweet right then what happened well I was offended I mean because the fact is I do represent crypto I represent the average person in crypto if you look at the statistics I actually did a poll which is not scientific but I did a poll on Twitter which you would think would skew harder to Twitter and 70 of the people that answer that poll say the first place they went to learn about crypto was YouTube my channel is the mainstream YouTube channel it is the Gateway through which the majority of people at least in the last Bull Run came into crypto now certainly I don't end up being everybody's cup of tea and some people ended up wanting to get more into trading they want to get more into mining they want to get more into um you know maybe they just like someone that has a different disposition so someone that doesn't do hour and a half live streams every day maybe they want their stuff more concise uh look there's plenty of great YouTubers out there for people to watch so but I'm the doorway and so so many people come in and I'm great with that if people come in through my channel but then they end up somewhere else the the point for me is I love the fact that I bring people into crypto I was at a conference a couple weeks ago and you know the guy who organized the guy who organized the entire conference uh Expo verse he came up to me and said you know if it wasn't for you I wouldn't even be into crypto and now there's a giant conference going on I met with a woman from iog who works uh you know under Charles well yeah I guess he is the head of iog technically but um she came up to me at rare Bloom and said hey you know like I got into crypto through your channel and now look at this I'm working at iog it's so cool so I know that we are the doorway through a lot of people that people come into the space and to say that I don't represent people like yes I don't represent the suits I don't represent um you know people that have you know 74 degrees uh whether it's in financial management or whether it's in law or whatever it might be but I do represent the average person and no person on planet Earth has educated more people about crypto than I have that's just a fact if you look at our number of views we dwarf everyone at least in the United States for sure obviously Bureau in the UK I think he just moved to Dubai he does a good job his channel has outgrown ours they have a different you know kind of a different kind of thing they do they do longer videos but less videos per week and things like that but you know for us we really believe that we are you know that the the Catalyst for bringing people in and educating people and certainly you know people can point back at things from years ago that weren't done perfectly um you know some things that happened whether it was projects we promoted that didn't do well or did well for a short period and then dropped or God forbid there was a couple that rug pulled whatever you know people hold that against us from years and years ago but if you look at the maturation of my channel if you look at where we're at today I take that very seriously that we are the educator in crypto I'm coming out with a book catching up to crypto you can find on Amazon comes out in January uh this is going to fill the gap between people that come into the space to understand the space because you've probably experienced this before when people watch your podcast there's a gap between when people come in and what we consider to be a beginner it would take 60 videos to make that content in the book I'm going to try to do that job of filling the Gap so we take it very seriously and people don't understand all the things we do behind this behind the scenes to try to push crypto adoption and Regulation and um trying to make things that are very friendly for the crypto world and we want to keep decentralization so to say that I don't represent crypto like yes it triggered me it definitely triggered me because I see this kind of comment all the time and it drives me insane and then of course when I look at the list of people that you have there that you can talk to like these are your traditional uh you know uh your traditional kind of uh you know lawyer in Jake travinsky obviously like I said I didn't know Miller cwl but coin Center I know what they are and I know what they represent they're buttoned up like for me it's about representing the person like the average person that comes into crypto with a dream to change their life and so yeah it made me mad and and when I get angry um I do have a way of verbally assaulting people uh in a way that uh it's it's both a strength and a weakness you know it's one of these things where I can defend myself pretty well and I don't I don't take things lying down but obviously you know should I have made fun of your glasses probably not I do have a suit on in the picture to be fair um I I by the way there's a t-shirt under that suit so it's just not I mean it's just I don't like how the series not today with a skinny tie there you go there you go not today no today is my full Banker apparel so okay so you're saying that so by the way I think we'll come back to this but you're saying hey look bit boy is an uh a gateway to many people into crypto uh I'm I'm you know helping to lead people in and uh by the way like bankless and others you shouldn't be so dismissive uh of me right and you felt like this sweet was dismissive let me tell you my perspective and where I was coming from with this with this tweet but and I do want to come back to you like with that entry to crypto and the 1.x million uh number of um you know followers you have on on YouTube subscribers you have on YouTube what a tremendous amount of responsibility absolutely rest in your hands bit boy like what a a tremendous amount of responsibility to make sure people aren't falling for scams right are going in the direction of like the dough quads and the 20 anchor yields like you have a tremendous amount of responsibility we'll get we'll get to that a little bit later in this conversation but I guess here's where I was coming from with with this tweet right I don't know very much about you to be honest bit boy like I did know who you were I know you didn't know who the FI was but I knew who you were just like but I hadn't subscribed I'm not listening to the bitboy crypto channel uh on the regular basis like I'm not down to bit boy Rabbit Hole I just don't know very much about you my reputation uh like you're kind of a crypto influencer sort of attention seeking individual visual you might have reasons for that maybe the reason is to kind of onboard also um you know Zach xbt which uncovers a lot of scams and and you know frauds in in crypto had sort of a thread I was familiar with that I was I was familiar with your your riff your back and forth with Kofi Kobe where there was like some sort of lawsuit involved so I hadn't done a deep dive on this and what I was saying here is if you see my tweet here uh at you know was SPF put up his my current thoughts on crypto regulation all right first tweet here this is what I said before you even replied Sam with respect this absolutely sucks you're saying D5 should be oh fact you're saying on-chain freezes should be normal you're saying D5 front ends to register as a broker dealer no this is not reasonable this would eliminate the us from the crypto race all right so the things that you were saying at least the points I could glean from the rant that kind of resonate with me is like you are anti-sam's ideas on so-called crypto regulation that would stifle defy guess what so am I like so like so and here I am in the thread saying that and you uh lumped me in with the Devils uh SPF which we can come back to which was completely factually incorrect yeah and honestly bit boy I think you owe me an apology for that and I'm happy to say I could have phrased this tweet the other tweet that you're talking about differently uh the Tweet where like what did I say here uh the Tweet where I said Don't listen to bitboy but let me give you some context for what I'm saying I don't want lawmakers to listen to SPF all right right and I don't want them to go to the nearest attention-seeking crypto influencer YouTube and get their information from that person either I want them to get the facts from the people who are on the ground working on the dccpa in DC like Jake travinsky who cares about our values bankless values who cares about the values you say you care about Miller uh as well from D5 fund coin Center these people are the people who are standing up for our rights in DC and actually have the funding and have the ears of lawmakers I want lawmakers to go to them no disrespect I don't want lawmakers to see that the rant you put out because they think we're crazy when we do that all right it sets our cause back I don't want them to listen to SPF but to be honest bit boy I don't want them to listen to you either I don't even necessarily want them to listen to to bankless okay so that's where the Tweet is coming from I'm trying to redirect look your game is attention I get it that's like that's why that you you said you know back in grade school you put on the glasses for attention you have a YouTube channel for attention okay and you're good at it because you're good at getting attention by the way this rank got a lot of attention I think like you were trending on Twitter like three days yeah my point is this is not where serious lawmakers should actually go and you're saying in your rent that you're working behind the scenes yeah and you've got legislation coming up I've talked to these people they don't know anything about what you're talking about like who are you working with in DC like there are some things that are factually like just not resonated I sent you guys an email last night and you didn't get it and it has all the information I wanted you guys to come with that information so that you guys will see exactly what I'm doing and it's not smoke like it really is we are working we have high level politicians on both sides of the aisle um and what we're working on is a bill and the goal for this bill is now to become an amendment onto the boot onto the uh a boozement bill so because of that like yes if they're working on the specific language of the bill we're not to that stage yet because this has to run through a process where it gets tweaked down to an amendment and now look here's here's okay number one sure I'm I'm sorry that I said that I apologize I can certainly be a bigger man apologize obviously you know I make fun of sandbankment free tear I make fun of your glasses like I I tend to I tend to focus on things that really don't matter but really what that is is that is just me trying to to manifest the way I'm feeling about you and that's the way that it comes off and to me it was a very elitist thing to say that I don't know what I'm talking about when number one you you don't watch my channel and you don't haven't listened to the things that I've said we actually already have a bill drafted in California uh that's you know sitting there in front of the assembly which is uh the financial uh stability and the financial education and stability Act of uh 2022 sjr 16 on the California docket I've got Senator Mitch hersberg who is the head the head of the assembly in California he's coming on my channel soon met with his chief of staff gave input on the blockchain bill in uh the blockchain bill that they did for Vital Records in California guess what it got approved I'm not the reason it got approved obviously but we had input on that bill we looked over it in early stages so I think people really dismiss the level of involvement that I have in crypto now here's what I want to say I really wish basically I know you guys didn't intentionally not read that email I you didn't realize it was sitting there we talked before we went on air um but that email tells you a lot of the players were working with it it tells you um you know exactly what we're doing and I think when you understand what we're doing it makes sense because I don't want to be in charge of crypto regulation I don't want to try to determine what is a good transaction and what's not what we're working on is a mechanism that a lot of people have called for for years in crypto to be able to make those decisions on crypto regulation I would not be the person making those decisions some of those people that you mentioned in that tweet they could be involved potentially in the future in making some of those decisions and I wish it could be a little more clear about exactly what all that means but unfortunately until we have the funding for the bill and it's registered then we technically can't give the details away of the specifics but it's taking away the ability from one man to be able to come in and influence crypto in terms of uh what SPF has done and it puts it in the hands where people in crypto actually have a seat at the table and I think once you look over what we put together I think you'll be like oh yeah that makes complete sense um and I I doubt that anybody in crypto Eric Voorhees who's on your show a couple weeks ago or you know last week I doubt any of these people will be against what we're doing what what we're doing circumvents all the language actually in in the uh dcap is it dccap or dccap yeah dccap right it goes around all that link which CPA I think yeah yeah DPC you know YMCA so the whole thing is is it's a mechanism and it's common sense like we like doing things that are common sense for people and people would say like why in the world these people came to me by the way why would these people come to me because I have the biggest voice in crypto like I have the biggest platform in crypto by far in the middle of a bear Market between Tick Tock and YouTube and like we had almost 10 000 people watching our stream today we have almost 10 000 people around the internet watch our streams every single day you're Eric Voorhees versus SBF debate which was the most the thing in crypto I enjoyed watching more than I've ever watched another thing it got like a thousand viewers like I wish they've got more it should have gotten more is what I'm saying but the point is I've got a big voice and we're able to circumvent marketing costs on builds because I'm able to go out and speak on behalf of crypto so that's that's why I got triggered and that's what we're doing in a nutshell you guys can read more about it later um but I don't I don't want to make decisions it's creating a mechanism that also by the way I think everybody will be on board with this who right now is in charge of crypto everybody knows it's SEC that changes under my Amendment so this is the thing right and this is the thing that uh we're kind of like we have to respond to it's sort of like the crypto ethos of of uh not trust but verify and so I don't know anything about the bill that you're saying there's an email waiting for me and I'm happy to like look at that and investigate right but your approach was not that your approach was not like hey here's the bit boy uh bill you know let me reveal it let me go over kind of like a a rationed reasoned uh sort of reply and Eric Voorhees style of reply to SPF it was just it was just like kind of this big like rant yeah uh kind of accusing I I think that you'd probably say based on this tweet anyway bit boy that like from what you say we're probably on the same side okay so we both think that Sam's proposals uh sucks and like you've got one approach one way of doing things bankless has another we were able to bring both Voorhees and SPF on the show to have a productive conversation it wouldn't have worked if we started the conversation rather than rationally replying with something like this by making fun of Sam's hair or I saw on your Twitter stream like uh Sam with like devil horns and like a goatee patched I just retweeted it you know look okay so you're doing a different approach here and yet like you're saying we're on kind of the same side from a values perspective you have to respect the approach the bank list is taking this in my ass to you bit boy is like I'm not just gonna trust you okay so like one thing that we can't do in crypto is to the best of our ability if we have any kind of platform and your platform is bigger than ours on YouTube you know for certain but if we have any any kind of platform we have to help people we have to there are predators in this space tons of them and so we have to do a better job sniffing out the Predators and the scammers and those that would take retails money and giving them access to get information and if you just play these games of kind of like you know attention for the algorithm and you don't open source what you're talking about you don't like come back with with uh reasoned arguments it's just not going to be as effective but like let me let me ask you a question so what were your thoughts on the SPF and Voorhees uh conversation so you say you watch that stream um yeah what'd you think of it like who won the debate where were the good side like where were the good points made and overall what were your what were your takeaways well before I get into that I I do have to because I definitely want to give my thoughts on that um I I do want to just like the thing about that tweet like the same thing you're saying to me like you could have left out that first part about bit boy you could have just said hey these are the people we want to have in you didn't have to call me out specifically I guess that's I'm not sure like so I'm actually not sure you're one of the good guys like I don't know you I am like I don't like I understand why people but you can't just say that you have to like you have to you have to show it right and by you just engaging in in the way that you've been engaging it just doesn't show me that it just looks like it's a crypto influencer looking for more attention that's what it looks like to me if you had been like here's GitHub and here's kind of an open source um like document of all of my propositions here are the senators were working if it was like that kind of reply you would have gotten a different response to me my only thing was like let's focus on the people doing the actual work yeah sorry I'm gonna let you finish it's hard in the bear Market to get people to fund things so um that's that's really where our struggle is when we've had several people have committed to funding and then ghosted us and you got to wonder why that is but um so here's what I have to say about SPF before we get into the debate which is you have to understand what happened I've been whistleblowing on this Federal bit license for six weeks now for six weeks and the thing that triggered that entire conversation on Twitter after he posted that was I said I just respond to him I said get ready bud and he responded back oh you're still in finance or whatever but he didn't even say binance because he was scared to actually have CZ involved there's a deep civil war going on in crypto between uh CZ and SBF people don't know that's why him CZ have been investing in Twitter such a big deal because SPF was told no so um but what happened is we I have a person who helps us raise money he he reached out to SPF and uh Tim Harrison from FTX U.S and sent them our bill and our proposal and said hey we're looking for funding we think this might be something you'd like to take a look at they said yeah sure so they took FTX took the bill they moved it over to their policy team now in the world of Politics the way a policy Team Works is they move very quickly they don't work very slowly because it's always a race to try to get things out so they sat on our bill for like three weeks without telling us if they were going to fund it or not no no input one of our top politicians Who's involved in this called the policy head at FTX us or I don't know if it's FTX or FTX us I think U.S and basically called him and this is the type of person when this person calls you answer the phone and so this person talked to uh the politician and said that okay so here's the deal we're actually not going to be funding this bill because we're working on our own legislation we have Chuck Schumer behind it and we are attempting to create a federal bit license and because of this we've been having a problem with your side of the aisle we would like for you to lead bit boys team and come over and work for us he literally tried to steal one of our top people out from under us meanwhile they sat on our bill for three weeks to sabotage us to slow us down and so it's been very personal so you can go back and look nobody else was saying this about SPF because I'm the only person who had that information for six weeks I've been telling you he's going to push Federal bit license about four weeks ago I finally came out with the term Federal bit license I outed Chuck Schumer I outed SPF um outed Tim Harrison uh so I explained what they're trying to do the next day Brett Harrison steps down from ftxus who was the person that just all ended up going through the next day Brett Harrison follows me on Twitter so you know they're watching and so it's personal between me and SPF and if you look at SBS track record this is what he's done consistently consistently he has crushed competition in pursuit of his own Endeavors trying to rule the space but what happened is when we came out with a video that very uh very distinctly uh articulated what he's trying to do what happened is he's soft in the language so if you go look at his tweets he very specifically says in those tweets about what they're doing which by the way the manifesto on the website a little bit harsher language a little more detail but on the Tweet thread he said now just to be clear here we're we're not coming after decentralization we're not coming after D5 we're not coming after peer-to-peer transactions well what are the two things that I said he was trying to destroy for four weeks before this came out defying peer-to-peer transactions so he literally comes out specifically with those terms to try to make it seem like no what we're doing is favorable for these things like you know look at us we're so great we care about crypto and he doesn't at all I know people that know him personally he's not a crypto guy he's a finance bro if you look at what elevator research did to make all their money with kimchi premium and all kinds of other stuff they had to Rebrand and he had to leave even though he owns 90 of the company because they have such a bad reputation FTX is is getting the same reputation so what I thought was really interesting is they can't he came out specifically trying to talk about those two things because obviously if you get a license a decentralized exchange can't get a license peer-to-peer the the bit license put this in perspective for people it costs an average of a hundred thousand dollars to be able to get one and in addition to that you also have to have a certain amount of cash on hand is a broker to be able to uh meet their qualifications so you're looking at almost a half a million dollars it's not like the normal person's gonna be able to go out and get one of these especially a decentralized exchange isn't going to be able to so what I thought was so interesting in the debate between Eric and SPF on your Channel was it actually he's finally started sprinkling out the idea of licensure of Licensing and the if you'll go back and you look at actually what happened with tornado cash I I think he's behind that too uh the the rest of the developer I think he's behind that too that's speculation but if you look at the playbook for what got the bit license you had 2014 February Mount gox gets hacked July 2014 the bit license gets voted in the next year it got uh it came into action right so all of a sudden a tornado cash thing happens kind of out of nowhere a few months ago and then all of a sudden what does SPF start doing sprinkling out these ideas of white listing and block listing and you know if you if Bob sends money to Alice and Alice's uh address has been block listed now because Bob sent money to her his is as well what if somebody what if his scammer's address gets blacklisted or block listed is the new terminology and then someone gets scammed and sends money to that person and now they can't reach the rest of their crypto that's left in because it's been block listed you can't off off ramp it so he started throwing all these ideas out about tornado cash that seemed very experience a saint with the timeline for him pushing this Federal Bill license so Eric Voorhees did I've never seen such a one-sided debate I've never seen a debate that was so lopsided in anything in my entire life all SBF did was ramble not say anything try to talk about people's heads and uh you know try to rephrase what Eric said 48 times and then Eric would come in with one or two sentences and would totally wreck SBF he'd have to go right back into Retreat I I'm shocked I don't know if this guy has handlers I'm shocked they let him do this against Eric Voorhees I mean my gosh actually I give him credit for doing it yeah because he did have this conversation and open but but yeah you know what's what you know what's interesting pip boys like um I did not expect this this kind of a conversation coming into this uh because I'm I was familiar with kind of your rant and you know some other things and like you are uh presenting um some rational arguments uh a lot of things that like bankless would completely agree with you on we have always been very wary of like the greatest threat to this entire crypto movement is that the crypto Bankers come in and start to make this the same system that we just left it's like same mold you know uh same old bot new boss name is the old boss 2.0 yeah exactly a new set of uh bankers and we've always thought that a play could be for the crypto Bankers of the world to come in and like completely sterilize defy make it a AML kyc type thing so what you find is like if you are familiar with bankless content you will find that like we have it's a there's a a common allyship there around all of this now your your approach is very different approach is insanely different yeah like incred in like insanely different and like um but as far as kind of what you're saying what you're articulating some of your end goals of like protecting defy and making sure that this is a sovereign Financial system that more people are are uh able to go bankless like I think we're completely United uh in these schools which was which is also wise like if you were for these goals why are you attacking Bank lists in the bankless movement that was another thing that I didn't really understand about this but maybe what you're saying is it was just in response to my original uh tweet that kind of like uh yeah tweaked you out they didn't do too much more uh due diligence on that yeah but yeah I think I think also you know the thing is is like like I said it was number one you know bit boy doesn't you know it shouldn't have the platform to be able to do this and number two the I don't resent you know represent people in crypto and like those if you were to ask me like what my channel is and why it's so strong and why it's continued to maintain High numbers in terms of viewers and watch time it's because the average person out there relates to me I was gonna paycheck to paycheck a few years ago you know I bought Bitcoin in 2012 I sold it all it took me nine years to become a millionaire in crypto it didn't happen overnight and so because of all the things like people really relate to me and so when you push this idea that I don't I shouldn't be the person to do this like in my opinion it was kind of slap in the face of my audience and so let's not go okay so we're past that right okay but why don't you talk like this more often I do on my show actually here's what's so funny what's so funny is 99 of the people that attack me on social media they've never been in my community and they don't come watch my videos if you actually watched my videos from start to finish yes there might be a time or two during a show that's somebody comes in the chat and says something stupid that I jump on but outside of that like it's a really rational show it's a very mature show I've got a lot of perspective I've been in crypto since 2012. this is not new to me every major event that's happened in crypto I've been a part of in one form or another I've got Mount gox claims I use bid instant uh you know like I I you know knew about when Roger Veer was accepting Bitcoin on his uh you know uh uh picture frame website the first one to accept it like I've been through the ringer I've seen it all I wasn't always actively investing during that time but because I was having to buy a software for my business for many years I kept up with it a pretty good bid there weren't the educational resources out there but this is what we do the majority of people on crypto Twitter they know me from memes and they know me from a rant here or there or they know me from that Zack xbt thread which I talked to Zach about that thread I I message him privately we talked about a little bit and the thing is is like even he recognizes my channel is different now than it was there was a time where I got some really good advice from a I got some really good advice from uh you know another large YouTuber in the space and they said you know what you got to do you got to start giving your audience what they want and I think the problem that occurred in 2021 or 2020 really a lot of this stuff is 2020. it's not even in the last year and a half or two years what it was is I got too dependent on giving my audience what they wanted and I stopped giving them what they needed because it was more advantageous for me to grow to give them what they wanted and it was such I did this channel for two and a half years and nobody watched so when I started doing these videos um and giving them what they wanted all of a sudden now I start growing and so I had to go through a maturation process to get to a point to realize that at some point I have to turn the dial and I have to take control of the channel and give them what they need and that's what we really want to do uh for the next Bull Run is we're not going to be doing 100x altcoin videos every day or every week you got to the point where my audience demanded that from me like every Friday they wanted our moonshot of the you know pick of the week and what happens is we get over saturated with altcoin picks and most of them did well in the short term almost all of them did terrible in the long term we have some like seat VR that did seven thousand percent increase so certainly some that did very well but the overall idea is that we've just had to come to a place where I've matured as a content creator and I'm I'm very confident and and what I do is edutainment we're edu educating in an entertaining fashion and uh you know I think there's something that a lot of people they keep going back to this thread that was a year ago almost which we've not done a a spec of sponsored content since January uh even in a bear Market where we needed it as a business um and you know people don't give me credit for that you know everybody just wants to attack all this stuff um like the the nft stuff you pull up there like that was so basically I had a graphic designer making nfts for me and they just came up with that at that time everybody was using stuff from Google and once people made a big deal about this we actually if you if you look at the definition of uh fair use a lot of what they were saying was plagiarism was fair use we added enough to it to make it different but see when it comes to me for some reason it doesn't matter people don't care they only want to go to the most negative case because I represent I think what a lot of people in crypto don't like there's certainly a lot of jealousy out there I mean that's obvious um just when you're at the top of what you do there are going to be people that are jealous and are haters but I think that there's there's a rejection of the average person coming into crypto there's this idea that you have to be so embedded into the tech where you have to be you you have to be in the space for 10 years or you're not uh you know creditable and and so for or credible excuse me and so because of that like um you know people don't give me a fair Shake A lot of times I there's no question in my mind I am the most missed understood person in crypto bar none I actually would like to lean into that a little bit because bitboy at this at the start of the show you talked about how you know bit boy the channel is the the Gateway into crypto it's like the first exposure that so many people have in order to understand what this crypto industry is and YouTube is that place right YouTube is so critical for that and so the you know the account that leans into like the YouTube algorithm and YouTube optimization the hardest the fastest the the quickest is definitely going to capture that audience sooner than the accounts that don't now uh so like you said you've like talked to people and they say oh yeah I learned through crypto through bit boy when I go to crypto conferences and I went through a ton of crypto conferences over the last 18 months something like 18 20 15 to 20 of them I don't hear anyone talking about how they got into crypto through bit boy and like what I've what I've come to kind of realize through this conversation with you so far is that there's like two different worlds out there two different crypto worlds and there's like the bit boy YouTube optimize crypto world and then there's kind of the the boots on the ground I mean these people at crypto conferences uh World maybe there's maybe there's a better name for that but those these two worlds like the Venn diagrams almost don't overlap at all and there are certain properties that I think people from from our side the the people that I'm familiar with the people that I talk to at conferences that uh are when they see your channel and say they see that side of crypto World they just get like super triggered uh and when you go to your YouTube channel uh bitboy it to me it seems obvious like there's a video that says xrp to 589 which is something like a quadrillion dollar market cap or something like that once you don't make the same mistake the pump made and assume that a title on a thumbnail is what I believe it's the we covered that story because a lot of people have been asking what is this 589 in in Ripple why do people talk about this all the time that video was me actually explained there was one section of that video where I explain what that number is where where it came from how it's so asinine it will never happen and but the thumbnail cell like that's we're in the attention game here right and obviously to do that and of course I had the big thing with pomp a lot of people know about and pump does the same thing or he was when he was covering Bitcoin on his channel and you know he did the same thing where he would say Bitcoin to I can't remember 20 million dollars right so do you really believe bitcoin's going to 20 minute dark no and and I don't judge him for that I think that's fine for him to do it's an idea that's in the video that people can watch he used this other example of a Dogecoin video where I said Dogecoin to five dollars I didn't say Dogecoin five dollars the dunnell said it Matt Wallace said it was going to five dollars and I spent the entire video explaining why it wouldn't happen so I think once again it's like the misrepresentation and misunderstanding but by people seeing a thumbnail and number one assuming that people make investment decisions off of thumbnails and number two judging the content before you've even seen it uh I'll I'll take that point however you also in your Twitter profile have like hashtag xrp and the reason why I really want to lean into this is that like xrp to me is the Bankers coin right and it's it's also like got this like it used to be stronger but it's got this like super big Twitter Army uh and so we have to be careful about when we make content about like yes a thumbnail doesn't really represent my beliefs it's not investment advice but bit boy you know it is for a lot of people a lot of people are gonna see that and be like yeah okay I'm gonna go and buy it right now while I'm watching this video because the thumbnail goes straight to The Reptilian Brain and like there's also this like meme of like bit boy is like the Alex Jones of crypto and like if you compare your rant to like an Alex Jones rant it's like it's like seeing almost the same thing and so it was one of the best rants I ever had for sure I mean that's not typical and so like that and so like yeah like Alex Jones has called it educated a lot of people out there about things but I wouldn't necessarily call it education for the education that we're trying to go after well that's the thing bit boys like hearing you talk I'm like oh this dude's smarter than that like you're actually like no bet like you know better I feel what you're doing though is you're using these shortcuts that aren't actually good for the community as as you just mentioned that you were using these shortcuts in in 2000 uh to grow your channel and doing all of these well that's not a super Shady all coins right and so what I'm saying shortcut asking your audience what they want and then giving them what they want that's actually what it is it's bad for them if if what if what you're giving them is not good for them it's bad for them there's a balance there has to be I know and you're going I was out of balance at one time and today we're in balance like if you go look at everything Zach attacked me for if you go look at every thing that I've been attacked for it's years ago and people can't in their brain unwrap those things and realize we're not doing the same kind of content because that responsibility you taught that was so big David when you talked about that responsibility I feel the weight of that responsibility on my shoulders at all times not only do I have the arrows constantly in my back that come from Mostly false places the the the weight of carrying around the idea that people count on me to get educated crypto it's very heavy and then the weight of thinking about my audience that like I've told them how I made money in crypto and I and I've talked about all the different ways that it's changed my life and that I want that for them and I don't want them to make bad decisions whether it's no even when we were covering all coins that were way down on coin market cap whether they're promoted or not like we never told people to put more than five percent of your portfolio in a super speculative uh coin right we've always done portfolio videos and we've shown like you want the vast vast vast majority in the top 10 the top 20 the top 50 maybe a little in the top 100 once you get outside that range it's five percent but people don't listen to that people don't understand that that's the message we're giving they just go and they pull up the thumbnail of the video and say see you know and I've always from the very beginning of my channel one thing that you know really really irritates me it really chats me is that you know we've never done an undisclosed promotion in the history of my channel in the history of Twitter we've never done a single one we've never done a pump it up not a single one and yet people attack us for those things over and over and over and over again so this isn't like a crypto larked type of situation no no no no no no well first of all I don't know enough about the crypto Arc situation to really say exactly where that falls I think some of it was probably misrepresented but I think some of it was probably accurate the truth is probably in the middle somewhere like it is on most things but I've understood since the first day I started this channel that not disclosing promotions is a criminal like that's what Ian is in trouble for now Ian you know rebukes a lot of that stuff and says they're making stuff up but I knew that from very early on that's actually why I've been so vilified is because we did disclose every single time boy what's that where do you post them like where can people find disclosures in the video audibly do you think that that's something that um the crypto YouTube world could get better at well it's just like standards for disclosures and like where they're posted and like so it's not just in some show notes that no one looks at but it's like there's a disclosures page where like you're posting all of this information I know it's an exercise that we've um tried to get better at over time and I think we've landed at a pretty good place but we didn't were some videos deleted because that's what the Zac xbc uh well first of all the Zac xbt thread um I had a 160 long tweet reply to that whole thing I finally did because I just get asked about it so much and we want to put out every single thing about all of it so people could read it and understand we can all move on um some of the stuff that he referenced was not even true at all like he referenced one project that you know he said rug pulled no they rebranded and moved to a different Court the coin still exists now it's not doing well nothing is but it still exists it's not rug pulled so there was some of that information that was factually incorrect some of it was correct the one that everyone he points to his pant now Pam was a project I covered and I'll come back to this token promotion business I think it's really important to be said here in a moment but we covered Pam it was an anonymous team after that we never took sponsors from an anonymous team again um because we learned that was a red flag we learned red flags over time and what happened is is the project that we looked at in my research team vetted it was not the same project when I released the video when I released the video they changed the smart contract out once again showing the predatory nature of the token promotion business and the people behind it it's a Serial team of people that goes around and does a lot of this stuff and you know I didn't think about that but oh they could change the smart contract and so yes we deleted the video and the reason we deleted the video is because it and to me it makes total common sense these coins are still on decentralized exchanges out there if someone were to somehow stumble across this video and think that it's new and they and and see that they could very well go to YouTube and try to buy this coin be like oh my god look how cheap it is why would you want to keep up something that was a scam and so you know there was another project that we covered distex we paid our community back the entire amount we got paid for that promotion we put together an Excel spreadsheet of the etholders and out of my own money that I took in from that and more we paid them back and nobody wants to talk about that they only want to make me a villain and they only want to pound me for uh you know like I said should I have known that they could have changed out the smart contract I'm not a tech guy but we learned it going forward and every time we made a mistake we learned a lesson and we moved forward and I think here's I really like that you brought up the idea of disclosures um because you know there was an article going on today behind the European Union they're about to make uh you know regulation where you have to disclose which good I I've cheered for that I love that I want that here we're putting out a video this Saturday where I'm going to be talking about the token promotion business and I'm I'm going to be calling on all influencers across crypto no more token promotion period no more no more private sale deals where you get an investment round in in lieu of a promise for you to promote that project right this has to stop if we're going to mature the space and this is not something why I look back and I say what I did was legal or illegal obviously there's no regulation in place we try to do the best that we could um we implemented the same kind of rules they use on the stock market like we wouldn't touch our you know we did a video on something we wouldn't touch it for at least 72 hours usually we never touched it um because that's kind of what's in the stock world but the token promotion business is totally broken if you look back at every single project that we ever did as a promotion very few of them are still viable bit boy what is it I I'm glad you're saying this yeah like why does this even need to be like obviously I mean there were tons of creators like bankless has never would never include in its business model whatsoever a token promotion like the daily way Anthony sassano a smaller Channel but like would never do that like this is just comments he'd throw himself on a sword first like why and I'm glad that you're saying it and like you're saying mistakes were made but like the thing I really want to want to emphasize here is that like big boy you're talking like oh yeah we learned these lessons like uh the Zach xbt thread misrepresented me I'm the most misrepresented person in crypto like people don't talk about like with how we gave the money back people don't talk about that we did this like I don't hear anyone else in the crypto industry who's like a media person content producer having to make these like defensive statements and so like there's that there's that dot there's the X Zac xbt uh thread it's that like when I go into in real life events like no one really seems to to listen to you and it was like all of these different either line sometimes for four hours at conferences so sometimes when I go to conferences like last year was a decentral con I literally didn't move for four hours and took pictures of people so the people who you're talking to are not the they're at the crypto conference the people that watch me it may not come up in conversation but it's it's hard for me to walk around if I go to a to a demo Hall where they've got uh you know booths stuff I can't make it five feet without every single person grabbing me and I understand what you're saying like a long time ago somebody told me something another large YouTuber when I was growing very quickly they said look you are going to want to slow down you do not want to be the top dog in the space if you are this industry is not kind to the person at the top and you're gonna be assassinated Time After Time After Time and I said that's fine I'm built for it I can handle it and and so yes I get more of this than anybody else but look at all the people Zach xbt has done stuff it's not just me and you also have to consider the fact that when I came into YouTube you don't want to be in the same list of people that Zack xbcc has gone after well I'm the one that has the most famous thread so you know yeah of course not of course I wouldn't you know even Zach would admit like things have changed on my channel I I know he would but the fact is is that when I came into YouTube the model for making money on YouTube and crypto was to do number one in 2017 it was tons of undisclosed promotions and so when I came in the space I said okay well the token promotion is that's the model like that's fine as long as you're disclosing and so I really committed to disclose and you know is it we don't know what the legality is uh if it's not a security if it's not a security then we don't know what the legality of it does of course we don't know anything that has a security or is it not a security but what I'm trying to say is I just regret it because I I don't like the fact that I did it because I understand now that it's it's a flawed mechanism and yes there's not a model for going to ten thousand to a million and and if you look at most of these videos they were when I was in the 20 to 30 000 subscriber range they were not when I had a million they were not when I had 1.5 million almost and so we did you know learn that on you know learned that earlier on we thought what we could do is we would learn from the mistakes and we would try to hone it into something that was advantageous for our audience at all times and you know unfortunately I just see now that it's not a profit it's not a model that works for the audience and to be honest with you it's not a model that works for the influencer either and I think this is the big thing that people have to understand the model only works for the people that are behind the token yeah they're the ones and why look I know almost every major YouTuber personally okay they're maybe one or two that I would consider to be pumping numbers okay one one or two that's it the rest of these guys know what's on the line what happens is you go pull a chart and you look at a video and you say see right when you did this video look at the dump it's the team it's the people behind it they're the ones that knew when the video is out they're the ones that you know helped you know tell you what should or should not be in the video not we actually would take no advice on what should or should not be on the video we would do it totally unbiased there was money involved but we would never let them look at the video before we published it and things like that um but the whole thing is the teams are the ones that are wanting the shortcut and then what they do is it makes it look like it's the face I'm the face the team nobody knows who they are and so they get off scot-free they get to dump the token and now they're in Founders dilemma where they made all of this money off a token off of something that's not built yet what's the point to build it now let's just take the money and run and that's what you see happen over and over and over again and I think really exposing the way that this business works and then once again when the next hype cycle comes in these business look I I had somebody tried to pay me a million dollars to do a video I said no way like and it turned into a big big ordeal we had said we would do a video and then we said we weren't going to do it and then they tried to give us a million dollars this is how desperate these people are and these Founders are to be able to push these these tokens out there on unsuspecting people and so um you know I think personally um you know going forward obviously we haven't done one since January but I do think like you guys do sponsors like there is things you can do in crypto that I think are appropriate for sponsorships this is what one thing we'll be talking about this weekend and there's other things that that shouldn't be when the hype cycle comes in the audience is looking for a shortcut so when you do a video that's a very low cap coin they're looking at that and they're like oh my gosh like this is the way for me to shortcut and get rich and so they lose and then you lose credibility and the founders make off with all the money that's why like really going forward I've talked to one of the top promotion companies in crypto as well and they've told me that if I come out with this video say calling on all my friends everybody to stop doing token promotion that they as a promotion business will also stop doing promotion business and they will focus on what needs to be focused look while it's fine exchanges fine Affiliates or exchanges fine tokens now look here's a little dicey water in nft well NFC is a whole other thing but an nft or a game that has a token I think it's okay to do promotion for that as long as you don't mention the token at all they have to understand we're not even saying you have a token we will talk about the merits of your game and that's it I think that can be appropriate but the idea of talking about a speculative asset that could go up or could go down um you know based upon awareness which obviously eyeballs bring awareness I think it's just got to stop it it's bad for the space and people will pull up my media sheet and they'll say oh you know 30 000 video first of all that's going rate like that's not outlandishing crypto okay second of all um what people have to understand about that is it wasn't leaked we just we gave it out to anybody because we didn't think it was a big deal we thought people understood that's kind of how prices were in crypto but we stopped doing promotions in January and that's hurt us this year you know like financially that's like we've lost out you know two million dollars or Whatever It Is by people who stopping also we stopped all sponsorships um and I think that um you know it's something that now after being this far away from it in January looking back I can say you know what I regret doing the token promotion yes I made some money doing the token promotion for sure but look when is my Penance up like when does it ever end is it ever and or in 2029 when I'm running for vice president and I'm Pro crypto like are we still bringing up videos for 2020 and not recognize the growth process and the maturation that we've been through like I hope that's not the case but I look back on that time and you know I do regret it but I also see that you know you didn't have to cut it off completely now I'm starting to understand like what could be appropriate what what is an appropriate yeah um and trying to do you know what's what's best for the space overall yeah and Ben here's here's what I I think is happening here like you you the going leaning into the whole YouTuber thing you're the man of the people right I am the man of the people there's like a bunch of funny like chat comments I'm reading right now uh uh backless needs to watch a show about bit boy guys bits knowledge is bankless working with regulators and so like you've created this meme that you are the man of the people right and that is why people watch your show like your fighting for them and that for some reason has worked uh it just the populist tactics like we do Quan did it like uh uh Danny Alex Jones did it it's very intoxicating for like a lot of people out there and so they they get along for the ride and so I think your show started off as did the Leaning into the token promotion business perhaps maliciously as you grew you realize that you actually can't optimize for wealth while also leaning into the malicious token promotion business so you started to pair back and you've probably been pairing back your malicious token reporting uh token promotion business as you've gotten bigger because you're doing this optimization function where you're trying to promote the best of your ability while growing your channel the most while also still maintaining this brand of I am for the people but what I'm seeing here what I think here today is you are brand managing and PR managing as you've gotten bigger and bigger and bigger so that you can keep on being the man of the people and leveraging your audience for monetary gain in whatever meta is now in 2022 late stage bear Market that's what I see going on here yeah I think anybody that meets me in person will tell you that's not true I think all my I have 50 employees here they'll tell you that that's not true and what you actually are looking at is you're looking at a pruning away of things as I've grown and gone through this maturation process of things that were not good the things I wanted to change every channel goes through maturation in some form or fashion and so what happened is look it's certainly like how dumb would I be to promote a scam like how stupid would that be if I were to oh yeah you know this one definitely is going to rug pull let me go ahead and promote this in a malicious type way no would it started out in the beginning is is hey like this is a project I like it it seems like it's got a lot of things I like and that's one of these predatory things that these places do is they learn what the YouTuber likes and so then they're you know like if you're a D5 guy check out this D5 project here's the thing I hear what you're saying but I still feel like you're playing the victim card right here because like I mean we were bankless was around back in you know 2019 2020 and it was self-evident to us that number one you can't do sponsored content never do sponsored content for Fiat for tokens for anything number two never take like tokens in in compensation and pump the price of those tokens of course we didn't do that but like okay but like you but you're just saying like there are some things that you're saying now you regret in you know 2020 you did and you've reformed your business practices like what I'm seeing is like there's some unethical things that you did that were self-evident and obvious back in 2020 that you're now kind of regretting what is what is the unethical thing specifically don't take it don't take tokens for compensation to create a pump video about the token okay well I didn't I I didn't do that to protect from that we received Bitcoin in ethereum or usdt so so don't take cut it cut cut the token compensation don't don't get paid for Content sponsors right sponsors disclosures commercials we make content and add sponsors we don't do sponsored content what I'm asking what I'm asking bit boys because like I think that I think that um first of all um this is a much more like this is a different conversation I thought we were gonna have I thought it would be like not intelligent I thought it would be some back and forth but actually it's the meme culture there's a lot of benefit from this because I got like I think Dave and I got to appear inside of like a very experienced crypto influencer who's kind of matured his business and as at the top of their game and like now you're looking at your business you're like how can I reform it what I would say is like just you know it sounds like you're going this direction but disclosures very important let me show you the bank list disclosures page right here we show everything that we have okay the entire team like what we have tokens in across nfts public nft wallets and stuff like that okay so so you could do that number two don't get compensated for Content don't do the pay per content play do sponsors do some sort of subscription model disclose all of these things to the public number three I don't think I think you're better than playing kind of the attention game all the time right it's just like um these are all of the reasons by the way not to get back to that tweet bit boy but like all of the reasons I I want people to talk to Jake travinsky if they're talking about regulation and not going down the bit boy uh you know train of like looking at some like some of the Shady paths that you have anyway all of these things I feel like you are reforming I feel like you can play a role in making the whole crypto YouTube influencer uh space better it is interesting to me that this world out there exists and I totally acknowledge this that like Bank list isn't tuned into which is like this Venn diagram
