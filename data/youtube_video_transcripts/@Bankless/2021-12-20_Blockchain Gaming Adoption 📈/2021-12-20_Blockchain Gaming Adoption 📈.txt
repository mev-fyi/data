it seems to be like there's just something new comes about in the world of crypto that is similar to something that already exists uh pre-crypto and there's just a lot of resistance to change humans just don't like change a lot of people are just very comfy where they are and they see something shiny and new and they're like well i'm comfy here i don't i don't want to change is that too reductive or is that kind of just what you're seeing here i think that's part of it but i also think in this case they are also thinking about like well how is this better and i think part of that is like not really seeing for example like the axi infinity community and realizing that yes there's actually people just farming and making a lot of money from that but there's a real like you know community there otherwise they wouldn't have the retention rates they do i think that skepticism is a big part of it but also i think we're in very early stages of watching gaming and some of these experience studios will will come out with a more like triple a gaming experience embedding blockchain pretty natively and i think that will also convert a lot of people as well
