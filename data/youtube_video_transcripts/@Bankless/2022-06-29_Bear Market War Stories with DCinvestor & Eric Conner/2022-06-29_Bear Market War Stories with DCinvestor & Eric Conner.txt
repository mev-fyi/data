what have you guys learned out of this cycle what did this cycle teach you uh what as a community as an industry what did we learn from this cycle that was unique to this cycle and that we couldn't have learned previously welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is david hoffman without my co-host ryan tread adams because he's away at the beach for a well-needed vacation but either way bankless is here to help you become more bankless and so today we have on the show eric connor and dc investor and these are people that have been through multiple market cycles they've got the battle scars to prove it they've got the gray hairs of wisdom that we so desperately need during these highly chaotic and uncertain times in the crypto world and so we go through some very simple but deep questions as to something of i think we can all get behind which are things like how what lessons have we learned throughout the market cycles what lessons did we learn through this market cycle how has the personality and like investing strategy changed as a result like what has the market cycles done to these humans as the markets chewed them around yet they are still here and fighting and will always live another day even though they've seen it all and also of course we get into the conversation of macro uh is the merge more powerful than macro uh and what are they thinking right now in this present moment in crypto and of course what are the patterns that we all see every single market cycle what are the patterns that resemble of this current market market cycle to pass current market cycles and what we can expect going forward when this whole macro thing turns around and of course we finish off with some advice for newcomers as well i hope you guys enjoy eric's and dc's wisdom uh they are people that i lean on during times of strife that i've had in my first market cycle and they have helped me keep my head on my shoulders and are just perpetually exude wisdom so bankless nation i hope you enjoy this fantastic conversation with eric connor

more than a hundred thousand dow members are all robbing about at governance governance.avae.com welcome back the station to the cope room i've got two veterans market cycle veterans who have seen multiple cycles throughout their life both inside of crypto and outside of crypto you guys have heard them on bank list before we're joined by eric connor uh he's been through the cycles he first found out about bitcoin while working at a bank and has been around an ethereum since the pre-sale itself and has stuck around throughout the cycles ever since then eric welcome back to the show thank you sir and of course you guys know and love him dc investor the guy with the coolest nft portfolio at least is cooler than yours uh he has also been through the marcus cycles both inside of crypto and outside of crypto and he's got the gray hairs to prove it dc once again welcome back to the show getting more gray hairs by the day thanks david grey hair again that's what we that's what that's what we're here for well whether or not you guys got your gray hairs from the crypto markets itself i i think this is a time in the cycle where we could really learn from the people that have come before us uh and so previously i have looked to you guys just for just wisdom of uh because when we go through the market cycle sometimes as newbies we don't really know what to expect and so we have to go and talk to the people who have been through the cycles before uh and just to make sure that we're not losing our minds we're not going crazy it's not going to zero and other people have felt the emotions that we are currently feeling uh as first cyclers although i will say i'm a second cycler uh and so with that context for the show my first question for you guys is how has um being a multi-cycle veteran like changed your disposition changed your personality your mentality how have you changed as going through the manias and then the lows and then the manias again and then the lows again like how have you like ridden out these waves and how has it changed you as a person uh eric i'll start with you yeah you know what's funny is like i don't really like i haven't even looked at the price of eath in the last like 72 hours to be honest and i feel like that has once you know like a bear market's happening you know the bull market's next and like i i just i remember looking back in like 2013 it's the first time i got into like crypto and then like we had this crazy top where everyone was buying like feather coin and litecoin and all this stuff and like litecoin went from 50 to 2. like people act like this is a new thing it's not a new thing and what's really interesting is like bitcoin and eth so far at least it could get worse who knows but like have less of a downswing so like as just a bitcoin and eth investor my entire life pretty much says like you know 98 of my portfolio um this is kind of nothing and you just get used to it and it's like okay here comes the bear market everyone's gonna freak out on twitter and now i just shitpost on twitter and just like it's you know and people get mad at me now it's like hey think about the newbies it's like no like i i'm teaching the newbies through shitposting on twitter it's like hey guys you know this is we've been here before we go through cycles and i i kind of find solace in every cycle getting less and less bearish like you know i think bitcoin's down 70 from the top eight hit like 75 something around those ranges but we recently lost cycle right hit 90. so i think i mean to answer your question sum it a lot for me personally i just kind of like start tuning out charts and step away a little bit take vacations with family realize everything's gonna be okay right everyone starts questioning their investment thesis and i think that's the biggest mistake you can make right like i mean we we had the ball podcast probably what 18 months ago or something on here and like we were all pretty bullish but i think the the general consensus is like sell some on the way up buy some on the way down and know that crypto's not going anywhere right i mean i think i think that's the most important thing you can kind of take from all these cycles dc how have the market cycles impacted you and how have you uh how has your personality been affected by the wisdom that you have gained throughout the cycles well i think from my let's start off first by talking about what it means to what does a cycle mean um to begin with and i think a lot of newer investors and market participants don't necessarily get the concept of a cycle they don't necessarily want to accept the concept of cycles but the reality is that human behavior and especially human greed kind of lends itself towards cyclical behavior and this has been proven in lots of different markets lots of different kinds of financial and non-financial behavior but especially when you whenever you have any technology with real fundamental value um that's that is significant people tend to front run that value right and so it's kind of like and this is true of crypto we've seen it in growth stocks and in other asset classes as well whenever there's an asset that has fundamental value the market tends to pile into it and that as they all pile in more people want to get in because the number is going up and it kind of creates this reflexivity that causes the number to go up often that number overshoots its target on the way up and also sometimes on the way down and i think everyone needs to kind of understand that market behavior because you're you're a part of that game whenever you invest in any kind of fundamentally valuable technology um as far as how the cycles have changed me over time i'll tell you what when i got into bitcoin in 2013 i bought the top of bitcoin um i had been investing in the stock market for years but i had heard about bitcoin much earlier than 2013 but i was like you know what i gotta buy some of this and because i saw it was going up hit a thousand dollars i think this is really interesting and i thought i was like i told myself i'm definitely gonna hold it no matter what i'm gonna hold it long term well i bought it for a thousand dollars in 2014 it started to go down and then in 2015 it went down more i decided i wanted to buy a condo in dc so i ended up selling that bitcoin for like between 300 and 500 um and then i saw it go back up to tremendous heights later on and that really taught me a lesson it was like you know what i need to learn how this technology works and to understand what made it special what made it accrue value in the first place and i need to stay engaged the next time one of these cycles happens and that means i'm not going to sell my assets at the wrong time i'm not going to buy in for the wrong reasons and i'm going to position myself to survive across these cycles as they occur and manage my risk so i can continue to participate because that that's the thing you've got to be able to stay in the game right if you if you end up selling out at the bottom of a bear market you're kind of done i mean you can always buy back in later and i've seen people do that we can talk about some of those stories but it's just kind of like you have an opportunity to participate in one of these world-changing technologies early you've kind of got to stay committed and position yourself to be able to stay committed speaking of having conviction in the assets that we buy eric you named some some very og coins that i think a lot of new cyclers might not be familiar with things like feathercoin and in the same era there were things like purecoin and namecoin and just some ridiculous sounding coins some ridiculous sounding names that in the world of 2022 we would be like nate feather coin like whatever the hell feather coin is it's not going to be part of the future of finance however back in the era of 2013 i'm sure people were like the feathercoin blockchain is going to change everything namecoin which is going to be it was like a blockchain plus ens so very early like naming type system i'm sure back then people are like oh this is going to change the future this is going to change everything uh and then that was a cycle i'm sure there was a fallout and a crash and a hangover as a result of that and while it is obvious nowadays that something like feathercoin is not going to be the future of finance i'll remind a lot of uh people out of the 2021 cycle that they probably bought a jpeg that they thought was going to be the future uh and so eric can you talk about just like how the the general sentiment always kind of falls into this trap of just like whatever is in the time of the market is the thing that is going to change the future and then like there's this inevitable like sobriety period can you talk about these phases yeah no i think this is a really good topic because i think one of the things we saw in this cycle were i guess i'll just name names but like avalanche solana people are like oh this is like new like people are reinventing ethereum that's not really like this is what happens every cycle like feather coin litecoin were reinventions of bitcoin in 2012 2013. like feathercoin pitch itself i think is like like an upgraded customizable bitcoin litecoin always kind of pitch itself like charlie like you know basically exit scan at the top of like litecoin but like pitching as like a faster bitcoin right but we all know now like that's not i mean block size is important and like that that was kind of a scammy pitch right but we kind of saw that this cycle with solana and avalanche in my opinion where it's like writing the coattails of ethereum and saying hey you know we've got something better we've seen this all before right so i think what's like really important these cycles is to keep your head on straight when it comes to this hype of you know i mean bitcoin i give it and like you know i think long term it's pretty doom but for now i would still tell most people hey buy eth like 80 maybe buy like a little bitcoin just to like whatever have some in your portfolio all these alts that like ride on the coattails like i said of ethereum's the new one right like hey we're faster better ethereum and you just it's unbelievable the hype and the the funds jump in and twitter's all about it and like everyone i i'm still amazed i've seen tweets in the last few days no one thought solana could have went back to 20 dollars like what i mean this is one of the most obvious things ever to me that solano was gonna crash 95 right it's just it's just unbelievable how people think this is new but in reality this happens every single cycle and kind of a funny story but i'm vacationing right now and my wife and i were driving home you know we had a half hour drive home earlier we were laughing about because we were talking about being on this podcast and stuff and we were laughing about being the retail noobs in 2013 like we were buying litecoin and feather coin and stuff like at the top because at the time like btcc which i don't even know if people remember this there's some shady russian like exchange like like one had gone from 20 to 50 around like thanksgiving of 2013 and we were buying like the top on all these things and they crashed like 95 the next day we're like oh this could be the next bitcoin like this is not a new thing so it's funny how not only do price cycles repeat but narratives repeat and people jumping behind what they think is smart money but in reality is dumb big money um it's just all the same i mean my point of view on it is a lot of people and this something i learned from my management consulting days um the concept of like a value proposition and i'll define a value proposition is what is the unique value a product or blockchain offers the market that cannot be found anywhere else and when you ask yourself when you frame the question that way there's not a lot of unique value in this space there's a lot of follower value there's a lot of duplicative value now i i won't be quite as harsh as eric to say that you know i i can't say with surety that these other chains are not providing any unique value but i think it's an open question um across the board in crypto to include ethereum still i mean in some domains where is that unique value and i don't think many investors are asking themselves that question as eric said a lot of people just follow whatever they think the smart money is doing but guess what the smart money is is selling at the top and they're not coming back i mean we've seen this cycle a few times um with some of these other coins and unfortunately there's a tendency where there are some vc's or i'll use the term vcs in quotes here because a lot of a lot of different firms are calling themselves vcs these days but they will pump a coin one cycle and then they're gone the next and they will act during that cycle like it's the most important thing i'm not i can't point to any one token that that might happen to this cycle but we saw it happen in the past with stuff like eos which was the first they called themselves the the first ethereum killer that's where the term came from so i think that people need to be a lot more vigilant and think about where is that long-term value and it requires patience it requires years of patience in many cases to establish that durable value and most people just aren't that patient i think one thing though like it's a good point i think one thing to think about there too is vc's totally quote unquote vcs missed out on eth they missed out on ethan 2014 in the pre-sale they were sleeping on it most heath buyers were actually like bitcoin ogs and they also missed out on buying the dip and pretty much put money into like cosmos eos and others before everything kind of took off in 18 and then of course they weren't buying each one of its number two market cap i think that's a smart thing for people to understand and realize when they see these quote-unquote vc influencers on twitter like eath has to be one of the most missed out on assets of all time when it comes to big money just to balance out the conversation a little bit more i will say that the uh the alt flavors of chains that all that demand where like as soon as the blockchain proves itself it'll generate a bajillion all flavors of that same blockchain i saw that with bitcoin and the proof of work a fork and fair launch era and we're seeing that a bunch of ethereum i will say as that progresses forward we have seen a significant improvement in quality even if it is like an all flavor of the original chain like the quality of the flight of the alternative flavor does get better and trend to be better over and over time and while these dynamics of uh vcs forking something just to to have a investable alternative will always probably stick around uh at least the i will say the quality of these forks do attract new use cases new developers new attention at least during the bull markets uh and i but i think since we are in a bear market with the conversations here as well what happens when everything contracts and how many how many uh people in that community and around that that ecosystem is really going to be here for the long term um one question i have for you guys is uh what what would you say what would you credit to the reason why you are still here is it something in your personality is it like a lesson that you learned early on uh what was one of the reasons why of all people many many people come into crypto and they get washed out uh but you guys have come into crypto and you guys have stuck around uh what quality or what do you credit to that reason why you guys are still here and dc i'll start with you this time i'll start first with crypto is not my first investing experience and so you know i had invested in the stock market for for years since i was in college um and i made mistakes in some of those stock cycles you know i mean like i didn't really understand herd and market behavior as well and i i got caught up in like 3d printing and how that was gonna change the world and i bought some of the stocks that went up a lot and i watched it crash and i eventually learned my lesson um in terms in terms of how those things work but basically the stock market investing on the stock market and other assets taught me to think very long term and especially for a technology like crypto i i think also like my experience in growing up with the consumer internet which i know i've talked about on banquo's before i actually recently published an article on my sub stack about um you know the early internet and what it was like to grow up during that period and i kind of refer to this period that we live in today as the dial-up era of cryptocurrency where there's a lot of harsh criticism a lot of that criticism is also deserved however it would also be myopic to not believe that we're going to eventually progress some of past some of these teething challenges that we have today just like we progressed past the challenges of dial up internet um but in terms of other things that i credit for still being here i mean look i stayed engaged through the bear markets and i didn't do that in the 2013 bear market i realized that's a huge mistake eric did and eric learned about ethereum got involved in the ethereum pre-sale if i had stayed involved i probably would have followed a similar path but i didn't do that so there's a huge opportunity cost to just stepping out during a bear market and missing what's actually happening and i think finally and most importantly perhaps is not over leveraging at the wrong times and when i say not over leveraging i mean that means borrowing money to invest in cryptocurrency which i don't recommend for most participants at all but it can also just mean like over investing in general you have to have a position that you can hold and if it's like if it's like your entire net worth and you have no other liquid assets then you're not going to feel secure and you're going to be tempted to sell at the wrong times i've seen people do it i've done it myself you don't want to be the guy that sells the bottom it's painful eric same question to you well what about your experience your history or your disposition has allowed you to stick around throughout the cycles yeah it's it's funny like i to me every the first day i like invested in ethereum or like even thought about its potential to me it's always been i've said this so many times on podcast twitter whatever people are probably tired of me saying it but it's a multi-decade play like you're not going to build the next financial system overnight right so i think one of the problems with cycles people just get antsy like i get it people want to get rich overnight like i totally get it but in reality most people that get rich however you wanted to find that right like monetarily personally whatever mentally they they stick to something for a while like not many people just become rich overnight so i just i think that to me i knew ethereum had a huge uphill battle like when i first ran across it it's because you know i had some friends that lost money in mount gox and i saw the talk pitch it i'm like hey this could be a cool thing like people get control of the financial system and this goes all the way back to i graduated college right as the financial crisis in 2008 2009 was happening and you know what's funny is i ended up going to work in finance but at the same time like you kind of saw like all these systems start to fail and you know as you kind of grow grow up in that you're looking for alternate solutions or alternate systems and this idea just has fascinated me since then and i i knew that you aren't going to like become a leader in an industry that's been around for 150 200 years like finance has or banks have overnight right like you're up against government you're up against regulators you're up against currencies like this this is not gonna happen in two cycles and i think that's one thing people lose track of right and i really think though like why am i still around i and i think this gets lost a lot in like d5 and nfts and stuff i like the power of the composability and the ability for anybody in the world at any point in time to not only use ethereum but to build on ethereum and you know plug their new programming language their new code their new lego into d5 or into nfts and say hey look i launched this maybe it fails maybe they exit pool maybe they rug maybe they make a billion dollars but you know what someone in india or south america or russia or i don't care where they are like the power in that is incredible and i think we're used to these closed off systems where people are selling your data or you know no one's allowed to plug in because this api holder is the one that connects your bank account to your venmo or whatever um that's always been to me why i stick around i'm just never going to lose that vision and i don't think ethereum and its community is ever going to lose its vision so i'm just going to stick with it i don't care if i'm 90 years old then we're at a hundred dollars i'm going to that's not going to be here you know i'll just add on to that eric because i think you made some great points but i think in particular that last point is really valuable for people to think about um the thing that i think that's made us both successful in crypto is that we've looked for those organic communities where people are building on these permissionless systems and it can't be contrived it has to be real builders and community members who want to come and participate in something and it can't just 100 be motivated by money there has to be a higher purpose but when you see that man i mean go all in frankly i mean because if it's real it's going to grow and it's just going to compound on itself and that's exactly what we've seen in the ethereum ecosystem so far yeah and i'll just i'll say like that made me think i was gonna say this but you just made me think about it is like kind of the smartest people i know are just in this space like i'm never not only the smartest but the friendliest it just i don't know it's a good vibe it feels right like it's hard to just pass up on that and be like oh these people must be onto something wrong like there's there's just no way that's possible and uh eric you said um something about like money legos and permissionless building and and i think in 2017 we definitely as an organizat as a community we definitely tapped into that permissionless building thing but that money legos that defy legos part we didn't really come up with that as an understanding until something like 2018 and 2019 when we had actual apps to plug into each other because in 2017 2016 they were all siloed apps and even vitalik actually i i remember him saying that he didn't really realize the power of composability in these things until it had actually happened and so this is like a this is a bear market lesson right this is something that we learn after the mania of the 2017 ico movement where we realized that like no it's not icos that are in the new paradigm it's composability between these applications that are the new paradigm and like that that's a lesson that i learned very very quickly because i was the person that got burned by icos right that was my first cycle that was my like bull market mania lesson i thought that icos and tokens were going to solve human coordination we're going to bootstrap this ecosystem by like leading with a token first uh and just like high pipe hype mania mania mania super convicted on it because it was my first cycle and like not only was it my first cycle but it was also my first foray into like money and finance like your boy came from uh from social work like i worked at a mental health agency so like coming into ethereum in 2017 with like all these tokens like i didn't really have any sort of like foundation to ground myself in so the question to you guys is is was there like something that you had a ton of conviction on that you wholeheartedly believed that you lost a lot of money on like have you guys ever had an experience like this eric i'll start with you yeah i mean i i think i definitely resonate a bit i mean losing a lot of money the only time i really lost a lot of money in the crypto space when i entered and i was like i'm gonna just leverage this thing i know what i'm doing and i just lost like i mean i probably wouldn't be doing this podcast i'd be living on an island and i would have so much bitcoin it wouldn't even matter right but i mean i was david i love you so i still did a podcast but uh you know i lost way too much bitcoin on leverage right and because i was at the time yeah i worked in finance yeah i had traded stocks in the past but i didn't understand market cycles like people are like oh this is the best idea i've ever heard in my entire life like i'm just gonna go all in it can only go up right and that just doesn't happen so you know people need to understand that stuff goes up and down um you know as far as like conviction i had i think it would resonate a bit with you with tokens early on i think where token started to miss the boat let's think like the d5 example and yeah i bought some defy tokens probably lost a little money here and there but um they just said we're just gonna launch a token and assume it's like equity in the company and that that's just not right i've actually been very disappointed in a lot of defy tokens and not giving a little bit more value to their token um uni swap i don't even know what's going on with unison governance they can barely get anything through and they haven't enabled fees back token holders and all this stuff i think you know i i had better hopes for that i would say as far as you know ave unison i'm not like naming names in a bad way but like these are great apps that are doing cool things and we somehow can't like find a real way to give value back to token holders and like an appreciated token a little bit and i think uni has gone from like a dollar to 50 back to three which i get it like that's the market cycle but at the same time if you look at like the uni governance process like not much is going on right so i think we can do a little better than hey we have a token and our app's really cool so i think i've been a little disappointed to this point about that because to me it's not that different than the 17 ico phase i mean most of those went down 95 percent all these tokens have two um and maybe i've got a little burned on that opium wise and investment wise we can definitely do better um but i i know i know dc has definitely views on this because i've seen tweets about it and i know the whole community does um so yeah i'm curious to see what he thinks yeah i mean so to answer the question first i you know my biggest losses have probably just been from being too greedy at the wrong times so you know seeing a trend and then just kind of chasing in with even more money and then timing it wrong and i lose money so not too different from what eric described just being over leveraged or overexposed at the wrong times but in general i have attended i try to get into assets that i believe in early before a lot of people like understand the value that's at least that's what i tried to do and i tried to do that with you know ethereum as early as i got in i wasn't at pre-sale but i came after that in late 2016 early 2017 with d phi and with nfts um but i think you know to speak to eric's point about defy token design in particular i also have been kind of disappointed because i think that a lot of a lot of these defy 1.0 protocols as they're called they're like stalwart protocols i mean they're still ticking i mean a lot of these d5 2.0 and these other like exotic um algorithmically driven stable coins have just totally collapsed and blown it but like uniswap compound ave they are just chugging along they're working exactly as they're intended to maker is another one so but the tokens aren't necessarily reflecting that value and i think that is a wake-up call to governance of those protocols to say hey we have to think about how to return value back to our token holders we need to think about that feedback loop which some at least make or has one in theory through the token burning but a lot of these really don't have that yet so i'm not willing to count them out yet but i do think the market price has reflected that reality i also believe in some of these protocols for the long term i think they have kind of changed the market they have durable value so i'm crossing my fingers that you know through and some of these have already been through one cycle like ave i'm hopeful that we're going to see some changes on the horizon as we move in through the spare cycle do we think that it's a regulator fear i mean i i know that like technically we could vote on stuff and whatever but there are still leaders let's be honest and like do we think it's a regulator fear i i can't quite understand why this hasn't been improved i mean i'll share some thoughts on that i think that regulator fear is part of it and you don't want the central they're not central but you know the people who lead the labs that have developed these products if you will they don't want to be seen as pushing some of these fee proposals through that's number one number two i do think that there's a fear that implementing fee income is going to lead to a competitor than stealing you i mean most of the successful growth businesses in the stock market even have not shown a profit for years sometimes decades so i think there's some of that thinking that's at play here i also think that the path for value creation to the token doesn't have to be through the existing product lines either it could be creating new products i mean like i just look at something like uniswap let's take that as an example there's a ton of potential there like if they i'm just saying hypothetically if they developed a layer 2 exchange which is as fast as a centralized exchange that could lead to a ton more trading volume at lower fees and the game for unit swap i think is to continue to gain and grow its market share which really i mean well it started off as basically 100 but it it did pretty well in terms of defending its market share a lot of people are like uniswap is dead and they've just kind of surprised the market now the question is how to activate that value in the token i do think it can be figured out but i do think there's a fear from a regulatory perspective i think there this really really illustrates the difference between this current cycle that we just went through and the cycles of old the the last cycle because i don't from what i'm gathering from you guys and i would totally agree like yo uniswap's not going anywhere and the tokens that people held in 2017 and then held down to the bottom in in 2018 like they went to zero and they stayed there uh i mean there almost almost no token actually goes to zero so when we say it goes to zero it's more of a metaphor than anything like omisego for example it was a token that was very very popular total consensus in 2017 and effectively has gone to zero uh substratum that was a token that i helped uh decentralized i don't even know actually at this point uh went to zero right uh and now we have tokens like ave and uniswap and and other d5 related tokens and like no one thinks that they're going to zero and and maybe and maybe the first cycler may be like well okay yeah we're just naive it's going to happen again like last time but the difference is is like we're talking about market share like you you guys just talked about how you know unit swap didn't lose market share to a competitor uh and we're talking about like why what has failed us with being able to value have value capture in the token so when we when we talk about like things that are different this cycle yo this time it is actually different like the tokens do have fundamental quality and my answer to this question eric i know you didn't ask me but i'll answer it uh is one definitely one part regulatory because the leaders are cannot the people that guide governance can't make that decision to you and swap can't just turn on the fee switch like maybe maybe the token holders like hayden when are you going to turn on the fees hayden please turn on the fees and hayden's not going to turn on the fees because of exactly what you're talking about which is regulatory but underneath that the bigger qualm the bigger thing that i think is really holding back token value capture is coordination is dow coordination and so like dals right now are still learning how to do this how to dao and so i think where most if we're learning lessons from previous cycles in most tokens 99.9 of tokens in 2017 went to zero and most defy tokens from the 2020 to 2021 era are not gonna go to zero and they're actually going to figure out how to come back from the bear market by meaningful value capture and it's probably actually going to be the bear market itself that triggers these dows to have the like put the fire under their butt and actually figure out how to have this token capture value because guess what a lot of salaries are paid from the value of this token what do you what do you think about that take eric i'll start with you yeah no i mean i i definitely agree i think kind of going back to your point about 2018 and stuff i think what most people don't realize about like this bear market which by the way i'm not even like yes it's a bear market but it's more a downturn like a bear market it will be if we're having this conversation 2023 and we've been sitting at you know 1100 for a while i'm not convinced that this thing isn't just gonna turn back up which i know is funny to say on this podcast because i know i've been painted as the bear when i got 2500 as the top but i think we could see accelerated cycles and it loops back to your point of in 2018 there was like nothing i mean like crypto kitties and crypto punks were out there on the nft side and like ave was called lind i don't even know if most people know this it wasn't even called ave uh and uni swap was just like kind of launching and there were a few defy apps but as far as like an ethereum user you were just kind of like stacking your eath in your wallet and you were not doing much right and at the same time we were literally as a community i mean you all three of us were there were debating how to fund the future of ethereum because we thought the ef was going to go bankrupt and they were laying off in place and we weren't sure like how guts was gonna get funded so i think you know if if this is your first cycle trust me it's been way worse like the price at 1100 and still billions of dollars flowing into this ecosystem it's not a problem um i don't even know i i don't think you can really destroy ethereum at this point like maybe you go down to like 10 bucks for 10 years i i don't even know like i think i think it's basically destroy proof or foolproof at this point um but yeah i mean there's so much out there and i know i tweeted this like yesterday or something everyone in my feed is like oh we we need to have a two-year bear market i i think times are just going to be different in these cycles i think crypto has like a hyper acceleration of greed and fear which drive markets and i think we saw a hyper acceleration on the way down i don't know if this was funds blowing up or whatever but it was a hyper acceleration of fear um but i think this market is not like it was in 2018 we have use cases the merge is coming layer two's coming and maybe you know anthony and i talk about this all the time on our podcast maybe that doesn't matter short term but zoomed out it actually does matter and i i just i don't know i this doesn't feel like 2018 to me i think we're gonna wash everyone out quickly and the tide pulled out at the time i pulled back in don't call me not financial advice i don't know where we're going but i'm actually kind of bullish i'm not going to lie i kind of banned this supposed to be the bear market podcast eric but and you know what no no no no it's a bear market war stories podcast okay bear market war stories well i think in that case i will echo eric's sentiment that during the last cycle and even the one prior to that was when mount cox blew up and there was a ton of concern a lot of people including myself who did not understand the technology well at the time back in 2014 didn't understand that you know mount cox was not the end of bitcoin like in my head i was like oh man is this like some technological or existential flaw in bitcoin i didn't understand and similarly i think you have a lot of people having those kinds of fears right now with some of the stuff that we're seeing and i'm going to use defy in quotes and actually i'm not going to call it defy at all because a lot of these like algorithmic stable coins and some of these off-chain funds doing kind of shady things a lot of that stuff is blowing up and i think what people kind of fail to see is this is the system kind of rationalizing itself and this will eventually kind of flush through okay because it's not like a fiat based system where centralized custodians can make up all of this money or or do bailouts and so we are seeing i think erica's right we're seeing an acceleration of some of this downside price discovery now i don't have like i i don't have a really strong point of view on how long this is going to last but i would say be prepared for any scenario and that's kind of how i'm that's how i'm positioning myself is like if things go back up um because the fed loosens up that would be great and i think i think we do have to talk about the macro backdrop a little bit um because i don't know if you want to hit that in a different question david or if you want me to talk a little bit about my thoughts on that now i got one more question i'm then we're going to get to a macro and so just to tie things off when we talk about cycles is every single cycle seems to bring its own lesson like i talked about my lessons in in 2017 is like getting super bullish on vaporware tokens and kind of fading ether uh granted before the ultrasound money thesis um but like every single lesson seems to bring it's it's new or every single cycle seems to bring its new lesson uh and so i'm wondering what what have you guys learned out of this cycle that what did this cycle teach you what as a community as an industry what did we learn from this cycle that was unique to this cycle and that we couldn't have learned previously um so dc i can throw that one back to you yeah i mean my point of view is this is the cycle where i feel like crypto was de-risked because a lot of us were able to actually see with our own eyes and use these apps the potential for world change through these apps i think is real i mean the stuff that we were able to do with d5 during this cycle i think is incredible um and i know that the three of us were you know chatting a long time ago and i remember when uniswop launched and i remember using uniswap for the first time and i had an oh moment i was like wow i just did a decentralized trade with no counterparty no custodian and it just worked on chain that was like a game changer and so that was a huge um growth vector for crypto this cycle the other thing that we can't ignore is the attraction that nfts brought to the space of a lot of different users so we went from just being a bunch of crypto and finance nerds to now bringing in artists and culture and i cannot i don't think you can overstate how important that is for the future of this space um this was the first endogenous economy to crypto in my point of view these are people who are creating digital works on the blockchain they're selling them on ethereum through various nft marketplaces and there are artists who have earned a living from this some of these people will go down as digital art legends in like five ten a hundred years and we are seeing this metaverse economy open before our eyes so i think this ties into eric said none of that was here in 2017-2018 these are all like twinkles in her eye wondering if these things would play out but i think we saw it happen we saw the power of composability and we saw the users come yeah i mean i definitely so like my first thing was basically going to echo your point around nfts where it's you never know what's like next like people thought oh d5 that like ethereum and d5 maybe like identity and all of a sudden boom nft just absolutely blew up blew up beyonce yeah i mean beyond yeah we all kind of like knew like punks were cool crypto kitties were cool some of this stuff was cool but i mean a thousand times more than our imagination ever believed right so i think that also ties back to the point we're talking about earlier though where it's like this is access and building access for anybody in the world and i think people really underestimate how much capital and how much building can really happen when you have a network that can take anybody in the world to go in but anybody right like i'll use venmo or paypal as a basic example like it's pretty closed off i mean no one can build on it very few people can actually transact when you consider the entire world right all of a sudden you bring in all these people developers users capital anybody can tap into this things can explode way faster than you think and i i couldn't even comprehend to this day how much nfts pull up i just i mean it's amazing so i think that's the biggest thing i learned from this cycle is not to underestimate what the use case because use cases could really be i think also one of my bigger takeaways has been we've gotten to a size now where we're threatening to to governments to regulators to people um and i never like i knew we would get here but i was kind of surprised at how fast we got here where it's like oh wow we we built an alternate financial system and people are threatened by this um so i was a little taken aback at how fast that happened and you know people being concerned with the sec and regulations and you know lawsuits and other countries and whatnot and i think you know i don't want to tell people like be careful with what they're building or like what they're putting out there but i do think there's a target on um builders and users backs all of a sudden because this is a threatening thing and you know i'll go back to the multi-decade play meme that i always say like the multi-decade play the reason is it's going to take a while to usurp these traditional systems and incumbents right and i'm hoping that as we go on people we can elect into like you know congress or government in the u.s or pro crypto and stuff but i think we saw that it's going to be an uphill battle i don't think there's just at least in the u.s obviously i'm speaking from u.s terms i live here um i was a little shocked at how negative some of the reaction was this cycle so maybe it'll get better i don't know but um yeah those are the two things i kind of took away from this cycle rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eth with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross-chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution you can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co-founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely go to across.to to bridge your assets between ethereum optimism arbitram or boba networks arbitrom is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use device and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to

for your users visit arbitrum dot io developer to start building your dap on arbitrary if you're a d-gen many of your favorite daps on ethereum are already on arbitrarily with many moving over every day go to bridge.arbitrom.io now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defy nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast cheap secure and friction free one other aspect before we get to the to the macro conversation is the concept of leverage because leverage was also a very new thing this cycle because we had leverage options from from centralized entities in 2018 and 2017 but they weren't really as robust as they are now and we had no concept of on-chain d5 leverage which was super transparent and i think you can really see that in the way that the charts behave differently this cycle uh for example in may of 2021 when we had that big may crash uh tuesday may 11th the total crypto market cap of all crypto assets were 2.5 trillion and then just 10 days later 12 days later on may 23rd it had lost a billion dollars down to 1.4 trillion excuse me it lost a trillion dollars 1.4 trillion dollars down from 2.5 trillion dollars just like 12 days earlier and that was may and so if we just zoom back out to the to the all-time high charts uh for for total crypto market cap uh the total crypto market cap peaked at basically three trillion dollars and now here we are down below one trillion dollars and it's as a result of three eros capital the world's the crypto's largest uh vc fund blew up uh and now we have insolvent nexus mutual because like nexus or not nexus excuse me celsius was on leverage and now we have just contagion from leverage everywhere like leverage it was like a brand new thing that happened in the cycle that i think we could definitely point as one of the sources as to how fast this crypto this cycle seems to have moved i want to pick your guys's brain on if you do think that this cycle seems to have went faster than previous but also just like the run-up in crypto like the total crypto market cap was 400 billion in october of 2020 and then it was 2.5 billion in may of 2021. like that's insane and so like i just want to pick your guys's brain as to like to what degree did leverage really play a key uh center in this in the role of this particular cycle um eric i'll throw it back to you yeah i mean i'll start with saying like unless you really have good risk management don't touch leverage i mean you know i've been there and i remember when maker cdp's launched and i had a bunch of good friends in crypto that like oh i can borrow gets my eat they'll buy more eath and then you know ethan's crashing at the time and it it's just i don't necessarily so leverage by the way is like traditional finance like funds and firms are leveraged to the tits on on the you know on the traditional side too um so i don't think it necessarily like caused the boom or bust but i do think when we do bust people look for excuses right like why did we bust and you know there's capitals out there they blew up there are rumors of the blow up that there's not much info around it um but i don't think like it kind of goes hand in hand there's never like one reason right that we go way up or way down i think maybe some of these firms are leveraging and like on a breakout they start leveraging up and we break through and you know then all of a sudden retail buys in and we go up higher and higher and maybe they get greedy and then on the way down it's kind of the same thing so i don't necessarily think like it's why we went to 5 000 east and what was 60 or 70 000 bitcoin or whatever it was um it's just a factor of the markets and it but it has been around in ethereum land for a while and i think it's it's funny right like i have this weird view of where some people should be allowed to access certain financial tools in d5 versus c5 and i think leverage is one where i kind of i don't know it's so easy to just like deposit your ether to defy and like leverage long on it and not really realize what's happening there and i remember back in 1819 and some people got like blown up and they didn't even really realize what they were doing um whereas if you're on like td or e-trade or something you try to leverage like you have to sign like 16 different documents and like have a certain amount of money in your account and really prove you know what you're doing and i'm not saying like i want regulators to come into d5 per se but i think we could do a little bit better as a community going forward to like warn against this it's just so accessible and i feel bad for people that just kind of like get sucked into it yeah my point of view is leveraging crypto isn't really it's not totally new it's been around for a while and we saw this with like other exchanges in the past and you know bitmex was a pretty famous exchange where you people were leverage longing and shorting and people lost a lot of money and they saw this back in especially in 2020 when you know the liquidation cascade almost like tanks bitcoin to who knows what price if arthur didn't pull the plug or if bitmex didn't go offline or whatever but the bottom line is leverage isn't necessarily new i think what is new one we have more on-chain leverage but the on-chain stuff doesn't necessarily scare me as much and eric's brought up some valid points about consumer access to the services and making sure consumers are educated however through this liquidity crunch and macro we've also seen traders on robinhood and a lot of other platforms get liquidated because a lot of people they'll sign the forums but they don't know what they're necessarily getting into even after signing those forms i think what hurt us this time is the degree right they're just like giving give me that ten thousand extra dollars i'll sign one exactly they don't care and they're just like it's free money numbers going up i want to get as much exposure to the market as possible but i think also what hurt us this time is all of the opaque off-chain activity which was being executed by some of these large funds and essentially what has reportedly happened with rio's capital which i i don't think they're the largest fund by any means um you know and i also wouldn't necessarily call them anymore yeah not anymore and i wouldn't also call them a vc really they're a prop trading firm who was kind of playing a role of a hedge fund and of a vc at times but they were trading their own money reportedly what has happened with their assets is they were borrowing against some of their liquid staff positions and they were pledging that collateral to multiple parties and because those assets are not on chain there was no automated way to liquidate that collateral when the value fell below whatever thresholds were required for them to have access to their loans and so there's a huge mess that needs to be unwound there there could be some contagion or collateral damage from there but i think fundamentally we can't ignore some of the macro picture and liquidity tightening and how that's reduced at least for a time a bid for risk assets which i think crypto is still viewed as a risk asset to most investors um so when risk assets i think come back into play or at least when the selling has completed i think crypto's gonna still be well positioned because there still is that fundamental value that we talked about earlier yeah and let's go ahead and just lean right into that one of the unique things about this time right now in in crypto's history is the macro conditions uh like well almost most investors have never been through a situation investing where there's like a war that's threat that's increasing oil prices and food prices causing inflation but also more importantly very few people have invested during times of high interest rates and this is true for not just crypto but for the s p 500 like a lot of the newer investors who unless they're like older like gen x or older and maybe even gen x two is too young but like high interest rates we haven't seen those for most people's lives and definitely for all of crypto's history we saw like maybe like something like one or one and a half percent at some point in time like 2018 but it was so such a short amount of time and so i think to me this explains why this drawdown happened so fast uh if this is indeed the bottom 2018 took about a year to bottom uh and 2022 took about two-thirds of one year even a little bit less than that about 60 of one year uh and so let's talk about that like leaning into high interest rates in crypto how is that new and how is that going to throw people for a tizzy when it comes to investing in this thing and how should we reorient ourselves as we go forward dc i'll lean into you for that one sure i'll start us off i think that so one one of the big factors that's different this time and for the first time in 40 years is we have inflation in the us economy at pretty significant numbers there's a lot of different reasons for that it's not solely just a result of having printed too much money but that's part of it perhaps through all of the moves to introduce economic stimulus into the economy during the covid period during the lockdowns and when people are at home the us government printed a lot of money there has also been supply chain shortages as a result of that there's also been some of the energy challenges that we're facing as a result of the war in ukraine and so there's a lot of different factors at play but bottom line is there's inflation in the system the fed has a mandate to deal with that inflation one of the policy tools that they have at their disposal is raising you know interest rates and they're raising those rates and i think that's probably you know i'm not a macroeconomic expert but i pay a lot of attention to this stuff as an investor with capital at risk and it's hard to ignore that environment and what happens effectively when they're raising rates is borrowing money becomes more expensive and as a result liquidity starts to tighten and so fewer people are borrowing money fewer you know there's not as much money to be lent out as a result of that and there's just less money sloshing around and so people start to pull back on that risk curve if you will and crypto i think the reality is it's still at one of the farthest ends of that risk curve and there are different assets within crypto that are even at farther ends of that risk curve the crypto's far out there stocks are out there as well and stocks are also taking a a beating as as a result but that shedding of risk is natural it's part of an economic cycle which a lot of people who maybe have not been in financial markets for that long look we used to do this like every eight to ten years the fed has can extend that cycle sometimes but there is a natural credit cycle where basically they keep rates low for a while people take on irresponsible kinds of debt and you know you start to see some of this risky economic activity happen and so rates get raised and it tries it kind of calls it back and i think we stave that off with some of the coveted stimulus because we didn't want to induce a recession or or economic pullback at that point so we staved it off but now we've got to kind of pay our due so this is just the reality that we have to deal with this the environment that crypto exists in now and i don't know exactly what it means but i do think for a time at least there's just going to be less appetite for risk and i think that's okay i think crypto will survive that to be honest i think a lot of overledge leveraged participants are going to get blown out they need to get blown out they took on too much risk they're invested in stuff that doesn't have value once that board is clear we're going to be set up to kind of continue the ascent of crypto my point of view yeah i think like one of the more important things is crypto people are just spoiled by their gains at this point i mean i think from the the bottom the covered bottom of nasdaq we're up they're up 2x and e sub what 15x even at prices right now so we we just kind of get like we're almost like leverage stocks right so i completely agree with you dc like you start to think of crypto as a risk on asset so if if we are entering a recession high rate era which i i do think the fed now is going to push rates up high enough to call inflation and push us into a recession um you know how bad that recession is how fast they go back to lowering rates i'm not really sure um but you know crypto is a risk on asset it will get hurt in that snare right now at some point i still believe that crypto you're never going to be a totally like 100 diversified asset right everything every market is going to kind of move together because to your point people are pulling money out you know things aren't great in the economy of course they're going to solve crypto i do think we could start to once again de-correlate so like for the first four or five years of bitcoin and eth we weren't that correlated to the stock market if you look at the correlations you know generally if you really zoom out it kind of goes the same but we weren't too tight recently it's like almost a one-to-one correlation might you know if you take out like the the extreme moves um and crypto started to go down more recently i i think we're going to start to decorate a little bit more as things start to calm down um you know there's really no predicting this stuff per se but i mean i think one thing i've realized recently is people once you get into like these bear markets people act like the worst is ahead of you when in reality the worst is probably behind you so most alts are down like 92 to 95 percent east down is 75 bitcoins down pretty much the same the nasdaq is down i think 38 from peak which is a a lot for a major stock index i think once you start to that's not to say it can't get worse but most likely the worst is behind us maybe we enter a little bit of a recession inflation comes down like housing gets hit a little bit is this is the nasdaq gonna crash 60 70 percent from top i i don't know i kind of doubt it at what you know i think one of the conversations people should be having in this bear market is where are people putting cash i mean the u.s dollar is gaining but inflation's still eight ten percent a year stocks are down crypto's down housing's maybe a little bit down from the top eventually people get antsy and need to invest in something i i don't know it's it's a hard thing to but at some point you can't just go down forever in every market there's a conversation that's going around uh about the merge versus macro and which one is more powerful eric do you have an opinion on which one is more powerful merge versus macro emerge no doubt about it so i think one thing people totally get wrong with crypto and if you've been around a while you get it it's things are not priced in they're just not i mean we we saw that i think with e2 phase zero we saw that with eip1559 and people not just like price necessarily but narrative people don't think these things are going to happen until they go in and i i think people will be shocked pun intended because the supply shocks would be way different um at how much i know this is a bear market podcast i sound bullish which is funny because on the bull market podcasts sound bearish so who knows um but i don't think people really wait but isn't that appropriate though because if we're in a bear market and like you said if there's a decent chance that most of of the bearishness the bear expressiveness has been expressed and so i think there's a case we made that like if prices are down 90 that's when you get bullish because that's just rational yeah exactly this is when you should start getting bullish and to me i mean one five five nine plus the merge as far it makes east one of the most unique assets on the entire planet i mean you you have a secure blockchain paying validators at a very low net issuance rate and you're taking 1559 which is burning fees out i mean look what i just said to most people is word salad but again like this is going to take a while for people to realize and i think once you know mev's life or stickers transaction fees are like for stakers we shoot up to whatever 10 15 percent for a little bit and people are like hey if i stick my eighth i have this um you know it's gonna come down as people flood in and whatnot but it's just i think the merge is bullish what's i was a little disappointed seeing bloomberg today put out an article where it's like east about to you know reduce its environmental impact by 99.9 but miners are going to be put out of a job like that just proves to me how far away we are from the narrative we all know is going to come but that just makes me bullish man i'm not going to lie like people just don't quite understand yet what we're building here yeah and my take on it is it's hard not to be bullish about the merge especially over an intermediate time frame i mean i'm super bullish by the fundamentals that this is going to bring because i think the narrative i just suspect in the next cycle is that eth is going to become this financialized asset that becomes attractive as an asset to hold to a lot of other participants and it generates this income based on demand for its block space on top of that all the things that eric talked about from the supply shock and the reduced amount that was going to be sold that because miners are out of the picture in and basically the reward that's paid to stakers can be a lot lower than what is paid to minors so there's a lot of virtue there as far as where it fits within the macro cycle i'm gonna stay a little bit more neutral on that and i'll say eric i'm definitely with you on the long term and the midterm in the in the immediate term if macro i just don't know what's going to happen in the macro picture right i think that if macro really tanks let's just say in the back half of this year maybe we are past the worst like like eric said but if we aren't i think it's going to be hard for crypto necessarily to catch a bid and these fundamentals will get buried for a time okay i say for a time because this is one of those things it's going to be like yeah p1559 or even like the bitcoin havings in terms of the supply shock that comes even if you don't see the effect immediately it's gonna be this fundamental that whenever the cycle shifts which we all know it will shift eventually it is going to be like fireworks so i'm really excited about switching to proof-of-stake not just for that reason but for a lot of other reasons and i don't think the market has properly assessed that it is going to happen we all know what's going to happen because we're like super immersed in this stuff i mean it's just like eric david remember when nobody believed dip 155.9 what happened i mean like the people just don't want to or that beacon chain would launch and by the way the launch of beacon chain was probably the hardest part of the launch of eth2 because that was the launch of the bonded validator network so the money is already staked to secure eth2 and a lot of it i mean that was a huge accomplishment and i think i think if you ask most eth2 developers they'd say that was probably the hardest part of what they had to do yeah the my mental model for the merge it's like a tide that doesn't stop rising so yeah like tides they oscillate in and out and so yeah macro could get worse and maybe maybe it gets really bad but like the tide still comes at the end of the day like it's a tie that always catches up it's like a zombie it's always it's always on your heels it's always catching up to you you always got to be on the run um that was a weird analogy uh and so as we wrap up here i just want to pick your guys's brains as like some advice for newcomers uh so there's a lot of people came into crypto and one thing i am bullish on in this particular bear market is that the crypto industry actually retains people much better than it did in all previous bear markets like we have more things to do we have better content and better education i will say uh and we have just more just camaraderie and community in the in this space and so for a lot of newcomers who got perhaps disillusioned by the how fast some of these things would come and how this future uh isn't actually here in 2022 or 2023 but it's actually going to take us you know 2026 78 and beyond to really get to the vision that we had in the bull market what advice do you have for these recyclers for the newcomers that are down bad eric what advice can you give them to make them feel a little bit better so i'll just be blunt and honest first and foremost don't expect gains that people got by being in early so don't expect that in a year or two years you're going to gain 2000 x like 300 000 x whatever it just it's not gonna happen again like as the market cash gets bigger and bigger you know it's not it's almost impossible right like you we're at a trillion dollar market or whatever you're not gonna get another 2000 x on top of that overnight so um i would say first and foremost like reeling your expectations um if you're here and you're invested and you believe in things i think that's what matters most so don't be here if you're just like you your neighbor told you to buy crypto and you think it's gonna go up right like find something that you believe in i don't care if it's buying your favorite nft like because nfts are cool and i think ethereum offers a lot to art um maybe you think the merge is cool like find something in this community that you actually believe in because i think even when you have a big downturn you actually believe in the technology i know that's a meme but it's like it's actually true like you're gonna you know hold on i think if that goes down and i i think the biggest and i think one of the worst things we are as a community not very good at when stuff's going well or bad is on the way up take a little profit on the way down by a little bit like you don't need to always be a hundred percent you you can take take 50 profit on the way up at some point and you're probably gonna be okay like when people are super greedy sell a little when people are super fearful sell it all and stake the rest of it and keep it forever right like it doesn't need to be an all or nothing endeavor and i think that's the number one thing people don't quite get it's like oh i have to be 100 either not it's not true you can be a little bit cash and eat and on both ways you know so i think that's the best advice i can possibly give and i think what you're perhaps saying as well is that it might also be the uh profit maximalist maximalist approach to that strategy where like a lot of people they come in late and everyone comes into crypto and they think they're late it's like part of this industry it's just like the rite of passage you come in and you feel fomo and so what do you do to answer that fomo you maximally expose yourself you put every last dime into your your bullish crypto asset but i think what you're saying is that if you go in like 75 percent in but keep 25 in cash i don't know pick your balance that actually ends up being like the profit maximus approach uh because that 25 cash allows you to buy the dips if they happen uh and then that also that commitment to not being 100 exposed makes hitting that sell button easier perhaps when you should be hitting that sell button uh and so if i'm interpreting this correctly committing to a non 100 crypto exposed position is a is perhaps a way to keep your head on your shoulders and be rational and actually perhaps make more money in the long term in that in that in that uh with that strategy would you say that's a correct type eric yeah absolutely no i think that's a good summary and you know david you and i talked about on the podcast we did um you know just the one-on-one thing we talked about it's like don't don't go all in don't etherium sucks you in from not only an investment perspective but a mental job friends people you just now like art everything just sucks you in don't get that sucked in i mean i know a lot of us live and breathe this stuff but like keep some buns on the side to buy dips and when everyone's freaking out and saying we're going to 100k sell a little bit it doesn't matter if you sold you know 40 below top or whatever at least you kind of set stuff aside and also say like take a mental break i know a lot of people listening to this probably are just 100 percent all in constantly on crypto step away from a little bit um unsubscribe from breakfast for a few months and um you know get on twitter i don't think david will don't do that whatever yeah but just definitely resubscribe when you come back but no all kidding aside just like take a breath sell a little bit rebuy at the bottom resubscribe all that stuff you said uh it's okay if you sell the top like 40 below the top forty percent below the top is two thousand nine hundred dollars right now for ether price and so if you had sold at those numbers you'd be feeling pretty good right now so it's okay to miss by forty percent uh especially when these cycles are so rampant uh dc what thoughts have come to mind i mean just my experience being in a variety of financial markets over my life um the more you feel like you need the market to do something for you the more likely it is to do the exact opposite and i hate to put it that way but that's just true and i think this goes back to eric's point which is really about risk management and i see way too many people with this mindset of being all in or all out and i would never be all in or all out in crypto and even in in my later zoo zero conversation with you david i talked about how i had my risk hedge through other assets that i had accumulated over the course of my life and i wasn't just going digen long all in i put a lot of money in but i also did it at a time when valuations were low and so i think you've got to first and foremost position yourself to survive and to be able to stay in the game and i think what you see on twitter and different forms of social media is you see products of survivorship bias these are all people who kind of followed some of that advice you don't see the hundreds or thousands of people who wash themselves out who leveraged at the wrong time who took on too much risk and they lost everything so you've got to manage that risk you've got to manage your expectations too and i think part of that is understanding where we are in this technology development arc and i think you see a lot of comparisons flawed comparisons in my point of view to like um like silicon valley type products and and that sort of thing because they're centrally developed and they can iterate very quickly look we are developing decentralized networks here at least the the real products in my point of view like ethereum bitcoin and some others and you can't move these things at light speed it takes time to iterate and especially in the case of ethereum you have to reach social consensus there are multiple clients that have to get on board and that's why everyone's like why is it taking so long ethereum will never upgrade to proof of stake it's like look this isn't as simple as adding a new feature to gmail or even adding a new feature to solana or some other blockchain which is more centralized ethereum's process is a lot more different but that is also what gives it long-term value and so i think i think if you want to be patient you should go back and you want to learn how to be patient about this study the history of the consumer internet and how that evolved and there were a lot of periods where it was just kind of stagnant and then we'd have a new iteration and we would make a quantum leap as a result of that and all of a sudden we had new functionality that we're playing with i think for this upcoming market cycle that's going to be probably layer twos on ethereum and some other things that i can't foresee right now it's gonna unlock new potential for what this technology can do and i think fundamentally you've got to learn about the technology and what different differentiates some of these chains in my point of view and you've got to really ask yourself where is that unique value that's going to survive across cycles are you invested in the next name coin or you invested in the next ethereum is there going to be a next ethereum you know i mean i think you've got to really have some of those honest conversations with yourself and you've got to manage your position appropriately this goes back to what eric said at the beginning i mean whenever anyone new comes to me it's like what should i buy them like buy some ethereum and and maybe some bitcoin and then just spend time learning about the space and make sure that those are the core of your portfolio if you want to take swing bets on other stuff fine but you've got to learn how it actually works i think i think my final point of advice is stay engaged through the bear i mean respecting eric's advice to kind of be bored or or to take a break a mental health break i think that's very valuable but also don't check out okay because you will miss the next unit swap you'll miss the next d5 you'll miss the next nfts the people who did really well in those markets were all of them were very involved through the entire bear if you think you can just show back up in two years and and tap into all that i think it's going to be pretty difficult certainly yeah the people that got the uniswap airdrop were here before the token obviously that's how it works uh and so like the growing your footprint during the bear market and just growing your skills uh like no one knowing just exactly what you were saying dc no one knew there was going to be d5 that was going to take off and no one knew that it was going to be nfts but the people that did figure it out figured and figured it out first were waiting and paying patiently were waiting around in the bear market because they knew something would come they didn't know what but they were the ones that hurt it first because that's what they do in the bear market they just stick around and hang on to it and then my i think one last comment i want to add with uh on eric's comment about leverage um like people think that these markets are rational like i had a cursory glance like oh yeah like we can do some dcf flows and and blah blah blah and like they're not even close to doing that in crypto land uh but even in in stock markets like people think that these things are based off of numbers and to some degree they are but they're mostly based off of emotions uh and especially the crypto markets because crypto markets are so hard to evaluate like how the hell do you evaluate bitcoin like 21 million heart crap how do you how do you evaluate that you evaluate it with your gut like you just how do you feel about it and therefore like when you're on leverage these markets when they call it a depression because people are literally depressed or they call it the euphoric part of the market cycle because people are literally euphoric so if you're on leverage and you're also like going crazy that's why it's because like you're experiencing like you're not just leveraged up on your financial assets you're leveraging up on your emotions too uh and so like it's it's there's no way that you can keep yourself sane in these market cycles while you're also leveraged you'll literally drive yourself crazy and you will lose all of your sleep and you won't learn to think like a normal human being who thinks like normal human beings think in multiple year long time frames like they have a plan for themselves and when you're on leverage like no one holds leverage for years that's ridiculous uh and so as you are playing in the markets understand that like your emotional gut responses are very strong a very strong guiding force that you can't really get away from because you know what's making you feel it is you and you're stuck with you and also the decisions that you make throughout these market cycles uh so that's my last comment i'll give you guys if you guys want uh any further comments to add on or anything else you want to close out with i'll just i'll echo two things dc said i'll my first and foremost opinion is survive in advance that's all that matters don't get blown up if you keep most of your crypto and advance you're gonna be here and you're gonna make money i promise you um and you know that i i just heart seeing people get like so blown out by influencers on twitter and stuff like on the ups and downs like just stick to your convictions you know stick to people that you trust um social media does play a crappy influence in all of this um i think people so i'll say go read devil take the hindmost like the crypto is not the first marketing god yeah i think david you've read it right um crypto is not the first market to capitalize on green and beer right so you know stick to something you're convicted with know that things are gonna go up and down and don't get taken by influencers and like hype or doubt like sure maybe they'll like convince you about a little bit but please do not take like over leverage at the top when these people are saying things and i think most people would like super cycle yeah yeah the next super cycle um please don't do that so all i would say is look just advance i've made stupid mistakes i've been around since 2013 i've been called on margin positions i've made stupid investments i've taken stupid token buys um but the end of the day i try to just keep a core east position not on leverage and look i'm here and i'm i'm doing fine so just try to do that and i think you'll survive yeah my final advice is don't so learn teach yourself not to fomo into stuff so like when the hype is at an all-time high take a step back let the market do what it needs to if the value is still real and it's still there you'll have an opportunity to enter and i think the flip side of that is look if you want to know how a lot of people in crypto really ended up making it they were involved in the bear market they bought during the bear when no one else wanted to buy i mean i know the three of us on this podcast right now were buying ether at ninety dollars hundred dollars during the last cycle most people could not get rid of it fast enough at that point okay and if we see another depression of that scale depression phase there could be an opportunity that presents like that um or even just dollar cut and also i think my okay my final final point is don't try to like time the bottom perfectly if you're trying to buy it like that it's much more effective just to dollar cost average after it's already sold off a lot and i'll tell you guys what i tell my friends and family right now look if you have cash and you're trying to if you have an income and you're trying to get exposure to this market now is a great time to start entering positions and yes it could decline a significant amount from here still however is it going to be lower than this point in five years i think probably not um i think it could be potentially much higher for in the right kinds of assets so you've really got to position yourself for the long game and you've really got to position yourself to be able to take care of take advantage of these opportunities while they exist yeah i think that i think that's a very important point don't try to time bottoms and tops like it's it's a fool's errand as long as you're within that range and like we're down 80 percent or whatever and like stuff looks bad starting the dollar cost averaging is probably not the worst idea right maybe you don't call it the exact pico bottom or pico top but you know you're probably doing yourself a service by you know i i totally echo your sentiment here by you know buying in now or somewhere between here and zero and then selling all the way up between 10k and infinity amazing guys well i feel very relaxed after listening to you guys and i hope the listeners have gleaned some perspective and are able to uh just calm down a little bit while the markets are very very chaotic so eric dc thank you for sharing some of your wisdom
