this is a movie that's a vertical jail and every jail is just one room and there's a hole in the center of the room the jail is leveled like floor one floor two floor three four four like going down once a day when this platform with a bunch of food on it descends down the jail if you're in like floors one through fifty it's a good spot to be you're gonna have plenty of food 50 to 100 there's like food there but that's kind of the food below 100 it starts to get real scarce and this is a metaphor for intermediaries there's flow of value you can see like there's cakes and Delicacies it's like a comment on society and luxury and all luxuries at the top but then the luxury doesn't make it to the bottom because intermediate areas eat it up along the way
