[Music] what up coordination today on the pod we got adam stallard from bright id which is a tool that creates civil resistance in web 3. basically weeding out sock puppet accounts so that you can build more one human one vote type systems the way brett id works is off of a data science methodology called web of trust so basically allowing you to verify with your peers that they're actual humans and they've got this whole big beautiful web of trust that creates more civil resistance in the ecosystem git coin uses it for civil resistance with bitcoin grants and it's just a real delight to talk to adam because boy bitcoin integrated with them in like bitcoin grants around six and that was two years ago and they have grown a lot as a technology platform have become a dow have been more sophisticated in their civil resistance and so is bitcoin so we're kind of like sister projects in that way and i am just really excited to have adam on the show to talk about simple resistance and how that contributes to a more regenerative society society with more high resolution democracy with more civil resistance and is more pluralistic so this episode was a lot of fun adam is super thoughtful and is really taking this problem of civil resistance seriously and that's what we go deep in on on this episode so without further ado i give you adam stallard of bread id enjoy

ios apps and on desktop too hey adam how's it going going really well thanks yeah same i am really excited to talk to you about civil resistance and bright id so let's tee off with a super broad question why does civil resistance matter and uh what is bread id yeah thanks so the reason civil resistance matters is um a lot of times when we try to give away something of value to people there's a very small tiny subset of people that are just kind of like waiting in the works for to to jump on that and um just exploit the system and take more than their fair share so we need to stop those people and that's that's known as a civil attack when someone comes with multiple accounts hoping to exploit a system and that's what we need to stop and that's exactly like the tiny little thing that bright id tries to do really well is to stop this with attacks so it's basically like i put out a a bowl of jelly beans and i say one jelly bean per person and there's going to be that one guy that is going in and taking a whole fistful of jelly beans and braid id is a little piece of software that kind of like gates it and says okay prove your identity and um then you can have a jelly bean is is that kind of like a a good uh parallel like real world parallel to the digital thing that the red id does yeah that's a great analogy and that actually that analogy works on other levels too because it's like if if you're there babysitting that bowl of jelly beans the problem's really easy you just everybody you're like here's your jelly bean here's your like when you try to automate things which in the case of the jelly beans is like okay i don't want to have to expend the manpower to have someone manning this jelly bean bowl the whole time i'm just going to leave it here with a little note please take one unfortunately we found that that little note that says please take one doesn't work um because there's always that person that just comes and takes the whole bowl so we need uh we need something that works with an automated system so it's in in the real world in real life when we've got real people um it's really easy to tell uh that that a person is just a person but as soon as you move into the digital realm and things become automated and you're trying to run things with with computer programs rather than um like every interaction require a human being then you need something like bright id right and i also say i know a requirement of right id is that we're not trying to build a panopticon so you know if i had to like upload my passport uh that has my national id on it and my date of birth and my address on it into some system in order to get those jelly beans then that's a different requirement than a privacy preserving civil resistance tool yeah that's exactly right so there's a couple of problems with using something like a national id one is like you said that there's just way too much data attached to it and you don't need to share all that data you just need to know that that person is a unique person you just need to answer that one simple question and then the other problem is that the creator and the guardian of that is this government agency that we don't get to um supervise we don't get to i mean we supervise it from like a great distance um we don't get to know what's going on so there could be some worker named bob inside that agency who's who figures out like hey um national ids are now used for acquiring jelly beans i'm just going to go over to my office here and and print up ten thousand ids so i can have ten thousand jelly beans we don't know that that that there's any mechanism within those agencies to stop something like that so it's better if we have a solution where everybody can audit each other and and make sure that the people who are authorizing the verifications um are are under control of of other people that are auditing verification so it's kind of like this you you watch me i watch you we all watch each other type of thing yeah totally and just to illustrate the nation state thing i i think in one of italics posts about uh identity he kind of talks about the range of actors that you can protect against and there's a range from like petty criminals to uh the mob organized crime and then there's even nation state criminal systems depending on what your international rule of law is so nation states are not created equal in terms of their legitimacy and i think that's a core point when you like are just ruling out the that as a mechanism for creating that so i think now that we've talked about what bright id isn't i'd love to talk about what bright id is and how it provides that civil resistance that stock puppet resistance to distribute distribution of digital jelly beans right cool so um so what we we boil things down to um the idea that uh the the gatekeepers of of jelly beans or other digital goods where it's one per person should be the people that know you best because they're the ones that are in the best position to know that this is your one and only you your one and only a account that's that's that's approaching this this good that you want um and really all the other systems in the in the history so if we go before digital systems and look at at other um systems that were used to give out benefits of certain kinds over the history of humanity um it's all they've always been around some sort of um social trust where either it's you know the this the simple example where you've got a tribe of people where everybody knows each other that's an easy one to solve it's like well we know bob is one person because we know the whole tribe and there's this is bob and so that's that's the easiest one to solve and then once you start to grow into the size of cities and and uh and and other um larger groups then what's kind of happened in the past is you have you you will assign people those roles like we'll assign create a government that's in charge of um issuing ids or will create um a system of notaries where they can sign and vouch for people and so um so that that's worked pretty well over the years but it hasn't transitioned well into the digital world and that's the biggest problem and that's what we need to solve and so i don't think i actually at the beginning when i was trying to solve this problem i thought well what if what if we brought um national ids into into it would that work and then i realized well even if you start to do that then you you get this because the internet is everybody you get this weird you get this weird other problem which i can't work on which is the problem of how do you federate this this type of control how do you how do you get the nation states to work together or how do you get everyone to accept every type of id and that problem really wasn't interesting to me and i didn't even think that that was something i could solve so instead i thought well what if we go backwards and look at um kind of other types of social relationships that we have and see if we can't leverage those and do it in a way that it would work even if there was no nation state or even if you're one of the uh many people millions of people in the world who is um uh what's the term basically like denationalized you you don't have any any citizenship anywhere we want we want something that could work for those people as well so um i think if you look at uh the way nation states approach it often they'll be birth registration so they start they'll say okay this is an event where we can track that a new person came into being and we uh so we'll go here and we'll trust the hospital to vouch for this person and then the parents and they'll all sign this document together that said that this is a new person and then from there we can create a new um identifier for this person we'll give them a social security card and then and then they're good to go and that works pretty well until it comes time to bring it on to the internet and then uh i think many of us are familiar with how horribly things have gone wrong when social security numbers have gotten onto the internet um all the data breaches that have happened etc how hard it is to actually replace the social security card so with bread id what we want to do is we say okay it's the people that know you best that get to vouch for you so um yeah the mom and dad that were there at your birth registration could also be the people that vouch for you and get you verified in bright id it's just uh a different setting that works natively well with um with the internet because uh your mom and dad can cryptographically sign the fact that you're a person and um and then other people can sign that as well to give it even more validity so that your mom and dad aren't just inventing fake kids to game the system or something and and then from there you you get verified and the nice thing about using cryptography is then when you take that unique identifier into different realms you don't carry all this baggage with you like all this other personal data that isn't actually necessary to just answer that one question of are you a unique person and also uh let's see what was it going to say about um yeah privacy um if uh so the nice thing about using cryptography is when i when you bring that into another realm um you you can kind of abstract away that that original identifier so you you can say okay here was your bright id which we can kind of relate that to a social security number here's your bright id but we're not actually going to use your bright id we're going to use something else we're going to use another unique identifier and then we're going to allow you to link that to your bright id in a way that the the application that's getting this uniqueness verification never actually sees your your bright id so that if there is a data breach that it's not something like oh i've got to go get a new social security number now it's like no yeah you just nothing got leaked to them so yeah that's one of the things that's never really made sense to me knowing about public private key cryptography why my social security number is my private key and my public key and um it seems like you know y'all since you're using 21st century technology have managed to get around the database data breach problem yeah definitely yeah i mean social security numbers are really old they're from like 30s or something and and uh public key cryptography came out in the 70s so it i guess they're just really hard to adopt it yeah well uh so so tell me the the use case for bright idea i think i download an iphone app and then uh it gives me a qr code and you and i will uh i'll say hey scan me and verify that i'm a i'm a person and um and and and then basically once i have a certain number of verifications then i have some sort of trust level and then there's there's kind of a web of trust is what you're building on the back end there is that is that more or less right that's right so um what what i would do this is the since we're on video is this video being captured for the podcast by the way so we're going to have about half audio listeners and half video ones but we can just speak to what we're doing for so the audio people can can hear it okay sounds good so i can i just opened up my bright id app and there's something that says well let me back up so if i say my code if i click on code i get to show you a code this works over video i can hold this up and then if you get your phone that has bread id on it you open up the bread id app and you click scan a code and you scan this um and if you happen to have it we could even do it right now if you happen to have your mobile phone if not that's fine i can just talk through what it's like so you scanned it and then i will pop up on your screen you'll pop up on my screen the interesting thing about this yeah you got it okay let me turn off the blur on my camera actually well just scan me because you don't need to be on blur you just need to scan me yeah um that needs to be unblurry i'm doing that i just wanted i wanted to show my my phone after what i see when i scan you yeah um okay here we go we have the technology all right so i just scanned you and i have this little screen that that has your information on it and it looks like i can mark you as suspicious uh or already known or just met so i'm gonna put already known since you and i have known each other for a couple years and now you're my uh it looks like you're waiting to confirm my connection yeah that's me milwaukee um and so yeah so i see that we have no mutual connections which is possible um already known i didn't interrupt you i i have a new phone and and that's why okay you're starting over this is good yeah you'll soon be you'll soon have some bright id verifications now that we've made that connection so that's good so that and um that information that we got very importantly that's just shared peer-to-peer between you and me okay so there's no server anywhere that stores this information there's no facebook-esque type thing that's like collecting all this data that was just between you and me so if i know you you know let's say that the two of us have nicknames for each other and that's how we know each other and maybe we maybe we have like weird pictures that we like to use as our avatars or whatever that's all of that is totally fine um there's no requirement other than that the other person should be able to recognize who who they're connecting with right and that's another thing that people ask about bright id is is this going to out me in some way if i get bright id verified um and the answer is no it's not um number one because when you're making that connection you're just sharing with the person that you connect with um there it's not always possible at this point to find someone that you already know that is going to help you get bright id verified unfortunately so we have these connection parties so you will have to make a connection to someone that you don't already know and like share your name and photo in your face with them so that that part but that's not that's not the same as like outing yourself on a public registry or something like that or uploading your data to a server um but you know if you're lucky enough to already know someone who's in bright id you're not sharing any data with anyone that doesn't already know that data and you can still become bright id verified and then it goes one step further because once you start connecting with apps they don't know anything about you like all the apps get is that little stamp of uniqueness that says that this is a this is a verified bright id user you don't know which one we're not even going to give you the bread id identifier we're going to give you this other identifier such as an ethereum address or something like that and that's all you get to know and it's not linked to anything else yeah beautiful um i i in speaking of apps connecting i have empirical experience of this because bitcoin uh derives civil resistance for bitcoin grants using bright id so uh there we go you're so uh for the audio listeners adam's just showing off his get coin integration on his phone so um bitcoin grants relies on quadratic funding which relies on civil resistance and we derive civil resistance on bitcoin grants uh via brett id i think the numbers were something like 30 percent of contributors are read id verified or something like that i have to look at the analytics again but um yeah it's it's been really great uh mutually beneficial because uh bitcoin gets civil resistance from bread id and i think that we sent a good set of users over to bright id to bootstrap your network so it's been very mutually beneficial we love that yeah because it's kind of this chicken and egg problem you need to get ready verified you need to have other people that are bright id verified and um and then you also need some compelling app some reason to get ready verified so yeah any large community like git coin that sends their their community over to bright id helps with the whole bootstrapping thing because then the next app if you already got verified for a git coin it's going to be super easy to get verified for the you know i mean you don't have to do anything you just have to link the next app you're already verified plus all of your friends will have uh that much easier of a time of of getting verified with brad id they'll already know someone that's verified in brand ads so i want to share my screen and show something that i just think is the coolest thing in the world if i go to exploredubrightid.org i can actually see a graph of all of the different uh these look like dots on my screen but they're all deeply connected to each other and i think that this data model that we're looking at here adam is called a web of trust tell me if i'm wrong but basically you've got a directed graph where people can say oh i know each other actually maybe uh maybe not directed but uh like a graph in that that truss graph is like basically the data model that allows you to have certainty about different parts of the graph and whether or not they're a civil attacker or not so did i get that mostly right yeah you got that right so it is a directed graph and the reason is because um our our connection with each other doesn't have to be symmetric it can be asymmetric you can say you could say i just met you and i could say i already know you um i'd have different opinions on that so it is actually directed and um the cool thing about explorer and by the way if you want to access explorer for those who have never tried it um you can there's a way to copy your explorer code it's on the left hamburger menu on bright id you'll get your core code and there's also a password that you can find under your profile if you hit edit profile you can see your password and so you can use your password and your explorer code to open up explore.brightid.org and the cool thing about it is it'll show you your view including all the people that you know so we probably don't want to share that on this um on this recording right now because we don't want to we don't want to out anyone right but uh yeah you can see your whole neighborhood so for me because i have like 600 connections i can see my whole my whole neighborhood of 600 connections and and i can see how they're connected to each other and and all the other anonymous dots that they're connected to so it's kind of fun to view the graph that way beautiful are there any other sort of goodies that are worth showing off in the bright id analytics or labs ecosystem i know that you all are always building new tools to understand the graph yeah so i can't really show it off um because there's there's just uh it's it's in public beta and or not actually it's enclosed beta right now but there's a new tool called aura um uh there's there's a post a forum post on it and there's also a discord where uh like so if you're really interested in this sounds like something that you want to try out um there are there are ways to get in into the closed beta to get an invite um but what it is is it's a it's a power toolbox for civil hunters and um so we want to extend this to not just bright id but git coin and proof of humanity and any of the others um like um projects that are really working hard on um on civil resistance but we're starting out scratching our own itch what we've realized is in the years of working on bright id is that almost all bright id users are just there to get verified which is totally fine that totally makes sense they they they found out that that their app that they want to use requires bright id and they say okay just tell me the steps what do i need to do i just want to get find the quickest route from a to b and i want to get verified and that's and that's going to be their interaction with bright id pretty much and that's fine but then there's about one percent of users that go beyond that after they've been bright id verified they either want to go help their friends get bright id verified or they they realize hey this this is kind of a cool concept like what else can be done with this um and so they exp they explore deeper and that's what the aura toolbox is for um it's a way to go beyond and maybe i can um maybe i can share my screen i wasn't really prepared for this but let me let me see if i can pull it up and and share my screen but aura um is a way to let me see if i'm already logged in here yeah i am um there's not a whole lot to show right now but i'll share it anyway let me get back to zoom okay so i'm gonna share where was i aura there we go okay so aura um in aura i can i can rate people so in bright id you can you can just it's very simple what you can say you can you can label someone as just met already known or suspicious and suspicious would be like i don't know where this connection came from i wasn't expecting it something like that but in here you can go beyond that and you can um you can start to rate uh people um in your in your little group so like i could go to my good friend phillip and i can i can do a much more detailed rating of him so i can give him an honesty rating and what i'm doing there is uh so this is beyond how well i know him this is like my estimation of of how likely he is to be an honest user versus an attacker and there's different uh like research tools that i can use to to assess that um and then once i've done that there i can go beyond that if he's an aura if he's also an aura user i can give him energy so there's these little energy sliders and i can give him some of my energy and energy is something that is it's a concept in aura it's a concept for bright id power users it doesn't exist for the normal 99 of bright id users they 99 of bright id users are not going to have energy but what energy means is it's your ability to help other people to get verified um so the aura game is saying um i want to be someone who goes beyond just kind of like a consumer of bright id i want to be a helper that helps other people get verified i also want to help police the system and detect civil attacks so in our early days of bright id we we played with the bright id graph and we had algorithms that said well if i know you and you know someone else then there's kind of like this my vouching kind of flows a little bit and if i and so if i'm vouching for you some of that flows over for you vouching for someone else and is this kind of like edge rank like yeah so we need an algorithm a drink and and so we use something called civil rank to do that but what we realized is that that um that relationship is not really transitive that relationship if i know you and you know bob that doesn't mean that i know bob um so that doesn't exactly work the way that we wanted but uh if in this aura construction it does work the way we want because what i'm saying is um i know you and i think that you're a going to be a good aura player that's that's my rating of you that's my energy that's what energy means i think you're going to be a good or a player or i think you are a good or a player and that is transitive because if i say you're a good or a player that includes you saying that other people are being good aura players and being accurate you being accurate about that assessment so it actually is transitive so you get this smaller graph it's also more manageable for these algorithms if it's a smaller graph so you have this smaller graph of this one percent of bright id users that are the power users kind of rating each other on how how honest they are and um and and not just how honest they are but how good of a job they're going to do playing the aura game because you could be totally honest but just be like a terrible or a player but be a perfectly honest player so it's kind of that energy kind of combines those two um so they're all rating each other on on how good of an aura player they're going to be that energy gets spread around and then the final hop of this graph so the very outer edge of the graph is the other 99 of bright id users and all they need to do to get aura verified is connect is no one or a player and connect to that one or a player if you if you can find more that's even better for you it increases your chances and your verification score but you just got to find one so the steps are simple if if you're not an aura player you just find another player connect to them they'll take care of everything for you they're kind of like your guardian or your whatever your your introduction into becoming bright id verified they'll say okay i i've got your back i'll take it from here they do their research they look at your account they see who you're connected to if there's some pieces missing or something that looks suspicious they can help you work that out and then uh and then they'll make sure that you get verified so anyways that's kind of what aura is and and then it like i said it becomes this toolbox um right now it's just it's very simple all we can do is like pass energy around and rate people's honesty and help them get verified but in the future what we want is we want tools that allow me to do deeper research on on people um like so we can see things like okay who else have they connected to um are is there are there connections missing that we that we expected them to have um can we uh a really interesting thing that i wrote a forum post about is um so let's say that i'm evaluating you to help you get aura verified you're not an aura player i'm but i'm doing the work for you let's say that i know you're um so i can obviously i've connected with you on bright id we have that connection so let's say that i know your um your twitter twitter handle which a lot of people know so i know that and i feed that into the system anonymously um using a cryptographic protocol called socialist millionaire protocol and then other people do the same and it can without revealing um which which bright id user i connected to that said that they that they were kevin owaki it can compare everybody else that that also uh thought they were connecting to kevin owaki and by comparing that anonymously comparing that twitter handle we can say wait a minute there's actually two people that people think are kevin owaki instead of just one if that kind of makes sense so like if you like let's say you connected to let's say you connected to philip but you connected philip with a different bright id um we can kind of we can detect that that anonym anomaly in the system without ever revealing anything so i don't have to reveal so let's say someone's someone's in there trying to fish for information they're trying to like figure out what your phone number is or what your what your twitter handle is we don't without even revealing what that is we can um we can say whether there's one kevin in the system or two kevin in the system and we and so we can quickly shut down these kind of small scale civil attacks where you you like try to get verified using different accounts with with different people um so yeah so or is going to have that bright id doesn't have that um that's kind of one of the weaknesses of bright id right now is you could do something like that you could say well okay i'm going to go connect to this group of friends over here get bright id verified now i'm going to take a different phone or make a new account go over to this group of friends and get verified um aura completely shuts that down i'm using the thing that i just said so beautiful seems like um you know uh basically what you what you've done is kind of decentralized in a way the network analysis role of the bright id system into this aura tool and you know like get coined out listeners that might not know this we have like a whole fraud defense like team uh bitcoin that's paid by the dow basically works for the dow and it's interesting to compare and contrast that like having an internal team that's doing the fraud analysis versus like a network graph based approach this kind of decentralizes it um and it just seems very elegant to me so it's come a long way actually since i haven't even i didn't even know about aura that's that's very cool yeah we think this is the future um just based on how we've seen users interact and um and and we hope that there's gonna be lots of aura players what we really want is this to be able to be a um a paying job for people that are really good at it i mean if you're an excellent civil hunter that could be your full-time job you could just be on the network be on different networks you could be on bread id get coin et cetera just like hunting symbols and that's your job so that's what we want immutable x is the layer 2 platform for crypto gaming immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9

know i'd love to talk for the users so if you go to the app store you download bright id you get verified you go to a connection party what can you do with it like i want to take this thing for a spin now that i've got bright id we've covered that you can contribute on git coin grants and that contributes to your trust bonus on git coin grants increasing your civil resistance what other are your favorite d apps once your bread id verified to get integrated with yeah so some of my favorite ones are um ones that uh give away something of value so i think it's pretty cool when an app um comes out and says like we're giving away tokens but or nfts or whatever the case may be or or tokens that allow you to help govern a dow but we're we're just going to limit the amount that we give per person rather than per address like we've seen done in the past um we're going to say that each person gets a certain number um so i love it when dao's do that song did that with their dao um launch um breit dao which is bright eddie's dad we did that with our launch um so i think that's really cool um and i want to show something that i think a lot of people don't know about because it's really new um so let me share my screen again but we launched something called unitapp and let me load that up so it's i think it's just unitapp.app so unitapp.app unitapp is a gas tap and soon to be a token tap and it's a way to collect tokens from different networks it's just small amounts just get you bootstrapped so we want to be able to bring in the next 10 million crypto users and we want them to actually be users not just crypto holders but crypto users to find things to do with their tokens whether it's participate in a dow or um just do any of the any of the cool apps that that any of the dapps that you can use but a lot of times the barrier is that um then the network requires gas and they don't know how to bring that over and so um we want to really streamline this by letting people easily add the network so we've seen things like chainlist.org that allow you to easily add the network to to metamask or whatever wallet you're using we also want to give people gas tokens so this is kind of like chain list plus a faucet um but as we've seen the past if you try to launch a faucet a lot of times they'll get gamed this is going back all the way to the first bitcoin faucet that gavin anderson launched where he was giving away uh 50 bitcoin to anyone that just showed up at the faucet um because he wanted more people to have bitcoin but he had to shut it down right away because for obvious reasons someone figured out how to script it and just come and claim more than their fair share so we use bright id to keep that and then uh so you can come in here you can get your little bits of little bits of um gas tokens but then the cool thing is we can go beyond that and eventually rather than just collecting gas tokens we want you to be able to collect other tokens that that are your gateway into other things like gateway into dow participation gateway into using an app um and and eventually we want um people and projects to be able to give out um kind of like micro ubis that if there's enough of them they add up to a real ubi um and so anyways we we hope that this that this becomes um something that a lot of apps use just to like bring more more people into their community without uh like inviting all the sybils in right so this is already live and right now it's just got like a couple of main nets and a bunch of test nets but yeah it's great man seems like a real triple win i mean it's more utility for the bright id network it allows these networks to uh distribute their tokens to people who want them legitimately and for the user they get tokens to spend on these networks so it seems like a real triple win yeah and um just to mention song song dao again they're they're going to use unitap um and i don't know if they're going to use um be using id chain or gnosis chain they'll use one of those um as kind of like the host for their for this new app um that they're using to rate all the different songs in songdo and uh to be able to vote to be able to participate um you need to stake a tiny little bit of the song token and go to unitapp and get a little bit of the song token so you so anyone can just come and start participating without having to buy anything you just kind of just smooth that plus you get the gas token for whatever network it's going to use so you can just kind of like stop in there get everything you need to start participating in the in the song ranking app so beautiful um and and and so uh i i guess i'd love to talk about braid id dao next but i'm wondering if there's anything i didn't ask about the bread ids or journey or utility before we get into the dao um no i think i think we've got uh yeah i think bright id is one of those things where it's like um there are you you'll discover cool apps that you can use um we haven't uploaded apps tabs so um you're welcome to anyone's welcome to go to the apps tab and just start clicking on these and see what they are um i think you'll find that a lot of them are mostly giving things away because like we said um it's uh yeah we're trying to protect against um we're trying to protect that jelly bean that jelly bean bowl so a lot of it is that but there's also things like learn to earn like rabbit hole where it's like okay you've got to take this quiz to prove that you um that you know the answers but then once you know the answers we don't want you coming back a thousand times and collecting it over and over and then there's um there's other things that are similar to um git coin where it has something to do with voting it's it's like your your uh your your voting power is is is in some way related to being a unique human so um brett it is useful for that so a lot of people who are not within the web 3 community are like well i don't need 10 cents worth of a token and i don't want to vote in these weird things that i don't understand but those of us that are like deep into into dows and stuff like this um i mean it's cool to discover so i i hope that actually i i hope that unitap becomes kind of a discovery engine for finding new uses for bright id i hope that dow tokens will start showing up there other cool project tokens will show show up there um so yeah if you're looking for more things to do with bright id definitely keep your eye on on unitap will do uh amazing so uh tell me about bread id dao so uh y'all have a doubt how what's what's that about how does it work uh what was the what was behind making it into a dow and um yeah how can people engage with with that layer of the of the project bright dao is um it's a gardens dao which is a a creation of of one hive um they created a type of dao which is um it's uh so it uses something called conviction voting um which basically says okay you you use the community token you vote on proposals right if you leave your token in a proposal then your voting power automatically grows which i find really interesting and the whole point of that is to remove the need for getting everybody's attention because that's that's one of the that's one of the hard parts of dao's um is like you have to reach quorum and or you should be trying to reach quorum and that can be tricky sometimes and and so the um gardens dow is different it says well the amount of attention that you need on a vote should be proportional to how much money that was requesting so if it's uh if it's um you know a small proposal that doesn't need a lot of money then then maybe only five percent of the of the users need to vote for it and and um and so uh allowing people to uh so you kind of if there's a lot of competing proposals you kind of have to choose which ones you want but but other than that it's like um your your your vote grows over time and not everybody has to vote and you can kind of like it's almost like as long as no one objects to what you're doing it's like you can just come in and take money for something that's bright id related that you're building so that's what we encourage people to do is just to come up with their own ideas of what they want then go to breitdow and collect the tokens that they need to fund it and um and we have some guidelines on how to how to create a proposal in forum.brightid.org um but yeah uh i think it's dow.brideid.org we'll take you right to our garden style we gave away um some bright tokens at the beginning as part of our bright um fair drop is what we called it and then uh so a lot of git coin users got those i think that was our biggest single airdrop recipient was bitcoin participants and it wasn't it wasn't for people that donated to bright ideas for people that used bitcoin and donated to anything they got a share of um bright tokens and so you have bright tokens a lot i mean a lot of us a lot of our community friends have have bright tokens and they've probably never used them um so uh yeah i mean voting in proposals we you can come check out and see let's see what's up for a vote check out the forum see what people are talking about but yeah it's um it's a pretty open forum pretty open down right very cool so go to dialed.uprightid.org basically the tlr to get involved in that and you know uh as a project that's eating your vegetables around decentralization and privacy and uh like i just think that it makes total sense for bright id to become a dao uh one day and i'm realizing we integrated with each other bitcoin grants around six which was like two two and a half years ago uh and since then bitcoin has become a dow and bright id has become a doubt or it's gigan grants has become a dow um and so actually when i say we i gotta stop doing that because i'm just affiliating from get coin dial right now and the decentralization of of not relying on the founder anymore it's like a feature not a bug so uh it's just been cool to kind of like grow up together a little bit yeah so that the dow is an inch is an interesting evolution i didn't think we needed a dao but the community wanted one and it's kind of cool because it's it's like it wasn't my idea i didn't i i did some work towards helping it helping it along and um i'm happy to see that it launched and i'm happy to see that people are paying each other in bright token to do stuff related to bright id and i don't have to be the boss of everything and i'm sure you can relate to that it's nice to to have that yeah so i i mean our dow is not our dao is probably like one percent of the size of of of git coin dow but it's still cool to have a community down so yeah it's not it's not size it's the impact that you're having that yeah um well i guess i'd love to talk a little bit about like doubted out relationships which i feel like will be a you know it just seems obvious to me if you look at biomimicry you had single cellular life and then you had multicellular life that kind of evolved and um and i see that same thing with dowels where you've got this like kind of like primordial soup which these dowels have emerged and um gitcoin and braid id have been sort of friend owls for a little while and um uh you know we recently launched git coin dial recently launched bitcoin passport which is like the decentralized version of its trust bonus tool and you can use your brand id in that along with other couple other civil resistance tools um what is there anything that we can glean about future dow to dial relationships from uh from this like i could imagine that like our our fraud defense the get coined out fraud defense team could be using aura to give fraud defense back to bright id and vice versa the traversal of that data back and forth there's obviously a traversal of um information and ideas because we're socially connected and talking about civil resistant dials and then there's there's kind of like the data back and forth between the two systems but is there anything else to say about the dow to dial relationship there that we can extrapolate between between the two or um you know what do you think yeah um i think that there's gonna there there's are we're already seeing um the beginnings of inter dow trust where we say okay you are showing me a proof that you were an active member of of get coindao and so um you you can maybe you can start out with a a big reputation boost when you join breitdow or something like that um so that's that's i think that's an interesting um ways way for daos to work together i mean we're also seeing um kind of the beginnings of dao's being able to uh kind of vote with each other so you could you could do something like where you could say okay you can vote with bright tokens or you could vote with with um git coin tokens um to make the decision um so that's that's interesting um another thing that i think is is uh that we can do with bright id to help daos um is we can we can avoid uh we can help to avoid kind of dow attention overload and dow apathy uh i think that's one of the things um that we noticed at least with our launch of breitdow is we tried to cast a wide net when we were giving out our governance token and just we i mean we gave a bunch to anyone who could just show that they were a unique person because we thought okay at least some of that's going to stick at least some of those people are going to stay around and that was true and and it worked out but the majority of those people are just like oh what's this free money okay and uh sell and and that you know that's kind of just what happens but it would be better if you could get you you could kind of without giving away to you could find a cheaper way to settle in on on on who your core people are going to be so um going back to unitec which i showed earlier one of the things that we want to do is once that list starts to become long of all the tokens you can collect we want to limit people um limit unique people to let's say five tokens so let's say that we have a category there that says dow governance tokens you can get some free dow governance tokens and here are the hundred dows that are offering some free governance tokens for their dow but you only get to pick three of them three from this list and so you ha you real it forces you to go through and um either pick the ones that are the most valuable but then over time that kind of that will kind of balance out so at some point it becomes which ones are you really interested in like you you don't want to get a token and then um just immediately sell it if you could instead get a token that you're actually going to keep and use it would be just more efficient for you to to pick the ones that you're actually going to use so we can um by doing that we can allow dows rather than just it i guess to be smarter about how they give away their their um governance tokens in like giveaway rounds and and actually attract users that are going to be using those tokens um so that's so that's one thing that we hope to do um and then like i said this uh it goes along with the passport where you can say here's my certification that says that i've been a good actor in this dow and maybe that carries some weight in this other dough and and hopefully we can use um i think that depop passport was was a cool um like i i i definitely see a future for that i think that that i i guess it started out as an experiment but i hope it stays around because i think it's really cool and i hope we can use it for that sort of thing to hold like dao certificate certifications um so i don't know what i mean maybe we should uh what's your vision for the for the depop like in just a few sentences so it's a d-pop for the uh for the listener stands for decentralized proof of personhood passport which we're now just calling get going passport because it okay it rolls off the tongue a little bit more um yeah i mean i think that um you know we just basically wanted to take the civil resistance on git coin and allow people to um consume it from across the ecosystem in their d-apps and uh we kind of look at ourselves as an aggregator of decentralized society credentials so basically this world in which there's all this different data out there um we can aggregate it into one passport which are like stamps and bright id is one of the stamps in that passport and then like give more civil resistance out to the ecosystem and like um you know i guess i look at like y'all as like this web of trust tool in us as like an aggregator and um i keep on saying us but i've just just affiliated from bitcoin now i gotta get out of the habit of that um but uh yeah so that's that's the idea with bitcoin passport and i'm just you know wondering how we can be good ecosystem partners to each other we don't have to have this conversation on the podcast by the way we can do it privately if you want but um but um you know i just want to make sure that we're good good partners to each other and also we're kind of like building towards the same vision of uh civil resistance together so like what is the world in which bright ideas maximally successful look like like paint me a picture of all the democratic dows that will be out there and like quadratic funding and quadratic voting that's civil resistance um you know like what's the world in which you all are maximally successful look like and and how can we be good supporters of that yeah so to me the um the maximally successful bright id world looks like we have the same uh level of security like still the the best level of security um can so so one one account per person that we that that it's good enough that we have tools like aura that ensure that it's good enough that you can support things like um a true ubi um so uh and then and then um have it be so that the it's it's just kind of like um just part of the social fabric that everybody gets one um it's like right now it's kind of like oh who do i know that already uses bright id and i've got to figure out this thing and i've got to go to this weird connection party thing and but um in the future when bright idea is maximally successful it's like you don't have to it's like you'll grow up with bright ideas it's just completely natural it's like you know your parents and your close friends and relatives will be the ones you naturally connect to and it's not like you have to go looking for someone and you'll just get verified that way um and uh and then yeah why wouldn't you use write it like if you could know that your users were unique humans why wouldn't you want to know that it's like right now it's like well which apps what kind of like what realm of apps are going to have the greatest need for bright id and there's certain types where we've seen like bright ideas so crucial to their operation that they need something like that otherwise it's going to fail but in the future it'll just be like well this isn't crucial to our operation but sure why not we we want to know how many unique users we have that's useful information and so it's like every app will just just want to use it just to just to have that just have that extra i guess um assurance that their users are unique yeah so that's kind of and then as far as daos so it's interesting because it's like we have to be careful um so if you look at like the [Music] the dsoc paper that came out a couple months ago and also um i wrote a post about um plutocracy like a little bit before that but um like we have to be careful because just knowing that someone's a unique person doesn't completely solve the collusion problem um because let's so in the talking about dows let's say that we have dow a and dao b and and they're just uh they're giving away governance tokens to whoever wants them and and i so i collect tokens from doway and dalby i don't care about dao a but i do care about dial b and you are vice versa so we just do a swap now i have two um dao a tokens and you have two dao b tokens and now we we each get double the votes that we should just because we got all these free tokens that we don't really care about and so we just like trade them to sell them to people who do care and we're not supposed to and stuff like that so that's that's where the soul bound things comes in because you want to make sure that uh like that these things that should be kept one per person are not being traded and also that you have the right the right right amount of attention because you could also i mean you if you tried to do like a soul bound token by just having it bound to an ethereum address or something like that you could sell the you can you can just sell the the private key um so just making it non-transferable doesn't solve it um what we did with bright id was we create we actually earlier this year we launched a soulbound token and gave away 10 000 nfts that are and bright id what soul bound means is very simply that you can rescue it it's bound to your bright id in a way that you can rescue it to another ethereum address so let's say that you have an your your soul-bound nft in one ethereum address and then you lose everything you lose access to all your ethereum addresses maybe someone stole it or maybe you just lost access maybe you also lost access to your bright id you can socially recover your bright id and then those tokens um those soulbound tokens have a rescue operation and so if you re-link your bright id to a new uh ethereum address it will it will like teleport that token from your old ethereum address that you no longer have access to or got stolen or whatever into the new one as long as you've as long as you can get that bright id back you can get that token back um so so that makes that makes it soul bound because now it's bound to you as a soul not to an ethereum address that also makes it um not resellable because it like those nfts that we gave away are worth zero and the way that i can prove they're worth zero is i can sell it to you and then i can take it back because it's bound to my soul and not yours and so it ha it automatically has a value of zero so you you can't sell these things so anyways i think that that's really cool um that that paper is is really interesting i think the potential of soul-bound um tokens is really interesting and and helps with some of these governance problems yeah very cool uh i i just think that the future is so bright pun intended for civil resistance and uh thankful to you for being an early pioneer in this space it's so neat to see the the line of of good or bread id growing over time and its relationship with bitcoin growing over time so it's been great um is there anything i didn't ask you that you want to that you want to tell us about um no i i i managed to like cram in everything that i could possibly think so i appreciate that um but yeah i like you said with the collaboration of git coin and bright id i i see lots of of potential there because it's like we're trying we're both trying to fund figure out ways to fund public goods and we're both trying to figure out how to like get public goods out to people so i see us collaborating for a long time likewise and i hope to see you know the early success of of get coin and bright id and other civil resistance tools to be sort of a a sign that you can build non-speculative apps and that i i hope to see more democratic tools more public goods funding tools in the next market cycle be built and and and that's kind of the dream for me and and i just want to end on this is my list of of what civil civil resistance enables and i just want to end by by saying it because i just want to like articulate how how great it would be for the ecosystem if we can solve civil resistance so quadratic voting quadratic funding measuring the genie uh coefficients of ecosystems ubi one person one vote dow's so not one token one boat dials one person will vote dials and then civil resistance air drops is is my uh is my list so anything to add to that or any push back on that list um no amen it's all good stuff amen all right well thanks so much for being on the green pill pod adam really appreciate it and see you around the internet all right thank you [Music] you
