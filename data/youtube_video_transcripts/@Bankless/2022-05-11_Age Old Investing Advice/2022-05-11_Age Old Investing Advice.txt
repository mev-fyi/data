listener who's listening today maybe the bulk of their experience in investing comes from like kind of a crypto world and that's how they they'll learn things and so i feel like people listening are probably missing some key pieces of of how to invest do you have any just parting thoughts for us anything else we should keep in mind as we're going on this investing journey into crypto and other lands so i guess what i would say is maybe one of the wisest lines i've ever seen in my life is this too shall pass when you think that way the losses that you take and you will take losses become less painful and the gains that you take excite you a lot less in terms of you know look at what a stud and what a genius i am the other parting thought would be go with what resonates with you by that i mean everybody's different you got to find the right process the right thing that you can vibe with and just like keep learning listen to your podcast read books do as many things of those things for your self-education that you can because in the real world you gotta teach yourself
