this is another revolution this is a revolution towards value welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode for you the crypto revolution this is the sister episode to our favorite episode of all time called the crypto renaissance we have josh rosenthal who's a phd in history who went through the parallels between the original renaissance historical renaissance and crypto now today on the fourth of july independence day we are going through the parallels of crypto and the american revolution calling this the crypto revolution the lens that we are applying today's how's crypto like early america how are you like an early revolutionary uh so excited about this episode it was an absolute blast with josh and i love these historical analogs david what were a few of the takeaways from you yeah it's so important to we always joke on bank lists we're speedrunning the history of money and finance and also human coordination and this is that that last part where we've we did the the crypto renaissance episode we compared and contrasted the way that crypto is very much like the renaissance and josh makes the claim that the american revolution uh happy july 4th everyone is the logical conclusion of the renaissance the the renaissance man turns into these revolutionaries who break free from top down state control uh and so it's this governance experiment experiment in decentralized governance based on a protocol is something that had never been seen before rather than a monarchy we have this piece of paper that is a code that we all agree to and there's also just some other parallels behind this like innate human desire that is built into the american ethos that i think we have lost and that's now being captured by the crypto ethos crypto is here to produce a more perfect union of humanity crypto is a nation of builders a nation built on freedom and independence and crypto people are here to discover themselves this innate ability to build something to become an entrepreneur to add value not just for your own sake but also for the sake of people around you is very much baked into this human desire that has always migrated westward if you will starting in europe with the renaissance going on a pilgrimage towards uh towards america for freedom and now we are going because there's no physical land left to go we are going into the metaverse to find our freedom and to be able to build stuff and so josh rosenthal is of course the best person to tie these parallels together as we go into the crypto revolution to understand in what ways is this the same story that we have heard once again and so bankless nation i hope you have a fantastic fourth of july and thoroughly enjoy this part of crypto's history as we go through the crypto revolution the last thing i'll say before we uh get to josh's i think some of you might find this episode a bit idealistic of course we are idealistic on crypto we are also uh there's some idealism about the us and for some whose experience of america is kind of not the aspirational vision of what america could be uh you might recognize that and i don't think this episode is saying america is perfect or that it's lived up to its vision or its aspirations but that those aspirations are good in and of themselves and the us has been a fantastic experiment post-renaissance and into the revolution of economic freedom and personal freedom not perfect not finished not complete but a worthwhile experiment and we see some parallels with crypto so with that we are we'll get right to the episode with josh rosenthal but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 heat to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish e-staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators

fulbright scholarship to the sorbonnes institute for advanced studies he's no longer a practicing historian though uh he has sold some web 2 companies he's now a crypto investor and indeed a crypto native josh is the individual who helped us create our favorite podcast of all time both david would say this and i would say this which is the the crypto renaissance podcast if you haven't listened to that podcast go back and listen to that we'll include it in the show notes because it is the precursor episode it is kind of the sister episode to this one because we are here on the 4th of july that is independence day for those of you in the us celebrating our independence in the crypto world and we are talking about the sister episode to the crypto renaissance because first you have a renaissance then you have a revolution this is the crypto revolution josh is here to talk about it with us josh rosenthal welcome back to bankless how you doing hey thanks so much thanks for having me back and just right off the bat i'd like to say thanks for continuing what you're you're doing like they say you can only know about a person two points like when things are great when they're brutal and like i think it's like more instructive on the ladder and you guys have just been fantastic in terms of delving into the issues giving people context and especially first-time cyclers like broader context cultural and historical and i personally appreciate it so a pleasure to be here i think bankless listeners have noticed ryan and i get more giddy as prices go down for some reason just because the bear market ultimately no this is where the revolution happens this is where the revolution is born uh it manifests later but it starts in the bear market uh and so we are excited yeah we're here for it and so josh the the way we want to take this i know you you had some thoughts you wanted to share with us today but we want to provide historical context on the american revolution and how that maybe relates to crypto uh and uh we're going to talk about that so first we want to go through the high level of all of this uh and then go through the high level of the the revolution historically and how that applies to crypto from a value perspective from a vocation perspective from a governance and identity perspective there are some incredible analogs and parallels here and then we also want to end this with some action items all right what can people do with this information and i know you're fantastic at that as well so let's just set the context here and maybe take us from our initial episode where uh you asked individuals listening bankless listeners to put themselves in the position of the medieval you someone in a pre-renaissance uh time period how they experienced the world and how the the renaissance changed their experience of the world through technologies like the printing press and uh through um double entry bookkeeping uh the the neo ledger that we came up with that's where we started on the journey of the renaissance could you just recap that quickly and then let's start to talk about this second chapter from renaissance to revolution uh so take us through that yeah yeah absolutely for those just catching up you know one of the models i can think of when i look at crypto i think the best way to describe it is as a renaissance which is a crazy claim to make but it's fundamentally the the historical rhyme that best fits what i think we're seeing and so just kind of laying out the tldr medieval you lived in a permissioned world and we looked at value and communication identity and value for medieval u was access to wealth and it was subject to the control of others the decisions of others communication likewise was permission that was top down and ideas were controlled by access you know to expensive manuscripts and their economic powers reinforcing that hierarchy and those two things fused to form your identity your horizons who you were and what you could do and the key world to your permissioned world was uh to your medieval world was permissioned and the crazy thing about it is you might not have known it was permissioned at the time it would have just been the area breeze you wouldn't have been aware of that and so with the renaissance we saw two new decentralized technologies converge and it kind of gets to what drives history it wasn't you know means of production and it wasn't great men with ideas but it was really communities making history by using decentralized technologies for social coordination and so there are two technologies that arise simultaneously ledger based financial primitives which we call double entry bookkeeping debit and credit may sound familiar and a new permissionless communication protocol which is really the printing press not just text but also images and ownership baked into the protocol itself and so this gave you access to capital there's sharing of ideas at scale it essentially unwound a hierarchical world and early adopters you know had asymmetric returns on that and so the basic idea is that your medieval world which is static for you know recent memory to all the way through centuries was fundamentally fractured for the first time bursting open with new opportunities and so you could hear competing visions and join a community based on your values your job your family could start a business that's what historians call the birth of socio-political pluralism and proto-capitalism your stars were no longer set and so as we go into the next chapter you can make meaningful choices so what did you do with those freedoms so if the renaissance marks a unwinding of medieval hierarchy and the birth of the modern world it's the birth of this creation we call the early modern world which is still what we're in it didn't obliviate medieval structures um it offered a revolutionary idea the idea of an alternative luther forked reality like satoshi and that was forks begat forks and so faced with new opportunities what did you choose to do some people chose to stay in those vestiges and that gave us juxtaposed communities with competing visions and if you adopted those new values and joined a new community that meant you likely faced resistance conflict with previous ties your family your friends your bosses your landowners your overlords and that's kind of the context for the american revolution what did this pluralism mean and so if you adopted these new communities you had some options you could stay put and convert your political authorities and sometimes that ended badly in what's known as wars of religion you try to migrate to a different geography and physically reside with your community where it held political dominance and you had mass communication now so this idea different geographies courted these communities partially because of the massive economic benefits they reap from them you can also choose to participate in your government and try and carve out liberties for you and your community by threat or military force but also just by the weight of your newfound economic power and here's where we have the genesis of a variety of political representation experiments and governance but for people who still found those vestiges too constricting there's just one other option that remained and that was to strike out for new shores and leave and there was a diaspora in exodus like many attempts on this political experiment on a global stage were undertaken we've forgotten most of those huguenots in south america acadia new france we just we don't remember them anymore largely because just like the last renaissance was so vibrant it eclipsed all those previously the american experiment in independence was the most successful in terms of staying power it eclipsed those previously and that largely is the context for for our discussion today if you're an american and into history you kind of think of puritans and pilgrims but at the time it wasn't fixed those people were zealots and kooks and nut jobs people who were so obsessed with this renaissance vision of individual sovereignty acting in community that they struck out and it wasn't just religious freedom the way we think about it content or personal belief but it was really about what you could do with that freedom associate with others engage in economic enterprise and build with whoever you chose and so that is the american experience in terms of british colonialism but if you're way out on the edge over leveraged if you will in the pursuit of sovereignty and community what then what happens when the experience doesn't meet the ideals and that's precisely takes us to the debate with the british british colonials right like do you remain loyalist or do you go revolutionary what form of governance best serves your interest as well as your neighbors and how to even think about that and so rather than just doing kind of one history like most historians do one damn thing after another we can pull on these threads if you're interested in looking at value which is money economic systems and ownership and business then communication sharing ideas at scale the technologies the platform and the content and particularly how ownership functions and they're in and identity how you viewed yourself values and allegiances and organize yourself according to governance so that's kind of that's several hundred years of history in two minutes but there you go and and josh we uh we want to get there and we want to start with kind of like the the timeline of the the american revolution and the declaration of independence and kind of start there but while we're still addressing the the themes and the analogs be behind kind of the the american experiment this experiment in uh self-governance bottom-up governance a nation at its best aspirationally by the people and for the people we start to see some parallels with what we're doing in crypto so you mentioned this group this tribe who rather than work within the existing confines of the establishment structure that was left to them in europe they came to the us in search of they headed literally headed west that's how we end every single podcast is this is the journey west and we have these puritans uh headed west we want to get in into their head but a few of the cores that i think we're going to talk about here in the parallels you know number one um crypto is a nation of builders in the same way i think the best parts of the us in its early phases were a nation of builders maybe we could talk about that but also america has a history of like it wasn't we weren't sure it was going to make it right there were like lots of lots of parts in the history of the u.s just like the history of america where you're like um was that whole experiment a good idea are you like are you sure these people you know know what they're doing this could go off the rails in so many ways and it almost did that's another theme and it's literally called the great american experiment for a reason in the same way we can call crypto the great crypto experiment i mean all this stuff at some level is we're still in beta aren't we i mean this is still an experiment we don't know fully how it's going to play out um and then so tell us about some of these parallels and like the common quest i guess for a self-sovereignty and freedom why don't you pull on some of those strings at the high level before we get into the into the detailed history here yeah yeah sure so when we talk about crypto and i said hey renaissance is a good way to think about it it's a rebirth or recreation of society it was an unwinding of medieval hierarchies and every form of of technology and control and organization and essentially unwound them and then what do you do with the pieces how do you put those back together and that's the context of of what we call the great cultural renaissance or rebirth of society and when we really get building we get building into the renaissance tracing these themes like through and it's not just me as a story kind of forcing the themes if you ask revolutionary you this would be in your head this is a context for why you're taking actions and so just to the long story short if you're into crypto you're part of this like story and it's echoing throughout the ages renaissance revolution it's always the same characters it's always permission versus sovereignty hegemony versus decentralization subjugation versus independence and so the shift from middle ages to renaissance is context but revolutionary you and even what we're doing in crypto today they they aren't different stories they're all chapters in the same story medieval u is permissioned renaissance you had a choice revolutionary use about what you chose to do that was to build and to build in public as part of a great experiment not because it's easy but precisely because it's hard people would pile on and it would be ridiculous but there's no other way to do it but to build through it and participate and that's actually how you surface unintended consequences and hidden dynamics and so in both phases we're driven by the stupendous optimism you know critics would say it's naive zealous and petulance we thought we could rebuild our world from the better from the ground up after we toppled medieval institutions we proceeded to rebuild this imagined community instantiated by consensual currencies and contracts like the same pieces of crypto and we we did it all in public to your point like on chain keeping records on the way full display for the world to see and when it failed and it often did fail like repeatedly the old world piled on hard our first constitutional form didn't last a decade that's a giant fail back to the drawing board not gonna make it then debt and rebellion after rebellion not revolution internal rebellion until we adopted a strong centralized authority it's basically a king with a different name critic said where's your decentralization now and when it came time to build we to create a more perfect union we argued we scobbled we basically anonymously shat posted on each other and then did these middle-of-the-road options um and we gave just an example we gave the central bank a short-term charter because we didn't trust it and then we revoked it the first chance we got after just a few years because we thought it was working against us through bad lack of clarity and regulations and actually causing inflation like american history in a nutshell in the history of decentralization as part of this continuous experiment is a history of not gonna make it the critics always say just give it time they'll collapse into chaos and come crawling back and the crazy thing about all this is we didn't disagree we actually leaned into it which is crazy this had never been done successfully before the building our our history we'll get into his uh history of moonshine fueled rebellion the modern post office attempting to tax her emails the fed denying a spot etf enforcing court action that's that's not unexpected that's what happens when you experiment we called it that and did it in public inviting others to point out the failures to gloat when the community broke to carefully track our downtime it wasn't a bug it was the feature and to your point ryan like the safe bet was against it right as historians you step back and say oh we know that was a renaissance we know that was a revolution we always we envision ourselves as characters in the story and we would have bravely marched out but the experience of that wasn't it wasn't that way it was it was volatile it was cataclysmic you know the people in the renaissance thought their world was ending and it was and when you actually tried this experiment it was uh it would be chaos the the smart bet from the institutional intelligentsia was political theorists reasoned from armchairs and said hey governance from the bottom would be chaotic you can't even have a piece of that that was like enlightenment axiom age of reason like the answers would be obvious thinking from first principles like any form of self-governance would burn out and collapse into chaos and they had reason to say that like when we tried these little experiments dissenting voices from bottom up peasants rebellion after martin luther russo and france it tended to end poorly massacres blood bass guillotine running you know 24 7. and if it ever did succeed so the reasoning went you know and take on an increasingly ossified structure and become the very thing it was created to replace which is you know irony and that's like shades of leviathan in either scenario smart that was to say institutions were inevitable and history had these time-tested models who are you to question it and like honestly the loyalist position was very attractive right stick with the devil you know even if he wore a monarch's crown um and so this experiment that we partake in this freedom to attempt to pursue one's economic interest and find a governance to ensure that it persists was crazy it was like the risky bet to take like renaissance gave you choice to express one's value to join a community and help others and the american debate is about how best to do that and that's the context it's not just dumping tea over the boat it's really history swinging back and forth between decentralization and aggregation big ticks and talks medieval to renaissance and little ticks and talks that characterize american debate and discourse like since day one do you remain loyalist or d revolt centralized institution or more autonomy for divergent geographies and communities and this is this is federalist versus anti-federalist experimenting in public and the long story short part of it is all those down times all those experiments that did go off the rails and blew up in our faces to the glee of spectators they paid off we built through and discovered an unexpected solution a way to balance structure with freedom and to prevent both chaos and calcification and it was a new model of largely demarcated lines with broad spaces to play and tinker today we'd call them sandboxes or safe harbors um and we knew those would go bad over time and so we kind of built into the system eternal vigilance not from an external enemy but from ourselves and one of the things about history is that you know there are unintended consequences exploitation of peoples and lands and that's true you want to go deeper into history to get a better mastery of it to prevent that from happening again and to give you a lens to better look at your current experience outside the blinders of your life experience and so when we use these lenses we say hey in terms of the renaissance and the revolution and where we are in this great debate and great experiments we've ticked and talked back to central leverage we have centralized institutions with very clear say on very few sandboxes and regulations that aren't nuanced once again and so crypto isn't just another part isn't another thing it's actually part of this great experiment um it's the ability to rebuild our world from a better up and from the ground up and to participate in this imagined community instantiated by consensual conservancies and contracts and maybe it won't work it'll probably fail it definitely won't go according to plan and will veer between chaos and hegemony all the while doing it in public and so this is by design the volatility is a feature of meaningful structural transformation when things die they do so by slow ossification and crypto is the reason why we're forcing this issue is because now we have the the technical rails to actually do this meaningful generative which is a revolutionary idea creation for the first time to remember our our history to pursue a more perfect union as a community of builders and the space and the power of spaces to experiment it's a way to re-imagine what it means to be a nation but also the technical rails to pursue on a global scale independent so that's the that's the whole thesis kind of a to z and the podcast that that we do with you josh the renaissance podcast and this revolution podcast i think are so incredibly important like that we could talk about this defy app or we could talk about that blockchain but when we talk about the the pendulums throughout history we tap into something that everyone i feel like knows intrinsically we have been here before and when we experience things when our ancestors experience things it gets written into our dna and we understand some of the concepts that we're going to talk about today intrinsically to our bones like everyone can relate to their peasant self in the 1400s renaissance everyone can relate to their ancestor that was a part of the american revolution and like even if they didn't have ancestors in that part of the world there's other components of the of this swing from decentralization and aggregation to top down control and authority like we have been here before what's unique about crypto is that this part of the cycle is like we have so much more recorded history to have data points on and so like while there have been a hundred pendulum swings between order and chaos throughout history only recently has we have been able to write all these things down and had the internet structure to be able to communicate these things and the podcast to talk about them on and so as we as the listener listens to this this is you are not a passive observer of this lucky revolution that has tends to happen once every 300 years right 1400's renaissance 1700's american revolution 2 2000's the crypto revolution you are not just a passive observer you are a part of this story and if you are on the edge of your seat as i am right now it is is on you to not be passive in this story but see and understand your role in history because that is how we get this done uh you talked about the first attempt at like the american structure that failed after 10 years the reason why the american experiment succeeded after failure after failure after failure is because of the people that decided to undertake this revolution they knew that there was a there there they didn't know where it was but they were committed to this these ideas of independence these ideas of freedom so they were going to get there they were going to run this experiment into the ground they were going to ride bitcoin they were going to ride ether 2-0 or or and nothing else and and so as we go forward into this crypto renaissance like it's important to understand that like your ancestors have been here before in one way or another and we are about about to park upon this great crusade once again and that's so it's full disclosure for everybody in the audience the crypt of renaissance isn't me that was you know david and ryan doing that and saying hey i think there's something it's like everybody knows this we know this in our bones right history isn't about names and dates and facts it's about remembering and kind of suspending disbelief to figure out like where you have a part in the story and for most of history you don't really have a part in the story in the same meaningful way like you do today right now it's it's it's really important yeah right eat to zero is like live free or die these were the calling cards saying like i know despite the fact that all evidence to the contrary i'm going to persist in this like not because i'm just obstinate and into faith and faith or feedism but because i know there's something meaningful here even if i can't articulate it and and it's it's it's kind of a counterbalance to this vague feeling of unease where we know something's not quite right right like your medieval peasant self you didn't know you were permission that was the crazy part about it when it occurred to you and it's like in some senses we're medieval today in this part right like we we think we have control of our money you actually don't you have a broker you have an iou you can't spend as you want to a credit card won't process it on the rails you basically you know et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera or you think you can communicate well somebody else owns the platform they own the broadcast layer they own the the plat the technical code you fill it with your content they can de-platform you or they can subtly shift you through or they carve out your identity it's like we're subject in all of the same ways and it was only with renaissance where you woke up and said hey there is an alternative i can do something else and so all the way up like through this continuation of the renaissance like things kind of re-aggregate and you continue like persisting and like participating in this experiment saying like live free or die i'm going to do this regardless and like somehow i can use it as a lens to say we're over leveraged and a couple of things of over leveraging we've just gotten use we've been born in this weird period of like stasis again just like medieval u where we have 40 50 years of kind of like global static statuses in post-bretton woods or what have you where we we think there's a institutional path we think there's a predefined way to get there and we we tend to view volatility as something negative rather than like meaningful structural transformation and so we kind of have to rewire the way we think about that and one way to do it is to look at history and say what would it have been like at the renaissance it would have been chaos and armageddon what was it like in the in the revolutionary independence and pursuit of it it would have been chaos and armageddon and like the way we did it was to experiment in public there's no other way through it and so it really forces the question it's like not just what side are you on but it forces you to really clarify your values what's meaningful what's important to you and what are you willing to do as a result of it so yeah so well said absolutely josh um i've you know long seen so many parallels with kind of the early founding of the us the the american revolution and like what we're doing in crypto right and i get a little weird on this because i think there's like some pretty direct analogs right it's like ethereum and bitcoin being sort of like in these other crypto products this is the great experiment of our era this is the the new america this is the land of opportunity right we even have um our own constitution in these crypto networks that is code right we call these things protocols all of the times ethereum rests on a protocol bitcoin wrestling a pr protocol well the constitution is a protocol as well the constitution is a protocol for coordinating people governing people in the same way that exactly in the same way that ethereum and bitcoin are a constitution for coordination as are smart contracts i even see people like satoshi and vitalik as almost like these this is going to sound weird right now but i just think in history it will literally view them as this almost like founding fathers right like i mean these are originators of kind of the thought and the code and the constitutions of our crypto networks that are so important and we in crypto as david was just saying we are like the revolutionaries we are those crazies deciding to like rebel against the existing system and despite what all of our friends and family say embark on this new in into this new world in this new journey there's gonna be opportunity associated with that so let's let's start with kind of the i guess the timeline here in the history because some people listening will have like vague ideas of kind of uh american revolutionary history like i myself have some you know i've taken some ap history classes american history classes of course um i've watched the hamilton musical all right that's something to you um you know but like i don't know all of the details but a lot of thought went into you coming out of the renaissance went into the revolution right i mean you had thinkers like adam smith and you know capitalism and uh you know locke and rousseau and others talking about like these freedoms um can you just tell us let's take us to the declaration of independence and why did this colony this british colony decide suddenly okay we're gonna revolt against the king we're gonna we're gonna separate from the british empire and like we'll war we'll go to war if we have to why was that decision made what's what's kind of the context here and take us to the early part of uh of the revolution yeah yeah so and just let me um you're not wrong thinking about it this way it sounds like crazy and audacious to think about crypto is like a new nation right it's like how is it it's it's just so it's such a crazy historical claim to make but this this literally is the continuation like the historical rhymes fit really well like in if you do a phd in poli sci like the first thing you walk through is benedict anderson you're gonna say hey nations are imagined communities instantiated by consensual currency and contract and so a lot of our discourse has been around crypto as finance replacing fiat and that's true but it really is serving the function of a nation in that sense right imagine communities consensual currency on tokens and contracts now with smart contracts and nft for property rights like expanding into governance exploring you know governance and with a thousand synthetic flowers being able to permeate not just democratic one token one vote not republican delegation like based on election but like quadratic voting and like proof of attendance experience expertise we're experimenting this it's all real and david to your point it's not just that we have more history we have greater visibility to do this all in public one of the reasons we've forgotten about this volatility and the craziness of the experiment was because that's just not largely shown to us anymore we just we haven't had the visibility to do this and so we have better tools to be able to do these experiments at scale with better speed and greater visibility to work together so it is really a historic moment and yeah just taking this too let me let me walk through kind of the history at the same time as i pull on one of these threads and so i like these threads different people have different threads but these are kind of the ones i use to assess like when a complex system changes and so this is kind of like value communication and identity and so let me walk through value and i'll take us through a little tour of history and then i then i'd really like to stop on one point which isn't thought about in terms of the context of the revolution but i think is like very salient as some historians would say it's the culmination of the revolution and like very much like the stage set for our discourse today and so that would be that would be the whiskey rebellion as well so we'll go from tea party to constitution i'll drill into fed as an example and then we'll go into whiskey rebellion i'm kind of pulling doing that chronology while i do a little bit of this value and so just big picture is uh renaissance choices you can pursue you have this idea of an inalienable right to build to pursue your vocation and to organize yourself like with different forms of governance you're experimenting with and when you don't have it's not just taxation without representation it's without clear regulation where the burden of regulation actually like burns you as much as the taxation itself because then you're submitting not just authority to tax but authority to like set the stage particularly where it's unreasonable and the implementations of those policy which is like a slightly more nuanced view that's what sent the founding fathers a crate that's what drove them crazy and so like the answer to that is really grounded in value which sounds like super selfish but it was a revolutionary concept at the time that like drove them to the tea party and continued like pushing back um as a result of property rights like yeah yeah it was partially property rights but it was also there's this revolutionary concept of like generating value this was like crazy right medieval you your world was static and property and wealth and value was static if you wanted something i had to take it from you ryan if david wanted something you had to take it from me that was the way that things were that was the way uh value was finite basically so coming out of the renaissance saying like there's an idea of like generative finance like shades of adam smith where i can actually create wealth by doing something that sounds so simple we take it for granted we say network effects and virtuous cycles but that was insane basically medieval you like the meaningful part about your work was doing wasn't doing value creation it was being outside the world you're better off in a monastery and a nunnery and a cloister being outside the work world like with luther and company all of a sudden the most meaningful thing you could do wasn't being outside the world but it was participating in it through economic generation you could actually create meaningful value by pursuing your vocation by building a product or a service and doing something for the market and the market would reward you if it actually was valuable and when others used your thing it created value for them so you had this mutual creation of value in terms of like people realize josh like there's no such thing as an entrepreneur before this yeah this is the birth of no you went from farmer to entrepreneur the holiest thing you could do in the medieval world was you know basically be outside of it be a monk the most the holiest thing you could do in the post-renaissance world was be an entrepreneur it didn't mean you had to be you know vc financing investing it meant running a small family business you could be a farmer but you owned your farm and you could do what you wanted to with the fruits of that and now you had access to literacy and you could see different manuals for precisely how to do this it was the birth of capitalism historians call it proto-capitalism until it becomes capitalism and so you you literally could generate wealth and that was radical instead of taking from someone else which meant that your tools of coordination were were generative you could create value for me as i created value for you it sounds very kind of like vw bumper sticker on your bus but it was it was unbelievable there was no entrepreneurism there was no creating a market there was no refining a service and so now with this like spirit of capitalism the holiest thing you could do was like work for yourself but by doing so you would actually work for your neighbor and for society at large and that was just like radical in terms of generation and josh i want to kind of make the point right it's like uh you know we are living in a different era of capitalism some would call this kind of like crony capitalism or late stage capitalism but like going back in time the concept of being able to open your own family business and get into the merchant class get into the middle class that was such a there wasn't a protocol there was no middle exactly and so this was an amazing revolution at the time and and this is what the like revolutionaries were like tapping into so like getting back to that theme is so why were the founding fathers so pissed at the british well like what were they doing with this kind of this value chain were they getting in the way of them um you know creating their own businesses and becoming entrepreneurs and no that was that was exactly it that's the context for it wasn't we tend to think of it just in terms of pure political theory like abstract you're not being represented represented but if you were there at the time you viewed that like to your point this was the creation of the middle class and now you're participating in it right and yeah some people didn't have access but it was crazy that anyone had access to this and the idea of taxation without representation particularly burdened some regulation around the details of the policy implementing it was that it impinged it wasn't just theoretical it literally impinged upon your ability to create your business to create wealth from nothing to make the best of yourself and to help your neighbor while doing that that was the inalienable right we call it you know pursuit of freedom and habit but that was like literally through value creation that was the context of everything you read that was that was what you did and so this taxation it wasn't just representation but it would potentially break you it was it wasn't a slippery slope it was it was the details the regulation were so onerous we we essentially we pitched a fit because we said you're it's a sharp knife to the heart of who we are you have an inalienable right no longer has like the divine cosmic like are you set in a pyramid you're now like divine duty is to pursue your vocation your calling like through this entrepreneurialism through what you like and what you're good at and generating something you know valuable for yourself and for others and so by these forms of taxation it's not just taxation it's a policy implementation and a lack of clarity around it that just doomed it to fail and liquidated everyone that was a sharp knife at who you were why you were here in the first place what you're assembling and so yeah we can if you want to we can definitely kind of turn back and kind of go through like the way to think about why everyone pitched to fit uh the tea party was like really around it was impinging upon value like the ability to pursue your interests unencumbered um so and what is it for people who again maybe didn't take their ap history what's the tea party are you talking about like dumping in boston actually the colonists like dumping the tea in and sticking to the british yeah yeah in a nutshell absolutely dumping the tea and sticking it to the british is the easiest way to describe it and this was kind of the start of the revolutionary war it's like one of those precursor events this is the start of the revolutionary war and the precursor around it and usually it's portrayed as people you know bros get mad about not wanting to get tax their taxes are too high and they dump it and that's not what happened it was it was monarchy it was governance control saying it was governance preventing you from pursuing your calling of wealth creation that's why everyone went apoplectic when that happened and so they they dumped those physical assets they said we control things on the ground and that was the clearest it was also symbolic and there's a bit of like cultural construction and ritualism to it there's there's things going on around that but basically it was because the revolutionary idea was that you could create wealth and this was this was impinging you from doing that basically it prevented you from participating in a virtuous cycle of creation and that meant that your colony would fail right if you can't create your colony is going to your colony is going to fail and the whole reason you're here is because you were already out on the edges you had already left for a new land and so like now what's the right way what's the best way to prevent careening from chaos into uh also uh from like having an overly ossified monarchial system and so we basically said no like where we draw the line isn't just in taxation but it's in taxation without representation what we meant by that with the tea party kicking off the american revolution is is the policy itself was poorly implemented and it's it's just something that happens again and again and again and again like if we if we play the story forward like the tea party it sounds weird but it's like this idea of like rule that you have an obligation to the policy not just the tax and like it wasn't foreseen right like as a loyalist um like the whole idea was you were subject it was a class of is a clash of world view right it really was like medieval versus renaissance remember how i said some people persisted in those renaissance and those medieval structures that those were the loyalists those are basically people who said it was an ideological battle around like value creation loyalists said you were subject to a monarchy this there's a divine hierarchy appointed by cosmic powers there's a king here he's imbued with supernatural authority there's a divine contract with a crown and all this ensured that it was for your best and like that was like a good trade to make it was safe it felt good had a good ui ux revolutionary you wasn't part of that you were part of that like luther breaking that hegemony and saying i don't know about that whole cosmically instituted hierarchy thing right you've participated in different forms of government representative pluralism divergent communities and structures league of lectures even in popular revolution and more importantly you'd managed yourself right you'd done it on the ground you've organized community events and helped others in need and like those values were contagious you've gotten used to this independence and so when you were obligated not just to pay taxes for services and public goods but when you did so and you not only you didn't see the benefit of it but was like clearly arrogant and the implementation of the policy prevented you from not just pursuing your business but from being you and yourself that was that was it you were done with it you would absolutely revolt that was you know live free or die that was east to zero however you wanted to to kind of carve that out basically and the debate isn't between like equality and outcome it's really it was about the the form of equality is like opportunity and so like yeah we kicked out it off with a tea party we dumped some tea all hell broke out we're fighting concord we're like we're like clearly the worst bet to make they have you know professional troops like we're fighting from the edges and using guerrilla war content we're farmers right we're like militia doesn't make any sense just to completely break the fourth wall and make this like crystal clear where we have this like top down regulation from the united states from the united states government that is holding so many parts of this industry back and it is frustrating the entire industry and like there's there's so many products that we have not built that we could have and there are so many things that our entrepreneurs and our builders could have built but they are hampered by regulation uh i'm not uh i'm not missing the fact that uh michael sunshine and grayscale just sued the sec because the sec is preventing a lot of the true manifestation of the products that we are building in this space from actually emerging and it makes sense that this is the way forward where like you talked about it's not some sort of just like ideological like purism like hey i think governance should be this way it comes from people with raw economic incentives saying the regulation and authority and top-down control is preventing me from becoming my true self it's from preventing my business from truly expressing its true raw power because the legal structures and the top-down authority are not allowing me to do the things that i want to do and the things i want to do are the things that i know best and it is fundamentally about pushing entrepreneurship pushing computation to the margins and saying like the state the holy divine pyramid of godly divine influence does not know what's best for me and now that i'm in an individual and i have the tools to engage in entrepreneurship and value creation i need this top-down central authority to get out of my way so i can create value for myself my family and my neighbors and so like this is where like in the american revolution where the americans went and invaded uh the ba in the boston harbor and threw the tea overboard it wasn't about the tea it was about the message it was about get your hands out of my business because you're holding me back and now we are doing the same thing where grayscale is suing the sec and we're saying get your hands get your regulation out of the form factor of how my business is expressed because you're harming our industry and we will go down with the ship and so we need to go and because we're going to go down with the ship we will fight you until we have our freedom yeah no that's that's what like the tea party is the whiskey rebellion is just a filing suit on the sec that it's also we'll get into it a bit but it's not just it's not selfish pursuit of economics you really believe that you can generate value in the world that you pursuing your calling was the way to improve the world for yourself and for your neighbor and for the community of governance and you chose to participate in that and that experiment like literally literally a way to think about it is uh is that you're you're you're you're helping your neighbor by making the world a better place and pursuing yourself and helping them perceive themselves you're opening up the door for them to do the same thing and the fruits that you actually are growing like will like feed them basically and governance as well so like if you want to break the the fourth wall the basic idea is that yeah wouldn't other people at least some other people be better off like owning their own like value controlling their communication their identity wouldn't they be better off in the especially if you're down the distribution curve like why keep trying to play minor league ball play a different game right like isn't that a better approach to it maybe even that actually if the technology is really generative maybe that's how you get out of like budget deficit and interest rates that's what we've seen like repeatedly through these sorts of explosions and harvesting like maybe you can actually take on new forms of governance we have the technology now like to literally do these governance experiments at scale basically right like maybe we can pay for public goods and ways our cities can't like get out of our way to let us do our stuff and like that's not a return to like complete chaos the solution we came up with was like safe places with safe harbors call them safe spaces for innovation like that was the balance we struck and so today i'd say we've all but forgot we've swung so far back we we have where's your safe space here right like to do innovation like that's essentially what we're suing sec through not because we're philosophically opposed to it but because we need a place to like pursue our economic activity yes to benefit ourselves but also others and like also the government like let us help you help yourself and so out of that desire we throw the tea overboard we kick-start the american revolution and we and we gain our independence we can fast forward through like the shooting and the war part because i don't really intend on doing that uh and so we but we win uh as as independent seekers of of the ability to express our values upon the world and then like that's when the american revolution or the american experiment starts like we are the the british retreat and we are given this blank slate uh to mess up and mess up again and mess up for a third time until we get it right and so that's where that's where this really this experiment in decentralized governance starts and i think that's where the story continues can you continue along the story there yeah yeah so i think the parallel isn't so much let's let's like do the tea party thing and basically recreate the united states the the part i really think is interesting is like the nature of that debate because it wasn't set just like the renaissance was always reforming you know so too the nature of this political debate was always in the pursuit of a more perfect union and that debate went back and forth and so like that's the context i think we're we're pretty clearly in today so to fast forward we basically go through british independence and there's a debate within the community do you mean loyalist do you revolt the answer to that is largely around how you viewed yourself in the world and like your economic activities and like how important they were to you to your identity and so 1777 we have this first uh we we have our first constitution and it's like odd it's not what we'd expect right it lacks the power to tax it lacks the power to regulate the government it's it's weird um and we've kind of forgotten about that just because that was like what we'd say now is a false fork or a false start but it kicks off the great debate where we basically have this exchange of ideas about how best to structure the governance to prevent chaos and also ossification to allow economic generation and you to pursue your true self and so that's really debate between like the federalists and the anons they they have different names and different points in time it's kind of federalist papers with madison and hamilton and you know they're advocating for a strong discourse um and the people on the other side that were saying hey be hesitant of that strong governance where they weren't just anarcho you know enoch and arcus they were they were a on those people like jefferson but also a lot of these people writing and taking the names of roman republic the idea was that they did this to say hey a subtle shift to empire actually tends to create you know persistent imperialism and so it's a debate between how best to govern how best to represent and that like kind of kicks off the whole discourse and they they did this debate in public while the old world piled on they did it through posting repeatedly you know there's images of someone you know and the the federalists were really good at posting they like they wiped out the anons like they just did a fantastic job like some of their better stuff is you see like you know an anon and he's like prickly an anti-federalist he's like a porcupine and you know the devil's whispering to him giving him tag lines and memes to generate and the the british crown and the form of alliance doing the same thing and lady liberty's weeping basically he's just if you're into decentralization not into this hierarchical monarchial like medieval vestige worldview like you're basically just like a incorrigible like sob right why else would you be doing that there's another answer why you might be doing that and there's another image where it shows what goes on behind the scenes and and you know an anti-federalist club and they're a bunch of drunken gluttonous like folks just getting like smash-faced and they're that's like why you would do that why why would you threaten your your behaviors are self-serving they aren't in the form in the service of neighbor and others of governance they're basically they're just for your own ends you're just you have no self-control like basically that's why you eschew these central centralized structures one of my favorites is this you know mad raging tom you can look it up and it's like some people think it's thomas payne it's probably jefferson either way he's trying to pull down democracy and the devil's helping him and you know and they're having a difficult time and you know he's obviously drunkard because he has bottled whiskey at his feet and that's why he's doing it and there's like there's a subtle sexual that's probably better for another podcast the point is there's other it's like very nefarious activity and like long story short if you want to strike out on your own if you want to like move towards this anti-federalist position like you're essentially like making this leap into the unknown and that always ends up in the back of like back in the arms of like british monarchy right like so there's another image to leap or not to leap and they have george there um and so this is the same governance debates are absolutely found in the crypto world we have like this super libertarian bitcoin maximalist that came first into the industry and they're like the they're the anti-federalists it's like get get your big organization like top down control out of here uh and then you have something more of the federalists which i kind of consider to be like the shared security model of ethereum where we have this one center of security that secures the whole entire union right uh on like we've called ethereum like the united roll-ups of ethereum right like we have the bottom layer one that organizes and and and secures the the layer twos on top of it and this is the federal this is like the federal say hey we do need a strong central government to control to protect and coordinate between all the states uh and but then and then you have also like the cosmos model which is like leaning a little bit more back into the uh states rights heavy states rights uh heavy app chain emphasis total sovereignty uh and so like these these conversations have happened in the crypto space how do we organize our blockchains uh whereas previously it was like how do we write our constitution now it's like how do we write our the code that or that coordinates our blockchains no that's exactly like the the crazy part about it is we're using so we we have these irl governance models and we're importing them into the synthetic world as we're recreating the nation now right and like as we move to the second unfold these these transformations tend to move in like two unfolds or two phases one where you do the same thing you saw previously but use like the new technology to do it better faster cheaper and then the second unfold is actually to do things you couldn't have otherwise imagine that wouldn't otherwise be possible using the new technology and so like phase one we're early days right we're using like irl governance models that we know some of which were popular some of which have like kind of faded away to manage the synthetic worlds and phase two of the unlock i think we'll actually and we'll get to it we're actually going to start using like the synthetic the things we generate in the synthetic world out of a synthetic lab where we speedrun not only finance but we speed run governance to actually port back over to new governmental models and here you see that even in early days with different politicians playing around with with different ideas but the point is we actually have the simulation capability to to do that now so yeah you can at the point of this whole discourse is that like  posting and the world piling on like whenever you're trying to do anything wherever you are in the spectrum decentralization like that's just how the experiment plays out right like that's just like characteristic of it so when you see that don't think oh it's a bunch of crypto bros getting mad it's like as crazy as that sounds and ryan to your point of like how did the british they saw him as a bunch of crypto bros right they're just like low-level unintelligent like people that are just pursuing their own economic interests at the expense of helping their neighbor right like oh that's why that's why you're into crypto isn't it and to say no no we're actually pursuing this like this experiment of how best to like govern to free ourselves and like also to work with others for their benefit even if they don't recognize at the time that was like lost on those folks and so this is just like very much a continuation of the experiment and again you know you can read now and that's great but you're still communicating through these images which have the semiotic import like that's the best way to tell a story these tend to be broad sheets memes they're absolutely like posting with memes is starting with luther all the way like culmination of renaissance into revolution this is how we do it into crypto it's not this is like what happens when we have historic epic structural transformations we do this experiment in public and we meme it out you know i feel like you know from the historical timeline perspective a lot of pop history in the u.s like people kind of skip this whole phase right so it's like oh the america won the revolution and then there was the constitution everything was perfect but you're saying no okay so the war was won but then this first constitution was kind of garbage kind of didn't work for anybody and people could sort of forget about that and then there was a series like a decade of debates even even longer but um between the federalists and and the anons as you say and so the crypto tribes yeah the crypto tribes and then the outside world i know there's there's a scene from uh hamilton the musical where king george like gives a song he's like at the end of it he's like good luck he's just like colonists good luck with this because um we were bringing the empire in the structure and you're just this whirling band of chaos and cool you can win a war but like can you actually govern probably not and then he's got evidence here where he sees the federalists and and the anons kind of arguing back and forth but what was the outcome of this because it wasn't it wasn't pretty in fact there were even like rebellions josh and i know you want to talk about the whiskey rebellion is that the first one like we have this my favorite rebellion and this was not a rebellion against the british now it's an internal rebellion in the us so what are these rebellions this is a forgotten chapter of of american history post-revolution yeah no it's so it's also just back to your point on that first constitution you can kind of think about it like early dows right you can even think about it like you know pick your dow where you know you have a leader and they go away and say just figure it out and you have 12 000 people in discord typing around it doesn't quite work and then like kane comes back or somebody comes back and they're you have to find this balance between top down and bottom up and there's not one solution but you have the freedom to experiment around and so you can think of our first constitution as like purely decentralized just do whatever you want to and like the knock is like that's the exact same people as people the next exact same thing as people pointing saying hey we told you corporations would always win the dows are too chaotic like the historical path is you you you tick and you talk and you experiment your way out of it that's like that's what you expect like yeah and so like the same thing like the the the british and world point of view like the the reasoned people in the armchair sitting back and like they basically said look you're gonna it's gonna be complete chaos yeah you can win a war because you're naturally more chaotic and like that's you can do it on your own terms but like you can't rule you can't organize the debate was about are you just like tearing down authority for its own sake are you really doing it to pursue your true self and your neighbor and others that's the debate and like that's going to be tested and like can you actually pull that off and like early days like not great try one constitution that like fails basically ten years you're writing it like you're posting each other like through this debate and like a series of ongoing revolutions just like ongoing renaissance is like we just forget about them shay just a number of others like the whiskey rebellion is kind of one of my favorites and like i wanna i'm not saying it's the most important but i like the idea that it uh that it gives us a glimpse into a glimpse into kind of similar analogs to what we see because it's very much an overreach of like one party like through a particularly poor implementation of policy tax like impinging upon entrepreneurs who are more sophisticated than we would think they are to not only like supplement their irl income self-insure their crop but actually provide back to the cities and so like drilling into the whiskey rebellion is really a different way to tell the fed story and so yeah yeah so it's a so there's a series of ongoing rebellions and like basically they really they really hit the people you know it's not just theory these are the results of on-the-ground experiences experiments causes and effects and these unintended consequences basically and so we go through this new we basically have a series of these rebellions we end up with a new constitution after a decade of debate like from this like posting back and forth and from these rebellions where where we'll get to an example of that and after a decade of debate we we get together and we have a new constitution and we're trying that's why we use the words in order to form a more perfect union and this has checks and balances as delineated lines of power it carves out places to experiment today we'd say sand boxes particularly financial and economic um but like how did we get here like what was the nature of that like chaotic like experiment in public and that's like the central bank is a really good example of that so 1791 hamilton manages to push it through and like jefferson hates idea right jefferson thought like three later agencies would like become permanent institutional crafts so jefferson is able to negotiate you know a 20-year charter for the fed to be revisited and that charter was revoked in 1811 after this lengthy debate and like even the congressional research services will say it's a function of bad regulations creating inflation so like what does it actually mean on the ground and like the example that is like a really good lens to give the listeners a taste of what it was like is uh is the whiskey rebellion you know 1794. the fed is set up all hell breaks out as a result of them not like in la using like clear regulation and impinging upon your economic liberty to be your entrepreneur and uh basically that's the result of uh you know revoking the charter and then basically creating out these like safe harbors and sandboxes so the boston tea party is what everyone loves to talk about and it's a key point and i get it but like the whiskey rebellion in some ways is like is like a better analog around this one what were people doing with like was whiskey an entrepreneurial exercise like what was the importance of with whiskey take us back to that lens because i don't think yeah so whiskey is whiskey is um so the american revolution creates debt and then basically the question is who's gonna pay for it right and so it's always a question like throughout history you see this clear theme of like fiscal policy like determining governance and like of course he's gonna pay for it not like the british in new england but those on the frontier like out in appalachia the irish the scotch the germans like the the people in the sticks right and so like they're gonna pay for it by like having their whiskey taxed and like the way the whiskey was taxed was was if you were bigger you paid less which is like reason for an uprising but it was the nature of the regulation like the the fed demanded taxes to be paid in fiat in full and that was like very very that was like that was like the most inflammatory it was the least way aware most arrogant legislation that essentially would liquidate every farmer and cause like inflation shock and like supply chain crashes everywhere so you're a farmer you farm corn right that's what you're doing in appalachia you're not a medieval farmer the difference is you own your land you can do anything with the fruits you're literally an entrepreneur you're running a family business and you're not dumb you're really smart you diversify you mitigate risk and you engage in product development you make you do the most revolutionary need is the most american thing you can do you make moonshine right like you turn your excess corn into whiskey and that access corn would otherwise rot and this is like huge and like as a kentuckian i have to say this isn't bourbon like disclaimer disclaimer it's like it's more like white dog or whatever and it could actually be like good it could be like apple anyway the point is like whiskey allows your farming to be profitable it is a supplemental income that allows you to do your first line is it like a store of value is almost like a currency yeah so it's it's a currency but it's also like a way to self-insure your crops as a farmer you never know what's going to happen right you plant too much you're broke you plant too little price crash it like it's like problematic either way and so like whiskey allows you to plant too much it allows you to over plant basically and when you over plant like what do you do you have enough to hit the market price with the excess you've invested in you know time labor and capital in those supplies you turn that corn that would otherwise rot into risky you literally distill the values called liquid gold you're so on one hand it's supplemental income that makes your farming possible like long pause that's your first line business your entrepreneurial business your farming is possible because of the supplemental money from the whiskey it's also possible your farming is only possible from whiskey because this way you're self-insuring your crop by being able to produce enough ensure you hit the market like peg and then be able to turn the excess into something valuable itself so instead of having like fed basically insuring you're self-insuring and then third like to your point ryan yeah it's absolutely it's a currency which is crazy so you're creating like commodity steadiness and commodity prices but it's a currency because like on the frontier in appalachia you have very little access to like dollars you don't see fiat dollars most farmer families see like five very few fiat dollars every year foreign spirits are very expensive it's tough to transport across the hills so you just still value and you trade you barter you settle accounts you pay for goods and services in whiskey it's their community token basically right it's like if moonshiner's the original dow that's them and so you don't have a lot of access and so if you have a demand you're fine paying taxes but you need to be able to do things to do that the regulation around the unnuanced regulations saying pay them in full in fiat it would break them it would liquidate all the farmers instantly it was a lack of policy with nuance and it caused absolute chaos a rebellion an intentional inflation because the supply lines and liquidating all the farmers and so crazy rebellion not enlightened one of the probably one of the most biggest reasons why this rebellion was a rebellion again to what you're saying it's not about the tax i'm sure they were happy to pay the taxes it's about not being heard it's about you guys don't even understand what i'm doing here and you guys are doing this undue regulation that isn't like and this is our frustration towards like the things like the irs and the sec and the cftc is like you guys are just you could do things that will make us align with you but you are doing this stupid thing that rejects us and now as a result of that we can you are not allowing us to work inside of the system you don't know who we are you don't know what our business is you don't know about the value that we're generating and because you're not permitting us to work inside of the system you're forcing us to work outside of the system sadly inside the government you're not a whiskey farmer you're an east coast elite it doesn't even get it yeah it's it's the details of your policy or the lack of detail that makes it impossible for us to again back to this renaissance revolutionary you like and the thing is the details actually harm you the fed right like left alone we're going to generate unbelievable value left alone the farmers are going to have food for the cities where you live we'll pay the taxes but like if you create a policy like you're going to you're going to create detailed policy which prevents you from act which like wipes us out and prevents you from getting what you want when if you nuance this policy based on like on the ground information you're supposed to be representing us anyway like we could pay the taxes we could actually continue to help you we don't need additional assistance we can basically self-insure against this and we can like have you enjoy the fruits of our production we're doing this all on our own and we're happy to participate in the governance around that when you come in with policy that doesn't have isn't nuanced where the details of the policy not the tax itself actually breaks the system it's just that's where just it's it's like very problematic and so in that case it was absolute it was negotiation and then when that failed rebellion um and then like a weird kind of rebellion where there was rebellion it was neighbor versus neighbor some people were excise men some people were resisting and then uh you know angry rioters facing off against feds and then the marshals are sent to town and then the marshals give them like a few hundred barrels of whiskey to quiet the riders and that doesn't work just pro tip and like history if you're trying to like camp down a rebellion don't don't give them a thousand barrels of whiskey i don't know maybe maybe that actually would work and then like even then you see this like great conversation going the governor pardons them all right and like it's it's essentially debated but like yeah ryan and there's images of like manuals for how to like tar and feather and excise man et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera but like no that's exactly right it's it's the great experiment is can we govern ourselves and the great debate is around the nature of that government and it's not do you pay taxes or do you not pay taxes but like are you able to carve out safe harbors and sandboxes for you as entrepreneurial renaissance you've pursuing your vocation to pursue generation for yourself and your neighbor and the government like that it's it's just it's it's like just conflicting worlds basically like meeting it sounds crazy it's like the beginning of like the later star wars things where it's like it's like oh it's a rebellion starts over tax policy or trade what it's like it's not just trade it's who you are and your ability to pursue this and like you can actually help yourself and help others like if you don't just hose us in the tiniest bit so yeah this is essentially them like you guys may be too young but like if you remember like the internet comes out and like we're trying to tax emails right fcc and post office they're like let's tax every email they were lit they literally said this taxi yeah yeah no no it's not hyperbole like that was the plan basically like yeah yeah so it's like this is what we do right this is like literally like we basically say oh you need fiat dollars when no one's using it as currency right we say you need to tax emails basically we say you can't have a spot etf like this is this is just how we do it it's like technology allows through self-organization control like coordination allows allows communities to outpace institution and then you get this like hierarchical dissonance basically and the way we came up with the solution to get through that dissonance wasn't to burn it all down but to have these little pockets where we could experiment our way out of it and then the fruits of that experiment grew like such gl so gloriously that they actually helped not only yourself and neighbor but government like yeah if you speed run the story into like the then when's the last time you had a budget surplus like the explosion of this digitization that digitization wasn't even tied to ownership like the con it was only read write it wasn't like own and the code itself was open source so everybody's laboring for these like hierarchical like constructions nobody's owning it and like but even that benefits governance that's where you have capital gains like creating digital surpluses you build your way out economically the only thing that can stop you is not paying taxes but like a very poorly like being out of sync not just with the community but the opportunity like taxing email isn't just like a giant fu to everybody participating in the digital space it's also just like doesn't fit it's not operationally possible and like if you step out of the way we'll create enough cap games to get you a budget surplus like that's the way to think about it another example is like the irs doesn't treat like bitcoin or eth even in small quantities as um as kind of a currency from a tax perspective it's all treated as as property right which is different than the euro or the yen or other foreign currencies why couldn't you treat these assets as foreign currencies why is there always this like you know tax event associated with them any legislation this effect has gone absolutely nowhere they don't even understand um this space and maybe they're not incented to do anything about it but okay so so is that just a double click real quick like that like the whiskey rebel like saying hey i'm going to require fiat and painful is like taxing email or like calling like everyone who's used an elven sword it's a capital gain event yeah yeah no it's like it's the same thing and the detail to get out of it i can't emphasize enough wasn't to debate it out in policy it was actually to have these safe harbors where you experimented your way out of it you saw what worked and then you applied it at scale right you don't need to change everything you need the ability to create and generate your way out of it so that was and so yeah long story short we revoke the charter and like everything's hotly debated what's the nature of governance you can go through like the next like 100 years basically around trials and errors around this right like your point loyalists are laughing you saw jeffrey you saw you saw hamilton so you know that history and uh that's exactly what happened like the revolution in france flounders like we kind of get into an undeclared war we passed alien acts it's like to silence critics like the point is we're just we're just chaos and international critics are piling on the whole way we experiment with this dual federalism it ends up in like civil war and reconstruction not gonna make it and there's all sorts of anecdotes we could go into but the basic idea is that as we move out of that we're slowly accreting like aggregation of powers and so the context for the debate isn't just the federal isn't the fed anymore but value thanks to a new value construct called a corporation that allows fractionalized ownership again hotly debated we did everything we could do to not do that until we finally figured it out through the experiment that becomes the locus of the bank the debate for institutional craft so now it's no longer fed it's actually sec and like everybody has access to fractional ownership but value becomes increasingly concentrated to fewer individuals and corporations and you have this expansion throughout the 20th century as a result of that that's the 1960s lyndon johnson great society and that's a counterbalance to social governance programs providing you know stimulus you point to opportunity or equality like in consolidation of control and the thing that really really got to us just as we were talking about was this overreach of like fed basically like uh and sec the institutions just can't keep up with the new technology and this is the post office literally tried to tax emails or real estate legislation you know called everyone who's ever played with a pixelated cat or an elven sword to say they're registered you need to be a registered securities broker like and a lot of people in crypto would say like this is all baked in the 1970s these assumptions basically of bureaucracy going past the point of no return and like our value creation in this debate becomes around tam total addressable market aggregation right and that becomes the feature where feyng actually like is essentially like the nasdaq index and so there is a socially credentialed path to participate in this where you're working from university and then working at a company and etc etc and like they sort of lose their form they lose their vocation and what you're doing the universities become you know it's fine if enrollment goes down every year from here because of demographics like now you're essentially a hedge fund right and your ivy league president is a hedge fund manager and like if you're an academic working in ip like it's owned by the university in like conjunction with like the pharma lab that set up the lab in the first place the the point is you're moving like further and further and further into like an accrual of federal power and we've kind of forgotten about these compromises of like clear demarcation for sandboxes even to the point where we've just forgotten the history of that the way we got out of that not by changing everything but a safe space to be able to create your way out of that like our overton windows shifted to where even madison like the the federalists would throw do a tea party himself right now and the shift is all around like communication a scale through digitalization but not ownership so there's like a great break in this and so it kind of gets the question of like why crypto now we've had this institutional craft why are we getting feisty about it now well there's crypto is like a new nation state construct but it really forces the issue now we have this internet of value and so the opportunity isn't just to do centralized value accrual but to actually do an ownership economy return to like you know renaissance you as an entrepreneur and revolutionary you like running a small business like maybe it's essentially you know a capitalism 2.0 toolkit you know historians always say all the previous stuff was proto-capitalism when we got to real capitalism 1920 century maybe that wasn't even the real capitalism maybe that was all proto-capitalism until now we can digitize ownership so you can like engage in those pursuits and so the way to do this that we saw throughout the spirit experiment historically was like clear demarcations of sandboxes um that's how you return with great renewed energy to the great experiment there is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app today we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven

polygon arbitra or boba networks that is the first thread um to pull on here and this is so it's like i'm getting us back to kind of these these threads of the revolution this is the crypto revolutions what we entitled this this episode the first threat is all about value and we find out that the the american revolution 300 years ago was a revolution towards more free more property rights more more freedom in value creation right and so we saw that even after the revolution it wasn't kind of a one and done it was it was this great experiment where we oscillated with different levels of centralization and decentralization back and forth and rebellions and debates and add-ons and ship posts and all of these things until we finally figured it out and it didn't work perfectly because it never does but it worked well enough that it was better than the previous system but all this time we started to get this this cruft on the existing institutions this this stagnation and now we are back somewhat where we started with with a better system than the like medieval system i would not want to go back and be a peasant in a feudal estate okay i'm not advocating that but we're we're still saying right now maybe we haven't fully exercised our digital freedoms our uh our freedoms of capital and property rights and that is where crypto comes in this is another revolution this is a revolution towards value and so i think we've uh we've talked about that thread let's talk about the next thread here josh which is i should just let you summarize that that's like the said so much better that was the context for everything you allowed me to do that um so let's talk about the next thread of the revolution that that you know the rebels you know we're fighting for essentially and this revolution was over and this this is communication you mentioned or another maybe term for this is like vocation tell us what you mean there and like let's go into the context of why um the revolution was fought for uh communication and and like vocation yeah yeah and so this is so like you ask a simple question like why the tea party why did everybody get mad and you can say oh they there's tax and da da da da da but it's really about who you are and what you're attempting to do and like how you're attempting to unlock yourself with others basically it's it's like and so like we kind of went through the history and the narrative all throughout like this value creation and so communication these can go pretty quickly the basic idea around communication and these are the threads i pull anytime we look at these like transformations every 300 years or so that's it's not just like you know fourth turning there's like these macro cycles and so what we see is that you know revolutionary u can now read the renaissance essentially unlocked mass media that's the point to take from it right and the ren the reformation was largely around communities propagating their message you can read you can learn and like what you read and learn doing that action learning improving yourself acquiring new skills the ability to generate is really around this idea of vocation that was like luther one of the you know if he accounted for half the media that was written at scale with hundreds of thousands of these images like a good portion of that was around vocation saying hey you're a medieval farmer or your holiest thing you can do is be out in a monastery or cloister outside the world no no no you're actually called to participate in the world in society and not just be like a sunk cost but actually be generating value for yourself and others and this is the idea of vocation that you're free to be you and that there's like honor and nobility and dignity and like pursuing your own interests like you have this divine calling not to medieval hierarchy but to like find out what you like and what you're good at and pursue that at all costs and this is where you hear about process work ethic and weber mike's favor and these guys but like this is this permeates you right like your work ethic improving and bettering yourself is the sacred activity monarchy is no longer a divine right it's now your vocation you're calling to participate in active generation especially those things you're good at gosh is this part of the meme of like the american meme of like the land of opportunity as well yeah yeah all this is yeah all this is land of opportunity all this is like uh you know work hard basically it's not we tend to like we're so far over on the other side now we tend to say oh that's like that's just like raw crony capitals and where you're generating money and then like you do you do your day job and it's shitty or it's crappy and you do all that just because that's what you have to do to pay the bills and then you go home and you write harry potter hand fiction because that's like what you're into and like they're doing with dumbledore or whatever and then like and then like yeah you're still into these causes you think like green is good and carbon and blah blah it's like the splitting right and like that was like what what vocation just said no all those things go together right the thing you're doing to pay your bills should be the thing you're passionate about and you need to do that through these newfound economic structures where you generate value from that you're free to do what you like to do and by the way you're not just doing this for yourself you're also doing it for these other causes which we'd call public goods today you can use the same mechanisms to do all these things it was a much more holistic view and it was just really simple what do you like and what are you good at and you like you pursue that at all costs and that's like where do you do it land the opportunity all the this is the american dream essentially yeah yeah the american dream is not to get rich and own your own house like that's like a is that's not how revolutionary independent you would have thought about it it's like the american dream is the ability to pursue what you like to do and what you're good at and the freedom to do that in an economic system where that can pay for you and also pay and help and benefit your neighbor like that's the dream it's like this calling it's not just happiness it's not just satisfaction it's like meaningful vocation like the ability to create in a substantive world way to the world for yourself and for others like it is your calling you're called to do that it's not selfish like when i get done with my shitty day job then i'm gonna like really be a harry potter fan fiction guy like no it's like that is the thing you're supposed to be doing it's crazy this is kind of dave like when you guys talk about unlocking yourself this is this is the historical context for it that came straight out of the reformation and renaissance it's what defined ryan to your point of like revolutionary you land of opportunity like high american dream like we've kind of thought about it in terms of the economic benefits but it wasn't just that it was who you are and then how you associate governance absolutely but it's also the alignment between discovering who you are when you are unburdened by just the rules when you're unburdened by the rules and you have this like blank slate you can actually discover what you do when you have this blank slate to work with and there's no coincidence that a lot of the most successful people in crypto like they're not working 40 hour work weeks like but also what is work and what is play and what is entertainment really starts to blur the lines and this is one of the reasons why this industry is so captivating for so many like we wake up and we start working but we're also on twitter kind of posting which is also kind of working because we're connecting with others and we're like you know doing research product market fit and then when like you know the discord and like typing time is over we go and we listen to like up only and like we get our entertainment or or we listen to whatever is like the weekly roll up because i also think that's entertaining but that's also work there is no actual boundary between what is in pursuit of entrepreneurialism what is in pursuit of wealth there is no differentiation between your local community and your business and there is no different differentiation between your your entertainment and your work and so all of these things blur together and it's why there are so many workaholics in this industry that are working like 80 hours a week it's because like well sometimes they're working at 100 clock rate but sometimes they're only working like 40 clock rate and like the other is like 40 entertainment and like 20 percent like  posting right and so i would add to that david is and i think you'll agree with this is also values alignment too value's alignment like there's meaning and purpose here like it aligns so well with like how we want the world to be in the future that's the tough thing to describe this is because like all these threads obviously interweave right like if medieval you your work is like laborious because you're told to do it and you don't like it and like you're working with people with have absolute antagonistic values largely the people who are telling you to do that now you have choice and you can you can like join a community with similar values right and like create and build with them now it's it's a all this is in like public like we have this this was what defined the renaissance doctrine vocation this is what defined revolutionary you why you went bat like at the tea party like because you wanted to be this is this is an intention upon who you are is a function of what you do not what you think about but the actions you actually take in the world and like not just for bettering yourself but bettering your neighbor and like the community public goods through governance like that's like that was like you could and now you can do this all in public right like you actually have this discourse you have the ability to do it in public and to spend your time doing that it's like we this idea of like well i have a work-life balance it's like well what if what if your calling is actually like how you like to spend your time how you benefit yourself and your family how you benefit others and you actually like like to do that and by the way you're creating value not because you're clocking in but because the thing you're doing is generatively meaningful it's we kind of it's hard for us to suspend like our modern disbelief but that was the that was the context for like independent you know for sure josh you opened up this conversation talking about how like medieval you if you wanted to grow your wealth you had to take it from from somewhere else right there was no value generation there was only well can my own personal supply of wealth can i how what can i get from somebody else and take their wealth so i can have it and that very much feels like the stagnated highly saturated world of tradfi and web 2 in this very moment if twitter is captivating my attention facebook's not getting it uh if if microsoft if i go and like i leave my job at apple and i go to microsoft i'll just ladder climb my way up but there these industries have hit their saturation point meanwhile you go into the world of crypto and you see literally this land of opportunity which is a blank slate where there are so many products left to be built we are probably at like five percent of total saturation of the crypto space and so it goes from it's not just like a can you be competitive and can you outbid out uh compete your competitors it is what competitor can i be become composable with what other community can my community align with how is my community composable with their community because we are in a state of complete under saturation of the value creation in this space where the value creation actually comes from dow to dow collaboration or from individual to individual collaboration that's that's kind of what i meant when i said this this might really be capitalism for the first time now that we have ryan your point property ownership and like strong rights on chain we can actually do generative ownership like maybe all that capitalism we were kind of working with like stone tools previously right like shades of adam smith getting back to this this vocation i wanted to like hammer that just to give you a sense of it's not crude capitalism it's in service others the revolutionary thing is that it actually like helps and then like ryan to your point yeah it's it's you can do this on an ownership economy right like so like if if web 2 is made of network effects you know somebody else doing something else but sure i have a network but all the value accrues to the medieval overlord like harvesting the fruits of my time attention and labor basically now in an ownership economy where we all i'm doing network effects and capitalism going on on steroids where we all own pieces of this basically my ownership is actually like improved on that and so like that opens up all sorts of like craziness for like long tail esoteric activities now i don't have to have aggregation with you know two million like views on a post with me making a dollar on it basically i can have a thousand a hundred like very small like esoteric interests and ideas and like that is the actual idea of like generation through that like instead of having empty vessels where like i'm filling these like platforms with content because they're not creating it and even the code itself has been a function of like open source community code like so what are these things they're actually like nothing all the generation is happening on the ground and like now i can actually like participate in that like three generations so that was your that was vocation it was like how you see the world like the key to like not just happiness and satisfaction but like fundamental meaning through value construction and like how you're describing it and like that basically like communication like sort of becomes economic generation at scale like you participate in public discourse but like and you're doing that like all throughout the history it's kind of a patchwork of bottom-up distributed like decentralized like media platforms local newspapers it persists until like you have a consolidation in the 20th century and like now we have digitalization but we don't have ownership associated with it so we have this like great divorce basically right so you have new economic creation but the value captured isn't for the creator or even the participant and so like you're you're working under permission controls at the broadcast layer at the platform layer not just having a chord cut not just being d platform but even the algorithms are shifting what you see and your voice going out and it's done in kind of a darker and a furious way where you might not even know that and in fact like background i built a couple of web 2 companies and like did this with algorithms sold one to the minute you spent where we're talking on the algorithms and like literally you have organic reach and how much can we artificially decrease that until you start to pay it's a it's uh it's like mutually like misaligned and so this kind of gets into like crypto's generation as like the basic idea of like how can we use communication like not just to help ourselves like but as a new form of following your vocation like i really like writing harry potter fan fiction right like maybe i can do that as my day job basically through these models or i really like you know i want to be my own isp or i want to own the broadcast layer instead of having to like do that through correct through verizon and so it's like this revolutionary new way to reassess communication and also the rails to persist communication through ownership like native ownership at scale requires these like sandboxes and like in that sense like if all the digital generation and the wealth creation that dominates our world today came out of a fundamentally broken model where we like divorced ownership from content from what you create and from what you consume as well as from the code and the platforms itself like open source like if we got those sorts of fruits out of like kind of a false fork imagine what we'll get like where you have ownership at scale powering network effects and a capitalism 2.0 and the way to do that is through like safe harbors on that like honestly maybe the best thing crypto can do for like the trad media world doesn't just recreate the platforms but give it a business model and like have massive societal impact where you have a business model that isn't inciting rage but like reassociating like ownership and and like realigning incentives like allowing you to pursue your vocation like you know even if it's like weird or odd or esoteric not a thousand through fans but a hundred or fifty it's like that's where you see the rub like we were talking about where the technology outpaces the the the institution like yeah zach may be an asshat but like sec is 50 years behind the times like they they're basically taxing my emails why can't i get paid on my content it's just like the the whiskey rebellion the regulatory details i'm not opposed to the taxing but they're poorly implemented i should tax the like fruits of the business as software instead of the email right like why can't i do that and so it just doesn't match the industry much less the opportunity and that's like deletorious for the government as well like again like what happened when we did this false fork was a massive explosion of value and that's like through the 90s budget surplus you may remember cap gains that might be one way to get out of the like no wind zone between inflation and recession like through this generation and like if we did that with a false fork through like divorcing content and like open source like maybe we can actually do this like and build our way out of it and so it's like a massive mass of opportunity and there's there's various examples you can go into but like if you have to sum it up communication is about vocation do what you like do what you're good at and like now we can do that through the communication rails themselves because you guys have this economy of ownership which is actually forcing the issue in a meaningful way how's that just absolutely i'm absolutely down for it and just to tie off this section with one one aspect i think we missed is there's i see a lot of parallels behind how governance was decided and debated in the rev the revolution and how governance is decided and debated here on in crypto and it's very much this emphasis on the public open square and you see these same behaviors but josh i'm wondering if you can kind of walk us through the parallels of of debate for how we should rule this nation how we should govern this nation for the united states of america before it became that and how crypto is also engaging in the similar conversations under similar structures for how we govern over our dows or how we govern over our protocols because you said the word building out in the open and that's some very much parallel alignment that we see between crypto and the united states and the american revolution and it's that like open permission list not just like of our businesses but also of our discourse i'm wondering if you could help us draw these parallels here yeah yeah yeah and that's actually that kind of that almost like seamlessly takes us into the the governance piece like literally around your identity that's like that's literally us building out an open in the public square to say how do you best do that so we're starting to see so in these kind of in this two unfold model you basically have like ryan to your point these these irl models of governance being ported into dows and that being kind of the first unfold and now you have new technological rails a capitalism 2.0 which allows you to like not only express identity but do association different ways and so you're seeing these things unfold and like hotly debated memes and posting but also like do you do it top down do you need a leader how should you you have tools like where government and debate has always been like a function of influencing someone right it's just like the business model i advertise to influence someone they take a series of actions and go down like now with crypto in an economic sense i can just directly tie incentivization to it i can pay someone or give them tokens to do that and have fractionalized equity in it but the same thing on governance i don't have to just like say hey who do i like or what have you i can like do nuance basically with tech rails that like let me do different things that wouldn't have been otherwise possible so you kind of start out decentralized chaos muddled up right like our first constitution everybody who has a token gets a vote okay then that like gets whales and craziness and da da da da da and like all right maybe we do electors and delegators and like kind of this next phase fine like you kind of have issues with that and that's kind of where we are we go back and forth between that and now with crypto actually you're seeing in this government debate like people playing around with different ideas on these tools for running governance right quadratic voting what if a fancy word like what if i what if i get five votes and i can use all five votes for one thing or i can use you know one vote for five issues basically i see how important it is or what if i have it weighted by history have i been there since the beginning not just like air drop and air drop in terms of governments or maybe i can do it by expertise which i can establish or maybe by on-chain action like we're essentially like speed running this governance model we've done the shift where we've taken irl models into crypto dows that's where we are right now and right now on discord you're seeing this unfold where we're starting to take new models and like apply them to ourselves and like i think in the broader governance piece we'll actually apply those new models to governance at the government at scale once we once uh now that we have like ownership on digitization so like yeah it's very much like parallel all the way through that and if you if you think we're just like making it up and this is a bunch of philosophy like even just the pure play communication standards there's like you know how do you decentralize or how do you have these sandboxes and safe spaces to play around with us we're doing it in the dows right now with governance but i think that will like work out into like government like that will act as a bidirectional doorway and go from synthetic you know dow world into uh into irl and we're starting to see that we're seeing that on the business and then we're seeing on the communication and we're gonna and we are starting to see that on the public goods as well which is a function of government and like examples you could say are like hey you know that's like you know maybe citizens ban service radio cbrs is like something that opened up and now there's like crypto tokenomic protocols that are requiring you know real world proof of actions and coverage right like helium and some other guys are doing this sort of thing and so now you have like a safe space and a sandbox where you're getting people to coordinate in different ways and like the the mechanics of that of how you do that in that dow that's one example of a dow all those are in the improvement proposals they call them hips you can read through them all that is on chain and so you have like a super successful way of creating like social coordination and alignment to solve a cold start problem on like communication broadcast layer done through a dow and like every improvement initiative is on chain so you can literally see how that so now you have this like sped up cycle time basically of like how best to social coordinate and i don't know what the answer is i know that we'll like see a thousand synthetic flowers blooming and uh it'll be uh it'll be you know complete craziness particularly when they start subsuming the public goods function so even pulling on that example like that just isn't like physical work you know from a dow doing different forms of governance in public square that also is them starting to give back and actually do public goods in this case like broadband access to citizens of a physical space in a city and so at some point this all starts to kind of pull together and like the way that works is all done in the public square you don't have to go to harvard to get an mba you can read every one of the dow improvement proposals and that'll give you more than like any lecture you've ever heard so that is i mean the the applying is the context of the revolution right and like the the three things the um the revolutionaries wanted we're in fighting for is value which we talked about and then this idea of um you know vocation and communication and uh you could start to see bankless listener the parallels here right it's like crypto is on the vacation side of things the new land of opportunity uh the ethereum dream maybe that is starting to replace the american dream as uh you know american our nation states start to to stagnate and the third uh element of this the reason the revolutionaries were fighting was for more representation more governance this was you know part of their identity and that again is a reason why we are rebelling and opting out of the old system in in um in pursuit of more autonomy of governance ability to coordinate with with our neighbors and i think a lot of us feel josh that um you know whether it's our web 2 platforms don't have a voice i mean i i have a twitter profile i don't have any like access to all of my followers i have no ability to like leave twitter if twitter censors me like i'm gone man i like i i could be permabanned right and so we are fighting in this in this web 3 revolution this crypto revolution for our governance as well and i know you made a point in some of the the notes that um you were thinking about for the show uh and i want to kind of like say this and get you to comment on it but um the revolutionaries importantly they did not burn the old order down okay but neither did they polit uh politely ask for permission to increase representation rather they tricked people into doing the right thing and you said later in some of your notes to us that the trick is that those who uh are exposed to the technology tend to adopt its values and this resonates deeply with us because as we often say on bank lists if they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values and this was the trick of the original revolutionaries too and part of why i really identify with this group of early american revolutionaries is because like i feel like sometimes in our present moment there's a lot of anger josh but there's a lot of anger and it's kind of like this burn it down sort of mantra burn it down i'm like okay burn it down all right but like what are you gonna replace it with guys like let's talk about what we're gonna build and so this is what i see in crypto is this movement towards building it but we're not asking for permission importantly wondering if you could dig into this topic a little bit and give us the his history oh no that's so good on so many levels that's uh yeah yeah now absolutely so that's uh so yeah we kind of go through why are you even doing this you can pursue yourself your economic interests you did that through communication now you have this idea of a calling your calling can be in the communication doing fan fiction or doing these other things like and so like how do you actually best achieve those goals using those coordination technologies and this this kind of gets into like identity like you're talking about which is really a function of like how revolutionary you would have seen it as of governance and so this idea of like independence it always in revolutionary thought it took an object we say oh independence from something like tyranny but for them is towards something to build like the basis for assembly like and so medieval use assigned an identity revolutionary chooses and like you exercise that through your vocation and like you're a builder at all costs you're not a burner you're building things and so like you're literally redefining your your community and this is this is the context of you know the old world piling on and like some people wanting to stay within hierarchy other people going into like sheer like uh anarchism but like you actually say no no i actually want to build and so in that sense it's like crypto is like this rebuilding of governance and community it literally is a nation in the sense of like imagine community insanity by currency consensual currency contracts and so like but not just in the us but across the globe right like crypto on these currencies on these contracts basically and as you built you joined communities and like you participated in governance and so like why crypto now basically it's it's a continuation of this great experiment not of burning it down that's what happened in the revolution as we fast forward like what happens after can we actually govern can we create can we generate can we live up to that renaissance dream land of opportunity whatever you want to call it and so like this governance that wasn't static we were continually playing around with it and like now crypto gives us these technological rails for meaningful reassessment but also the ability to recreate in new ways if you don't like something don't torch it like recreate it refine it like continue the more the perceive the more perfect union and do that like through authority of like these like uh sandboxes so people always say like yeah crypto you know speed runs finance and it's true but also speed runs governance like right like a thousand flowers blooming like through these ideas and so now we have this these sandboxes to try to recreate you don't like the old institutions you think you're not fair they're not fair you don't like the governance of them like yeah there's a place for like decentralized like what privacy anonymity for sure but so too there's also a place for like recreating these things using the new tools of like this technology like literally not just token count or identity but voting quadratic waiting proof of attendance in this sense it's like recreating the sandbox of identity and roles and like we've done all this like overweighting towards centralization and so now it's precisely in like the government's interest to do so and that's the trick like how do they adopt values but like you also have to be like crafty about how you go about it so just saying get out the pitchforks isn't super helpful in terms of like you're in the real world right you obey traffic signs you like get a speeding ticket you pay taxes presumably like you're already in this debate and so like you might as well participate in it in a meaningful way and the basic thought is like going back to the political theory of the age like leviathan company like governson government doesn't tend to give up power but it does tend to open the door to massive value creation once you've passed the point of it being more painful not to participate and it's here where crypto has this absolute advantage like it generates wealth but it also generates values revolutionary you you weren't into the loyalism thing because you'd already experienced self-sovereignty and construction community so that was no longer for you participating in those protocols the value generation as well the protocol from those ledgers as well as the communication protocol which was now just part of what you thought about every day like that created this value of independence and so that's the that's the trick when you're exposed to the technology and particularly communities intersecting with those technologies like they tend to adopt the values and that's like historically what happens when you have these epic changes of power structures some of it is generational aging your way in but also it's the stuff is too valuable not to use and so you have to kind of make the case get them to participate with it they adopt the values but you can also be really specific about it making the case that crypto is more valuable to the government through various things funding public goods with direct representation bitcoin kevin iwaki carbon credits what have you supporting hybrid local models if i have a restaurant or a coffee shop i can support my income just like the whiskey farmers with these new protocols where i don't need ppp and drive up you know a variety of inflation like it's actually like generative in these ways and so that's the that's the thing to like really think through like are you really interested in participating in this experiment and like that experiment means participating in the generation of it finding your true you vocation however you want to describe it and like pursuing that like it might be in communication it's going to be a function of how you organize not just yourself but how you organize those juxtaposed conditions communities like interacting with the government and like showcasing not burning it down but participating in it specifically around speed running the new types of governance paying for public goods and also acting as supplemental income in short have crypto take over government responsibility don't ask them to do it just start providing the things that government naturally does and that happens natively in a form of like as you generate wealth for yourself and for your neighbor and for public goods that's like the one of the tricks to it and where you do get those like cracks or chinks in the armor or like orthogonal like opportunities for trojan horses if they open up radio band go in there build a protocol incentivize and provide broadband access to citizens when the government wasn't able to do it far easier for them to say okay keep going um and so like it really gets to the heart of like are you up for this like some people aren't there are lots of people who remain loyalists and that was like the safe bet to make i had a great ui ux and like now with crypto you're forcing this issue and not just for the state but for you do you want to interact with it do you want to declare independence not to burn it down but to interact like with this great experiment and like the safe trade to make is like not doing it and if you're going to do it there's massive value to be unlocked by like generating your way out of it building out of the current economic situation like participating in the governments like speed running things inside the dows and then taking that back from the lab as best lessons into like the real world through daos that provide community and public goods and also take over the form of government just as pro bono just because that's like what it means to generate and if you do it right they won't even think about it just like you don't say there's an internet anymore you don't even remember the renaissances before like crypto will actually be this thing that like uh that like essentially forms a new nation like where we're acting in place of that for our good and for our neighbors and for everyone else's like it's a it means like building like if you want to be tough and you want to be like you know cool instead of saying burn it down like that's easy the tough thing to do is to put on your hard hat and build you're going to have to like participate in not enjoyable moments bear markets like that's the nature of the historical transformation there's going to be volatility as a sign of structural change public piling on like the idea is this is all open source in the public square you can like see it you can be at nobody and show up at a hacker house you can ask twitter and actually get answers on i get asked questions and get answers on twitter like that's the the thing you have to think about like is it for you after you tear it down then what we've already done that now we're in the next phase of like what are you going to build and how are you going to interact and so really crypto doesn't just change governance it changes you who you are your relationship to others and that's what we call like governance through community and like communication around that and like with value construction so like the question is like now that you've torn it down now that we've been building now that we've carried on this debate we have the tech implementation like toolkit to do this again at scale in a meaningful way so what are you going to do is the question which kind of takes us to action items i guess before we get there the at scale part is something i really want to to drill down on there there's this meme and crypto that everything is going to have a token uh and if that if something's got a token well then you bring a community along with it as well and then there's a theory that's that's going out there is that well if you have a token you can also have your own layer two if you want that as well so that is also a possibility and where this drives parallel with the progress of the united states of america these communities with shared values and like at this point in time shared physical location could go out into the frontier and draw a line around their community and be like new nation except the except it wasn't a new nation state it was just a new state and this is how the united states of america formed these communities with shared values existed in the same spots and they're like all right we are now going to make the state of minnesota and that is who we are we're the minnesotans and this was uh it was the layer two to the federal organizational structure of the united states and so you know we're kind of limited by land here we only made it out to 50 50 states inside the united states but on ethereum and on there's just and even cosmos with all the app chains they have an infinite array of the possibilities of producing a community with a boater around it not only is a token a border a nap chain is a border a layer two is a border and all the people that align with these things can go show up there and so we are no longer restricted by 50 states we have thousands and thousands of layer twos of tokens of communities that can be born here and each one experiments with governance each one takes a lesson and they apply it and they see if it works and if it works all other daos all other orgs get to copy this and this is the same thing that's also true with states state constitutions there is 50 state constitutions and they have 50 different sets of laws and some laws are so good that they get adopted at the federal level and they get propagated across all the states and this is not true just like on at an ideological level this is also true down to the code where we have these evm equivalent layer twos like arbitrary and optimism that if a eip goes into optimism or arbitrary and it works that eip also works on ethereum and it also works on every other layer two as well and so we have this ability this this infinite slate of experimentation unfolding us where so many experiments get to run in parallel and just like how i talked about like well we had the renaissance we had the revolution and now we're in the crypto revolution this one is blessed with these new technologies to scale out this innovation and and and uh development of governance and so as soon as we get something right we don't get something right for one dow all downs get it right it's it's public domain infrastructure yeah man that's so good there's a like the renaissance fractures the medieval world so now you have different communities and the question is like how do those coexist and like can you actually learn from one another and like with american experiment we do this in ways with safe harbors and what have you but you have this like layered dual federacy right like how do you have different like communities that are like formalized and then you have these informal communities like appalachia whiskey like moonshiners is almost a dow like how do you do that and so like you'll you'll start you'll see those same dynamics right now everything you're saying is true for sure we're seeing that happen within the synthetic space dow it out like chained to chain um but i i also think the massive unlock that crypto's doing is is it's opening these worlds basically where you'll have you know layered composition between irl and crypto where you'll have so nft is a strong property right it's not just pixelated cats actually establishing like bi-directionality between irl and between the synthetic world and so the lessons you learn in the synthetic world like i predict won't just remain in the synthetic world the best practices coming out of those petri dishes will like work their way into the real world maybe informally at first like appalachian whiskey dao but like also maybe like into states and like rights as well and that'll probably happen through like economics first where i can like generate in the synthetic world and enjoy the fruits in real world and vice versa and like that's uh that's where crypto is like an economic model starts empowering like irl business models and governance i think you're gonna see the first unfold as we figured out in the lab in crypto and using the lessons we've learned from history and the second unfold is where we take the best practices from crypto and like port them back into the real world maybe economically maybe through public goods and then maybe like at scale through new forms of governance i know it sounds crazy but like that's how it tends to happen a hundred years from now 200 years from now and like the key is you get to participate in it david to your point like this is all publicly available you can look at any of the improvement proposals right like how crazy is that like you can propagate it on chain or if you're doing something else completely crazy all this is available to you and so like it just forces the question with these new tools like what are you going to do like burn something down in the corner fine great and now what all right now we're now we're now we're in this great experiment and we have these tools in our toolkit so that's like the most meaningful interesting like part of the communication but it's also kind of the scariest because it forces the issue like what are you gonna do um and that kind of i guess takes us to like what let's talk about what we're gonna do i mean so we we that this is um fourth of july independence day in the us of course and we've we've talked about so far with you josh how many uh things we have in common on the crypto journey with the revolutionaries in the american war for for independence and all sorts of people groups of post post-renaissance that were uh revolting at that time and looking for more freedom in a better world right and so we went through kind of what are they fighting for freedom of value freedom of vocation and also freedom of governance and identity um so now let's talk about the the practical side the action items because i know josh you always love to leave us with some action items so i do i love that you guys do that it's so good everybody else just talks and you're like no do this i mean like what do we do we're on a journey together right so it's important so okay so i hear what you're saying i want to partake in this revolution i don't want to be a loyalist right i am excited about this great experiment and where it's going to go and i don't i know it's not perfect and i want to do my part in building it and proving it okay what do i do and i think you've got three things for us uh take us to the first one what do we do first josh yeah so this is great so this is and just to like set the stage this isn't crypto is the renaissance that's one lens kryptos revolution this is this is the story throughout all these ages you're just looking at it through different lenses and different chapters of it and so these things are particularly like i think salient to our times and ryan to your point if you're not gonna burn it down then you're gonna participate right so how do i actually participate in this and there's like this is a unique moment in time like not pejorative not just repeating the same thing but like we have these rare opportunities every few hundred years right to actually do something to have like meaningful impact for pursuing like self other like meaning and so like again this is gonna sound mundane just like you're like wait there's a revolution over like t taxes what this is gonna sound stupid and boring and be unpleasant but this is what you need to do like the real meaning is in an actual like building like in any way the first is to get political which sounds horrible and trust me no one i i understand that completely but it really is time for kind of crypto to grow up and there's like great meaningful places for anan completely private that's awesome but there's also like very meaningful unlocks by getting clear regulation around a specific type of policy with and that has a strong precedent in our history so we've seen today and that's really like this great experiment discovered a political structure that yielded amazing results from a specific model that's clear demarcation of safe spaces sandboxes safe harbors with unencumbered space to experiment and we didn't do it top-down we didn't create a department of innovation or a centralized sandbox agency we worked within our current immediate context we used a variety of these tools trips ticks and tools tips tricks and techniques um to carve out these spaces tricking people into doing the right thing by getting them to interact with the technology like pick up the values showcasing the value of what we're able to create our way out and like explaining how it's mutually beneficial and that really means practically just getting our points in order right start with one thing win and move on and pick something i personally think stable coins is a great example trick them into doing the right thing fuse the dollar as preeminent by adopting the new tech through a stablecoin without falling off in a centralized currency is a fast easy option make the default choice the easier thing to do say hey government you do a great job we have a choice you can build something or you can just like do what you're doing and let us take care of it and we'll give you all this value just by tying it to it like make the default thing easier to do or these uh trojan horse orthogonal approaches right like fcc opens up citizen's band radio service build something that's as valuable as like verizon out of it instantly with millions of people using it all over china broadcasting where they can't shut it down like when you have a crack like build value there and like take advantage of it and then like cherry on the top actually use it to like fund public goods that the government wasn't giving without raising the tax base so like get political means getting points in order like exploiting trojan horses and like really highlighting these these economic and social advantages like everybody kind of gets idea me trad media business model isn't great and sites like you know like rage like what if you have ownership across a distribution curve what if that generation creates budget surpluses and gets you out of economic like difficulty like what if value creation is important for like a demographic workforce like play the story forward what happens we're now as of this year last year like now going to have smaller and smaller workforce every year as boomers retire and gen z is not into it like what do you do like how does that work well crypto if a third the american workforce is about enforcing dumb contracts like crypto gets us out of like massive demographic structural like issues for the next 100 years and like fundamentally like participate and like highlight ground up organization for like local creation and supply trains that can mean like community support for public goods benefiting yourself and others through these through these models the space behind me was a drug den in the neighborhood we changed it by running a 500 box or 500 bucks and no coding we turned to drugged in and to communicate community education center like that may only work in places like kentucky where real estate's cheap but you can use crypto to actually solve like public good issues basically and so all that is available to you so get political which means engaging with governance get your points in order and like specifically like really think through how to exploit these chinks by building value and like actually creating public goods and just experimenting play with it play with it in your neighborhood so that's the first one josh and by the way you did that transformation of the space behind you through like running helium notes using the surplus there is is that correct to like transform the space and pay for that from that yeah it was it was this little experiment where this was a old uh old bourbon bar that fell into dilapidation and it's down the street from churchill and it was just drugged on heroin fire after heroin fire and so the property was was cheap and so we we literally mortgaged it again like oncoming fruits of like proof of coverage steak you can use helium but use whatever you want to and so it was basically the idea of how do you take a physical cost center and turn it generative so instead of having police come by and all sorts of nefarious activity and the property value of all the neighborhood being depressed we actually used crypto as like tokenomics to like solve this issue basically and created like we use it for office space and then do different community events and things like that downstairs all that done not through government intervention but like raising like like generating through these things and then the helium tokens actually validate go back to providing broadband access to people for free in need so like that's just like one example of like i'm not saying you have to do that but there's there's stuff out there web 2 will serve it up to you and you've kind of gotten used to that crypto allows you to find it there's 20 other things like this you can do but the point is like play with it what do you have to lose you know 500 bucks and default on something like okay like actually see is it possible does this get into your second so the first is get political action item what's the second josh yeah the second is get building so like just the easiest way to achieve and persistent of independence is to build and do so at scale especially when markets are up and down and so like traditionally web 2 like the values in your code and if you can code that's great but like this is back to vocation again right finding what you like to do and what you're good at like if you can code great if you can't it doesn't matter build community build content build conviction build build yourself learn read listen watch use the products and services find your calling and embrace this like generative work ethic and like one way to do it without spending any money you can spend 500 bucks do something like that where like if you don't want to do that like turn your cost centers into generation like literally crypto like moves you know it allows like early adopters to have like these these it follows an arc basically right it tends like these historical transformations tend to follow a path it tends to start in finance right because it's most value then you go into culture art and identity construction so you go from tokens to nfts then work how you organize to achieve these community goals and like association with one another which is like dowsing what have you and then education to propagate it which we're seeing on proof of attendance and experience and then finally where it becomes a business model like the whiskey rebellion to literally allow you to do frontline work and like impact value so find the things that you use for your day job or for your personal self as an entrepreneur and these aren't necessarily overlapping like find the web two things you do make a list of costs and services and then go out and like find the web3 version where you don't pay for it but where you earn tokens which can be traded for dollars in many cases like through participation and so like that's like literally tactically what you can do like you listen to music it's 10 bucks for spotify for you if you run a coffee shop downstairs this is 15k to license to bmi or otherwise the lawyers are literally calling you up that's their business model turn it off run audios rent space like run proof of coverage helium is one example you need to work or hire use a community entity join a data if you don't create anything join your you're you're interacting and participating and creating value for someone else to distill through your data join a data dao you can simply use an internet browser with a basic attention token like it's not just creation it's actually ownership and like it doesn't cost you that much and like by the way if you get into it there's all sorts of like weird little american spirit entrepreneurial like businesses you can build on top of these things like super easy and quick even without coding and like the point of the story is like get building especially like where it becomes a way of doing business starting with yourself turning your cost centers into like revenue generating things just like the moonshiners did with like corn and whiskey i i know there's three because good things always come in threes uh so we got get political get building what's the third josh yeah and this is this these are gonna be the least popular like action items ever but the other is like help others right like if you're listening to this like you likely if you're listening to bank list you know more than someone else out there most likely you're an elder states person in the movement it may not feel that way but we're incredibly early and you're here right now people are paying attention to you like watching closely what you do so help others i don't mean to financially only like by sharing information supporting others learning with others building out in the open and especially around public goods i think this is something like not glamorous or sexy but will become increasingly important in the idea of like regulation and crypto being more than just for you know crypto votes and value creation like literally can crypto like take over the function of government in meaningful ways by providing public goods so you have a cause or an interest like find the crypto version of that and participate within your calling however explore the governance models like we're talking about participate and learn like and fund them with this new generative value like one example we talked about was that broadband access in san jose provided through this network like it's literally construct the models right now they're being built donors providing liquidity for a movement or a cause progressively unlocking functions verified by an action on chain whatever it is carbon sequestration pain farmers plant trees open source pharma ip supported with staking yeah at a lower yield but still supported monetized by ownership with residual rights going back to the benefactor not just you but in the dao with cause it's like great experiment indeed and like the core crazy part about this is it's not just altruism it's something more like it's generative when you give when you gave that broadband access away it actually like created stronger network effects for decentralized ownership like in other words like crypto pays you to learn about it crazy crypto pays you to participate in it complete insanity and perhaps most radically of all like crypto pays you to help other people those inside the community and those outside is your onboarding and here i could give a little tirade about pluralism which like i'll just kind of like pass over maybe like just ever so briefly like tribalism's super important in early days of adoption movements but like as you coexist in these juxtaposed systems like it becomes much more important to like recognize other use cases like for variety c5 d5 kyc ainon and again think outside your immediate generational demographic associate demographic these are other layers uses protocols governance like gaming high speed cold storage infinite archival persistence we talk about like layer different chains there's these other things out there from r weave to graph there are other pieces and design decisions it's like we're responsible for others but we also benefit when things are a patchwork of pluralism so you can't pull one thread and everything unravels and like if you believe your values are the most the most generative and the most contagious like let it run pluralism isn't just tolerating others it's like using your creation to benefit them and that kind of just like takes me to like if i had to sum everything we've talked about and this is a lot of complex stuff so i definitely appreciate it like crypto is like really the crypto renaissance was about like this advent of choice this massive unlock of hot unwinding of hierarchy unlock of opportunities and so crypto's independence is about what we choose to do with that opportunity what we choose to build and how we use the creation for others is a continuation of this great american experiment how much centralization where do we draw lines how do we create like safeguards the renaissance was always reforming crypto is a new independent nation is always pursuing a more perfect union vigilant against this institutional craft by carving out sandboxes and places to try and fail in public and pursuit of a more perfect union like if i can leave the listeners with one thought like if you're into crypto you're into a story echoing throughout the ages renaissance revolution now right now in this moment in history is about what you choose to do and like i'd like to invite you to build to continue this great experiment to find your calling what you like and what you're good at and to pursue it at all costs like liberty or death like down to zero in the service of yourself and your neighbor to generate value something for yourself and others in this new economic model that gives you ownership through participation to build business models for meaning from like from media for society like broadcasting and content that draw value not from in citation but by reuniting ownership with participation experiment and governance representing yourself and others with similar and even conflicting goals through these new tools of social coordination especially public goods for community members and then finally i'd like to invite you to do this all in public to learn out loud share your learnings and your failures not because it's easy because that's how we build through it and when we fail and we're going to repeatedly fail just like we have throughout like to see volatility not as evidence of pointlessness but as a leading indicator of the historically meaningful structural transformation and to persevere in order to benefit yourself and those who come after you even those who are unaware of your efforts are outright antagonistic to your pursuit especially now to persist in exploring this opportunity and keep you resolved to achieve a more perfect union and to you citizens of the new nation i wish you a happy independence eh josh thank you so much for walking us through this was that okay that was a lot of stuff it was all over the place i apologize if i didn't go down this rabbit hole or that rabbit it's like it's kind of crazy i can't believe like we did all that no not at all not at all we still have to close it out um so so i'll put some thoughts in here um there's a line that you said in the show josh about how the revolution was the logical conclusion of the renaissance right you you get the renaissance you add some time the renaissance goes in a thousand different directions and it converges on the american revolution and then we do that same thing uh and now here we are but we are unique like like i keep on emphasizing the renaissance took two to three hundred years to fully manifest the american revolution that was like a hundred year endeavor of like a fight and then and then a debate as to how to govern the crypto revolution is gonna happen a lot faster just because that's how time works we are we're speed running the history of money and finance and we're getting this all done inside like 20 30 years and so we are all very fortunate to not only be in this part of history but to consciously know it that is also such a unique thing it's like we also know where we are in history and it is thanks to historians like josh that we are allowed to place ourselves in this very unique moment in history and so i i also beg to the listener just like how josh is is take that responsibility on your shoulders because while the crypto world feels big and chaotic it's actually very small and it's actually very moldable and it's it's you the listener that actually gets to dictate some of the future direction of this industry and so josh thank you for allowing us to place ourselves in history and hopefully these action items make listeners more biased towards action itself and we can build through this bear market together yeah it's a higher calling everyone has i mean you can this is going to happen regardless and it's going to speed run um not just finance but also governance and then like port back those lessons and like you can wait you can wait until things are polished and the markets are de-risked and ui ux of web 3 is as easily easy for you as cyclin on web 2's interfaces but like you actually get to make history that that never happens where you do that knowingly like you get a you get cosmically meaningful calling at this moment right now you get a po app for the great experience like they won't give you credit and if you do it right they won't even think about it but it's it's a stunning opportunity and like worst case like you get to participate in history and if you don't like where things are then like actually put on your hard hat and get building well said josh um we'll end it there and uh just a recap of the action items so josh says go get political get building help others along the way another action item we have for you is go listen to the crypto renaissance episode if you haven't already we'll include a link into the show notes and of course we want to say happy independence day and this is not an american holiday this is also a crypto independence for everyone outside of the u.s and inside of the u.s this is why we are on the bankless journey is looking for independence that's our quest that's our mission it's what we're here to do so go drink some whiskey for the fourth consider your role as a nation builder and are you a federalist or an anti-federalist this is the debate we're having in
