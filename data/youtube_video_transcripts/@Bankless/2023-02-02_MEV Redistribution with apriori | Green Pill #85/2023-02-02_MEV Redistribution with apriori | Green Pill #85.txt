foreign [Music] ation on the pot today we have a priori Xerox who is an Anon or semi-anon who is working on Mev and Med redistribution they wrote this post called random half-paked thoughts on Mev redistribution about a month ago and so this podcast is all about Mev redistribution so if you're just tuning in or if you're not technical Mev is basically a category of opportunities where people can earn Revenue uh by by capturing value from the mempool so if you're not deep on blockchain architecture these words might not mean anything to you but basically Mev is maximum extractable value when a transaction gets submitted to the mempool if you're a minor or someone who has access to the mempool you can insert a type of transaction that will capture value for yourself into the mempool and then execute it in order to extract value an example of that would be that you The Listener submits a transaction where you're going to buy some uni for X price and I have a transaction in which I'm selling uni at X plus one price and an Mev a transaction would be in between those two things buying the sorry uh selling or buying the um the the tokens at a smaller price and then selling them at a higher price and just it all executes in the same block but but the Mev person is able to extract value by monitoring the mempool and looking for those Arbitrage opportunities not all Mev is arbitrage but that's just a simple example so uh Mev is really interesting it's just this rabbit hole and a prior reacts Xerox has been thinking about this a lot why am I covering this why am I taking you down the rabbit hole There's an opportunity to do redistribution with Mev AKA redistributing profits to anyone other than the person who's doing the Arbitrage so what if we could fund public goods with Mev is sort of the idea of this episode is that even a good idea is it even an ethical vehicle to do that is another thing that comes up in this episode so one of the most deeply technical episodes that we've done but I see a lot of upside in Mev redistribution in funding public goods in the future there's also a lot of thorny governance and Technical problems in it which is makes for good podcast content but um yeah so I I think that you're going to see over the next quarter I'm hoping to do three to five episodes on Mev redistribution I put it up there with civil defense and digital identity as one of the most important things to understand in this nascent blockchain ecosystem to figure out and and to develop into something that could be more regenerative for the world so tldr a priori is an Mev researcher who cares about redistribution who cares about public goods and in this episode we go full circle uh on the technical on the technical applications here into how it could be applied to fund public goods and create a more regenerative crypto economic economy and we we wrap it all up by talking about the most interesting techniques in what's hot and where are things going to land on various l2s and layer ones in the future so this is a field to watch if you're interested in going deep on Mev this episode is for you if you're not maybe it's one to skip but uh I think it's a really good one and I learned a lot from talking to a prairie Xerox so without further Ado let's go deep down the Mev redistribution Rabbit Hole I hope you enjoy coordination working

good I I really like your uh your Anon name a priori uh that means uh knowledge deduced from theory is is that right yeah that's right nice so we're gonna go uh deep on Mev today I'll be curious how much of the knowledge that we have is a priori versus empirical um which is deduced from observation so um maybe we'll just start with the basics what is what is Mev and and um you know what's your background in working on it sure um so I would say that the the deeper I go or the more that I learn um the more that I don't know the answer to that question but uh I believe the term was coined in The Flash Boys 2.0 uh white paper which was released in 2020 with uh Phil Diane and a bunch of other uh esteemed authors from Cornell and uh they coined the term maximal or minor extractable value which meant uh that a miner could uh basically position themselves as being in the privileged position in producing a block uh to reorder insert their own transactions or sensor transactions to basically create the most profitably packed block and extract some value from those behaviors and as we have shifted to proof of stake world uh with not just ethereum but most blockchains in general um that's our maximal extractable value has has come to represent that um another way to think about it is um overlapping user preferences kind of create this value in the system that can be captured and sophisticated actors within the supply chain are able to go ahead and capture that value if they know what they're doing go a little bit deeper I would say that generally the most well understood types of Mev are sandwiches Arbitrage and liquidations that's those are broad categories there are certainly more in depth sandwiches refer to uh when a bot would front-run you um let's say they find a user trade that has maybe five percent slippage or something on uniswap V2 they'll go ahead and place a front running order uh jack up the price uh and then you will go ahead and get filled at that Max slippage tolerance and then they'll go ahead and turn around and back run you and capture that uh Arbitrage opportunity there that's not great for users because you got filled at a worse price and then also to um you're already uh you're already down on your markout p l from like 60 seconds after the trade which also isn't great yeah um in terms of Arbitrage obviously like amms require some amount of Arbitrage to keep prices in line with off-chain order books or centralized exchanges wherever the liquidity is so it's kind of a necessary function one of the most popular types is back running and then you also have liquidations which play a key role in all of the lending protocols with respect to uh being able to capture some collateral at a discount and then go ahead and sell it and make that operation profitable and actually like liquidation sometimes can be um the most profitable form of Mev and maybe one liquidation opportunity will capture more Mev than in the entire month based off of different on-chain activity like when we have high volatility and those are kind of generally the different three types of Mev cool let me just play some of that back just for the audience to hear it again so um Mev is basically the category of incentives that miners or you know whoever's whoever's executing transactions um have to profit from the transactions in the mempool so when you sign a transaction in metamask it goes into a mempool with a bunch of other transactions and there is a setup where the people who are executing those blocks are getting um a block reward and transaction fees for executing those transactions but there's another way that people can profit from those transactions which is by um sandwiching transactions or inserting their own transactions so basically you're buying token X at um or you're selling token X at price at one uh one die per token and I'm buying it at 115 per token and so someone inserts a transaction in between there because they have access to the mempool and makes it a little bit of extra profit on top of that so it's the category of of opportunities for for people who are have access to the mempool to get their own transactions in for for more profit and that's how I think about Mev and sort of as Layman's turns terms as I can get uh is that close at all is there any corrections that you want to make no I think I think that's a good uh framework um and then the only other two things that I would add which I think the listeners should be aware of long tail Mev so these are opportunities that don't come up very often on chain um it could be something like a more recent one was there was a board Apes uh yoga Labs land meant for their other other side deed land tokens and or nft rather and um somebody came up with the idea of well if I do a flash flow and borrow an ape from this lending protocol I can go ahead and then you know mint the token return the eight back to the lending protocol repay the flash loan and then capture that value of whatever the nft was worth minus the expense to put on that position so there are opportunities like that where there's some people that are incredibly skilled in writing um solidity or even in lower level uh Yule Assembly Language and can really make gas efficient contracts and then are just very creative in identifying some of these opportunities the other thing is that sometimes like protocols that might not necessarily be very popular um might have you know Mev that can be linked from them but because nobody is paying attention uh there are opportunities that are there for the taking like it could be like a lending protocol that most people aren't aware of but there are still liquidations that need to be processed so a Searcher might say hey like this is profitable for me and then the other uh piece is this newer one uh for a uniswap V3 which is just in time liquidity which some people might have heard about where basically um about we'll go ahead and they'll sense an opportunity where a large trade is in the mempool and it's going to be executed they'll go ahead and front run that trade and add liquidity just in time and go ahead and capture that fee uh from that trade so it actually comes at the cost of uniswap passive liquidity providers unfortunately for them but actually for the Trader it it leads to a better fill and then they can turn around and have a background transaction right after that as well and capture that profit so just two others to to be aware of nice yeah it feels like this whole category of uh profit opportunities with Mev and I'd love to just like put a pin on Mev now that we've established that there's an opportunity for tokens to be made here and uh pivot to talking about Mev risk redistribution so um you've written a post about this and I'm curious if we could just start with what's the definition of Meb redistribution sure so the idea would be that either a protocol at the application or maybe like easier to think about like an application specific blockchain is able to capture some Mev and then redistribute that either back to users who are using the protocol or maybe if it's a DEX like liquidity providers or um you know they might just decide that the best thing to do is to burn the token um which obviously helps the token holders of the protocol or they might use it to subsidize new users in the future um the there is to my knowledge there is no nothing live in production yet with this type of model but um the high level idea behind it is that you're able to capture some of this profit and redistribute either to the protocol or use it for some greater good like maybe um funding public goods so it feels like Mev redistribution is just the opportunity to take Mev and instead of putting in the miners Pockets maybe there's some reason that they want to distribute it to another actor in the system of which a subset of that could be public goods funding that's right yeah so um yeah I mean I will we'll we'll have a link to your post in the show notes here but I'm curious if you can kind of give us the high level uh of the post so the post title is random half big thoughts on Mev redistribution and you published it about a month ago so I'm curious to hear some of those random half-baked uh thoughts on Meb redistribution for sure um so the post came from uh I got the idea from Shin uh at uh sexy sun one on Twitter he's uh flashbots uh collaborator researcher and you put forth this idea um and I kind of riffed on it and my idea is that If the product Market fit or the ultimate use case of blockchains is to disintermediate financial institutions because we can basically unbundle an investment bank with defy and put all the Primitives on chain themselves then blockchains are uniquely positioned to actually capture this Mev that takes place in the Legacy Financial World which is very instrumental to the revenue models of all these Banks and different firms there and so as we have more Fiat dollars that are converted to crypto coins via like things like usdc or or tether more volume and liquidity comes on chain there's going to be more opportunities to capture MAV and so having that model uh thinking through well um you know what is the best way then to maximize this opportunity for the ecosystem and uh optimism put out a post a couple years ago on youth research called Neva with this notion of Mev auctions and selling block space in advance um and basically selling the rights to sequence transactions for a given amount of blocks I'm not sure if they've settled on the the specification implementation details on you know how to go about that but high level the ideas like you could auction off maybe like 10 blocks and say okay you know you have the right Alice so you sequence the transactions in these 10 blocks there might be some other rules associated with the sequencing but you're willing to pay uh in advance and then the protocol is able to capture a profit minus the expenses that they're also incurring and then they can use some of those profits in either maybe like go to a community pool or do something like retroactive public goods funding recently the cosmos ecosystem put out a a white paper for atom 2.0 which was a revamp of the cosmos Hub tokenomics and one of the ideas within there was to have this notion of a scheduler who could schedule block space in advance and then use some of that Revenue to feed a different contract called the allocator which would then go and do things like provide liquidity to help bootstrap you know token liquidity or to fund uh Venture startup project public goods which actually the cosmos Hub does have a very good track record of of doing those things within their ecosystem so those are kind of like the two that we've seen so far ideas that have been elevated I would say another thing to consider is that a lot of times this is going to get pushed to Layer Two because it's not feasible to capture Mev on layer one fun public goods and I think the reason being is that there has historically been an EIP I don't remember what it is offhand which proposed this very early on which was swiftly rejected and then in addition to that in ethereum at the base layer aims to be credibly neutral so it's very difficult to coordinate and say we want to fund these public goods right because you're going to have a whole group of people that disagrees with that notion as well and you also lose some of your credible neutrality in that way so at the base layer there's actually been some great research uh to ruin chitra I wrote a paper about uh Mev smoothing basically redistributing the Mev to the validators in the network but doing it on a smooth basis so everybody is able to capture some of that rather than it just going to either large staking pools and then there's also a great eth research post by um Francesco I think his handle is frad map we wrote a couple years ago about committee based Mev smoothing on how to implement this and then there's also a more nuanced recent post by uh domothe at the EF who wrote about uh proposer auctions in burning Mev so that's kind of the layer one combo but at Layer Two you have this ability because of the way that the sequencer is so integral in the operation of the roll-up where they're your Builder and you can you know auction off that right to potentially sequence transactions now like there is an opposing view to this and the opposing view is um it's kind of the religious divide within the Mev community and that is auctions versus Fair ordering and um some people believe that you know Mev is bad and it's theft and it's stealing and therefore um you know you should just have these Fair ordering protocols that order transactions as they come in with network latency first come first serve um and then you have some kind of agreement on those transactions uh before they go through consensus and maybe you have like some kind of like ZK snark as well attached to them um great work that's being done there uh is a protocol called Themis it's being researched by uh Cornell umna calcar actually shiram Kanan uh also an author of that paper as well I believe Ari Jules is involved in that work too uh arbitrum is more so looking to implement that approach however recently actually Shin from the flashbotch team put forth a proposal to actually have this notion of auctions prior to Fair Suite sequencing so maybe like you take two seconds you do an auction and then after that auction you're you're locking your order of transactions and then you're going ahead and going through the uh block production pipeline time and so that could be a way to kind of get the best of both worlds and so the post was kind of riffing on that well Mev exists and it's only going to get bigger so we might as well think about what are the ways to capture it and redistribute it to refuel and refund the ecosystem and to me that's very important because a lot of times Venture funding within crypto I've noticed uh will dictate whatever the next meta is and where people are interested in terms of building and sometimes people won't build a public good because they don't think that they can get funding for it so they'll go out and they'll maybe like some ZK application that they know that they can get funding for not saying that's a bad idea but you you're unable then um to stay as an ecosystem while we need this you know uh BLS signature wallet let's say and really get a lot of good funding uh behind it and if you're able to capture Mev and redistribute it you actually allow some of these ecosystems to be self-sustaining um you allow the community of the ecosystem then to dictate where the funding goes and you're less reliant on Venture funding and with retro public goods funding as I understand it it's kind of the symbiosis now between Venture and the community where you're able to then still get an exit at the end of um at the end of the term and still be profitable as a venture so you have this you know other carrot as well yeah if we go together on this then we can kind of mushroom this out so amazing I'm just going to play back what I heard and uh feel free to interject any corrections so um at the layer one there's Mev auctions Mev smoothing and I'm just doing very high level for the audience uh here to give them a topology but Mev auctions Mev smoothing at the layer one proposer auctions and burning Mev and then there's also since ethereum's got this modular architecture you have all these different l2s who have their own Mev road map so it's almost like in the United States how we have 50 states that can craft legislation that could be adopted at the layer one which is the federal government uh you almost have this this kind of like experimentation in these Sovereign layer twos that uh is ex that is that is also happening that is kind of a fractal uh or reflection of the layer one um and then across the breadth of this topology of people who are exploring this um there's basically a debate of like okay well uh should we be trying to capture and decentralize Mev or should we be trying to get rid of it because it's theft and it's stealing um and we should have Fair ordering protocols so auctions or sorry capture versus Fair ordering um is is kind of like maybe capture and and like equal access uh to mevs democratizing access to Mev versus Fair ordering which is eliminating it and your take and I don't put words in your mouth this is just what I heard is the meav exists we might as well figure out how to deal with it and the opportunity that you see is that Venture funding in web3 often dictate dates to the next Meta Meta just stands for most efficient tactic available and If Venture funding dictates the next meta is that a good thing what if we could do funding for ecosystems with Mev and displace the VCS with that opportunity okay so that's my rundown of everything I heard from you what did I miss where would you want to correct the record I think you nailed it um I think the only thing that I didn't include would would be to say like there's a lot of data that shows that uh auctions actually have increased the overall welfare of users in the system with respect to like fills on prices there's even a research to run a paper uh going into this I did a talk at Bogota I think it was called the quality feudalism where he talked about um you know actually sandwiches can potentially even improved order routing for vex aggregators so maybe some kind of sandwich but overall everybody else gets a better fill and so like there's a lot of data that supports some of these ideas and there's not necessarily that much yet to support uh Fair ordering um and then there's also some questions about like information theory is there a lower bound on Mev anyway yeah but yeah I think you totally nailed it I think you got where what I was trying to say you did a great job I think you nailed it I'm just trying to keep up and summarize for the audience so I guess I'm I'm curious how you see this ecosystem developing in the next couple years which projects are you excited about um if I'm a regen uh which mechanisms and projects should I should I pay attention to in like the real for me the cherry on top was like okay so there's gonna be all this experimentation at the layer two what's gonna end up happening on the L1 like uh the beacon chain um it that to me feels like like the end game of all of this Mev research like because the l2s are kind of their own little Sovereign Place for experimentation but where does the ethereum L1 end up on this is it just status quo is there going to be an EIP that changes the status quo so anyway I asked you a lot of questions wrapped up in one uh it's my sandwich attack of a question back to you but like what are you excited about and where does the ethereum L1 end up sure I'll start uh with what I'm excited about definitely a bit of a roll-up Maxi um very excited about uh well obviously optimism um I love their Community I think um like I think a lot of people are very bought into the vision and just from what I've seen with like various different movements uh in crypto you need this type of spiritual or Vibe component to actually build something sustainable so I'm very excited about optimism also there are architecture of Bedrock is highly modular and so far optimism I believe has had the most forked code base out of any roll-up so the op stack um you know I know they're still working on Canon and getting fraud proofs live but the op stack in general might be a way for ethereum Roll-Ups to just kind of fork and um spin up kind of like the cosmos SDK in this way so I'm very excited about that project um and then also they've done some great work on 4844 contributing there as well um obviously ZK Roll-Ups are very exciting I think Tycho is super interesting there's a trade-off space between these type 1 Roll-Ups and these type four Roll-Ups where you are being extremely if you're uh you're being exactly ethereum equivalent but your proving time is very slow so uh so sorry I want to make sure the audience is clear on this is that the difference between a type 1 and a Type 4 uh is aquarium ethereum equivalence versus some other some other trade-off or I'm just looking at the definition of those two types of of Roll-Ups yeah that's right so ethereum equivalents and the ZK roll-up means that nothing is modified there is no modification of the gas op codes uh like it's just another instantiation of ethereum that's being put through a ZK circuit and proven versus a Type 4 like um let's say a stark net runs a different type of virtual machine and so while they do have some ethereum compatibility because you can um take solidity and put it through this warp transpiler and get it down into this uh Cairo bike code it's not quite ethereum equivalent in this way because you're not matching the evm and so there's this trade-off space basically where potentially you could get more performance uh as a Type 4 faster proving times maybe cheaper verification but you lose uh your ethereum equivalence basically cool too so I just want to connect this back for the listener um optimism is famous famous for bragging about how little they've changed Geth uh in their code base so they're type 1 exactly the same as the ethereum made I think I've actually heard them say like we we want to be ethereum whereas something like a stark net or a ZK roll up might have a different type of virtual machine underneath of it which presents new opportunities but also challenges under underneath of it is is that on target yeah I think that's a good framing I would just say that um there hasn't really actually been anything written in terms of like optimistic Roll-Ups and how equivalence I'm just basically framing it off of vitalik's article that he wrote um about you know what types of ZK Roll-Ups so but yeah I mean I know optimism is is very much uh trying to go down that path of ethereum equivalence and um they have this potentially really cool mips machine uh fraud proof scheme uh when Canon launches so looking forward to that as well but not to dive too much into the roll-up stuff um in terms of layer one uh Justin Drake's done some great research on this uh Alex obadia as well and others um there's a lot of solutions to various different problems that could come up uh with respect to Mev so one that a lot of people know about is this idea of proposer Builder separation right now we have map boost which is kind of this out of protocol proposer Builder separation and we're actually getting to learn about the actors and kind of what are the needs of the system and what are the trust assumptions and where do things break down so I think that's great that we could test that so PBS is something that long-term uh should be implemented in protocol another one that I'm very excited about is single slot finality so this is similar to what you would see in tendermint where basically you can achieve finality on every block today in ethereum you don't you achieve finality over um to epochs which is 64 slots so it's maybe about 13 minutes give or take um and uh in a tenderment based system you're achieving finality after one block and so the overhead in terms of a challenge right now in implementing that with ethereum is I understand is the aggregation of signatures to get every single validator to be able to vote on that one block but um I believe it is pretty much solved as a research problem for reading vitalik's post on it I think it's called the road to single soft finality but that is something that can stop any kinds of short-term multi-block reorgs and that gives users a lot more assurances about their transaction finality so I'm very excited about that one opens up a number of possibilities also to uh with different types of cross-chain communication another one is a single secret leader election so right now today you know in advance uh who's going to be uh the leader for each slot in an Epoch but in the future you will be able to only know if you are the leader and nobody else will be able to know um so there's some cool cryptography some great research that's being done on that front as well and then uh muv smoothing which we talked about that's really great for redistribution and also creates a different set of incentives uh for the participants in in the uh the block production supply chain there as well recently there's been ideas put forth about uh threshold encrypted mempools the idea of maybe you can even get to like fully homomorphic encryption um these are topics that I'm not quite as familiar with but there's some great research and um the recent uh what's it called the recent Mev roast uh with Justin Drake and flashbots he gave a whole presentation about the different types of encryption and how feasible that they would be you know going forward in the future so I would definitely recommend listeners check that out so ethereum at the base layer will be robust and will be I would say as Mev resistant as possible in the future I think in terms of like if most of D5 and nft minting moves to Layer Two that then they're going to have to figure out probably what they want to do in terms of value capture mechanism let me play that back so um you're excited about optimism because of the sort of vibe uh you didn't say retroactive public goods funding but when you said Vibe and spiritual uh component then that's that's at least what I hear and also the modular architecture is that fair that's fair cool and then the ZK ecosystem there's some projects you're excited about um vitalik wrote a post about the road to single finality that you're excited about single secret leader election is also something that could help here and you think that ethereum that the base layer will kind of be more robust and Mev resistant so the design choice at the base layer is minimizing Mev um but at the L2 layer it's well it kind of depends on whether D5 and nft moves to l2s and if so which l2s but it's kind of anyone's game to figure out what to do at the L2 layer uh is is that a good summary for the audience that's a great summary the only thing that I would add is that like I think ethereum is going to be able to achieve this kind of robustness but also still have this opening free auction Marketplace um I know flashbots is working on um this proposal of suave where um it's kind of this idea that vitalik put forward heard of having a distributed Builder almost a return back to Mev Geth in a way where you're building portions of the block off chain and then kind of like Mev boost you're delivering them to the slot leader at that time what's called proposer Builders separation is this the same concept it's it's yeah it's it's similar this would be an off chain again version of it but it's it's a similar idea they still have to release implementation details on this so I would say check out their post it's like about a 20 minute read on their website um but I know that they have more details coming soon but basically the idea would be to have kind of uh these executors in the system act as Searchers and find profitable bundles and then aggregate those bundles and then you know this chain would would aggregate them together and then send that portion of the block to um the ethereum proposer to include um and one one method that I didn't talk about that got talked about quite a bit at SBC was this notion of proposer agency where basically like locally a block Builder could say um I wanna these you know set of transactions included in my block Builder you go build the block for me but I need proof that you're going to include these 10 transactions as well so it's a way that you could potentially get some kind of censorship resistance um and then there are some complications there with respect to proposers needing potentially a view of the mempool and you know the idea being that like you want validators to kind of be as dumb and pipey as possible so anybody can spin one up and not have to like run some complex uh searching algorithm or a building algorithm but that being said there's also this idea that did ship called minbid where basically you can run map boost as a proposer but you can say hey like I only want the net boost built block if you know the the fee is that I receive is one eighth or if it's 0.5 youth whatever your threshold is but it allows you to participate in the censorship resistance of the network generally but then also say Okay um you know I want to get some long tail exposure because there have been blocks where like it's an 80th payout or a 70th payout and if you're that single proposer like that's that's going to be much more than you're making in a Year's worth of staking rewards so you want that opportunity but the idea of proposer agency and protocol commitments there's some cool stuff research um I would say Barnaby Monet and the robust incentive group are doing some great research there the eigenlayer team have put out a proposal called Mev boost plus plus which talks about some of this stuff as well so I would say check those out for for more details word so um talked about uh distributed Builder and I have it similar to like Mev gath proposer agency and a couple other mechanisms um it seems to me that like you said at the top uh of the episode that Mev is just this deep deep Rabbit Hole um and the more you learn about it the more you realize you don't know and I'm like getting that feeling it feels like that scene in Alice in Wonderland where you're you're kind of falling down the rabbit hole and there's there's various like you know there's like a rabbit or like a glass of milk that you could grab I think she actually has a rocking chair on the way down um and I get that feeling of just being going down the Steep rabbit hole and I'm wondering what's the a priority reason for that is it just that this is a place where there's a lot of upside and it's so novel and there's a blue ocean here but like what's the reason why there's such a deep Rabbit Hole here and like how how far does the rabbit hole go um if if you had to guess um I mean some some people would say like they think that all these type of solutions would say would prove that like you can solve Mev and within five years once we see some improvement in different versions of cryptography then you know we'll get to a point where Meb is mostly solved um other people think that um it's going to be continued to be an ongoing issue um it's hard to say I mean I think some of it is a coordination problem like we talked about like you have people that are building stuff kind of in parallel to each other but it might be uh symbiotic it might be conflicting which is great but at the same time wasted efforts maybe um I think that it probably started because when uh you know this this flashbots team or these early members of kind of looking at Mev and searching uh back in like 2018 2019 when you had ether Delta um like they were looking at wow like maybe you can make some money by reordering transactions and there's are there actually Bots that are doing this and then experimenting and seeing that there are and then seeing that hey this is kind of a problem and uh you know this led to D5 summer where you had this uh notion of priority gas auctions where Bots were just kind of spamming the mempool with tons of transactions um and it was jacking up the gas price for your average user and transactions were failing on chain um and it was just creating a environment that was not great overall for the welfare of the system so flashbots came and shipped mfgf and then moved that um you know PGA game off chain uh into an auction mechanism and then kind of cleared up the mempool for every other General user but the idea was like you know there's this negative externality because there's this value that can be captured which is making the experience of using ethereum poor so like let's ship this product to improve that uh and and help the overall welfare of the system and I think it's just kind of continued from there to to to build because now designers of applications designers of any systems are have to be Mev aware because there there's these incentives and um that exist and when you have an incentive that says like if you do X you get paid x amount of money um people will probably gravitate towards that and do it so it's a way of Designing the incentives that keeps the Integrity of the system um as intended but also allows these incentives to potentially benefit the users of the system so I don't know if that's a good answer but I I think it started from this notion of you know how do we solve the problem of pgas to now Mev is everywhere on every chain you know how do we coordinate this and make it most efficient to be captured and then figure out these kind of redistration fusion mechanisms because otherwise you might have more Anarchy and then it just kind of becomes an existential threat to blockchains in general amazing um in a world in which you're maximally successful in your agenda with Meb redistribution what does the world like look like so take me forward to 2033 10 years from now and and let's say that um that what you where you want to see Mev redistribution go if that's maximally successful how does that change the world into let's just give it 10 years which is a total arbitrary time maybe you could answer for five or 20 years but um you know what in your world what's your maximally successful what does that look like a great question um so I think I would say the end State I would say I would hope that people aren't researching Mev Too Much Anymore um and I would hope that people are now like studying um you know how to redistribute Mev for things like Universal basic income maybe um like I see Ubi as kind of an inevitability with AGI there's going to have to be some some kind of distribution because not everybody is going to be able to keep up um and I think Mev is like one of those vehicles that could actually fund this um so that's one thing I would say more so less of a focus on how to capture and how to design protocols and maybe more on you know governance like I I think Mev is going to force governance to have a lot of battles and issues over time and I would hope that maybe in 10 years time we're beyond that and there's like a couple standard models that people can just say okay this is how we want to set up our governance around this issue or at least have our governance be aware of this issue and then move forward and be able to redistribute and fund public goods and then we have less ultimately of these ecosystem Free Riders that just come in and you know spray and pray with different Investments and then dump tokens on people um which ultimately doesn't benefit anybody and if we can just have more investment in things because they're good ideas and because they can benefit the overall welfare of the ecosystem rather than you know what's gonna what's gonna 10x in a year or two years time I think that we can get to a better place and then you can start seeing the removal of some of these Ponzi games from the ecosystem so I would hope in 10 years there's no more Ponzi games because Mev has solved a lot of these problems so what I heard there was that there's an opportunity to do public goods funding here there's governance problems with Mev um and those those battles will be fought probably l1s and l2s across the ecosystem um I I really want to double click on the idea that Ubi could be funded with Mev so basically the chain of thoughts there is that AI could cause a bunch of worker dysplasion or displacement I mean not just AI but all automation like um could cause worker displacement we need a way if we want to keep democracies or we want to keep the working class able to stay afloat then they need to have some way of paying their bills um and Ubi is one way that that could be happening I mean maybe there's other public goods or uh uh I don't want to say welfare but distribution mechanisms to to the working class and they could be funded with Mev which is to me is like a big assertation of Mev redistributions ultimate place in the world like holding together democracies and keeping the working class afloat feels feels like a pretty big deal to me and it felt almost understated the way you said it um yeah I mean I I guess I I uh maybe it's not as well formed a thought I would just say that like what I'm seeing with Roll-Ups and app chains in general is that they the idea being that they're their own communities their own nation states in a certain way and if you believe that there's going to be a lot of these Roll-Ups and maybe maybe for ethereum that's more at the layer three than at the layer two um and maybe for some of these app Chains It's you know just a dispersion of them um but there's there's going to be these coordination mechanisms where people form these communities around blockchains in the future perhaps and it assuming those things are true then you know participants in those ecosystems probably um are going to have to think long and hard about different funding mechanisms um to keep their Community afloat and I think that this could be one where if you know you're part of this community and there's a Ubi for you know this roll-up community based off of the Mev that's captured um yeah I want to play forward sort of one of my ideas uh about how blockchains could fund public goods and I just want to get your feedback on it and how I maybe fits into it so I have this sort of like holonic perspective on the world um home lines are just basically this idea that um each hole is also a part of other holes and it's kind of like fractal up and down uh different site like for example I'm a person I'm a I'm a whole lot that's composed of cells in my body and you and me recording this podcast are a whole on because we're two people that compose this green pill show and then the ethereum community as a whole lot in Boulder Colorado where I live is a whole lot um and the whole world is a whole lot um and and so within each of these Hollands um if we were to fund public goods at that hole on let's just say like take the ethereum community you basically need a a way of raising funds for public goods but that's only half the battle you also need a mechanism to legitimately incredibly neutrally distribute that public goods funding within that whole on or maybe if you're a extremely positive externality based hole on your ex your your shipping positive externalities one level like imagine ethereum creating funding not just for ethereum open source but all open source software okay so you've got whole lot it's whole lines all the way up and down and you can kind of have this modularity where you can match different funding mechanisms systems like Bitcoin raises money from just people who want to support Bitcoin optimism has retro public goods funding uh maybe Mev redistribution is another funding source and then on the other side you have uh retroactive public goods funding and Ubi and quadratic voting and give backs and and um and and so it's like this this hollonic architecture in this modular way of pairing up funding mechanisms with with distribution sources that like this to me is like the way I see us building a modular stack for funding public goods worldwide um is is having forkable software and doing this modular uh way of doing it and so um I guess I'm just wondering if you have any feedback on on that vision and is that does that make sense to you and then and then I guess I'm wondering like how do we connect the people who are who are working on the mechanisms to the ones that are working on the funding sources is like the question that comes after that for me so I don't know what's your reaction to that whole ball of Wax I think that's really cool um I think that makes a lot of sense it actually it reminds me of something that uh David Deutsch wrote in one of his books um I don't remember if it was fabric of reality or beginning of Infinity but where he talked about this notion that like on planet Earth um if we're able to leave Earth then we can impact the Universe um and so like you're basically able to grow the tree out um and so we're not as Stephen Hawking said these insignificant specks of dust that are just you know random um we actually have um ability to make great impact and change and sometimes all it takes is a small uh impact first which can grow out in mushroom and um so I'm totally aligned with that thinking um in terms of what do how to how to coordinate I think that's really the the issue right now Mev is very much in this phase of you have people that don't want to accept that it could be a good founding mechanism versus people that say well you know like it could be a good funding mechanism um and I think once we figure out the distribution mechanisms in the next couple of years and and what works and what doesn't work I think it would be a lot easier for people to come to a shelling point and say this is what I think about this mechanism these are the trade-offs this is the data associated with it and I think people will have less bipolar opinions about Mev at least I hope so um and I think once you get to that point then you're able to have some conversations about these other things in terms of how do you kind of how do you coordinate this I think the awareness piece is really key I think what you're doing right now um you know for your listeners I think what a lot of people are doing is just helping educate and raise awareness I know for me what I first learned about Mev I was like oh my God this is terrible you know how could this possibly happen this is just like high frequency trading in traffic and it took me a little while to get past that and then once I started digging in a little bit deeper into the research I started to understand it a little bit better um and then as I learned more I ask more questions talk to people at flashbots like I got to a point where I saw it more as kind of this this uh Financial energy that just kind of exists um and it's going to keep growing as the total addressable Market of blockchains keep growing and so um you know for me personally like I'm not at that that bipolar Place anymore with it but I can see the perspective of the people that are and I think we just need to settle and get more data on some of these things and have continued awareness I think once we move past that then we can get to this point where we are funding all open source software uh with Mev redistribution yeah oh man well I think that's a great place to end unless there's any questions that I didn't ask you that you want to say um no I would just say that um you know it's a very complex topic so uh I might have you know I might have said something that's like Loosely true or uh um not as precise as somebody um more technical might have uh expected but I would say that I'm just very thankful for the ethereum research community flashbots research community in general um great public goods and just having this research available for people like me to consume it and to think about it for us to talk about it and so it's it's just been a great give back by that whole community so very thankful there yeah same well I think that the work that's being done here is going to be foundational as the ethereum ecosystem continues to grow and yeah hopefully hopefully this can be routed into doing good for the world which is what regenerative crypto is all about so thank you for your for your work on this a prairie and excited to see where it all goes [Music] absolutely thank you Kevin peace [Music]
