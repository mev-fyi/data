[Music] bankless Nation welcome to this critically important episode of Bank list where we are going to talk about your wallet and you how to set up a wallet and not lose all of your money what does it mean to securely store your own crypto Assets in the world of web 3 and in order to tell the story we're bringing on a security expert this is going to be an episode with Charles GMA who is the CTO of Ledger he's got a background in cryptography and Hardware security and overall knows all of the best practices to setting up your private Keys your seed phrase your Hardware wallet your hot wallet and make sure that when you put money into those things that the money stays there and does the things that you want it to as you navigate the wild wild west of crypto as we all know at bankless we want people to be their own Banks but we are not naive at all and that this is a big deal it is a big deal to store your own money it is a big deal to self-custody assets it scares a lot of people it is intimidating and it should be because of how big of a deal it is but thankfully we have people like Charles at Ledger and other teams working on the world of private Key Management to help us navigate the world of self-custody safely and securely so that we have all the best that web3 has to offer while still not losing our funds we'll cover subjects in this episode like how to set up your seed phrase how to set up your private Keys how to have and manage a cold wallet in what ways is it appropriate to have a hot wallet how should you have a hot wallet cold wallet system what about the entropy for creating a private Keys what's blind signing what is transaction simulation and how should I not get fished what are smart contract allowances and when should I be concerned and when should I be okay with it and overall what is the future of wallet security and private Key Management as we progress into the frontier so I hope this episode for all of you beginners out there who are still nervous about self-custody and being your own bank that this episode can give you some practical advice for how to do that and also some peace of mind that this is actually the right way to go and for the veterans out there there's still going to be some nuances and Nuggets that you're going to learn I promise so let's go into this episode with Charles the CTO of Ledger and we are going to teach you all about how to practice good private Key Management in this crazy world of web 3. let's get into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show

background in cryptography and Hardware security before coming into the world of crypto Charles welcome to the show uh hi David nice to meet you and thank you thanks for having me today so Charles you have a tough job uh the world of crypto is a world of self-custody being your own bank going bankless this is one of the main core drivers as to how this world works the concept of private Keys everything that we talk about bankless everything that we talk about in the world of crypto comes down to do you own your own private Keys it seems to be the center focal point of this whole industry so that you as the CTO of a hardware wallet company you have a tough job um when you wake up in the morning how does it does do you feel weight on your shoulders to make sure that this world is safe the second question uh to be honest I I sleep pretty well just because we are spending a lot of time and energy to do the things right when when you are in security you know that there is nothing like bulletproof like impossible to break this is this is not something that exists in the security world but what you can do is always improve like security is not something static this is a journey and you have to make sure you implement everything possible to always raise the bar for security and and this is what we what we are trying to do at Ledger so Charles we're going to walk through a number of subjects in which we see beginners uh trip up with and when it comes to maintaining their own private keys I think people coming into the world of crypto they're used to not having options that might accidentally steal all of their money like usually when they're navigating the web to space venmo or Wells Fargo if they do something wrong that's not a problem they can there's somebody to talk to that's not the same in this world and so people sometimes get intimidated about having their own private keys because that means that there are buttons that they can press that nuke their whole like savings or send their savings to like the wrong person uh and so we want to I want to make some content with you this uh this morning this morning that we're recording to make sure to educate people about all the choices that they need to make and if they are going to be their own bank you ready to get started let's go all right so the the three overarching categories Charles is uh a wallet how do I set up a wallet how do I maintain my private keys and how do I use this wallet in the world of web3 in ways that are safe and secure and aren't going to uh be at risk so that's that's the first one and then we'll get into okay now that I have my wallet set up what are your risks of me using my wallet out in the wild and this goes into conversations of phishing how do I make sure I don't get fished and then also smart contracts uh and so like how do I make sure that this smart contract that I want to use is safe so these are the three overarching uh topics that we'll want to go into but of course it all begins with setting up a wallet uh setting up your own bank and so the first very big big entrance Point into this world is how does one safely establish a set of private Keys we all want to be our own bank therefore we need our own private keys but we can't just have a Post-It note on the side of our computer that has a private keys are uh why how does one do this and why is this so important yeah generation this is a this is an important piece everything starts with that and self-castity means you own your crypto you are your own bank you don't ask the permission to anyone to spend your money to uh all your nfts like you are on your own and you are the power over your assets so everything starts with that because your Critters are on the blockchain so owning crypto means being the only one to know your secret to to have this knowledge and to be able to prove that you own this knowledge and to do so in terms of cryptography this is what we call digital signature with a digital signature I'm able to prove that I know my secret key without revealing any information about my about my secret key so this is why secret key is very important and it's even more important for blockchain because of immutability if ever another teacher gets an access to my key it will be able to sign a transaction drain my wallet and there is no Central entity where I could complain and say ah that was not me I didn't want to do this transaction this is not something possible so this is the difference between our private keys and Wells Fargo's is this concept of immutability if you accidentally make a bad transfer with Wells Fargo you can call them up and get them to reverse it if you make a bad transfer on ethereum it is a mutable it is one way exactly and this this is a big political shift and this is something you everyone needs to keep in mind so you you have a big power but also a big responsibility as someone someone famous said um but everything everything starts with the key generation so you need to make sure your keys are randomly generated that means randomly means several different things but that means they have a high level of entropy like the zero and one of the bits that forms this private key must be evenly distributed let's say and also that it's very difficult to guess them the space for private Keys is very wide it's two power 256 bits so this is something very very wide if you try to pick randomly a new key every millisecond during several times the age of the planet you won't be able to find mine like the space is very wide but in order to um to be sure your secret key is secure you you you must be sure that it's generated evenly in this very wide space so this is this is something very important so I can we just pause and I want to make sure I understand that uh private Keys they're really really long string of randomly generated characters and because there's so many characters like a through zero through through nine it creates what you're calling it and like an almost an infinitely wide possible set of private keys there are more private Keys than there will ever be need for that number of private Keys like they have every single what you're saying is like if one human generated one private key every single millisecond that would still be an infinitesimally small number of private keys in comparison to the whole possible set of private keys but your point about emphasis on random generation is that okay great we have this massive total possible number of private keys that are out there but if we're going to generate one the way that we need to generate one doesn't need to have patterns to it because and it would actually constrain the available the the Practical a supply of private keys if there were nuances in how we actually derived the private key is that my understanding this correct yeah your understanding is is really good you explain even better than me so if your key generation is is not good is not uh evenly distributed and it actually it happened a few times in the past I remember the profanity tool maybe you remember this tool this is a tool which is able to generate vanity loss so uh address on lithium that starts with some zero and in order to do that you you just have to generate plenty of keys DUI the private key in order to get an address and as soon as the address starts by the number of zero that you would like then it's a hit the you keep the seed and that's your seed you can do that in the in a in a good in a good way in a secular way but the way profanity was implemented was not good because instead of generating Keys which are like 256 bits of Randomness that was only 32 bits that was just a small bag in in the in the random code generation in the cast like if you if you are if you know a little bit like just C language the cast is when you change the size of um of your type let's uh let's forget forget about that but just the space of keys was was not super well uh 256 that was 2 power 32 and this place is very small actually with with um with a good computer you can generate all possible profanity keys and this is something that has been done and a few wallets have been drained because of that I also have another story in mind like see I want it this one is a little bit old for for OG and maybe they will they will remember and BCI wallet was using random.org as a source of Randomness to create new wallet a new set of Privileges and at some point rondon.org simply changed the the API and when the wallet was requesting for a new random number you obtained a four or four so instead of having instead of having a good large number you get four or four four offer all the time so that was a big a big fail in the space because plenty of people were generating wallets with 404 as a seat which is which is definitely not a larger number okay so these are just two different stories about how people have tried to do finesse some private key generation in order to for the first example was a for a vanity address some people for funsies they like to have their ethereum address start with zero zero zero zero for fun uh and there are ways to generate and this an address but if you're not careful you accidentally reduce the entropy that goes into this private key generation and you go from this very very secure space of almost an infinite number of possible private keys and an infinite number of ways of driving those private keys and it really just constrains it and so this is what the stories that you're telling uh Me Now is really all about the mistakes that people have made with not allowing enough entropy in the private key generation that makes it susceptible to outside Recreation of those private Keys is that is that the the takeaway message we should have exactly and as soon as Asana take care you understood the mistake then you can simply generate seeds and drain what it because you know the keys of your victim and as an a hacker like I you're not doing this one at a time you have written a bot that will do this extremely quickly and at very high scales right yeah exactly then as soon as you understood the the issue it's uh it's just a matter of optimizing the code you can use GPU to be faster and and faster but as soon as you know the mistake it's uh it's just a matter of time and an opportunity cost like oh how much does it cost to generate all these Keys how much money I can earn by joining these wallets and unfortunately it's always on the hard worker side when the when there was this kind of um of vulnerability sure okay so say I'm say I'm a brand new user and I just heard this story right now how do I not fall into that trap how do I if I'm using Ledger or the metamask or any other wallet how do I know whether or not I'm falling victim to bad entropy or not it's it's quite difficult to to have good guarantees on on the entropy of your seed I can explain how we are generally generating random number on the job product so we are using trng for two random number generator so inside our devices like we have a secure element and inside the secure element there is a dedicated piece of Hardware which is called the trng and it's specialized at generating random and it goes through independent certification and there is a dedicated certification for a random number generation quality which is called ais31 or El eal5 plus certification so long story short that means there's a trng go through a different statistical tests onto a p model with some mathematical evidence that must be provided to the evaluator also on the powder itself there is some online test because there is a risk that during the immigration like everything was fine with the the random number generator but whenever you use it for any reason it doesn't work properly anymore so there is dedicated tests that verify some basic properties about the trng when it runs and it allows to detect a potential defect and on top of that we are adding some cryptographic post processing recruitment so even if the entropy would be low from the trng this cryptographic retreatment allows to amplify the entropy adjacentes um so when I say that I think we have like the one of the best setup in terms of generating random keys and but the problem I see is you and as a user you have to trust us a little bit when you do when you do that I think it's the best idea to do that like trusting Us by generating uh your your secret but if ever you don't want to trust us you don't have to because it's possible to import your own key inside the device something possible also would be to generate a key on your device General generate another key on something that you trust more and then simply exhort them in in doing so you you you you have the quality of otherness that is inside the secure element plus you don't really have to trust us this is this is something you can do okay so is it is it true that with modern wallets like definitely with Ledger and this is really the product that Ledger's building is security to the nth degree to the point that the customers don't have to think about it uh is it would it be true that like with Ledger and other wallets uh like metamask like the entropy saw a problem at the retail level if you're not doing anything crazy is largely solved yeah totally uh when it comes to metamask if you don't use the hardware because if you use metamaski I think it's a great product but it's not that great when it comes to like securing your privacy so what you should do is using a ledger device and connect it to a metamask so that you have the great connectivity that offers metamask with the security provided by Ledger devices because if your keys is secured in metamask only that means any kind of malware running on your browser or on your computer more generally would be able to Simply extract your scene and this is not something you would like and to your point I don't really know how the seed is generated within metamask if you generate it in a software Manner and the computer are not that good to generate keys I think it could be acceptable but storing them in in your in software wallets is not a good idea for my standpoint certainly and this gets us into the subject matter of hot and cold wallets which I want to talk about a hot and cold wallet system but really just to tie a bow on this part of the conversation you're saying like computers are making a private key inside of my own computer is less secure versus like inside of a ledger because Ledger has that unique dedicated part of the hardware wallet that is meant to do this and so while computers are great there are risks risks with doing inside of a computer sometimes the the entropy is not so great or the verifiability of the Enterprise entropy is not so great and also you are connected to the internet which is the big one but there are benefits to being having a hot wear wallet as well and again we'll go into that is there anything else you want to add before we tie a bow on this conversation no if it's it's a it's a great summary so yeah first of all generating your property on on software could be a little bit tricky because there is no reliable way and uniform way to generate good secrets on computers and and it's the same for for your mobile phone even even if on mobile a little bit better because you can use a strong box and and on on Android and and the Crystal and on on iPhone you can leverage this for a key generation um and and for storing them definitely it's not it's not a good a good way to to do that okay so say I've just got my first Ledger I've written down these 12 to 24 words that come out of The Ledger which is your seed phrase actually can we talk about that um there's the difference between a private key and a seed phrase and I think we need to unpack this before we go into the next conversations which is where do I write down my seed phrase what's the difference between a private key and a seed phrase phrase is a human readable way of your master secret let's say and so it's a sequence of 24 words and there's 25 words directly to translate to a string of zero and one of 256 such bits and from this this seed this seed phrase We Will generate different private key per blockchain and per account so you have one master secret which allows to generate priority for every single account and every single blockchain so this is the the the the difference between these two okay so a master password I really I really like that 24 words all human readable words like Fox magic um elephant like random words that are basic words there's a list of 24 of them uh how how does that how do those words actually come to create private keys and public wallets like is there is there like an algorithm that pulls out these things out of the seat phrase I mean yes there was a there was an algorithm which is standardized so first of all there's 24 words are taken from a dictionary of 2048 uh words each word as a number and then an index so if you if you take the first word which is abandon abandon indexes zero zero zero zero like eleven zero and so you will uh get this 25 years put it in the string rate like in a in in a bit in in a bit representation and then you have a binary representation of your master secret there is some redundancy at the end of the of the of your seed phrase just in case you uh you miss type one word you can verify this let's forget that and from this um this 24 this 256 bits uh master master secret you will derive private keys and to do so we are using one-way function one-way function with the hash function for instance and the GID is that from your state phrase you can completely determine a stick deterministically generate your priorities for your sem account but the the opposite is not possible like when you if ever you know your priorities there is no way to go back to your master Secrets while the the master secret 2 privacy is is something possible with one-way function okay so my seed phrase will allow me to make and derive a list of private Keys like almost I I endlessly an endlessly long list of private keys and then one of those if I know one of those private keys I cannot go backwards to create the list of words it is a one way only so if you know the private key you don't know any of the other private keys that your seed phrase will create you only know that one private key but your seed phrase will create any private key that's dedicated by that seed phrase and also you said something that it also works across any blockchain how does this work but how does my seed phrase work on both ethereum and Bitcoin and Solana how does that work the the difference is just the way of derivating the master secret to different blockchain and then there is a there is a dedicated dedicated field in the in the in the derivation which specifies which chain you are the relation derivating to plus and other index which are calculated this is the this is the basically okay so my 24 seed phrase words are the entropy and then there is a unique derivation path using that same source of entropy to a specific blockchain so like my 24 words uh abandoned elephant magic spell whatever uh these are not my words um uh so that's just that is just entropy and then you add this one more component a derivation path and then you get entropy for Bitcoin and entropy for ethereum entropy for Solana that's how that works exactly okay so like is every single character in a c phrase word relevant like so for the word I know that a word elephant is a word in this in this dictionary does the derivation path or the entropy need every single letter in the word elephant or does it only need a few of them so as I mentioned this is not really the letter which is important but like each word correspond to an index in the dictionary so in a defense which is important is not the fact that sister e-l-e no no what is important is the index of elephants within the dictionary okay so so there's this common dictionary that the crypto world has determined is the dictionary that we use and we can't add we can't add or remove any words from that dictionary because it has to be standardized so there's this like standardized dictionary that we use it's got It's got a very large number of words and each word has like a specific serial number attached to it and then the ordering of those serial numbers creates all the entropy that we need in order to be secure exactly you said it very well cool awesome well you're I'm you're walking me through this this is great Okay cool so now we've covered entropy we've covered seed phrases we need to write down our seed phrases because 24 words it's not a super high number of words but I mean I can't remember 24 words of a specific order so we so people usually write these words down yeah don't try we'll talk about why that's a bad idea um but people usually just write these pieces of write these words down and then they store them somewhere uh can you talk about the mistakes or the mistakes that people make and what they should do in order to securely write down their words yeah definitely so the common mistake we see is like people want to digitize this 24 words and they they they have they are quite Innovative when when it comes to finding new way to digitize their 24 words the something that we see quite often is that they are taking a picture of the 24 words with their phone and when you do that like you have inside your photo album of your Android phone there is a photo which contains your 24 words maybe you have noticed but sometimes you install some random application and they just ask you to Grant access to your photo you say yes as soon as you say yes that means you want this application which is completely random can get an access to your 24 words and for an attacker it's very easy to put a piece of code which will simply scan your photos and try to figure out if there is a list of 24 words inside so this is this is something trivial and this is always happening so that there are some Bots out there which which are simply leveraging this a very common vulnerability trying to find if there is in your photo a photo of your 24 words so this is a common mistake another one is to like write your 24 words in an email so this is something that could happen also like some people uh draft an email and put their 25 words in the in the email I don't know why they do they are doing that but it happens sometimes and again if there is a malware on your computer if someone has an access to your mail if there are plenty of ways to access to those 24 waves or simply you want to to write them down in your block node or in your in any file on your computer like all these cases you if you do that you end up with the same security as if if it was if you were using a software wallet and and this is a this is completely not secure against like a malware right and I think that that is the really the punch line that it becomes the same security as a software wallet so the takeaway here is that any form of digitization of your seed phrase opens up your risks to the scale of the internet the internet's a hostile Place uh there are people out there in many different ways trying to snap some of your valuable data or whatever and so like there's a there's a Chasm that you cross when you go from writing down your seed phrase with pen and paper uh to writing down your seed phrase on some digital form that is connected to the internet and so like there's almost like a binary amount of difference where like one is like oh pen and paper you're Totally Secure when it's related to the internet because it's not on the internet oh did you write that down in the notes section of your iPhone did you email that to yourself did you take a screenshot of that thing uh did you store it in Google Drive like if you cross that Chasm to having that on on a computer on the internet somewhere then like you're opening your UPS up yourself to the a long tail of risk that you don't even know how to account for would you say this is accurate yeah definitely and you I think we have no idea of the potential of Articles like I'm I mean in this space like in security space for for a long time since I'm 12 I think and I I saw uh the like the the potential of attackers growing very significantly and now there is a market around uh the vulnerability um like you can buy and sell venabilities and they they are quite expensive now when I started like selling even reality was not even a thing and uh and when it started it started with uh the back bouncy program where the vendors get are got quite uh upset when people were were publishing vulnerabilities and then they started to incentivize a security researcher to pay brontes and and to give them vulnerabilities before publishing them and after that it started to we started to see some market around vulnerabilities and as of today if you go on zerojim.com for instance uh this is this is a market where you can buy and sell critical vulnerabilities and they are quite expensive for instance the I think the most uh the most expensive one should be um zero click and zero day remote code execution on Android or on on iPhone and I think it's around 2 millions and this kind of inability allows like any attacker to get the full control of your mobile phone without you doing anything like this is the this is the the the kind of analogy and these are like this video we see our are sold like not every day because this one is quite tricky but very often very often we see other girls leveraging this kind of validity to to Simply to do money or to spy on people because this is often also related to government and with crypto we are entering a new era where like the opportunity cost is really interesting like if ever as an attacker I'm able to drain all the wallets all the software Reddit of every single users in the world just by buying a vulnerability like then two million is nothing like this this is where we are entering with uh like with crypto and this uh this security Market okay so let me check a behavior that I have about myself with you um sometimes I I open up a brand new crypto wallet just to experiment with it and it makes me write down a seed phrase before I get into the wallet and then it tests me to make sure that I actually wrote it down and so I take a screenshot of that seed phrase because of out of convenience and then and then I fill in the the seed phrase because it's testing me in order to open up the wall and then I can open up the wall and then I play with it and then that seed phrase is still in my photos and I and I know that but I'm not going to use this wallet I'm just testing this out maybe I'll throw like ten dollars in there to like try it out like I'm I'm okay right like I haven't violated any rule if I know that I'm not going to store a lot of a large amount of money in that wallet yeah I think you you said you said everything if you are sure that like you won't put any valuable on this wallet and when I say valuable it could be like um monetary value but also like emotional value sometimes you really like this nft because you have an emotional connection with it even if it's worth nothing if you are not in this situation if you are completely okay with losing everything that is on on this wallet there is there is no debate you you can be unsafe but you have to be very cautious not mixing up like your uh your the wellness for for which you have valuable on it and the wallet test which is which is two different things okay so I've written down my seed phrase I've done a good job to do it either through a ledger or a source of entropy I know is secure and I've gotten my 24 words and they're written down physically on a piece of paper uh what do I do with that piece of paper how do I make sure how do I make sure my seed phrase is actually secure um on this I'm always a little bit reluctant with giving like an advice um what is important is is to is for you to question yourself like who like do you want to be the only one having an access to uh there's this 24 words to your friends do you also want your wife to be aware of those 24 words you have to question yourself what happens if my meds finds this 24 words uh what happens if some someone comes at home with uh with a gun like should be in a position where I could give my 24 words like this is about your op second your opsec is very personal so the first thing is to is to make sure that it's in a safe place like not not in on your desk otherwise like you're approaching on your desk potentially a lot of value um but you have to question yourself and to find out what is the best open SEC for you um like if ever my ledger wallet like fails like it's broken because you you have put it in a washing machine how long do you need to recover your wallet in in one new device if you if you're completely okay with like your one which to do to do that maybe you you might be able to hide it out outside of your house maybe you would like to cut it in two but that I I think there is there is different trade-off and I I won't give you mine but I just I just try to give to give you what what are the questions you have to ask yourself and then you will be able to find out the best option for you so your answer to this question where should I store my seed phrase isn't actually an answer it's perhaps another set of questions which is like do you live alone if yes do you want to be the only person in control of your private keys if yes then okay I guess you can keep your private keys at home do you have a roommate how much do you trust that roommate like how long have you known them do they know that you have private Keys um do you have a family do you have kids do your kids might might they accidentally find your private keys and not know what it is and accidentally eat it because they're that young who knows um do you have a dog that might eat your private Keys you have a maid that comes and cleans your house to and they're going to be next to your private keys do you have a place uh a place another home another family member that's not at not where you live and you can use their place to store your private keys do you trust them so really your answer is to like oh you actually have to look inwards and start to answer these questions for yourself more than you actually having a prescribed answer for us exactly also you can take into account the scenario where your house gets fire what happens if it happens like if your your device and your 24 years are the only way to access your friends and your house is burning what happens for you this is the kind of the of thing you you have you have to ask yourself and depending on your answer and your appetite to risk and your convenience and so on you you will have a different answer for storing your with your 24 webs okay Charles I want to run by uh this is actually a personal setup that I've had in the past and then I've changed it and then that I've brought it back so this is something I've done in the past where I have I have a ledger with me uh and I do not have the private keys for that ledger with me I only have The Ledger with me uh and so like this makes if if my um if the place where my private keys are goes and is uh is lit on Fires has a fire and those private keys are destroyed I only have The Ledger but then I would hear the news of that fire and then I would transfer the money from my ledger to a new set of private keys and I would be okay does that make you nervous at all if like if there is a moment in time where the private keys are gone from the world but I still have access to my ledger does that make you nervous not that much because you are the backup just because of this reason like if ever one of the two backups is not easy you don't have access to it anymore that you have you have another option but but maybe you would like to have another another bucket this is this is always a trade-off of what you are better to risk what's what's your impact on on the on the ux and so on but maybe we could mention uh quickly the plausible deniability feature we have on the job devices so you have this 24 words that we were referring to before but there is a friction energy which is specified by the standard the big 39 standard where you can add an additional word actually it's a passphrase you can add a Pathways to your 24 words and these passwords creates a completely new words and one idea is to use this functionality for plausible deniability reason so you have your 24 words wallet where you put like 10 bucks on it and you have this 25th word which create a new wallet and if there's some days someone threaten you to give all your wallets then you will show him your wallet containing only the 24 words and you will see oh there is only 10 bucks and maybe it will drain your wallet but you it's a way to have a plausible deniability because there is a hidden wallet oh that's really cool okay so let me run through this again so uh a seed phrase is 24 words but in the bip 39 standard which is the standard of how the dictionary or standard that we were talking about earlier there is an additional mechanism to add a 25th word which can be like a password like maybe a normal password to your computer although not suggesting that um and then that complete that basically adds an uh another word to the point where like all of the entropy is brand new again and so you have two wallets actually you have the wallet that you need the 24 seed phrase words to get access to and that is your plausible deniability wallet you put like a something in there just to satisfy your attacker and then the real wallet is those 24 words plus one more word which you might maybe keep in your head and that is your actual wallet with all of your money and so it's like an extra Secret Key and Lock to open up a much bigger safe other than this dummy safe this is the right way to describe this yeah you described it very well and with that you can you can think of like new setup to store your 24 minutes because like there was there was new there was a new mechanism which allows more flexibility more option so this is something you can consider but this is not something I recommend to new users because like it's more popular user because it can be a little bit confusing and so on so I for a new user I definitely would recommend like use using you're using the rendered art to info with a set phrase storing it in a piece of paper in a safe place like keep it simple and then as soon as you get more comfortable with this secret with with self sovereignty and self-crest energy and then the 25th weird option it can be can be considered I think okay is it possible Charles to over engineer a wallet security have you ever seen someone like try and make a Fort Knox and they accidentally like create a system that's too complicated and they lose their money is it possible to overdo it yeah definitely this is a and this is why I just I start with saying this like newcomers shouldn't use this complex video because I think it's it's more an advanced feature and the like the kind of uh mistake you could do is the following you uh not you write back your 24 words on the Play Store paper then you choose a strong passphrase for us a 25th word and you uh you you you don't write it down otherwise you if it's a little bit the purpose you you you try to remember it and just simply simply forget it and that's it you have completely lost access to your wallet forever so this is the the kind of um the kind of thing that could happen and also I'm thinking about Luke Junior the guy on uh yeah yeah he actually other fault I think is always excellent like he and I I think he it's it's easy to say this when he lost his money but I think I think sometimes it's more simple to use like of the Shelf uh secret solution because like there is a lot of investment and and people uh we try to make it simple and secure on each and what he tried to do was really complex and uh and he didn't want to trust anyone and so on so this is a different set of course of constraints but uh at the end it it ended with with the loss of his money which is a which is a um quite unfortunate let's say yeah yeah so maybe to summarize like it is admirable to try and create a self-custody setup that you uh built yourself because if you build yourself then no one how can anyone attack it if you built yourself it yourself but I think the counter argument would be like the off the self Solutions are there's a lot of investment into the product and the product is to not have any sort of vulnerability so also don't discount the value of an off the self off-the-shelf solution too yes if if you want to do better than what we do you are actually competing with a company of 800 employees which is here for um age seven or eight years and which is formed by like um like global global specialists in security so this you are competing against The Ledger when you are trying to do your own your own security solution maybe you can do better that's it's difficult okay uh but the last subject I think we should go into before we talk about some more virtual stuff like smart contracts and phishing is um a cold wallet hot wallet system uh can we can we quickly talk about what how do you define a cold wallet how you do you define a hot wallet and is it appropriate to have both and and in what scenarios would you have both yeah so I I think the the debate of temperature of foreign debate um from my standpoint I would Define like hot wallet as a wallet where you want to make plenty of transaction um possibly like automatically uh this kind of thing while a cold wallet is a wallet where you have more governance and when doing transaction is takes more time and so this the codeword is what it's where you will do typically very few transaction where a hot wallet will be a wallet where you would do more more transaction and when you think when you think about that that exchanges have this mechanism like all quality and cold wallet like when at the end an exchange is an exchange as plenty of Bitcoin but you have ECM and stores maybe 90 or 95 percent of all this Bitcoin and ECM in a cold wallet that they ship typically don't do much transaction on it like maybe one or two transactions per week while they also have like five percent of uh their holding in a hot wallet and the hot wallet is is typically more um that is doing plenty of transaction when you are um finding ethereum on an exchange you are sending your money to a hot wallet and when you are withdrawing uh from The Exchange you're always willing uh to uh from the hot wallet and they are trying to make sure they always keep the same threshold the ninety percent ten percent something like this because the hot warranty is quite automatic like everything is done automatically without any control in governance there might be some automatic security to make sure that there is no one trying to withdraw everything from the hot wallet but it's essentially automatic because you don't want someone to validate the transaction of you when you want to withdraw like what is from your favorite exchange so this is the decision trade-off they are putting uh in in place meaning the hot wallet is very automatic with low level security because it's very difficult to have something very secure with automated process while the cold wallet is more more secure but with less less transaction and more governance around the use of the the cold wallet typically they will say okay the codeword can only do transaction to the hot rod like the waitress Shield addresses and if they want to do a transaction to another wallet they will probably need that to gather five approval out of five out of seven like this kind of thing that can be implemented at the at the wallet level for the for the cowboy so this is how and and quite often like exchanges got hacked but only they got are this is only the hot wallet it happens quite often and they try to have insurance in order to cover or safely funds if you if you're thinking about binance in order to cover the loss but this is something that happens quite often and if you want to do something quite similar with um individual experience in in web3 so as I was mentioning before you have you're holding which is valuable for you whether it is emotional an emotional value or monetary value that you put on your core wallet and typically you don't use often Discovery because this is your valuable this is your saving this is the nft you like a lot so you just want to keep them secure so you put them in your in your wallet you have a long pin code you you can even put this in a secure place because you you don't need it quite often and also you want to do some teaching things on nfde on D5 with a smaller portion of your wealth and it can involve some blind signing which I strongly don't recommend to do that and for that you might want to have a second wallet a second and but I still recommend using a hardware a device for hot wallet where you will pay less attention to the transaction you sign to um to the transaction design to the approval the allowance that you put on your NFC or erc20 and if you want to do some defy dgn thing stuff I would recommend splitting both wallets and do what I mentioned the the worst that you could do is to mixing what you want to be called with what you want to be hot if you do that the the big risk is to sign a transaction where you are drained from everything from your world it was a little bit long answer but I I tried to explain a little bit of difference between the two no I think that's great I think the the really the tldr is um uh again we the world of crypto is being your own bank so you should think about your wallet set up as like a bank and a bank has a vault in the back that's hard to get to and then they have like tellers in the front or like a cashier in the front and if a bank robber comes in your setup should be that they can really only get to the hot wall at first and they can't get to the vault in the back ideally they can't even come in but if they do get in they only can access the funds and the cashier they can't access the funds in the vault because the vault is behind a door and so think of your hot wallet as like the cash in the the cashiers like teller desk and then your cold storage as like all of the money that's in the vault and it's way harder to get to but Charles you said something in that description that I want to unpack a little bit you said exchanges or cold wallets often only ever send money to the hot call it not other things and this is actually um something that I think Kevin Rose is now doing now that he he got fish because of his nfts there's like this idea of if you do have a cold storage wallet if in order to be maximally secure that cold storage wallet should only ever send funds to and from a single other hot wallet can you explain the benefits and why people do this when you do that you you are sure that the only uh transaction that you will sign from your code audits is a simple transfer which is which is always uh well supported by our wallet and when you do a transfer there is there is no much risk on your wallet there was there was no risk you you understand everything from the beginning of the to the end of the transaction you send this very nft to this very address you verify everything on the device and then it arrives on your hot wallet and then you will need probably to create some other ones because you will need to you want possibly to set it on an open C or this kind of thing but when you start to do that it you you might sign like off-chain transaction you might sign a complex smart contract interaction sometimes they are not always well supported by the device but it's it will it won't have any impact on your cold wallet because the assets is not on your code wallet anymore but it's on your hot water it's a good I think it's a good uh a good a good way to a good practice to do that uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the game but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and unisop's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing defy and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling Arboretum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to option Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop to plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and so this is this conversation is getting into the world of smart contract risk so we're beyond the risk of private keys and Beyond the risk of like how is our wallet set up and now it's the risk of a smart contract wallets and so um many people the way that they build their nft portfolio is they have an nft fault and that vault is just for long-term source of their nfts and importantly they never actually sell nfts through the Vault if they want to sell an nft they send a senate they send that nft to the hot wallet and that hot wallet then in order to make a sale has to go to something like open C or any nft Marketplace and it has to give that nft Marketplace permission to move that nft because that's how a Marketplace works so if you want to sell your nft you have to give a Marketplace permission to move it in the in the event of a sale but then you're starting to open up your that wallet to the risks of allowances is what you were is the word you use allowances and so you only you want to ideally contain all of your allowances to a single wallet so that when you know that you send your nft back to your cold storage wallet your cold storage wallet hasn't made any allowances it is literally a vault and so you can use that Vault word appropriately and not like a vault but with 17 different backdoors into it and so that's that's kind of the setup is it this is all right yeah do you like to think like security and this is a this is something I always keep in mind when we build new products and so on lunch there are three main security properties that we want to fulfill with our solution the first one is like key generation we we talked about that like in a secure area by a secure trng then whenever you want to sign transaction like the cryptography must take place within the Enclave like the the secure key the key must never leave johnclave basically since the second property and the third one is as a user you want to be able to have a human readable way to understand what you are about to consent and for that first of all we have the Twisted display on our devices you have a dedicated display which shows you what what you are about to consent and this is really important because if you blindly sign for any transaction maybe you you will simply transfer you nft but maybe some smart contract will drain all your wallet this is something you you have to to to keep in mind this is very important so for that we have the the the concept of clear signing so first of all the this interaction happens on the trusted display of the device but secondly the ID is for the device to be able to understand what it is about to uh to to sign and for that this is what we call the smart contract interaction so we have developed some framework allowing to a different dab to be integrated within the drive and to be able for the device to understand what it what it is about to uh to consent but sometimes it's a little bit more um quilting and this is where allowance and access permission comes and so basically allowance and or access permissions allow a third party to have the right to perform transaction of a certain amount of your directly to your NFC and all of this is possible without giving the priority of of your wallet this is you don't need to give your priority but you give a smart contract to a third party permission to access to your part of your what whether it is your EST training or a specific a specific energy but this is always always must be handled with care because for instance as you were mentioning when you interact with a secondary nfg Marketplace you will need to allow the marketplace to access to a certain NFC and then you will do off-chain signatures this is how openc is is working so option of change signature is is a regular signature as for transaction but the difference is it's not committed on chain directly um for for various reasons but I think it's about the transaction is signed but it's not broadcasted so you sign a message and then you give it to openc and openc just holds on to it for a little bit exactly so open the for opencity is quite simple you will sign a transaction a message saying I'm okay to sell on my nft for this amount and a buyer will see your listing on a openc and build sign a message saying I'm okay to um to buy this energy for this amount and then you have two signed message and you render this message in a big in the in the smart contract interaction in transaction in the ecn transaction and you submit this on chain and the open C smart contract will say okay there's two things much so it's possible to it's possible to to do the The Exchange so this is how openc work as a schematically but the problem is with of change signature they are vulnerable to what we call insecurity talk to like term of check and time of use often when you enforce on governance you want the governance to be applied whenever you check it when it's when it's um uh when it's off-changed signature you check something at some point in time that might be executed a long time after so maybe in the verse you wanted to sell your nft for 0.8 0.1 is and you forgot about it but another car gets this uh this signature and a long time after buys your bank for 0.1 yes this is something what what which happened for for open City in the past so I this is the first uh an issue and and I think this this design is driven by the fees like uh we would like to do everything on training saying I'm listing my nft like on chain uh I'm I'm I'm okay to sell it for this amount and I'm I'm okay to buy it for this amount all those messages should be on train and published to everyone but openc is not doing that because of the the price of fees for ECM and I think it's a it's a bad practice and we are in a point where like we have this dabs which builds um interesting application and they decide to enforce part of the rules of shame but this is the purpose of blockchain blockchain must enforce the rules this is the this is the purpose of blockchain this is the purpose of our smart contract and I think we should spend more energy on like solving the scalability challenges for ACM including fees and Associates rather than building non-secure experiences on L1 so I think like this kind of design shows us that we are targeting like uh short-term Revenue opportunity rather than thinking long term because if you think long term what needs to be solved is the fees and the scalability of ECM and not this kind of hack which leverage L1 that will be my uh my two centimeters yeah and this is really all about um just the way that openc and other nft platforms Works in order to save and Route Around extra gas fees is that you sign a message saying I approve of this nft being sold given these parameters and then you give that uh transaction to openc and they just custody that Trend that that note for a long time and maybe you set uh the time parameter on that it's like and this transaction is valid for indefinitely and so like all of a sudden you have this outstanding note that you've given to openc and they custody of that note and you've given up control over that thing and so there's other various like instances where something like this might happen but this is all boiling back to the world of allowances uh and so okay can we just go back to the concept of allowances and talk about how people need to think about allowances and the wallet that they use doing their High active High touch high frequency D5 nft stuff yeah so again allowances and all access permission that allows a third party that could be open c that could be a compound for instance when you do a lending and or Boeing on compound you provide you grant access to compile code to compound to use your funds which are your erc20 which are in your wallet when you use openc and you grant openc you approve you you sign an approval to openc like openc will have an access to like openc smart contracts more specifically we'll have an access to your nft to do a transfer we think it's okay because everything is defined in the smart contract of openclu so you can if you are a tech savvy and you you have time you can verify what is uh in the in openc smart contract and understand in which condition openc can use your nft but yeah the problem is that when you do that an attacker can leverage these allowance in order to uh to to buy your nft for for cheap price for for instance and and so on so that's why I think it must be 100 shared with care and if you don't need to sell your nft if you don't need to do anything with your nft there is absolutely no reason uh to Grant allowance to anyone that you you do most revote every single approval that you have on your nft and on your esc20 if you if you if it's the case as well and there is there is a website called reward.cache which allows you to list all your assets and and to check which which one is for which one there is another one and so on and because allowance are unchanged signature okay so I want to check my understanding about this so again going back to First principles uh we get to be our own bank we have our own highly secure bank vault that we are setting up we're doing a good job setting it up because we're doing proper entropy proper private key storage all the things that we've talked about thus far um but we okay so now we have this Vault that's super secure that has our money in it but we want to go do some defy things so we want we will go to compound like you said and we'll allow compound which is a smart contract to access a specific token in our wallet and so we've created a door into our vault and that door goes to compound and gives compound allowances over certain tokens in our wallet now there I want to unpack the difference here because sometimes we can give allowances that do a very narrow set of things that are probably completely safe and secure as in giving allowances to compound smart contracts or maybe even a more simple smart contract and compound is not really adding any new risk because this contract itself has only a very narrow set of things that it can do and it's not actually Pro it's provably because of what's in the smart contract not going to steal from you as in like it can only do a very small set of things and all of those things are we are totally okay with and there's no third party human who can change that and that's just but that is just one smart contract there's another world where like we approve and give allowances to another smart contract and that smart contract is totally vulnerable and can totally be changed and the rules can change can you help us unpack and navigate like what the difference is between giving you know smart contract a versus smart contract B how one can be secure how one can be vulnerable can you can you guide us through this conversation yeah this one this one is difficult uh difficult to answer but what you said is a totally correct lecture giving allowance is not bad per se like sometimes you need it to uh to access to compound sometimes you need to uh to to to sell your favorite nft to openc my message is more if you don't need it don't allow anything like there is no reason to to open a window like you don't need it don't don't access to anyone and when it comes to like selecting the different smart contract and understanding what what smart contract and and what kind of access you you would like to to give them it's it's a little bit difficult so first of all reputation is is something that you you could you could take into account when you use compounds you can trust compound I think when you use uni swap you can trust you uni Swap and so when you sign this kind of elements uh this contracts can be can be trusted when it's a completely new a smart contract that has been deployed like yesterday maybe you should you should think about that so maybe it's not it's not that good also when you when when quite often this is like fishing like some people ask you to contact you by DM and they simply ask you to sign this uh indirectly to sign this this very message or to this to do this allowance to this smart contract but I think like again there is some signs like people are reaching out to you asking you to do something maybe there is a little bit fishy also there was something I say quite quite or Advantage when it's when when it seems too good to be true maybe this is the case maybe it's too good to be true and and this is something I I I keep in mind quite often like um when when because almost all the time like fishing people are just making you think that you will earn more money than usual and then you get tricked and then you you sign a transaction that gives full access to a Smart contract which is uh held by the by the attackers simply so yeah you you will be to to do you will have to be cautious and to to question yourself keep calm and yeah this kind of thing I think I think is important in this Charles I think the last question I want to ask about is a phrase that you use earlier which is blind signing uh what is blind signing why is it bad and how should people uh think about blind signing in order to maintain safety in web3 for me blind signing is simply signing a message without understanding what it means when you do that maybe you are about to do a very good trade and it's good for you but maybe you are giving away all your Holdings all your holding this is possible this is something possible when you blind sign maybe you grant access to a malicious contract to all your wallet to all your ECM wallet and the smart contract will simply empty all your wallets so this is something you have to keep in mind when you blind sign you are teaching a lot of risk so going back to our previous conversation if ever you blind sign you probably should do that on hot wallet where there is only what you are okay ready to lose if ever there is an issue don't do that with your main wallet because if you do that with your main weather you might lose everything so I personally I'm almost never blind sign like for me this is a this is always a big issue like signing something I I I don't understand completely but if ever I do I do that with a completely new wallet and I'm like if ever I'm if ever it goes wrong that's not a big deal because because this is a not valuable energy this is a this is the way you we should see it when you blind time so I would say like I think most of people's activity in in like doing defy stuff is blind signing as in like when they go and and maybe I I need to understand what blind signing is a little bit more but like say I've just opened up a brand new wallet I go to uh app.uniswap or uniswap.app which is the URL and then I just immediately give allowances to spend my usdc and I it goes to metamask I hit approve it goes to my ledger and I just hit approve because I've done this a thousand times before on different wallets did I just blind sign on unit swap is that what I just did uh it depends which is written on your device uh I if you do that this way I don't know if you have uh if you have a clear signing on your device but for instance if you go on parasol I'm sure a password and you are using your device and you are about trades like to exchange one ethiom against the 110 USD here like 1000 usdg um on on your device it will be written and that you are about to swap one ECM against 1000 usdt are you happy with that and then you can send but if you have only if you honey I have um a hash to sign like this is a complete blind sign if you have the address of the smart contract plus the amount involved then you could you can be sure that the this there is only this amount that is easy that is at risk so it's a little bit less blind but you don't understand fully what is about to uh to to happen because you don't really know what the what kind of method of the smart contract is called so like between blind signing and completely clear signing there are plenty of shade of gray and our targets as for Atlas to provide as much information to the user so that you can consent in a in an informed way and this is a this is not something this is that's why we have built platforms that have been adapts to uh to to to make sure their interaction are well supported but I think the dubs ecosystem grow faster than the different interaction I would say yeah and this is really a a multi-faceted solution space as in there is no one clear solution to Blind signing but I would imagine like maybe a couple of solutions that come off the top of my head are um Hardware wallets that have larger screens so that we can put more words on them so people can read more words uh but then also transaction simulation is a new frontier in this world where um we need systems to help simulate a transaction so that the output of the transaction we're about to sign for can be displayed to us so that we can understand like what the that outcome is uh so those are the first two like solutions that I'm sure are are non-trivial to work on are there any others and just overall what is there your philosophy on how we solve the blind signing problem I know it's a it's a it's a good segue because we are working on both we are working with on the on the feature which will be called the West Street check so we are working on Ledger connect to the connect will be an extension and mostly iOS first and and Safari after allowing you to connect your device to a safari and iOS and we think later connect you will have a feature called Web Suite check and with it with switch check will will Implement various heuristic in order to give you an idea of the risk that you could take signing this transaction also compute predictive balances and so on like this is the the kind of feature that will be implemented in Universal check this is the first thing and the second thing having a device with a wider screen with better ux this is also something we are working on it's more than working on we have announced it at The Ledger open and it's called Ledger stacks and and finally there is the there is the support at the operating system level of the smart contract interaction and for that we have uh what we did so far is to open our stack uh yeah our practical search and allow different depth to implement their interaction within our ethereum app but then it's a matter of doing it and making sure the developer custom is as everything it needs to uh to to
