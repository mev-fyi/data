I think crypto really needs to rebuild and go back to its roots go back home to its fundamentals the thing I'm pretty bullish on this week coming out of this is specifically more tools that help us go bankless I feel like we took so many shortcuts in 2022 we trusted centralized intermediaries and there are a lot of reasons for that but I don't think we will be rebuilding on centralized tools moving forward I think it's kind of like it's bankless season like the entire next year is that's how we're going to rebuild I think we have a triple threat that make me believe this this time we have veterans who know what they're doing in the space we have some recent pain I'm just reminded that pain is a teacher we touch the stove and it's hot bankless ux is getting better that was part of the problem last cycle why people gave their funds to centralized intermediers is because it was just one click one button it was so easy and the ux was easy and I didn't have to think I didn't have to learn about private keys and self-custing all this complexity well we are ramping up and getting better
