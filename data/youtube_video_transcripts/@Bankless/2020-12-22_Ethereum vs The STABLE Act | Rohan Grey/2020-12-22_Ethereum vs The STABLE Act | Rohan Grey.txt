if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the urn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at y earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well bankless nation we are super excited to have rowan gray here he is the assistant professor of law at willamette university he's the president of the modern money network he's an advisor to politicians including rashida taleb and he's one of the authors of the stable act we've recently had a state of the nation show with coin center where we brought this up and they said why don't you bring rowan on the show so he can speak for himself so that's what we're doing we're bringing rowan on the show to talk a little bit about the stable act and some of his core beliefs rowan welcome bankless it's great to have you how are you doing sir thanks for having me well i'm still alive so you know that's a bit of a joke but appreciate you having me on surviving the tsunami of twitter dms and yeah you know terrible comments i'm not sure yeah flaming bags of dog on my uh on my lawn notwithstanding everything yeah metaphorically speaking well um who was it was it bellagi recently david who who who talked about um or or was it um one of our guests talked recently about like twitter being sort of like the like the french revolution right where there's the entire time that's very much been my experience i'm sure it's yours lately as well but we are not here to do that what we want to find out rowan is what some of your um maybe maybe we'll start there at your first principle so david and i the bankless nation the bankless program has a variety of first principles reasons why we are in this space we we describe it in various ways one of course is like um more self-sovereignty to the people more power to the people away from the institutions that have historically controlled our lives for us it's very much about a public good a public infrastructure that we are creating a public money system that's accessible to the world and that is credibly neutral these are some of the principles that undergird the bankless movements we would call it in crypto and d5 a subset of that movement but let's talk about you first what are some of your first principles why are you doing what you do why do you care so much what is the foundation of your belief system yeah i mean well thanks it's a good question i mean the first thing is um that i'm you know i'm a leftist i'm a progressive so the people who don't want to take any value in that can sort of tune out here but um i i believe pretty deeply in individual sort of freedom and individual empowerment um and i think there's a role for monetary systems to play in empowering individuals and in sort of allocating social resources and and structuring the social provisioning process um a lot of what i focus on are the ways in which public institutions undergird markets undergird systems of of production and to sort of trace back or or peel back the layers of what may seem to be sort of neutral or decentralized or sort of you know a free market processes to look at the structures that underpin them and that govern them where there is some sort of actor who is exercising some sort of power and to try to look at how we can make those systems more democratic and more accountable to average people not just people who are born into privilege and wealth and access to means and things like that i'm an australian as you can probably tell by my accent i moved to united states in part because i am pretty acutely aware of how imperialism works in the modern age and and there's not really much attempt to much use in trying to change the world from australia um at least in public policy when the united states can pretty much exercise a veto in anything that we do um so you know if you were living in in ancient rome and you wanted to make change probably going to rome was the starting point and i moved to to a point where i was about 15 minutes away from wall street after living in dc so you can sort of take what you will from that in terms of where i see the power line um not because i have any love for bankers or anything like that but because that's sort of where in in the modern global economy the sort of power lies um i think probably where we disagree it may be a good starting point uh is just i think i have a very different theory of where money comes from and what it's where its value derives from i don't think that it comes from sort of markets i don't think it comes from some sort of technology of a medium of exchange or some sort of commodity that solves barter and a double coincidence of wants those were certainly ideas that i was introduced to as at a young age and through sort of standard economics education and the more i looked into it the more i looked into the history the anthropology um the legal history and and the sort of legal institutions behind those systems it became clear to me that that was a myth and largely propaganda and once i started looking at where money sort of actually comes from and how it actually operates throughout history and large advanced societies it led me to the kind of understanding of money that i have today and and the kinds of attempts to make change that i do today so i care about you know things like private anonymous cash for example i care very deeply about and i care very deeply about how to make sure in a digital world those kinds of features get retained but i think where i would disagree with a lot of people in your community perhaps is the idea that uh we can achieve that without it being a fiat instrument without it being a tool of public money and i think that that's probably why i think that a lot of the work that's going on in the crypto world is a distraction and a sort of wasted energy and that the real fight the real struggle will be over anonymous digital public cash which is where i think we should all be focusing so so we we want to get to that we want to talk uh about that a little bit um even including kind of your description of like the history of money and where it came from i wouldn't say that david and i are necessarily of the of cut of the cloth uh of like hardcore austrians like you might see many in the crypto space so i would say that we are like also very open to the idea that the money is not just um like from a barter system that it is kind of a debt type instrument it's definitely a social construct very open to that idea so you might actually find less divergence of opinion there but we did an entire podcast on on that concept is actually one of our very first podcasts where we kind of went through as like uh the barter myth and instead the how money was created by a community where they created a depository institution right like i in the in the podcast i called it a granary right a place where you know farmers come and deposit their food right and then their deposits were given credits and that's basically the formation of money by a social system that when you scale that up you create a nation state with it with a with a fiat right and i think that's kind of how where you're coming from rowan where that's kind of more or less how money is made but before we even get there david you know like i i definitely want to get there but i actually want to hear more about rowan uh on kind of the problem statement today right so so so before we get to that um let's talk about rowan what do you think the problems actually are with today's money system because we have a nation-state controlled money system we have fiat like fiat one that is the reserve of uh the world what's wrong with it today why like does it need to be changed what's not working for the people that's a great question as well i mean i think the first thing is that um we haven't sort of created a democratic society and then created money out of that as a democratic system we had systems of empire of warlords of white supremacy of slavery based economies of feudalism and we fought sort of tooth and nail to carve out pockets of public accountability democratic institutions that are very fragile i think we're seeing that right now around the world with the rise of strongmen authoritarians i think we're seeing that right now even the united states with things going on that if we don't keep actively fighting for those in expanding them they're going to contract again and that the default throughout history is that most of these sort of governing institutions have not been democratically accountable it's not that we start with sort of public democracy and then wonder what happened um and so what i think we saw after the post-war era was a a kind of moment where the the energy pushed towards more democratic accountability with some notable kind of exceptions particularly including things like race in the united states there was a very kind of white bent to the new deal kind of compromise um but and and of course an imperial event outside of the us with the marshall plan but if you if you look at what happened probably from about the 1970s onwards there was a kind of empire strikes back and and you know historians of political economy and others will call that the kind of neoliberal era but what it was was an attempt to re-naturalize money and the economy as something that exists as a product of markets and quote-unquote private enterprise and that was a very successful propagandistic effort people have sort of documented the the big money from from rich people and companies that went into constructing that to buying up university departments to building narratives in the media and the narrative that we have today is that money is not a public good it is something that comes from markets that the the sort of dominant metaphor in public finance is the taxpayer because where does money come from it comes from someone who pays taxes well that kind of begs the question of where did the money to pay taxes come from right it had to actually been created before it could be paid in taxes but if you start with the idea that money grows on taxpayers or grows on on people then you end up with sort of margaret thatcher's world where there is no such thing as public money there's only taxpayer money and i think that's the world in which we live today where public policy is being constructed on the basis that money is scarce that investment has to rob peter to pay paul that yes in theory there is sort of a productivity gain from from efficiency or from full employment but real you know in most contexts uh zero-sum game no free lunch thinking is the dominant way of thinking uh and that you know private investment it can do things that public investment can't um so i think that's the dominant starting point and the other big narrative i would say which is a little bit away from from what we sort of think about in this conversation with money but not that far away is the fight over full employment the fight over what it means to be a worker in the in the economy and to add value where we had debates in the 1940s and then again in the 1970s about guaranteeing everyone a right to participate in the economy and to labor to add value through their labor and we're still fighting that fight today we have millions of people unemployed who would love to earn money who would love to contribute to some collective common good who can't do it because we have not got a full employment economy where there's more work to be done than people to do it i mean there is work to be done but we're not paying people to do it so i think the failure of full employment the neoliberalization of finance and money and the kind of dominance of private interest in collective governance is where i would see the problem today on that last point the dominance of like private interests like what what we would what we would talk about is is probably the dominance of uh banker interests right um whether that's commercial banks whether that's other forms of of plutocrats plutocracy even you know kleptocrats uh we might say um but but also central banks so one of the like the thesis and bankless and in the crypto um world writ large is that um like the cantillian effect uh or the cantalon effect as some uh call it is basically positions the kleptocrats and the plutocrats and those in charge closest to the money spigot and so when they start printing money uh like buying back bonds or purchasing stocks or quantitative easing injecting it into the economy the recipients of those funds are those who hold assets so if you hold stocks if you hold real estate uh you know if you hold crypto even you are a recipient of that inflation and that issuance it's not necessarily going to the people and that has led to massive wealth inequality among a number of other factors over the past couple of decades and is continuing to increase um is that a problem that you see as well because for us in crypto and in bangladesh right like that's the state doing something that is not good for the people that's the state implementing um monetary policy decisions that are actually benefiting the wealthy and the bankers and excluding the people is that a criticism that you see as well uh yeah so there's one little technical quibble which we don't have to go into which is i don't think quantitative easing is necessarily or kind of monetizing government debt is the moment where a lot of this necessarily happens because i think if you look at government debt as a form of money then there's actually a separate layer going on there and the reason i start with that is because i think where i look at this and see a problem is that central banks are one institution in the public system and that institution is built and constructed in a certain way to give bankers basically direct access and to put their interest in the interest of what we might call free enterprise above other democratic considerations and so i spent a lot of time you can search my twitter record and things complaining about the 1951 treasury fed accord where up until that point the expectation was that the treasury that is to say the secretary directly accountable to an elected president would be able to determine interest rates and to to basically sort of have dominance over the fed and there was an institutional fight between the treasury and the fed at that point where the fed representing certain free enterprise interests aggressively pushed to take that power back and it came down to literally somebody being sick in hospital on one side of that fight and the other guy double crossing them basically like it was a it was a knife edge historical turning point and now if you read macroeconomic theory you read central banker reports they'll say central bank independence the ability to set interest rates according to how we think things should be done over elected representatives is a critical bull walk against government spending run amok so the entire edifice of central banking today is built on a fundamental distrust of elected officials and people representing the interests of the public now you can take that lesson that the government is corrupt and that any kind of public governance is corrupt or you can take that lesson that the private banking interests want a critical fight against democracy and that we've gone on a bad direction there and i i take that second view so i completely agree with you that central banks today are a reactionary tool of class interest against the public but i think the lesson there is we shouldn't cede you know public governance to those actors in the same way as we shouldn't have ceded it to the feudalists or to the slave owners right that there needs to be a a re-litigation of central bank supremacy within public finance and if you look at for example bills we worked on with rashida talib we proposed minting a trillion dollar coin which caused some people's heads to explode which was kind of but the point there was the treasury would issue that you can again look at look at all the resources that we put out about that we called it fiscal money for fiscal policy we don't need to come with our hand out to the central bank we don't need to ask them for permission we don't need to issue treasury securities which people are going to misunderstand and think as debt as something different from money i don't think it is different for money but it's it's easy for people to get confused because they think of it like their own debt but we don't need any of that if the government wants to spend on emergency cash relief to every single person which was the first bill i worked on with congresswoman to leave then the way to do that is issue the money and give it to people and do that through elected officials and through their representatives and leave these central bankers to their  and don't let them be gatekeepers to good public macroeconomic policymaking so i i think i probably agree on the diagnosis but i'm not sure we'd agree on the solution that's probably true and by the way i i do think there's a third option there right so you've got creptical corruptable bankers and corruptable uh politicians and you said you had to pick one or the others we kind of think both become corrupted over time through the the money system but i'll let david uh jump in with a follow-up here we'll get more to that later yeah i think this is actually where we could start to tease like the more concrete components of this conversation with regards specifically with the stable act but also rowan with the problems that you are trying to solve with like you know your your life's work you know when you wake up in the morning and and try and get things done or or things specifically with the stable act like who who are the people that are um being like who are the losers that are trying that you are trying to protect right who who are the disenfranchised that the current system is set up to that doesn't uh include right like what are the main fundamental issues that you see that uh things like legislation like the staple acts can help protect like what are the really big problems that that you are uh concretely trying to go after yeah and i think i probably should have mentioned one other thing at the beginning to clarify here which is in addition to sort of financial interest there's also technological interests right there are also and i think we can go back to the early history of governance here like the 5 000 year history of debt and things and it was not just financiers it was also the scribes and the lawyers basically anybody that had control over the complex tools of administration of governance who exercised power from their position with those tools and so today obviously finance is crucial right how are you going to pay for it who's got money who doesn't is a critical like layer of power but there's also who runs the technology right every computer around us in our pockets etc and i think we're seeing now a realignment of power around that in the same way as we saw with the railroad in the same way as we saw with oil and and steel and other forms of technology at different points in history that there's a new power structure emerging around digital computing technology and there are going to be people who are going to be the new scribes the new governance architects of the future that's being built right now whether that's mark zuckerberg and eric schmidt or it's a tribe of very you know white male technologically savvy free-market-oriented people who distrust any form of collective governance you know whether whatever the group is they are positioning themselves to be the new elite in in whatever kind of occurrency comes after the one that we've emerged out of right now and so to go to your question with this bill there's a couple of things one is there's a history of um financial interests playing cat and mouse with banking regulation the minute you regulate banknotes they switch to deposits the minute you regulate deposits they switch to another kind of instrument and there's a constant game of pushing out to whatever margins and when those actors eventually need public support and we can talk about why but inevitably they do in moments of crisis they then come and ask to be bailed out in the name of the average person or in the name of the entire economy and the lesson i think of banking history of shadow banking history is the way to deal with that is to regulate it on the upswing is to acknowledge that they're engaging in activities that you know while they've tried to put a different face on it put a different label on it are still fundamentally the same activities that we've regulated in the past and to minimize how systemically important they are so with this bill there's a couple of things one is if these kinds of stable coins become successful in the way that they hope you know whether it's mark zuckerberg with dm or circle and tether or die if it becomes successful that it's mass adopted there will be millions of people who aren't you know bankless nerds who who follow the podcast or you know people who are deep in in in the community right capital c it'll be people who just expect to be able to use this as another paypal right who don't want to think about it who get a wallet it's it's been made super easy to download on their phone or whatever else and one day they wake up and the whole thing is suddenly their money's gone right that's the kind of risk if this if this kind of energy succeeds in its wildest dreams at the same time if it doesn't succeed like that what i think is going to happen is the same kinds of financial institutions and big money investors that have played this shadow banking game at every other stage in history we'll get in we'll eventually turn around and get some sort of regulation just like usdc is trying to do now partnering with visa just like others are trying to get bank licenses or money transmitter licenses they will glom back on to the official system they'll start complying with the patriot act and everything else but they'll do so with just a little bit more power than they did before just that little bit less accountability we'll we'll forget some of the lessons about democratic oversight that we had last time and we can see this already with money transmitters money transmitters get to do things that banks wouldn't be allowed to do and the reason we have money transmitters is because there was a hole in the banking regulations at a certain point and they exploited it right paypal is doing things today that it wouldn't be allowed to do if it got a banking license and it didn't get that banking license because it managed to find that loophole and so i think on one hand it's about protecting the consumers who will be using these systems on the other hand it's about realizing that there's a power realignment between tech industry telecom and and banking and to try to address the new lords before they they start doing the next thing that they do because once upon a time you know jeff bezos and and uh you know zuckerberg and others were just young punks with a startup right and now they're super super kind of you know oligarchs who don't really give a about any accountability to any public at all i think what you're saying is like the the new boss is going to be the same as the old boss unless something but they're going to know how to code right that's going to be fast you were recently on dimitri's podcast and dimitri on an even earlier podcast with somebody from the defy ecosystem the decentralized finance ecosystem van spencer dimitri uh gave the opinion that like the reason why he thinks the world of defy and to me when i hear defy it's almost synonymous with with ethereum he saw that defy is cool and valuable explicitly because of regulatory arbitrage right like the d5 ecosystem is unregulated therefore we can do cool new things in this new ecosystem what you are worried about is that these cool new things becoming really really big and then starting to represent systemic risk and things like circle and and usdc are just leveraging new rails but that are unregulated to do new things uh and i would totally agree i do i do agree that like there is like the centralized actors like usdc like paxos like any like tether that are definitely uh skirting regulations in order to establish their businesses and establish their own native currencies to be a part of this ecosystem now i i do want to draw a line and this is where i think a lot of the crypto folk get really um upset about some of this regulation is is that there doesn't seem to be room for what me and ryan are really bullish on which is protocols money issued protocols and we can definitely debate about like the decentralization of something like die like i feel you are fully aware about uh veils of decentralization or decentralization theater and and die is definitely not as like decentralized as like bitcoin is or tcp ip is and so there are central there is a centralized team there are centralized beneficiaries but it's still more decentralized than than circle right it's still more decentralized than tether and what what i'm hoping to get out of this conversation with you rowan is is for you to include room in your mental models for what's going on in this industry that does allow for a fully decentralized currency to exist that doesn't that it would be outside of the stable act right i do believe that there is uh the possibility for protocol driven money that is that wouldn't that just wouldn't necessarily be doesn't cause the some of the existential risks that you are worried about i i don't see wh in your previous conversations i don't see you including room for completely computerized completely protocolized completely humanless monies and me and ryan are bullish on these possibilities coming out of our industry so yeah i think there's two things there the first thing is and i know i appreciate you guys taking the time to listen to other conversations and things i hope you've seen this bill isn't targeting private currencies bitcoin has its own unit of account ethereum is its own unit of account are not actually a stable coin under the definition in this bill right the instruments that qualify as a stable coin under this bill are instruments explicitly designed to function as public money by which i mean denominated in the fiat unit of account and to circulate in ways that public money is trying to do and just to get it out of the way the first instance because i'm a big believer in decentralized anonymous digital fiat cash my goal is to build a system where if you want to do peer-to-peer cash transactions in us dollars with nobody able to see it you can my view on that as a as a theory of money is that the only way to do that in a safe secure and and stable way long term is for the government to issue it itself that doesn't say the government issues all money right but it is to say the us dollar issues issued by the government has unique properties relative to a us dollar denominated token issued by anyone else and so we can try to play the game of my token is safe just trust me and i think we've played that game throughout history with bank deposits with bank notes and the the time and time against story is the only actual thing that can be guaranteed is when you issue the dollar yourself to ensure that the dollar convertibility so the first thing is no ethereum no bitcoin if you want to issue a private currency more power to you the second thing is about the technology i i don't have a problem with people developing technology the problem here is the systemic risk that comes with its wide scale adoption in day-to-day transactions and so when it comes to what you might call sort of computerized money i think the reality is that the economy is not built on human-less transactions the economy is built around human beings if you and i transact with a piece of paper or a paper dollar bill the paper dollar bill is is computerized in the sense there's nobody involved in it right but if you and i have a dispute there we go to a court and the court adjudicates that the court doesn't say the piece of paper has decided right and and my my old uh advisor at cornell james grimmerman who's a coder wrote a great piece called all smart contracts are inherently ambiguous and there have been others who've talked about this in the context of code you know going back to larry lessig and others that code itself is not a substitute for law it can automate certain physical processes but the the economy and commerce is built on legal institutions or property rights of contract dispute resolution of accounting principles of limited liability for entities and corporations for taught law even in instances where you didn't explicitly contract all of those things continue to apply regardless of what technology you're using to interface with another human being and so i could have a a perfectly written code and then we could disagree about how to interpret that code in light of an existing arrangement and that disagreement is going to come down to a court and a judge looking at two human beings on either side of a dispute whether or not the judge chooses to agree with the code or not will be a question for the judge and so i think that this you know to me it's sort of like saying the trench ball in matilda well i'd love a school without children how easy would it be to run a school if there were no messy children involved right having an economy where there's a money that doesn't involve people is in my opinion not a coherent concept because the economy is made up out of people just like the internet is there's icann there's isp providers there's people running individuals servers in their basement there's property rights around the land title of your basement right so i just i think i question the premise that we can automate social interaction to a point where society is not involved so the the way that i see uh you trying to eliminate risk out of the public institution of money is through an mmt type of perspective where you want uh stablecoin issuers like usdc to get a federal banking charter so they can get that fdic insurance in case that something goes wrong what ends up backstopping the risk from platforms like usdc is the ability to print money is that is that accurate yeah just to be clear fdic insurance i think is actually one of the like lesser tiers it's actually access to the federal reserve's balance sheet and the general protections that come with being part of the banking system and again colleagues of mine and my advisors have written a piece called the finance franchise where they look at the history of chartered banks and originally charters would come through specific pieces of legislation the massachusetts legislature would pass a bill creating the massachusetts bank and it was explicitly acknowledged as a kind of public private partnership it was like the panama canal and over time those private corporations or quasi-private corporations began to consider themselves independent of any public accountability right give me all the benefits of limited liability and none of the obligations to actually serve a public interest beyond profit that's the that's the neo-liberal as long as i'm earning profit i'm doing good for society right and and so the the fdic insurance is less important the real important thing is if you're the creator of the dollar whether that's the federal reserve or the treasury or some consolidated government that sits above any one institution it's the sort of you know constitution and everything else um you you make the dollar so yeah there is an infinity sign next to the amount of dollars that can be created by the us government of course that doesn't mean they should create an infinite but it does mean if if a dollar bill is a promise to pay ten dollars then you go get a take a ten dollar bill to the bank and you ask for the dollars they'll just give you two five dollar bills right because it's the same thing whereas a banknote is a promise to get those us dollars if you take a bank note in 1830 to the bank and you ask for us dollars the bank may or may not have us dollars and that's the same true whether it's a centralized stablecoin issuer like tether or usdc or a decentralized like die where the theory is that there's collateral sitting somewhere and that collateral is either actual dollars or worth enough dollars and hopefully the value of that collateral won't change but all of that is a theory that when you come with your token with a promise to pay somehow i'm good for it and i think our view is one actor in the whole system has a unique answer to that there's one unique answer to that that problem said and that is if you actually issue the dollar you can always pay right right and that's that's where the de-risking of a of a money system comes from is is the inherent solvency of the original issuer in in the d5 space in in what we call trustless finance or decentralized finance we we attack that same problem via the almost the opposite route where like the if a an application on ethereum is going to be quote unquote trustless it needs to be over collateralized and i've heard you on on various podcasts talk about or criticize like what's going on in the crypto space as just like the next iteration of financial like innovation or engineering right where you said like uh you know we we allowed the shadow banking institution to happen and then it got out of control and now it's massive and now they are saying like uh they just give the same old excuses as to like why they shouldn't be regulated and now you're what you say about d5 is something along those same lines like we have this new platform for innovation and this time quote unquote this time it's different right same old excuse as as we've all heard before i actually do think that quote unquote this time it's different and and the fundamental reason why is that there is a design ethos that is backing institutions like bitcoin and ethereum and d5 protocols that could produce a dollar denominated stable coin that they're designed good good protocols that get me and ryan and the bankless world really really bullish are uh protocols that are designed to withstand world war three right ethereum 2.0 it's it's in its rollout phase it's been designed with an anti-world with world war 3 resistance like what if nuclear bombs went off ethereum 2.0 should still operate and a lot of the d5 protocols that that we are really excited about are the ones that plug up all potential attack and risk vectors in order to make them world war iii resistant and so earlier you said you said uh we were talking about characterizing some d5 protocol that would produce a dollar where you would say hey use this money it's risk-free trust me we actually don't ask for your trust and that's why defy is so cool to us is that the way that these protocols are set up are inherently over collateralized with all possible attack vectors hopefully sealed probably not sealed and many bitcoiners would criticize the defy ecosystem for not having adequately sealed protocols but that is the vision we we believe that we can create these like inherently strong hard protocols that are are de-risked by the market because if they do have a in the armor if they do have a failure then they die and then they get replaced by new ones and those ones are supposed to be better by the laws of the free market and so what we are excited about is the potential for having de-risk financial institutions that don't actually require you know money printing to backstop risk that and that's kind of where our perspective uh comes from is that is that new to you or is this is this old information no this is old information but i'm happy to go there because i don't think i've done in some of the other interviews so there's two things there one is um when it comes to the collateral you say over collateralized right that's a conclusion right that's not a that's not a statement of fact you're saying that x collateral is is over whatever line that you consider to be the line of safety and maybe that's just where we frankly disagree is that i don't think those theories of over collateralization actually survive the tail risk kinds of risks that i'm talking about and then the second point there is well if it's got a in the armor it'll fail and something new will take its place looking for the front page of defy look no further than xerion.io xerion is your home base for managing your d5 portfolios xerion offers a central place for you to engage with all of the d5 protocols and assets that you engage with on a daily basis but all in one central spot here you can see i've loaded up a wallet and xerion is giving me the portfolio performance of all the assets in this wallet over time as well as a breakdown of all the assets that i own as well as all of my transaction history that i've ever done in an easy to view fashion xerion also lets you invest right into dfi's best yielding financial opportunities right from their home page xerion also makes it super easy to access interest in defy using applications like compound and ava in the background and you can

metamask or arjun or another ethereum address right into your mobile wallet so you can see your portfolio and engage in defy on the go here i just loaded up my argent wallet and now i'm going to load up my metamask as well and xerion will do the same thing it will add all of my assets and wallets together all in one space and give me a portfolio summary of what's going on adding wallets is trivially easy if you already have a metamask you can get it right into the xerion app and it can sync with your desktop app as well and the best part is you can also buy ether right into the app

your mobile device as well so download the app it works on ios and android go to xerion.io plug in your wallets and get a historical report of your portfolio over time as well as a comprehensive breakdown of all the assets that you own and how much yield they're generating for you we're also brought to you by monolith monolith is your cool new defy account your defy savings account your d5 checking account except the cool thing about the monolith defy account is that it gets software updates right you actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time so here are some of the features monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know defy and what it is you can you can add money to it you can put that money to work uh in compound and accessing yield uh but you can and you can also swap through uniswap what was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your smart monolith smart contract wallet on ethereum so it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a a savings account that gets software updates so this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world but you can still do real world things with you know real money in like buy your groceries so that's just fantastic coming soon to monolith actually already here to monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly right so it's also being an on-ramp so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like coinbase or gemini or wherever you can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet so check them out at monolith.xyz i'm talking about and then the second point there is well if it's got a in the armor it'll fail and something you will take its place that's exactly the argument that was given for free banking and what we saw was every time one of those failed a bunch of people got hurt right say diem actually takes off and then it fails and then mark zuckerberg goes welp we've learnt our lesson you know the next people that come after facebook will will have a better system well there's two potentially two billion users in the middle of that learning process and you know not not shady you but there's a lot of tech people that think the entire world is their playground to not learn the lessons of history and to repeat them like oh maybe i'll just do some human experiments oh that's unethical or there's problems with doing that well i guess i learned something this time no actually we learned that lesson 100 years ago and nobody should have let you pretend we hadn't learned that lesson and try it all again and when it comes to these d fire things i mean again if we're talking about 20 million dollars it's it's a rounding error if we're talking about 200 billion dollars that's not the kind of lesson we just let fail it is too big to fail whether whether we want it to be or not if there's if there's two trillion dollars of customer funds in these systems they're too big to fail they we can't just say lesson learned the free market will pick it up that is the kind of austrian response to the global financial crisis is we'll just liquidate everything right just let everybody go under let mortgage owners go under it people lose their jobs and the market will readjust yeah millions of people die in the meantime so here here's i think maybe a difference in kind of foundation because what what you were saying is basically like everything ultimately settles back to the nation-state legal system right with fiat currency yeah with with fiat currency but like with law in general it all kind of settles to that layer um we are like much more bullish on a new social layer that is being created just like you know some things in the human experience are settled outside of the nation state and outside of the legal system um things like you know ethics morality sometimes those things get written into law but religions are another inhuman institution where some sort of settlement can happen um like you you made the point that uh basically um crypto systems aren't decentralized because at the end of the day property has to settle to some sort of legal system but what about property transition between countries that don't trust one another who is the the judge that supersedes between a china that is antagonistic against a united states of america right which judge from which country sort of decides this is why we need overarching credibly neutral systems that essentially can provide the ability to transfer value and a property rights system that don't have any biases to one nation state or another we're talking about not like just a money system we're talking about a new social coordination system that is being built on these crypto rails and this is powerful stuff and it's outside of the legal system in some ways the nation-state legal system and the thing about this is um right like it is immune in some ways from the authoritarianism that you also want to to prevent right because it is not of the nation-state it is a different social structure and social system we're bullish on that but what we see when we look at the stable act is a little bit of like we're with you on the the dm stuff and the facebook and the zuckerberg trying to become a new banker and centralize control i hear you like we're with you like we understand what you're talking about i'm even with you on kind of these new crypto banks becoming like the old crypto banks that we used to have like i get it we're with you where we depart is we believe that there are credibly neutral protocols that can be developed and a protocol like the constitution is a protocol tcpip is a protocol no single country owns the protocol of tcp it's a standard for the communication of information of data we think such a thing can exist also for value and for property and we think that you should not squelch that you should be like we're on the same team we want a more bankless world basically and we want some of that innovation and that protocol to also grow in in in the us so maybe it was a misinterpretation of the the stable act maybe some things should be like um crafted in it to uh like protect what we're trying to do on the kind of the defy side and the self-sovereign side of things but we absolutely want the ability for every citizen to run a node an ethereum node without fear of some kind of legal reprisal because some some some company has issued a stable coin that is against a regulatory regime so i i guess maybe without getting to the specifics of the stable act like do you resonate with that are are you okay with this experimentation happening do you believe that maybe you're skeptical of it that's fine to be skeptical of it there's tons of people are skeptical of crypto but um are you fine with letting that experiment play out and seeing if we can actually build a bankless money system that it sort of meets the standards of of not having central intermediaries what do you say well so there's there's a couple of things there one is again this bill isn't stopping anyone for creating a private currency so you want to create private currency go for it it's the point in which you start issuing a stable coin denominating us dollar or another fiat currency instrument and trying to pass it off as public money where there's going to be an issue um and then and then to go from there the point about the nodes just to be very clear and i've clarified also to clarify here there the law regulates the issuance of stable coins and requires you get a banking charter for doing that what people responded almost immediately was you'll never you'll never stop us because these networks are decentralized right so immediately they've probably lost you if you agree that there's this veil of decentralization right but that was their response well we're going to create a network where there's only nodes there's only nodes there's no one else above nodes so you can't you can't go after anybody who is for these stable coins unless you go after every node operator and my response was if that's true then the only response is to go after every node operator because if you have a hundred people engaged in a criminal enterprise the fact that there's a hundred instead of one doesn't mean that they're not all liable right but and this was a crucial part that everybody stopped listening i don't think that's actually an accurate description in these contexts i don't think ethereum is decentralized i don't think if there was a stable coin issued on the ethereum network it would be impossible to identify the issuer above a node level i don't think that's true and so it wouldn't be going after node operators on ethereum it would be going after the issuer of the stablecoin on ethereum and if people say oh you can't find us we're hiding amongst the nodes i just call on that frankly but if you were going to design a system like that if you're going to say okay we want to keep doing this and we get caught up on a theory and we get caught out so this time we're going to design a system where we are perfectly hidden amongst the nodes on that system the answer would be okay we're going to go after each node operator and i think that's that's the line where i am willing to take a hard stand because you can't hide amongst a hundred people to do something that would be illegal if you were doing it on your own that's the basic principle here that isn't to say we're coming after node operators who run an ethereum node i'm i'm happy that people fundraised off that and people managed to but that's not at all what this was bill was about i mean would you be open to carving that out in such a bill to just clarify literally i've literally said to people first of all the way that we wrote the bill was that any activity that commercial activity so if you're running a non-commercial if you're engaging in non-commercial node validation fine you're immediately exempt anyway but any commercial activity related to this stuff would have to get prior approval from regulators in the same way as if we issue dangerous drugs you're gonna get prior approval now what i would support and do support is have a carve out for people who are engaging in node operations as long as that operation is not the only entity responsible for issuing the stablecoin right any node operator who is not the primary actor or a member of the class primarily responsible for issuing stable claims would be exempt that's fine now there's a question of how you draft that i think that should happen at the layer of regulation the bill gives regulators the authority to write that law if you want to lobby for regulators to put that rule in place as an interpretation of this law on day one i'll sign that no problems right what i am not going to allow or i don't think is reasonable to allow is someone to say okay i'm going to create a decentralized blockchain where the whole network every single node is identical there's no miners there's no validators they're just all identical and the whole thing together issues stable coins but you can't come after anybody unless you come after all of us if that if that's created the answer is to go after all of them so so the the node operators don't have any uh explicit relationship with a specific protocol on ethereum so like you know one one protocol in ethereum might just simply be like the usdc contract address and so while i run a node or i'm mining a transaction i'm processing those transactions from that contract address even though i'm not the issuer and so in terms of uscc it sounds like the stable act would go after usdc the issue or circle the issuer absolutely and then and then with die or make or dao you know you you're calling on the decentralization theater there are people there that we could go talk to and exert regulatory pressure upon them and therefore we don't even need to talk about nodes in that instance either kind of going back to what i was saying though with like world war iii resistant protocols the goal of ethereum is to produce uh such a human removed entity a human removed uh protocol that is in itself is almost synonymous with ethereum when something is completely decentralized in in with and there are contracts on ethereum there are protocols on ethereum that are 100 human removed and when that i don't agree you do you don't even you it sounds like you don't even think that's actually possible no if every single person who's running an ethereum node today turned it off where would those smart contracts exist in they will they would be stored in the database which so if every single person who ran one of those nodes destroyed those those nodes where would where would this mark yeah then then it would be eliminated but so we've identified a layer of human beings haven't yeah but but we're talking about um like 8 000 nodes i think just got spun up in the last week and then i think it's over like 12 000 now like at some point we have to talk about how feasible it is to even be able to track all of this stuff okay but now you've switched gears right let's be honest here you switch gears from there's no people to there's a very large network okay how many how many people are in are in organized crime networks do you think there are mafioso groups that don't have 8 000 members i mean there are right that we know there are because we've seen them in throughout history right 8 000 sounds like a big number when you're used to networks of 20 servers it's not that big a number when you're looking at criminal enterprises that span nations so i don't think that's a fair comparison because mafia networks are human to human and they they create trails but nodes are one node is completely independent from any other node i could have three nodes in my house that are all independent from each other and and it's just part of the same like nebulous set of and then at the end of the day you're totally right these these bitcoin ethereum protocols on ethereum they're created by humans but at some point it becomes such like a kind of like a virus like how do you control a virus like it's just it just the whole idea about these systems is that they are so easy to self-replicate that they it's like a termite you can't get rid of it but we do we do get rid of termites we do get rid of viruses very well not well but but not zero right like new zealand has just eliminated covert right and the way they did that was they dealt with a country of five million people and they put a wall around it now i'm not saying that's the right way to do every kind of problem but i think that there's you know you've got to be honest here with yourselves there is a difference between saying there's a large distributed network and that there's no individual people involved in that right the three nodes you're running you choose you choose what you're putting on those nodes i think software i think if this is an argument that the nation state could stamp out like a bitcoin or ethereum i think like a coordinated nation-state attack against these systems could do them significant damage there are humans that run the validators and run the machines one of the guarantees that we haven't talked about yet is of course the crypto economic guarantees which is the reason that people don't shut off their validators is because they're incented not to so if one country goes like authoritarian on a decentralized network like a bitcoin and ethereum but another country or some small pocket decides not to they benefit uh disproportionately and so they don't that's why these these crypto economic systems are are so resilient to that kind of attack at this stage whether a nation state could take it down or not is not really the issue i don't i don't see the us or like a western liberal democracy doing that at this point i mean like i guess two other issues i kind of had with the stable act right or that you just got on that on that question before you got the stable act which is that's also true of like nazi gold right if we say we're not going to let nazi gold go into people's bank faults and then switzerland puts its hand up and says i'm not going to look and ask questions or argentina says yeah sure you can come here and set up a pig farm it doesn't matter i mean the argument there is is not unique to computers it's just pointing out that people can engage in arbitrage between nation states and that's why there's a bunch of billionaires with bank accounts in the cayman islands i i get your point on that but i'm not sure it's unique to crypto it's just if i'm rich and powerful enough i can find someone willing to let me do what i want what is unique to crypto specifically with bitcoin and ethereum is these protocols are designed to be as viral as possible right they are engineered to be unstoppable which means that like the having it a conversation about whether we can or cannot i think is is is futile like the there if these things are doing their jobs they are untouchable therefore like any sort of like top-down control upon node operators it's not going to work because even if you do control the node operation from inside the country that you have domain over the network is ultimately unphased as a whole due to all the nodes that you don't have domain over so then why do you even bother trying to exert control under your own constituents well i think this is where there's maybe a misunderstanding of the point of the bill right the point of the bill is not to stamp out networks the point of the bill is to manage systemic risk from those networks and so what the goal of the bill is is to prevent these stable coins from becoming the new banking right from becoming the new primary layer of the economy that millions of consumers are putting their money into now we didn't stamp out torrenting right but that doesn't mean that most official commercial companies right now get all of their content by illegally torrenting now i happen to have no problem with torrenting right i think that's right ip producers but i think the the the point there is you don't need to stamp out a whole network you just need to make that network unattractive to the point of becoming central to the official economy and in the case of the united states like i think yeah the united states probably should take responsibility for the rest of the world in in what happens to the u.s dollar but if you had a system where no individual consumer in the united states and no major company and no business small business in the united states was using a risky stablecoin i would consider that a success in the sense that the systemic risk of stable coins to the us economy is going to be reduced there's not going to be that bank run in mary poppins of of average americans right that's the goal so yeah you're not going to stop someone in siberia running a node necessarily like that but you are going to stop that from becoming the new shadow banking that has trillions of dollars in the american economy when there's a crash they're too big to fail but that's the goal right it's a feature not a bug another another piece of the the stable act is uh there seems to be an issue in the stable act when any currency kind of uses the um unit of account of the us dollar right so you could envision something possibly that's not been created yet something like a die um but much more decentralized right maybe maybe sort of as decentralized as ethereum and ether and bitcoin but is somehow uh pegged or leverages the unit of account of the us dollar you seem to have an issue with that right so this is different than a a circle or a coinbase or a facebook issuing their own kind of stablecoin this is a very a decentralized protocol network issuing an asset that might be backed by collateral or however they do it that that is decentralized but is using the unit of account of the dollar the stable act the brand uh yeah uses the the stable act minor standing would prohibit that too why like what's what's what's the issue what's the issue there why why can we not use the public good of the dollar with these with these uh d5 protocols yeah so it's a good question and just to be clear the point here is not anything that ever uses the unit of account it's the unit that is issues something in the unit of account with the expectation that retain a fixed or or so stable as so fixed as to be stable value so stocks for example are issued in the unit of account but stocks fluctuate in value right that nobody holds a stock expecting it to maintain a stable nominal value relative to the us dollar they they fluctuate now one moment where that becomes an issue is the money market mutual fund industry they issued shares right that were in theory a share can fluctuate in value but the point of the mmf shares was that they were supposed to be stable in value they were supposed to never break the buck and when they broke the buck it was a huge source of systemic risk because they had built an entire business model on the expectation and belief that they can't do that and so when we look at how instruments function it's not the collateral backing in and of itself that's the problem it's the promise of stable value that can't guarantee because if people take it seriously if it takes its word yeah yeah this is stable we're literally calling ourselves stable coins right and then they start using it as though it's as good as us dollars right people use money market mutual fund shares as though they were as good as bank deposits they weren't and that caused a huge systemic risk and when you look through the history of common law obligations monetary obligations in contract law in in financial commerce things like that what the over and over a really important layer was what they called the nominal layer so people you know austrians and others will complain about the real purchasing power of the us dollar fluctuating right but what a hundred dollar bill will guarantee you is you can pay a hundred dollars worth of debts that's a nominal layer you can you can disagree how important you think that is but on that layer the nominal guarantee of a hundred equaling a hundred if it turns out a hundred doesn't equal 100 that's incredibly risky and destabilizing to the whole monetary economy we had banks that issued banknotes that were worth 10 pounds and then people realized those banks were risky and every time they walked into a store they had to negotiate how much of a discount they would put on that banknote so there'd be a ten dollar banknote and you would pay for something worth seven and they'd say this banknote is actually only worth five and the next day it might be worth eight the next day it might be worth four but if that banknote is designed to function like it's always going to be worth 10 and everybody starts using it interchangeably with us dollars right oh who cares if i have 100 in my actual bank account or in cash or i have 100 in my stable coin balance they're the same thing they're both 100. and then it turns out one day the stuff that was in your stablecoin wallet is now worth 50. that is the source of systemic risk the nominal stability not not just and that's tied to the unit of account because we get we denominate debts in the unit so rowan i take i take your point about money market mutual funds act against kind of a shadow bank like we've seen that that that happened like one could also argue that that euro dollars right now exhibit those same behaviors and by the way that's a absolutely massive market much bigger than the 30 billion dollars or so in stable coins out there so i i'm hopeful this bill has something to say about that if it's if it's targeting that i mean to my understanding euro dollars would meet the definition of of the stable coin deposit okay but but that aside one thing that is being missed here i feel like is i can't click view source on my euro dollar like i have no idea what's inside my euro dollar yes and like what's back is issued by a european bank yeah a black box like so the difference with defy is this you can actually like click view source and see all of the assets all of the collateral that back a given asset right this is a much more audit ever easiest audit ever it's a much more open and transparent monetary system it doesn't have the black box flaws that something like the euro dollar might have or some traditional finances those banks submit to audit requirements they submit to reporting requirements the problem is their theory is wrong their theory of why they work the way that they say they're going to work is wrong and so you could you can audit that code right but you may look at a certain thing and interpret it slightly differently you may you may look at an upgrade and think oh there's nothing wrong with this upgrade and you made a mistake or let's be honest if this becomes systemically important how many people are auditing that code how many i mean do we really think that 200 million americans are going to start using stable coins as their primary median payment payment and they're all going to be inspecting the source code of course not they're going to trust certain actors in the same way as we trust we trust auditors and intermediaries for credit reporting and all other kinds of stuff let me ask you let's say the crypto people uh are right right um i think you think this is not going to be the case but let's say that bitcoin or ether become a reserve asset for the world right would you have something like would you have a big problem with that like fundamentally because your whole the whole um fear of money that you have is basically to to save us from the systemic risk we need it in the hands of a public institution that can sort of print money right so the prevent bank rent right so i understand that but you can't do that with a bitcoin or an ether so it well it would seem to be thinking of the mining pool you could well so sure but it seems to be the case that you would be against a monetary system like that too even if the people chose it if kind of the free market shows it and essentially we adopted it like that's where some of this becomes a little bit of like you know at what point does the nation state sort of restrict individual choice and say no sorry citizen you can't choose your own money this is the money that we have for you it's a public institution you have to adopt it like we're banning these spits like how far how far do you push it well for the first of all nobody's banned gold i'm not recommending banding gold i've never said something like but i've never said i've never recommend that in my life i think residual leave is doing either right but but to go to your point there's two things one is i don't think that's going to happen if you actually look through the history of gold standards in throughout history they have been actively maintained through public law and i think going back to your earlier point this idea of sort of creating a layer above nation states you asked about china in the united states i mean this is real politic right they have armies do you really think that they're going to put down their armies and and ascribe to some liberal theory of property rights above the nation state i mean this is liberal idealism at its at its highest that suddenly people who have control over means of enforcement are going to just sort of out of the better nature agree to some higher ideal against their interest that's that's not how we've actually got any democratic gains throughout history we've got it by seizing powerful institutions i mean there is no international layer there that forces those two actors to do what they want they go to war and that's a problem and there's a reason why we haven't had a war within the united states between states since the civil war because we don't let individual states create armies against each other now if you want to have some one world government based on a belief in private property rights i mean more power to you but i don't think that you're going to miraculously have the institutions of power give up that power in the name of of ideals that's not how it works it happens when people stand up and demand accountability and up until now the the flip side has always been democracy has been on the side of the debtors it's been on the side of the people without property rights it hasn't the people who've been standing up to create supranational institutions to defend property rights have been usually doing so against the interests of working people and so when it comes to your currency model a hard currency like the kind you're talking about a commodity backed or a commodity linked currency whether it's a digital commodity or real commodity is pro creditor it's inherently deflationary which means if you got in early and you have assets that you own you get richer and richer at the expense of every next generation now to the extent that there have been moments in history where feudal lords have convinced peasants that it is in their best interest to maintain feudalism yeah i think you can fool some of the people some of the time i happen to think that those systems are pre-fundamentally anti-democratic now luckily that's not a problem we have to deal with in the stable act the stable act is specifically dealing with an emergent risk right now in the banking system if you want me to ask me what i would do in the moment where we have a hard currency i'd be in the room saying we shouldn't do this we should have a currency linked to human labor where everybody who wants to work to contribute to the common good can earn currency doing so that we eliminate rent seeking whether that's intellectual property or landed rent or whatever else and that we provide free goods to people outside of the cash nexus like we do with health care and education and everything else that works well for universal service provision and that the laborers who earn the money to to contribute to the common good provide the services that are then available to people who can't work that's the kind of democratic monetary system i want to build but it's not about protecting private property rights ted turner owns half of montana his property rights so ro so ron another thing that struck me as odd in in the stable act is uh you are a very sort of anti big bank yet these stable coin issuers would require a bank charter in order to operate like we very much believe sort of a you know the banking system is a cartel of sorts protected uh cartel of sorts why force them to be members of this this cartel the stable act seems uh incomplete if it doesn't incorporate the other aspects of of your of your vision and it's just leaving the banking system as is but like forcing stable point issuers to become banks what's what's your response to that yeah that's a good question there's a couple things first of all the bill that we released a month before this bill was the public banking act which would create uh new facilities at the federal reserve create a set of grants create a onboarding process for the chartering process to speed it up to create a separate form of deposit insurance and securities license for actors that wanted to create public banking institutions owned by the public government not for profit without shareholders in the interest of communities and that's specifically designed to make those commercial banks obsolete we don't need them to do anything systemically important right now one of the reasons why those commercial banks are important is because they run the payment system right they go under people can't make transactions two they're responsible for a large amount of investment if we don't get to make bank loans the economy stalls what we proposed with rashida to leave's bill originally was anonymous digital cash and fed accounts for everyone at the central bank and a postal banking system where they could go deal with their banking services at the post office right the post office the first internet right they subsidized packets going around the whole country they created information network where nothing existed one of the most socialistic institutions in the us government it operated since the birth of the republic and it issued postal savings and deposit accounts in the 1940s and 50s and 60s until the big banks shut it down because they didn't like the competition so before the big banks came for crypto they came for public postal banking and then and they that was the bigger threat that actually did threaten their commercial interests commercial banks don't get feel threatened by crypto they're just going to take it over when it becomes important but what we're trying to do here is it's a lesser of two evil situation i mean i have you know personally my politics go towards the side of i don't need commercial banks at all but this bill is saying if you're going to engage in banking activity you need to be regulated like a bank and be explicit public private partnership because you know go back to that earlier point that i made about neoliberalism the whole point of neoliberalism is to give the impression that actors that rely on public support are purely private they don't have any accountability beyond the market and profit so these shadow banks are doing everything that regulated commercial banks are doing in terms of systemic risk in terms of socializing the benefits and socializing the losses and privatizing the benefits but they're doing so without any of the accountability that comes with the public private partnership model and so getting them out of the shadows into the regulated system is a critical step is that as good as replacing them with public banks entirely no but it's it's a it's an important step and the the solution in my opinion is not to throw them even further to the shadows and say they've got even less accountability to the public is to bring them in now in 2009 there was a point where they could have socialized and nationalized half of those banks instead of bailing them out they didn't do that because the banking interest didn't let them that's that was a failure right the next time this happens maybe that'll go differently but if we had a system of anonymous digital cash fed accounts postal banking a government investment program and a network of public banks there wouldn't be much need for commercial banks anymore and all the claims that the crypto stable coin community has is if you regulate us too much you'll kill innovation well i don't agree with that i think there are ways to have public investment in innovation that would not require them to be allowed to do whatever they want without accountability so that's the alternative you you require them to get a banking license some of them are going to get banking license is going to come out of the shadows some of them aren't going to come into existence and all that energy can be redeployed in pursuit of actual public financial infrastructure so rowan is it possible for you to do all of this like go pursue mmt go pursue this new banking system in the us without crushing crypto through aggressive regulation and crushing defy and crushing this experiment that we're running to create a different set of social protocols that the world can run on top of like we're worried that you're trying to crush the new internet here that we're building and we think that a lot of the goals that you have are common with the goals of crypto and the bankless movement i think they're like hugely synonymous actually well i mean take your point i mean there are many encrypted who are very anti-mmt of course right but like go do mmt right and like may the best system win why can't we just have that sort of relationship in a free and open republic such as the united states what's your take my take is if you want to create a private cryptocurrency i honestly wish you the best i don't think stable coins meet that definition and and for example if somebody said hey we just want to counterfeit us dollars why can't we just be left alone if you want to print us dollars at the us mint go do that and let the best man win well no there's a reason why those two things are intentional counterfeiting is a little bit different well no okay let me let me be clear it's different only in this sense that a bank deposit and a us dollar are issued by different actors but counterfeiting a bank deposit is what a stable coin is doing in my opinion now you may disagree with that fine but if you accept that view that a a stable coin is an unlicensed bank deposit and that the reason we license bank deposits is because they are an extension of the public monetary system then these actors are not trying to just do stuff in the in the privacy of their own basement they're literally coming for the us dollar they're literally trying to encroach on the space the public system if you want to create a private currency in your own universe by all means i will defend your right to the death to do that and i will defend it against other people who would love to shut it down but if you want to start trying to mimic public dollars you're not creating the new world you're just doing the same thing that every other bank has done in history which is piggyback on the public monetary system and when it comes to building the internet i know nobody in your world is going to find this remotely convincing but i'm actually trying to save you from yourselves because you if you if you build an entire crypto community on the back of stable coins which is what's happening before our eyes right now right those those bitcoin ethereum systems are piggybacking and increasingly dependent on stable coins and that whole system comes crashing down you will have destroyed the vision of the whole thing and actually if we look back at the birth of the internet i work for this you know i'm a network manager sort of evangelist for this group called the freedom box foundation it's run by evan moglin uh he was the uh he was the legal counsel for the free software foundation he worked with richard stallman directly for 25 years i believe very deeply in free software free hardware free culture free bandwidth right and i think that if you look at even groups like the eff and the sort of zealous defenders of section 230 they have become their own worst enemies because what is the internet now it's a bunch of walled gate houses run by big mega companies right that vision of the free uncensored news net of the 90s it exists around the margins but it's dead and i wish it hadn't been allowed to die and if we had made some different decisions earlier on it might still be alive in a different way and i think this is this is one of those moments if you if you sell out to the us dollar you will live to regret it when's your legislation going to come down the pike that will support defy and true decentralized networks and protocols and crypto in the us when is that legislation if you believe in this vision and you want to save us from ourselves how are you going to foster that innovation in the united states well first of all i i signed on board of coin centers you know i'm i'm all in support of their of their letter trying to protect the right to self-host wallets i i'm all in support of that and i think it's really important advocacy work and as i said earlier and i wasn't being ironic i'm genuinely happy they managed to fundraise off misrepresenting my words because they're an important voice out there and i'm glad they've got a you know a place in dc i wish them all the best on that work i disagree with them when it comes to money because i think my understanding of money throughout history is it's not an anti-government tool it's always a rich and powerful elite group relying on government supports to support to to to fund themselves and if you want to create a private a a genuinely decentralized net stay the hell away from money do it with information do it with knowledge do it with culture i i support all of that stuff and and when it comes to bills like that i mean to be clear i'm a monetary expert right that's where i focus on i'm focusing on digital currency the work that i'm doing around anonymous digital cash is honestly there's about three people in the world doing it with me i feel very alone i would welcome people in the crypto space to fight on that and props to jerry and peter when we had this conversation they immediately went out and wrote stuff saying if we're going to have a digital dollar it needs to be anonymous in cash and i said yes you guys are right you're on the right track we're completely aligned on this because as far as monetary systems and the digitization of money goes these governments are going to build a surveillance system unless people step in and every person who goes you know what i'm just going to tune out and drop out like that's the 1960s hippie approach it didn't work the people who stayed in the boring room wearing the suit built the the wall street of the 1980s without them while well they all left can i just say rowan i'm worried that you won't be successful in that i'm worried that i'm worried that i'm worried that what what's going to happen is we're going to centralize more power in the current monetary system that we have and people like you might want a private money system but not enough people in the government do and we'll end up with something like the uh what china's doing with their digital currency and like so so this is the thing like we can't put all our eggs in the basket that you're talking about like we can't as a society and as a people like what happens if you're wrong what happens if you don't win those arguments we end up with a more centralized system that's now doing mmt and it's fully surveilled and we can't even open a bank account against an authoritarian government who's like what happens if you're wrong about those things we lose we all lose yeah but we lose anyway mate this is my i this is maybe just a tactical disagreement strategic disagreement if you're talking about building a currency for world war three compliance i don't know what planet you're talking about after world war three right but you're talking about one where there's probably a nuclear winter for 20 or 30 years you're talking about most vegetation on the planet's dead but hey at least i've got some digital gold assets i mean come on this is not this is not the priority in that moment if you really think that there's a way to build around the governments of the world and the control they have i i don't i just don't agree with you i don't think the currency layer is what stops tanks i just don't think it's true and you know mass revolution sure i'm with you but but but like making sure that your 100 million dollars is safe in your basement it doesn't make a difference you can have as much gold as you i have this conversation with dimitri you can have as much gold as you want if they're coming from every single member of your family or your race is not going to help you and what dmitry said is well at least you can buy your way out and that works if totalitarianism comes in one country it doesn't work if it's everywhere so if it's world war iii and it's authoritarian regimes from the u.s to china where do you buy your ticket to i mean what milton friedman's grandson seasteading in the pacific you think you think that the cruisers in the pacific are gonna let him do that come on i mean what is the alternative we're all in this we're all in this bloody globe together and we either we either stop them from building the procedures of totalitarianism or we don't but if we don't digital currencies private digital currency is not going to save especially not one built on the us dollar rowan i i'm i'm struck by the very strong similarities that i see with what you are doing with what what me and ryan are doing while simultaneously there being some absolutely completely polar opposite features as well as far as like a discussion goes i'm really happy that you came on and gave us some of your time to go through some of these details i think it was for me it was really educational to kind of hear a similar yet opposite or or similar yet different perspective and i think i hope a lot of the listeners um kind of learned about like what are because i do believe that there are some very real criticisms of the cryptocurrency industry coming coming from from what you are saying and and i do hope you know that at the same time like it is a constant conversation in the world of crypto that if we just end up recreating the same systems that we've seen before then we've lost like the crypto is supposed to be something new something better or something cool and likewise i see you acting as a steward of public goods i understand that you understand that public goods are some of the most important things that we can endeavor to create that's also something that we see ourselves doing here at bankless and uh making sure that the listeners understand that there are more than one ways to get to public goods i think is really important and i and i think you coming on and sharing your perspective i think was really valuable to what we call the bankless nation um i i have an article that i want to send you to and get your opinion on uh it's called the global public goods and the protocol sync thesis it kind of illustrates how we see public goods coming out of the space and i want to see if it resonates with you and likewise i think this will not be the last of of rowan gray uh when it comes to crypto legislation and i'm looking forward to maybe having you back on in the future to talk more about about the subject matter yeah thanks for having me and yeah i completely agree i think i think we do share a lot of common goals i think we diverge at a very sort of early point in the road and that's where it ends up looking like there's a lot of difference and look if you're right and you succeed honestly i'm happy too right i think i think it's the wrong way but i think we do actually want to avoid the same kinds of risks in the long term so thanks for having me on i appreciate the fair questions cheers roan it's been a pleasure guys that has been another episode of bankless wrists and disclaimers of course eath is risky so is crypto so is bitcoin my goodness mmt feels kind of risky too you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us on bankless
