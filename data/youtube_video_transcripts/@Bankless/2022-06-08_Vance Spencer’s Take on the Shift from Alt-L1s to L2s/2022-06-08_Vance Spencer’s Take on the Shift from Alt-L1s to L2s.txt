so if we take the lessons of 2021 and the end of 2022 what are the big takeaways from this particular bull market the first one i would just think about is just base layers i think what we learned about base layers and specifically you know all tell ones or ethereum killers or whatever you want to call them is how easy it is to build something that looks like a competitor to ethereum but how hard it is to actually bootstrap it in the long term and keep it going and build economic security in d5 i think you know what i learned was we have dominant players in most existing categories today and one of the memes of d5 was that these projects are the victims of their own success uniswap happens and then sushi swap copies them and then compound happens then ave copies them and you know all of these things which would suggest that d5 is just a race to the bottom i just don't think that actually played out the way that the market expected it to and i think it's fundamentally positive just to show the pathway how winners can emerge from d5 you know there's just such a rich amount of information over the past two years that we're really focused on taking stock and actually trying to apply what we learned versus just repeating the same lessons over and over again
