hey bankless nation welcome to another episode in our series the road to permission list this is uh a podcast series interviewing the companies and projects that are coming to the permissionless conference which is happening in may david give us a download well first of all i should say metamask is on this podcast okay so we're talking to taylor and we're talking to johann who is the product lead infrastructure at metamask taylor of course came over from my crypto she is an ethereum wallet og uh got got us through the 2017 ico days so it's a fantastic conversation with them but what is the permissionless conference for those who don't know yet oh dude it is the next conference that is infiltrating people's brains and i know this because when i was at devconnect this last weekend uh everyone was talking about the next conference that people are going to which is permissionless of course in three weeks from the time of recording uh it is held in west palm beach florida um and it is just going to be probably i think the biggest defy event but also a brand new track that i've never seen any other conference hold before which is the metaverse track which is a symbiosis of gaming the creator economy virtual worlds and just digital brands all of these digital things that collectively we are now calling the metaverse and the track the metaverse track i think is going to be some of the most fire content uh that i think exists so far in the content stream uh you guys will know so many of the people going to permission list you can see them on the website but it's basically a reunion of the bankless podcast and that is what we are helping block works out with doing scheduling some of the hottest speakers uh the the people that have gotten the most amount of views on the bankless youtube and putting them into the hottest content and panels there taylor monahan of metamask has a uh a keynote uh talk titled i think it's really really hot titled the infrastructure that gets us to the end game and that's actually where we start this conversation off with metamask about some design philosophy with wallets because i think when you come into this uh crypto space ryan you're like oh wallace it's the thing that i do my crypto things with and then you don't really think about it too much more after that but when you have basically every single user going and interacting through crypto versus with your wallet these small tweaks the small nuances of the choices that wallets make become critically important so that's where we get this conversation started and then we go into all the various things that metamask is working on the institutional side of things the nft side of things the layer two side of things uh and then we finish off with of course some advice for permission lists which taylor is also a veteran of so she grave some gave some great into uh conference alpha at the end of this yeah absolutely and i you know what i like about um permissionless as well is uh it's kind of a melting pot just like the bankless podcast right it's like you know some some conferences are focused on the builders others are focused on kind of the you know the suits some are focused on nft this is like all of them it's kind of just like the bankless podcast where we try to cover everything that's happening and cross defy nfts the metaverse and you know that's going to be the style and the vibe of the permissionless conference so if you don't have your ticket there still might be some time i think not too many tickets left but there still could be some uh and there is a link in the show notes to a 30 discount if you are a bankless premium member which amounts to like several hundred dollars at this point we'll pay more than a year yeah it's a nice roi on that instant roi if you're planning to attend uh permissionless anyway so go check that out and now we will get to our episode with metamask on the road to permissionless hey bankless nation welcome to our road to permissionless series yet again we've got the folks from my crypto meta max now entirely metamask here we've got taylor monahan she's the former founder and ceo of my crypto which has become metamask in a recent acquisition also johan borman he bourneman he is the product lead at metamask johann taylor welcome to bankless thank you for having me uh you know what we got to start here because you know some people may not have heard about madame ask we'll just start there anyway i think almost everyone in in the bankless community and in d5 probably has heard of metamask but for someone who hasn't taylor how would you explain what metamask is metamask is how you access this new world that everyone is building it is a quote-unquote wallet meaning it is sort of at the most basic level where um you you access all of your digital assets whether that's your eth whether that's your tokens whether that's on l2s and the ever-expanding ecosystem but more importantly it's it's really like this connection to um to dapps that allow you to really get the value out of all the the crazy experiments that people are are throwing into the universe these days and uh and taylor and and johann there's uh the very simple answer of that which is metamask is a wallet but that just loses so much nuance along the way so johan i'm wondering if you could add color to the very difficult design decisions that wallet creators and wallet providers must make can you talk about a little bit about uh metamask like design philosophy and why it's so complicated to making a good wallet yeah so maybe to add a modifier to start so i'm the product lead for metamask institutional and so a lot of things we think about is like how do we bridge institutions into d5 and web 3. um but i can definitely speak to you to your question so um obviously we have um you know the birth of the new internet a paradigm shift taking place in front of our very eyes and with that we have um innovation cycles that is absolutely second to none and i think that you know as product builds in the space and as wallet buildings in this space and taylor and i had a long conversation about this a couple weeks ago you know we have to think very deeply about how can we abstract that complexity you know as most of us know there are very sort of active degens in this space there's a lot of complexity around kind of yield farming crosslay ones and layer twos understanding smart contract risks and so i think a lot of the things we think very deeply about is how can we reduce that complexity how can we build great product experiences and then very importantly how can we bridge you know our friends and our family into web3 and so with that you know i think our role is is that abstraction layer and i and that is obviously a very complex thing and very complex form to solve yeah almost certainly there's this inherent neutrality about these blockchains that wallets uh talk to uh like you know bitcoin is supposed to be this neutral platform and so is ethereum um and uh something out of metamask that i've really appreciated is this uh lack of opinion or lack of like political choice about how a wallet should be designed can you talk about uh that and the importance of this ethos when it comes to designing our wallets taylor i think i'll throw that one back to you um yeah i mean i think that like in the world of uh this web three world where like so much is about like partnerships and announcements and and hype and and generating like attention um i think that one reason that metamask has sort of um gained a foothold in the way that it has is that it's it's shoved all of that away um and i think it's it's massively important because um it allows us to really focus on the end user and it allows us to make the choices that are best for them and not to sort of compromise um between you know all of the other desires and and and needs and financial obligations that that people have in this ecosystem because at the end of the day like um the wallet is really that that final that final uh barrier or that final access point so it can let you through it can let you in it can act as a gatekeeper if it chooses to um it can protect you right or it could not um all of those sorts of concepts and i think that by by really really just having this culture within metamask of remaining neutral and remaining focused on on what we're here for and just providing the most objective access that we can um yeah i think that that we've made a lot of really good choices it does make the ux a little bit a little bit hairy at points but i think we'll get there as we all know coming into 2021 and beyond we've onboarded so many different users in the crypto space a lot of newer nft users uh and somehow nft users have gotten the branding of giving up their private keys or falling victim to scams just because they came into the crypto eco ecosystem so rapidly with like so much acceleration that they haven't learned the best practices or haven't learned how scam ridden riddled this this ecosystem is and so i think if um the the simple take the the unnuanced take for people coming into the spaces why won't my wallet protect me from all the scams why won't it why won't it identify every stolen nft why won't it do all of these things that help me uh be protected taylor can you talk about some of the um second order effects of again political and opinionated choices about wallet design and and how it uh impacts decentralization along the line yeah so if we make a choice to say protect quote-unquote protect one of your transactions from going to a quote-unquote known scammer it does open up this door to censor your transactions to anyone right i think that's the most simple way to put it and it's um it's it's a bit difficult with like the words that we're using right because like what's the difference between protecting and censoring um and and really it's about like the end user and what their desires are right and whether it's something being forced on them or something that they want to will like willingly give over that responsibility to to their provider um and so i think that like again i think that by starting at the most neutral part and then um and not baking that functionality into the core wallet i think that's really really important um and the next layer that we're building right now is what we're calling metamask snaps and it's in beta um there's like a developer build called metamask flask that you can install that is sort of this secondary layer to the wallet where people can then choose hey you know what i do want some of my transactions to be censored or i want to be protected right and we can let uh anyone and everyone sort of build these these these specific sort of tools or the specific functionality that works and then the users can opt in to that experience and i think that's really important and it allows the wallet to remain um yeah it allows the wallet to to to do what it's meant to do at the very core and not get into the politics not get into um making decisions on behalf of the user right we're just trying to provide this informed consent we're not trying to force people down um any one road and we're especially trying not to open ourselves up to like any uh you know legal obligation to protect them uh taylor i've always thought like the the mental model for metamask is kind of like uh almost like a browser right so people in the early early internet or like you know they needed a browser they needed a netscape in order to navigate all of these things and the same way you need a metamask to navigate all of the the assets and identity and all of the cool web 3 things you can do and so when you were talking about metamask snaps that reminded me a little bit of like browser extensions is that like a useful analogy where like you know if i'm using google chrome i like right now i have tons of different extensions that are super useful for me for like you know bookmarking things and password management and all of all and metamask is an extension as well um what are snaps like extensions is that a good analog yeah i mean that's it's a little bit different just because of sort of how it's the technically how it's uh operating together but yeah i think that like you know just like extensions uh extend the functionality of your browser um it's that's what the snaps are gonna do right they're gonna extend the functionality of your um of your metamask wallet of your access to web3 of your you know all these different things that are going on so uh curious about the um we've already named a few of them right i think johan was talking earlier about like d gens uh we were also talking about like nft communities and then of course there's like seasons crypto natives uh that are in the industry using metamask maybe with uh in conjunction with a ledger wallet or something like this and then there's a whole flock of like noobs to crypto people who are brand new to the crypto space um how do you guys segment the metamask users themselves and how do you appeal to all of them at once because those are vastly different user needs i would say you know somebody who's in the nft community and new to crypto versus a you know seasoned crypto veteran who is maybe using this johan on the institutional side to try to move like millions of dollars a day um johanna how do you segment these internally within within metamask and these different users and how do you appeal to all of them at once yeah that's a great question so um let me start on the institutional slide and then i'll work my way to the consumer side i think that you're actually seeing an adoption cycle within web 3 and that adoption cycle is driven by the djinns um i thank god for that and so these are pioneers um obviously we very much have seen crypto being adopted by consumers and then following that we're seeing our crypto native institutions so these could be your crypto funds your dials participating obviously very actively in this ecosystem and then following that you have the typical adoption cycle where you have your early majority your late majority uh your laggards etc and this is normally correlated in the institutional world with the related oversight that institutions might face and so you know typically your kryptonites are going to be first followed by your hedge funds your family officers your exchanges your brokers your traditional financial players etc and you know we we really are sort of part of this train and seeing it happen in front of our eyes um and how we think about in terms of product is that i think it's very important to you know build for your thousand tree fans um i think we all fundamentally believe that this ecosystem is is going to be the thing not the thing on the side it's gonna be thing that we all live in and participate in and so you know we're definitely seeing that crossing of the chasm within the institution world but in order to cross the chasm you have to like be deeply obsessed about your thousand true fans and i know the metamask team think very deeply about how do they cater to the users that they work with on a daily basis within metamask institutional the exact same thing you know so we think very deeply about how can we be the very best wallet for institutions four dowels and therefore build a series of features around that to cater to their needs and so i again i think it always starts with you know those those early adopters the folks that can't live without you and then you expand from there why did you guys decide to split your your product into like these two segments there's sort of the you know the normal metamask and then metamask institutional yeah great question so uh we realized sort of the almost sort of the middle of the d5 summer and obviously metamask being very much at the center and the same with consensus that institutions were for the first time showing up in a meaningful way i know both of you talk a lot about this in the podcast you know there's always been this narrative of the institutions are coming the institutions are coming and the d5 summer really proved that this time was different and what we saw was kind of a fundamental pain point around how key management needs to be done so this is the storing of keys the signing of transactions and the mental model to have here is that for example if you're in the u.s and you have more than 150 million dollars in aum and you are regulated by a citizen regulator you have to work with a qualified custodian and so the aim of metamask institutional is to think about okay how can we bridge every single organization on planet earth into web3 how can we provide the key management solutions that they might need in order to do so and so we take a very agnostic approach the same way so the philosophy around metamask and so today we work with different custodians custody tech providers non-conservative solutions like nursesafe to think about how can we solve the needs for organizations and accessing web3 i'm wondering guys uh what's it like to work with institutions uh what are their specific needs that other user bases don't uh don't necessarily need and also just how many institutions are you guys working with can you guys like measure measure the magnitude of this for us it's by the way the visual i'm getting it's it's uh it's a great feeling to think about these massive hedge funds like working with a metamask in the same way that we are it's just like it's so cool that we're at that point yeah and crypto native rights like like dao's i think you know it's uh we're definitely seeing sort of uh you know the birth of new organizations using mmi which is deeply exciting you know the the kryptonite uh dejan crypto funds using mmi but then also very importantly which is an insanely exciting trend a lot of organizations that are allocated to nfts over the last three to six months and so we're really sorry to see again like this crossing of the chasm um yeah so they're kind of two questions though there were reference there um in terms of like what are we seeing from institutions and how we're working with them again like it started with a thousand true fans and so it turns out that when you create a metamask wallet connected to a custodian you have crypto funds all over the world wanting to work with you instantly and so very much kind of our thousand true fans are these crypto funds but we've definitely seen an evolution over the last you know i'd say nine months or so in terms of larger or traditional organizations also using mmi and so a lot of the things we think very deeply about in the product is like okay how do we build the products the services to cater to their needs and so this resolves around things like detailed transaction reporting you know making sure they have a portfolio dashboard so they can monitor their risk hedge their risk manage their risk report on their risk and then also importantly you know help them with risk assessment within d5 pools and so these are some of the things we think very deeply about and that normally maps to the typical transaction flow process for an organization so how are they thinking about accessing d5 what research they might need to do you know what compliance requirements or risk might they have how they're executing the trade with the wallets or accessing a d5 pool how are they monitoring that position reporting upon it and then lastly obviously custody sounds like a lot of moving pieces johan is it annoying to work with institutions are they like really picky he's not going to say yes he's on the institutional side david no i think it's um you know i was in a pound this morning and i was sort of explaining to the world of tradifying like you know like this is such a deeply relevant ecosystem and like it's such an insanely exciting time to be part of institutional crypto because for these reasons like i said earlier you know for years there's been this narrative around the institutions coming into the space and i think this time is is truly different and you know it's sort of like build the infrastructure that allows more institutions to bridge into web3 i think is insanely exciting and obviously you know working with metamask and like the metamask wallet within mmi you know in a shout-out and a hat tip to the metamask team the focus is very much like how can we provide the broadest access and the most in-depth access to web3 amazing amazing and so it seems to be that metamask just has like a bunch of things going on under the hood the the metamask snaps is actually the first time i've heard about this and of course uh the institutional side of metamask is something i wouldn't be privy to not being an institution so can you guys just illuminate perhaps like the next three to six months of what you guys are working on and and either under the hood or what is perhaps publicly going to be announced in that time frame taylor can i throw that one to you sure you can throw it to me um i mean we just we have so much going on it is absolutely insane and i think that uh part of it is like trying to play catch up with this with this uh very prolonged bull market that we've been experiencing right like we went from um i mean it's been i guess a couple years now but like from 1 million users to like 35 million users in under two years is absolutely insane so a lot of our focus right now is on sort of um improving the the user safety features of the security features um the the sort of overall user experience and giving people information and education about this new world that we're playing in um obviously cross networks right l2s have come to being like in a very big way um and and yeah and i think further uh further figuring out how to best serve each of these different user types is something that's very top of mind um and one thing that johan and i were talking about a couple weeks ago is like um users actually like evolve through the the sort of the the crypto seasons i would say right like you have like people call me like an og now because i'm on like my third summer um i think like anyone who makes it is still around after their sort of like makes it through the first winter i would call them an og um but at this point like real wealth is being created right like people have gone from being um you know maybe like a kid in college with literally like you know just student debt and that's it um to having having a fantastic amount of sort of digital wealth right like that's not sort of necessarily recorded on paper how do we how do we capture that how do we um how do we help them level up uh their sort of um their thinking about this right because in the traditional world if you were to suddenly have um a million dollars 10 million 100 million dollars worth of of uh various assets in your bank account you would have a number of people a huge number of people probably pinging you right you'd have financial advisors you'd have your bank you'd have all these people being like uh like yeah like uh have you considered certificates of deposit that's like there's just so many things right but in the in in this world uh and we see it every single day on twitter right we have people that are losing a million dollars two million dollars to fishing like basic phishing scams um because they yeah because they didn't realize that their uh their secret recovery phrase is a secret don't give it to anyone um and that's i consider that a failing on our part i consider failing on on the ecosystems part you know there's a lot of reasons for it but at the end of the day like this is happening and it's very real and so one of the things i'm thinking about is like how do we get people to uh yeah to realize that like when you have multiple millions of dollars in your metamouse that like there's there's bigger and um there's a variety of solutions out there to serve you and like the single secret recovery phrase like these words that you wrote down on scrap of paper somewhere maybe or took a screenshot of like that's not necessarily the way and i think we're really good about like hardware wallets and stuff but uh mmi is super focused on like even the next level up right is is uh multi-sigs right like your basic like true nose and safe multisigs um but also yeah like um you know the mpc stuff is really really exciting and also gives you a lot of um advantages if you're doing a lot of transactions whereas you know gnosis safe is is really good for treasuries uh johan do you want to talk more about this you know this so much better than i do yeah so it's fascinating how sort of um you know different ways of transacting with individuals as well as institutions tend to gravitate towards different types of key management solutions so obviously npc and i know um both of you had a few npc providers on podcast previously have been super popular with crypto funds because they allow for fast signing for cost effective signing and then what you tend to have is your contract wallets you know the likes of nursing safe obviously being just an insanely invaluable product for for dials and managing the treasuries and so you're trying to see sort of a gravitation towards key management depending on the type of user and again it comes back to our approach of you know being very agnostic and making sure we have you know all sorts of key management solutions so we can cater to different individuals different organizations um and make sure that again to taylor's point um you know we can help them in in sort of this moment signing process and protecting their assets okay guys we are just a few weeks away from permissionless so i i want to pick your guys's brains as to what you guys really look for when you go to conferences and specifically what you're looking for at the permissionless conference what's metamask goals at permissionless are you guys hiring certain kind of talent are you looking to make certain bd relationships what are you guys looking to get done at permissionless oh gosh i mean we are definitely hiring we are hiring all of the roles uh lots of tech talent we're looking for um what i personally like try to get out of out of conferences is really um i think there's almost like two worlds and uh and coven made this kind of hard to navigate but like there's like the real world like the builders like the people who are actually in the space creating amazing stuff and they're not necessarily the ones that are really good at talking on twitter about all their cool stuff and i feel like the conferences do a great job at sort of like leveling and like um uh just just like giving me confidence in like you know who's actually building who's creating value um who's real and then who's just really good at crypto twitter and and taylor as an og in the space if you don't mind me giving you that label i'm sure you've been to a number of conferences in the past i think i've seen you at a few of them just what advice do you have for newcomers into this space uh that have yet to go to conferences and are just kind of unfamiliar with what to expect what would you what advice would you give them oh goodness i would say don't make any um like any solid plans like i i absolutely hate it when they when they like schedule my conference and i have to like meet with all these different people um i think that those those sort of uh random encounters or the random talks that you weren't planning on going to and then you showed up at those can be some of the most valuable um and i think that the the most important thing is to just talk to people right like just go out and talk to people uh meet people share uh share your voice listen to other people's voices and really just like soak it all in like the vibe of conferences is is the best part of them for sure so just enjoy it and definitely adding on my own take to that just talk to people uh conversation please refrain from pitching someone at least 30 seconds or more into into the conversation sorry but don't yeah no we all understand uh johanna i think there's gonna be probably a lot of institutions that are also first-timers coming into these crypto conferences uh are you were you familiar with conferences that are not crypto conferences that are like institutional heavy and how would you uh what advice would you have for institutions or representatives of institutions who are coming to permissionless uh well i think crypto conferences are probably one of some of the most unique gatherings in the world today um you know they are a very kind of special week where to taylor's point you're seeing sort of a ton of innovation and creativity and the ecosystem is just so friendly that it's just such a neat kind of you know then to be part of most crypto conferences and they are quite juxtaposed compared to to other conferences and gatherings i would say um the thing i tend to get 99 of time of conversations is win token number one and uh and also like i have this bug on my metabolism taking a look there's a lot of customer support um but you know so that aside um you know um i think that permission is definitely going to be attracting a ton of uh crypto native institutions i know there's going to be tons of dials uh you know uh during the week and so no doubt a lot of conversation will probably sort of coalesce around that um i'd say that you know the d5 djs the crypto funds have been you know so part of cryptoconferences for a very long time and so i think a lot of our clients will be there as well so um yeah i think that generally speaking i'm expecting tons of organizations of all stripes to be there specifically institutions or organizations thinking very deeply about nfts this is great guys so i i'm taking notes because i haven't been to a crypto conference since like consensus in 2018. so it's been a long time i've been held up in this office here and david's david journeys to like just about all of them i feel like uh but uh getting some good advice here so don't plan too much it's the serendipitous meetings that are the most beneficial have lots of conversations it sounds like uh no unsolicited pitches and definitely ask jonah about all the metamask bugs you can create a lot of them kidding guys of course don't do that um do people still do business cards is that still a thing poe apps poe you met me yeah no business cards either all right cool well it's been really useful guys thank you so much for uh for joining us and uh we'll see you at permissionless taylor i think you were giving a keynote there as well you getting prepped for that yeah she did so prepared excited to see what you come up with anyway guys this has been the road to permissionless we've been speaking with metamask and we hope to see you at
