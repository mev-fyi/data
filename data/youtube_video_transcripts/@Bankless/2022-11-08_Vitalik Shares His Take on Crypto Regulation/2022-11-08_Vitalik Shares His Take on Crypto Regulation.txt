vitalik had some takes about regulatory too yeah this is metallic kind of response to this conversation about like regulation and he goes should I publicly blab my opinions about crypto regulation more feels unfair to let other people get attacked by cryptotater but never actually poke out my head everyone obviously wants fatalities we do want that he goes another maybe controversial take of mine is I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional Capital at full speed ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention that's interesting what do you think about that uh I think it's a fair take there's trade-offs the kyc on D5 front ends idea does not seem very pointful to me it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the kyc that's already happening that is a great take that's a sensible that's a great very practical and pregnant right these are great takes and vitalikus always is reasoned and measured and I would like to hear him publicly blab on his opinions about crypto regulation more so I'm glad I'll take any public metallic labs
