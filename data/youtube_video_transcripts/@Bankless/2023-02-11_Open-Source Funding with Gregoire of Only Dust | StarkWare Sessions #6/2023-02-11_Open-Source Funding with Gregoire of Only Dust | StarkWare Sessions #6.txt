welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this interview we are talking to Gregoire from only dust now only dust is an application on starknet to help developers start building in starkware using starknet it's like a developer bounty board a kiosk There's jobs for you to go do and this is perhaps an entry point for getting started in building in the world of starknet there is money associated with this so if you are a developer looking to make money while also growing your knowledge base about starknet this episode is for you so let's go ahead and get right into it but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible cracking has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as bankless's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out arbitrum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps stats can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 feeds by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite DPI apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every layer too and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like Arboretum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon transom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview bang the station we are back in Tel Aviv for the stock wear sessions and today we're talking with Gregor of uh what's your project called only dust only dust how did you come up with only dust I think to create Stars you need only this okay so it's like all developer for Community are just little just dust between them we got great Styles we got great new ecosystem on just wonderful on you it's a little joke because it's like a nerdy you know it's over those and uh in French is it's a private joke for French but yes okay so what does only dust do only does it's a peer-to-peer a ground platform so we have the money of the foundation with the not only dust on all developer can grant each other so it's not like a committee a borrowing committee with some paperwork it's a developer with like okay I like your job I want to Grant you some old developers are granting each other and it's very very effective and it it has a very strong Network effects because developer their friends and it's working very well and it's all transparent so we have no fraud on the platform it's just completely amazing completely Community driving so this is perhaps a little bit like git coin in the sense that it's a grants platform but it's different from Bitcoin in that projects on Stark net are giving grants to other projects on starknet yeah exactly and and the same repository on GitHub a project can give Grant to other contributors and a lead can for example if a developers see an amazing opportunity with a good developer it can grant another developer and with developer can grant developer on his repository so it just contributed granting contributors yes so if a developer is interested by starknet but they don't know where to go perhaps this is a place to get started is that is it fair I think it's the best place and we are working right now we will work with the term Foundation under a lot of overall blockchain are coming to us because we have a very very strong growth and it's working very well so I think when we are talking with foundation and a lot of foundation were like we don't want to have a ground program because it's not effective it's not cost efficient and when we see all results on our community I like I want to do this I need this and for example it's a bit strong because I was in a meeting with a big foundation and we're like so we have a business model we take we have a tech rate on all Grant and we're like you are not you need to increase your price I like what the like I have a 50 uh take rate like no 20 on 25 minimum so yes it's amazing to see this kind of product Market thing because ground program has a long history of failure according to me and we are Reinventing this with the community for the open source so it's very cool okay uh where does the money come from for the grants the foundation of companies for example stagnet Foundation is the biggest Grant right now and we're we are very happy to work with them advisable a company like cartridge so I think your advantage of remember like okay we can give you some money because we we want to support this kind of open source project uh for example Theodore is another sponsor of this event we're like okay we will give you um 100 or 200k for this kind of project so we have private companion we have big foundation okay so is this a way for this isn't really this is not specif specific to this darknet Foundation right no so you you guys are your own independent company yes that's meant to facilitate grants inside of the starknet ecosystem yes it's the open source ecosystem so right now if it's open source it can be funded advisable the stagnet foundation right now with us is funded non-stock net project because we pick it interested for the public goods so it's the new way to fund biblicals we think but a lot of the money for Grants does come from the Stark net yes right no it's okay yes okay and so it's a way to distribute value from this darknet Foundation to the rest of this organic ecosystem yeah totally yes and the scale is very very well and so uh teams inside of the starknet ecosystem can get bootstrapped because they're getting financial resources from this darknet Foundation but it's getting allocated by only dust yes is it not by unless it's with only this platform right yes yes but by developer yes right exactly okay so say I'm Argent how would I how would I use only dust and what would I use it they come to us and say okay for this type of project for this type of feature it's open source we want to have contributors and we're like okay let's go we push the project on our platform we have a lot of contributors like I want to work on this project we present we introduce them to Urgent they begin to work on GitHub and at the end of the of the week the lead of urgent we said Okay I want to pay this contributor this kind of uh one one grand or two two one thousand dollars this one 200 this one exact and all week is doing that and at the end of the budget of the Urgent there is some developers saying okay what we are doing with urgent and over contributor on this repository it's so cool we want that they are they they need to have more money so they click on the button on our products and they have more money and more money and more money um if it's not cool if it's not useful and if other contributor I think that it's not very well executed for example they have no more money so it's very you know it's very violent because sometimes the project just ends because there is not not enough quality not enough value for the ecosystem and so how do how do teams like Argent or other like projects that are building on starknet how do they get money from the foundation do they have to apply for a grant from the foundation no they they can sometimes directly with the foundation but when we talk with us we just have to talk with overall developer so they don't talk to the foundation so we have some for example or quadratic they are building on stock Nets and they didn't talk to a member of the foundation they are just working with developer of the community so for the foundation is very cool because they don't have to talk to every company and if they want to have a specific interaction with the company they'd contact them but normally they don't have to talk to the foundation but okay but the developers don't have to talk to the foundation but someone talks to the foundation that's just you because yes we have a we have an annual contract with the foundation and we have a dashboard with all the results all the developer all the contributors with all the channel developer with it's like the developer reports you see but it was a stagnet ecosystem and it's actualized day to day it's day to day and um they receive his data and they're like okay we like what we see so we'll give you more money and more money and more money so right now we have a contract for 2023 and we will negotiate a contract for 2024 and so we are negotiating for the world ecosystem with the foundation so this is like um uh only does it's like a kiosk of jobs for the starknet ecosystem yeah and like as a developer you can go to this kiosk and like oh that job looks cool this project is cool I want to work on this product it's not job it's not going to it's project so you apply to a project you go in the telegram group you talk with over developer you ship some uh it's project Centric we have tried the Bunty Centric approach it was devastating it was because yes Bunty I think don't work right okay amazing uh so I'm a developer I'm interested in getting started where do I go we go to your website you see all the projects you can contact directly the developer in charge of the grant of the project you talk with them you're going with Instagram group you work and yeah and at the end of the week you are paid how how much am I paid normally it's 500 a day it could be more if you're more expensive it could be less if you are a general developer and but it's uh it's your leads the lead project of the developer of the pencil project we will decide and uh what kind of jobs are available what kind of gigs okay uh right now we have a lot of for examples of smart contract developer in Johor we have a need for data scientists we need a rest developer a lot of first developer front so we need a lot of there's a lot of need right now we have 45 project open source projects and we are going very fast we have 300 developer and so if you come it's impossible to not find a good project and if you don't find a good project right now just contact us and I have a team dedicated to this which is to make the introduction awesome and what's the website uh only dust bikes why is it only does not XYZ yes awesome Gregory thank you thank you so much thank you very much
