the ethereum network is pretty resilient to things being imperfect right like it's designed to assume that things are not going well imagine a world where like proof of work is banned tomorrow or like all the miners disappear they attack the chain we could probably merge with the software that exists today and the network would be fine but the question is like then we need to spend all this time fixing all these edge cases issues on the network that's live in production with like hundreds of billions at stake and we'd rather avoid that and i guess the reason for that is just like if you take a bit of a like bigger view of like the entire ethereum road map we don't just want to ship the merge you know we have other things we want to ship after say we shipped the merge like in two weeks but then spent the next six months fixing a bunch of bugs that are like trickier to fix because they're already on mainnet and stuff like that it would just slow down everything else we have to ship after
