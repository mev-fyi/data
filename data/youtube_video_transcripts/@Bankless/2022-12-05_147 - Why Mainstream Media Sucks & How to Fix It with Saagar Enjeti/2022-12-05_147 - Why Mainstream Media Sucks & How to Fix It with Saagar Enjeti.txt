foreign welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we had soccer from breaking points podcast on the episode today we talk about why mainstream media sucks and how to fix it not just a problem but a solution the end of that problem a few takeaways for you today number one we talk about mainstream media why it's broken and the prescription of how to fix it number two we talk about advice Sagar has for crypto media how do we make sure we don't become them you know who I mean by them number three we talk politics because we had to saggers into politics uh and we asked them about the candidates his guess on the likely candidate for the 2024 U.S election and is all of this going to lead to Civil War there's a question on our minds number four what does Sagar think of the whole FTX thing he lost money in Block fi it turns out he watched the SPF plus Vorhees debate he's been in crypto since Balaji introduced him to crypto in 2017 but after this has he written it all off that was a question for him today and it was good to get sagar's perspective who is a talented I think content creator outside of crypto but share some of our core values David what your thoughts going into this episode yeah after just talking to Sagar I'm just so proud of him man he he and Crystal went up against uh like teeth and nails which is mainstream media he went up against the system the the composed network of incentives that keeps the Elites in power keeps the mainstream media companies in power keeps the Democrats and the Republicans in power and him and Crystal just said eff it you guys are just a bunch of acting charades and we need real media in a new real honest authentic media institution out there and so they made break points and I couldn't be more proud of of saga and Crystal even though I don't I just talked to Sagar for an hour and a half I haven't talked to Crystal at all but just like we need people like that in the world to make sure that we don't go backwards as a society so that's really just the impression I've been left with after this episode yeah it's definitely a kindred spirit and uh the work they're doing over there is pretty cool and we we felt some of the shared values in kinship with uh with bankless I think it's also good to get sort of somebody on the outside of the crypto bubble their perspective on this whole crazy space and uh so there's a lot of that conversation too of course premium subscribers make sure you stick around because David and I are about to have an epic debrief conversation about what we really think about

friction Free bankless Nation we are super excited to introduce you to Sagar and jaddy he is the co-host of a fantastic podcast I go to for all things politics it's called breaking points crystal ball is co-host this is kind of an anti-establishment political news sort of podcast I think there's some kindred spirit with what we're doing over here at bankless they launched in June 2001 breaking points right now has 850 000 subscribers let's just round that up to a million subscribers which is uh pretty hard to do I must say sauger welcome bankless hey thanks for having me guys I appreciate it hey we're excited to talk to you because there's a number of things we want to pick your brain about but like one thing that I think you have in common with probably people in crypto is um you guys see that some of the machines that run our society some of the institutions let's call them are kind of broken right now and so we want to talk about a few of those we want to talk about media that institution I want to talk about politics I want to talk about the economy um but before we get there David and I are about to get on a uh doing an interview with a politician senator Pat Toomey is coming on the podcast he's got like 30 minutes you know he's rescheduled a couple times but we're gonna do it um we don't talk to many politicians but I know you're in that world and you do what like what's your advice what should we uh what should we talk about uh yeah so number one don't let the handlers handle anything they're gonna try and say he's late they're gonna try and say he's got a hard cut off let the senator go when the senator needs to go uh that's number one so they always give you a short and a fake time frame and they always reschedule and they always want to try and keep you off again number two these people do this for a living they're filibuster so and they have scripts they're perfect they know how to launch exactly into them so they're better than podcasters they're they're good at this they they are the P they are the kings of saying nothing with as much time as possible uh the way that you get this job is by being an arch narcissist and also being boring and so this is uh this is their Turf so I would would really just try throw them off their game ask them something interesting try to get to the value almost as soon as possible I find it useful to let them get their script out within about five minutes and then start to dive in a little bit because they feel like they don't have to revert back to but he's going to come in he's going to come in with something to say then he's got a ninja rehearse thing right yeah I mean in my opinion they're not going to agree to do an interview with you unless they have something that they want to and we don't have to get into the circumstance I'm assuming it's like some legislation he's like the only he's the only crypto friendly Senator on the banking uh committee everyone else hates crypto right and uh you know this is like you know the FDX aftermath I'm sure you guys talked about a little bit um this is after that so I don't know what I mean I think he's he's like we're going to talk to him as if you know he is one of the few crypto friendly Senators who's come out and been like crypto is great and here's wise we want to talk about that but you might have some other ideas of why he's coming on yeah I would I would just try to drill down into I'm like what like why are you you know a fun question would be why are you here yeah why are you here do you want to start with that David yes super meta I'm always a fan of making it meta because it makes people uh step back on their heels so is there any uh is there any politician that doesn't fit that mold or are they all universally like this I think once you get elected before they get elected some of them can be fought um so and I know some people before they get elected and they'll talk a little bit more off the cuff but you know there's so many constituencies and internal so you know what we were talking you were referencing systems institutions like the risk is so high if you say the wrong thing you will just get killed here in Washington even if you say the truth so it can cause you some serious problems I would just in general like that's why I really despise and generally don't talk to a lot of politicians whenever they're asking to come on you know people will come a bit I want to talk about this one thing I'm like yeah but you don't get to decide and in general the way that it works is that cable news is very accommodating because they have very short periods of time where you can come on and Hawk your stupid bill or talk you get the attention that you deserve the system is really not designed to get into anything nitty gritty and unfortunately like really really talk to these people you're like you don't know anything like a long-form podcast yeah is it the time constraint that makes that meta reality I think that they love the time constraint uh the time constraint works on both ends right so cable by definition is short bursts in between advertising that's their true market they need to serve that they just their job is to fill time in between AD breaks politician's job is to say something as inoffensive as possible while also advancing X Y or Z agenda so it's really a match made in heaven like the format is born for each other the people who actually listen though and are like affected by this it's not really to their benefit at all so does this our format of media where uh we have like 90 minute long podcasts yeah uh and uh you know where we we don't have like this cable news how high production thing like is that is this format of media like this this has to be difficult for them this is like almost hostile territory for them you know what it is it's uncertainty they these most enemies people are old they're really old and they don't understand what's going on here most of their staff tells them to do it because they know it's cool like they know it's a thing but they then they don't really understand what it is they don't consume it and the real issue is that people in Washington they really don't consume especially our type of podcasts if you really ask people around here like what podcasts do you listen to it's either going to be pop culture or pod save America God forbid and so it's just it's it really is like unidirectional in terms of the media that they consume and are familiar with they think a five minute spot on Morning Joe is like you made it you know really oh yeah that's still it that's still Pinnacle yeah not like Joe Rogan or anything like that when I when I went on Rogan um afterwards I only had one person who worked on Capitol Hill who reached out who was like hey that was really interesting um when I used to do Fox News it was endless because like when you say Rogan is way more influential than like Morning Joe it's on who you know and and this is the most important thing like not really care about okay but they don't care about voters no they care about the system yeah they they care about talking to each other so everything has a function like everyone's always like why does how can X Y and Z paper still exist I'm like because the 500 people who read it are you know all work in the Pentagon and so like if you if you want to influence Ukraine policy are you better off on breaking points or are you better off on the New York Times editorial page obviously on the New York Times editorial page why because the secretary of defense will read it I could have a segment with let's say a million views or something like that a critiquing Ukraine nobody here is going to watch it so you know Average Joe might watch it but like what realistic power do they have over the state department and the defense department and unfortunately message to all of you who are listening you basically have zero I have zero so you have less than me is it literally just a delineation between just like the many and the elites as in like New York Times is like the elite uh the media institution that's read by Elise to talk about Elite things and then there's podcasts which is like you know the many is it is that the delineation here absolutely yes look at this podcast it has a huge audience it's very influential you know I was talking Ryan uh right before he came on I think it's actually crazy that you guys are not getting the due in kind of the SBF Tick Tock write-up a tick tock in journalism is like the step by step by step because it's very clear that it all really began in the Eric Vorhees SPF confrontation you saw that that happened of course I did um that happened on your show and I'm like okay that precipitated this precipitated this which precipitated the crash have you read a New York Times article that referenced it no but I'm aware of it because you know I exist online and I think it is uh actually a crimp it's criminal to not include that interview because it takes it back to like the Genesis of how it all started so it's complicated I mean what I really think about it is and you guys are familiar CNBC you know CNBC nobody watches CNBC but the 100 000 people who do they're all multi-millionaires Traders and billionaires so like if you do a one we call it a hit you know in cable news like you do a hit which is like an appearance on cable television one appearance on CNBC it can move markets it can set the you know the discourse on fire and that was tremendous effect on if Federal Reserve policy you know what some something that a lot of people don't take notice of was that story that Jerome Powell has a secret Twitter he has like a sleeper Twitter like an account yeah he's in a non-account oh God Jerome Powell is on econ Twitter so we have what 15 25 let's say 25 by people who are like really really big on econ Twitter those people have massive influence right on literally on the the thoughts of the Federal Reserve chairman so understanding like who the people in power and what they listen to and what they watch this is why I spend a lot of time critiquing the mainstream media even though on some metrics like we may be bigger than them is I understand where power actually lies I'm just like pitching in my brain power like posting memes he probably has let's be honest oh man that must be a crazy place to live if you're pal though um well yeah I mean we've had we've had a few conversation with politicians you know who's been okay though I think is um I think you guys have had him on Andrew Yang yeah I feel like he's in the lead of his own right yeah he does it's a little bit different than the sound butt you actually get to do what he thinks but okay let's talk about media for a minute I do want to come back to your thoughts on SBF because we're super curious to hear about we're trying to make the documentary at least anyway one of the documentaries apparently but but before we get there let's talk a little bit about um mainstream media as one of the the three heads of this Hydra that's kind of an institution that's failing but I think in order to talk about that story uh Folks at bankless should uh get a little familiar with what you guys are doing at breaking points because this sort of breaks the mold and is maybe part of the uh the antidote so could you tell us the the Genesis story of breaking points like yeah how did you get there and what is it yeah so what happened is that I guess we had to go farther back so it's about the careers of Crystal and I so Crystal you know ran for congress unsuccessfully but started doing some cable news got picked up by MSNBC had her own show with three other people which eventually got canceled in 2015. now the reason why that's important is that Crystal had a cable news background hated being on cable news was actively push out of MSNBC for being critical of Hillary Clinton and her corruption she was literally did a straight to camera monologue in 2014 saying Hillary please don't run um because of corruption and ties to the Clinton Foundation anyway we can go on to that and she was eventually called into the head of NBC news's office and they said that if you ever talk about Hillary again you have to clear it with the head of the network because the Clinton campaign called them and were like if you ever do anything like this again we'll cut your access off you know to Hillary and presumably the future president yeah this is real estate are you kidding no yeah this is all real it's totally real so that's on one end so Crystal was fired by MSNBC effectively because of that um second was like my career I was a White House correspondent you know I kind of like reached I'd like made it um and what I mean by that is like in town if you're a guy you can get called on by the president you I had four interviews with President Trump the Press team and I had a adversarial but good relationship as in they like trusted me like he's not one of these guys he's going to talk about Mueller I had my pick of jobs in terms of being another White House correspondent somewhere else I could have been like a regime player like for my whole life I would have been fine um but I hated it because I just I hated the job and I really hate why what sucked about it well I mean being the Press briefing room like you you you're amongst the top people in your field and so one of the best advice I ever got from someone was if you what you really need to do is check yourself in a career is look at somebody who's 10 years ahead of you and be like do I want that job and I was looking at Jim Acosta and all these other clowns in the briefing room just Clowning themselves for some extra minutes on cable TV and I was like this is fake I was like this can I curse here is that okay yes all right I was like this is all bullsh this is you know and so I'm like what about people who like actually want to know what's going on because I'm like this is all a play it's an internal result it's a massive charade it's a charade for every other which is what makes it worse right right it's like everyone is playing for their friends and for their own jobs like political theater it's theater at the worst level and I'm like but what about all these people you know I grew up I love the news I've always loved the news I'm politically active because I was against the Iraq War hated George W bush and I was like I want to understand like what is happening here like how can such a horrific event like the Iraq War happen and then the financial crisis I'm like I don't know what the is going on anymore I'm like what has happened you know it's like and so like I because I'm a millennial you know I'm 30 years old and I was like I have no trust in institutions and I'm looking around and I don't feel like anybody's really speaking as to like why Trump is even in the president in the first place it's the right wing media is kissing his ass I was getting a lot of um was getting a lot of appearances on Fox and I was like I just I hate this and what really broke me was I had to do this panel about nationalism in the United States there were three people on the panel and it lasted five minutes and I was like you know I have a lot to say about this I was like I've read a lot of books I've read I've thought really deeply about like the American character like who we are like why Trump is president what this unique moment and I got like maybe 35 40 seconds and at this whole time like I'm a podcast guy like since I'm like 22 years old like I've just been binging podcasts and so I know an alternative exists so that's the pretext then what happens is that Crystal was doing a show with another guy named Buck Sexton who's actually very successful right now but it was more traditional like left right the initial Inception was like cable news on television and they were onto something clearly as the success of our show shows but and it was at the hill the hill.com but he was leaving and him and I knew each other and he was like hey man why don't you come Sub in for me and I met Crystal and she just really clicked like we were really both interested in deeper problems going on in America and uh yeah look we paired up got very lucky started posting on YouTube and honestly like it really like I'm still shocked it was an overnight success like within three months we went from basically Zero YouTube subscribers on the hill to like a hundred thousand uh within six months it was like six seven hundred thousand something like that it just it went you know Sky High and then we went on Rogan uh so that was uh yeah 2019 uh like it was June of 2019 and by 2020 I think we had like six or seven hundred thousand in a year we went on Rogan and that put us up to like 1.3 million something like that amazing on the Hills YouTube channel but the problem was is we were still working for corporate media like a DC based institution and the fact is like we became too big like the ethos that we wanted to live by just were not ones that I like you have to censor yourself or couldn't say certain things so none of it is direct it's all a product of their business so I've told these two stories before but these are just the ones that involve me there's many more like this one was Maxine Waters who you're probably familiar with um so here's what I said on on the hill when I was there I was like Maxine Waters will be chairwoman of the financial services committee till the day she dies that's all I said because I said in reference to the seniority system and it was about why I think the seniority system is bad for committee chairmanships and why the Democrats should get away do away with that her press secretary called like my boss's boss at the hill and said that I was threatening Maxine waters's Life by saying that what yeah effectively threatened them and told them that if I did not apologize that they were going to pull out of an event with the hill now why does that matter the way that the hill and the Washington Post and all these people make their money is they do events with politicians which are sponsored by like Bank of America like some major bank right so this is like major catastrophe now I didn't apologize I said you I'm not going to apologize nice and uh an event it like was smoothed over like I would be lying if that was not up in my head every single time I talk about Maxine Waters and then another one happened with Tick Tock I was I did a whole thing about all these former US government officials based on publicly available data working for tick tock and I was like this is  you know these people are working for the cyber security head under Obama and now they're tick tock's head of trust and safety whatever um I was like this is ludicrous it's a mockery and again Tick Tock I call my bosses they said that I was doxing them that I was threatening them that I needed to apologize all this stuff and like you know the pressure gets turned up again I did the same thing I'm like I'm not I'm I was like again you like I I will say nothing um and it just it was getting tense it's a tense environment so that's why we decided to leave and we were like we can't stay true to ourselves and thanks to the internet I mean you know we the the core question was I was like are people here because of the hill or are they here because of Crystal and I and I'm like I think I know the answer to that and as time went on I was like it was clear like it's about us and look it doesn't hurt Rogan said that he would have us on and he would help us launch so it's like it's a pretty good guarantee of at least like moderate success out of the gate amazing that's a great story so one of the questions that we had was uh how did Breaking points have like hundreds of thousands of subscribers on day one and I think the the summary here that I'm hearing is that uh you cigar are a person who's intrinsically interested in politics and society and just the milieu of the state of culture and things and the current uh the current world the the world of politics is just not conducive to like true expression and like knowing that you've been a podcaster for like a decade now that means uh that you are a person who likes to express themselves I can speak from experience here uh and you need long format uh you need long formats and not to be have any top-down control as to what you say in order to fully Express Yourself uh and so you slowly just like exited from that the the it's like the being in the world of politics you need to fit inside of a certain mold in order to exist there for any certain like a long amount of time and you were just like resistant to that mold like f your mold get get out of here me and this other person Crystal who I'm probably super resonant with are gonna F off and do our own media institution one that promotes raw authenticity and unfiltered thoughts that are like interesting and true about the world and like it just makes me like uh just reminds me of just like so much of the demand there was for like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders who I think are two very authentic people whether you disagree with them or not but the reason why they had so much support was because of their raw authenticity and like why why did Breaking points have so much uh success in day one is like everyone is tired of the goddamn charade in politics and we just want some real humans to have long form elaborate thoughts into our ears uh and so we can actually move forward as a society that's like my summary for for why this why breaking points did so well thank you man it's very kind uh I think you're right and you know it there are a lot of costs like when you are here right as in you don't get invited to this stuff anymore like if you're if you want to be a company man you're going to have a job your whole life like if you want to be a traditional right-wing commentator or left-wing commentator you will never be unemployed it's impossible like you will get these fake fellowships and you get to invite to these fake parties you know and these Galas and do black tie and all this stuff and every you know inevitably every single one of those invites uh dries up and that's part of the problem is that it's it's a self-reinforcing system they employ each other they're friends with each other and to say even one dissident thing has great social cost to you and uh that's one of those things you have to be willing to just let go of it you just have to say I don't care anymore I I I just one of those one of those areas where you can't care and you have you you really have to accept like you're just not gonna have friends because so much of the system is built on teams and when you're independent by definition like you're not playing for a team you have to say what you actually think it feels like 1984 where like you have to always have your guns out being prepared for the next person who's gonna ask you and turn you in for saying the wrong thing yeah that's a good point you know I really face this during the Trump thing uh during stop this deal I got so much pressure from the right to validate this and I was like I was like guys I was like this is like we're just outside where I come from like are you talking about when you're at the hill or no no this was this is like friends like people who are in the right wing kind of commentator system they were like I thought you were one of us like he's a  now you know blah blah I'm like yeah I'm not a I'm a cuck because I think the election wasn't stolen it's like maybe you are like it's like you know like maybe you're the and you're the guy you're the guy who literally is taking their cues from Trump and it's so so afraid of pissing off your cultivated like right wing only audience that you're not willing to say what you actually think like put two drinks in any one of these guys and like they all know it's and I was and you know we're lucky because we have right left audience so I was like look if you really don't want to listen to me because I'm not going to validate this I'm like off I'm like you know what okay so two things I want to you know test you about this is just like you know Creator to Creator kind of inappropriate like that's what we're doing at bank list but it's like okay so there's one one question line of question I have which is like how do you deal with all of that just um backlash like how do you deal with all of the Just on Twitter like how do you deal with all of the um negativity and hate that same surface and honestly it doesn't really matter what you do soccer like you're gonna get it I mean we get it thankless um and people blame us for things we think are unfair you know like you you want to be as a Creator open to the the feedback from your community so you can't completely shut it out and yet if you like let your mind be completely open to that it can really taint how you see yourself in the world by them you can get captured by that too so that is a different form of pressure it's not the you know your boss at the cable news company saying hey you can't say this and this because Hillary Clinton called but it is like I don't know the social media pressures like so that's my first question it's like how do you uh how do you deal in that world because I'm having trouble I consider myself lucky from coming from the realm of politics is it's a blood sport like so for me it's like this is the game like I I signed up for it I knew what I was getting into yeah exactly like by Def what is the one thing they always say never to talk about religion and politics right and so I did that from the beginning like for me it was built in that no matter what you say half people are going to be extremely pissed off at at it and that has just been the case for me like from the beginning that said I mean look you're right the advice I would give is to try well so Rogue there's a lot a lot of different schools of thought Rogan is of the thought don't even read the good stuff because the good stuff uh is just as poisonous to you as the bad and by that right because to just look you guys have a successful podcast and you have an audience like of what the real question you need to ask is like of what utility am I getting out of this especially relative to the type of content that I'm producing I would like to split the difference and I'm lucky actually because we have paying subscribers and so those are the people that I actually pay attention to way more so than the Casual so one guy drops in for one YouTube video like look no offense I appreciate the view but if you leave a negative comment like I don't care but if you're one of our 10 a month like paying subscribers and you have like a long critique of something that you used to like and that you haven't seen in a while and would like to see more because you want the show to succeed yeah I'll read that I I would consider that um and also if you tell me something that you really really liked about the show X Y and Z I'll be like oh that's that's useful and you can try and aggregate it it might you know what my real advice is try and meet people in person as much as possible because that's what David said the yeah the online stuff is all I cannot tell you how much I have learned from meeting my fans in person like walking down the street and somebody says hey you know I'll tell you about rising and breaking points something I didn't even realize production value so many people have told me in person not on uh not on never in the comments I love your show because I feel like I can send it to my dad and it's not a guy in the basement who is our articulating my thoughts so it's like somebody that my parents might feel like they could respect um and will understand but understand my politics like the frustration that I feel with the system the fact that you guys are trained you know from the mainstream media perspective you know you're educated use diction prop you know like speak well all the little things which shouldn't matter but obviously matter I'm you know here you know it's crypto so I'm wearing my hoodie but uh like when I do my show I wear a suit like I wear a full suit I'm very proud of the way that I dress because I think that it conveys that I'm taking this job very seriously like I'm taking it it's a serious Endeavor of which I prepare a lot for in order to convey this message in a format that they appreciate but more importantly they feel appreciated to to share and I was actually really validated you know today that you the day that you and I are filming the Spotify rap thing just came out and uh we it turns out we were one of the top like in the top what one percent globally of shared podcasts so people really felt like like to share I mean that's the ultimate validation of your content right to not only consume but to say you have to listen to this so that's something that I take really seriously and again I really only learned it from meeting people in person so I would encourage you guys to do like Live Events not even online I'm talking in person like face to face that is that is the key well David David is a conference King he's been into like like 15 and I haven't bet like Live Events is sort of interesting I okay so like um thank you for that Sagar I think that's really good advice and uh I I do think that um crypto can be every bit as blood sporty as uh as politics uh these things because we have tokens involved yeah we have tokens and we have like scammers and we have real well yeah um okay and then it also Blends religion as well like some of these you know crypto communities are like quasi-religious all right the other piece I was curious about because when we were talking about like the problems with mainstream media uh and you're sort of describing some like personal experience I want to see if we can extrapolate that but it just it feels like um if I were to sum that up in one word it would be capture yeah captured like mainstream media institutional media seems like it's captured I mean if Hillary Clinton could call somebody from their staff and just get them to not say a certain thing that that is um capture and so it's great that you and Crystal are able to escape that I think like look um Financial media is also captured big hedge funds CNBC who do you think watches those shows right uh CNBC finest same thing Banks that's why they don't talk about crypto they don't give it good coverage it's not that that's why banklist has found its Niche but I guess the question for you is like how do you and Crystal prevent getting captured yourselves great question all right because like you were talking about business model piece here but like that could still come in I mean you could still it like we know how this works in order to get the person an interview you might have to say some things for instance right so there's there's guest capture there's also like if you if you have any sponsorship Revenue I mean there's sponsorship capturing do they have an info do they have anything to do with what you say you can also get the same hair so talks about this captured by your community too oh yeah so sometimes that can be like you can't say anything you've built this community that believes one thing and then Saga comes out and he's he's like saying something contrary to the faith and then like the faithful are like wait you can't say that I'm quitting like no more subscription for me so what what are your thoughts on on this uh topic of capture it's a great question and actually that's another thing I'm so proud of is that we thought about this from top to about before before it was launched like we conceived of it specifically to not fall into this so for example you talked about sponsorships we don't do any host red ads all the ads on our podcast are uh dynamically inserted by megaphone so it's basically like a YouTube ad but in podcast form do we make one tenth the amount of money correct uh is it worth it to not have somebody call me and say I didn't like what you said about Balenciaga yeah it is um and that's also why we are able to pitch to say hey ten dollars a month like pay for the premium subscription on that front this is another benefit of doing a genuine right left show is part of the part of what you're signing up for is by definition to hear something that you don't necessarily agree with half of the time when crystal is speaking or when I'm speaking so we've kind of cultivated an environment and an audience itself which doesn't cancel because of something that you say about you know one-off look some people have um you know in the past I remember during Afghanistan a lot of people wanted us to criticize Biden and I was like no I was like I support this policy and we we can get into that if you want and I was like I was like I'm sorry I was like I've been waiting my whole life to get out of Afghanistan and I was like I've never seen a war end in a good way and while yeah I think it's shameful like certain things weren't tactically done I was like it's better than the alternative which is spending 300 million dollars a year for nothing to get guys get blown up in IEDs and just stay there for the next 15 years for a fake cause and a fake military and a fake government and that was very controversial that was you were really weren't going to hear that and a lot of people were pissed off and the same thing it was built in from the ground up of if a certain segment cancels so be it and also we have three-legged stool of Revenue we got podcast Revenue YouTube revenue and premium Revenue all three of which kind of reinforce each other so I thought about it from the business perspective but it's also baked in kind of like I said ideologically of look uh you're not always going to agree that's fine um the whole core tenant of the show is You can disagree and you can also still arrive at some very basic starting points and conclusions which are good for you and they'll make you a happier person so how when you talk to Crystal and you're you're on the show do you ever get like meta about this as in like the construction of the business and the business model because like right now like uh bankless we have like a lot of the similar business models Revenue sources that you do uh sponsor Revenue which is synonymous with podcasts and the YouTube they're the same sponsors right we also have like our Inner Circle uh where you can get like the ad free uh premium feed and you get to be in the Inner Circle and that's when you were talking about like uh receiving advice from people that you know are paying you ten dollars a month or whatever uh then like we kind of have that same thing do you ever like talk about the philosophy of your own business while on breaking points do you ever like get meta about it yeah it actually just happened uh one of our shows was blocked manually by FIFA we've been doing a lot of criticism of FIFA and the Qatari government and this is just amazing to me they pulled off our video uh which was about the Iranian team refusing to sing the national anthem which was an act of great courage and they manually hit us with copyright to block our entire video and is this on YouTube yeah yeah it was on YouTube and and not only that they actually we have an unlisted feed that goes to our premium Subs a video link they've blocked that too which is kind of amazing and I can I mean look it's a blatant violation of the fair use Doctrine which if you know for a basic explanation is that you are allowed to use copyrighted material as long as it is not the core tenant of your video it has news value and you're using it to talk and convey about something else within two minutes of content wait it was 10 seconds clearly clearly within the bounds of fair use and it was you know it was abused by FIFA because they don't want people to talk about that probably covering for the Iranian regime and anyway we did a whole segment about that and we were explaining to the audience we're like look this is why we built our business this way I mean I tell people that all the time I'm like our videos get demonetized we know we're getting screwed with algorithmically uh for things that we're talking about and this this isn't even a censorship argument YouTube is a business the economy is in the right now they have ad cpms they have to hit so how do you do that you recommend Anodyne content about giving fifteen thousand dollars away to a homeless guy and then you serve a ton of ads on top of that like you don't serve videos about Russia and Putin and nuclear war or a deep dive into I don't know like Chinese protests because that's controversial and this is a fight that I've had with them so many times even in person I've told YouTube this in person I'm like look you guys claim you want to be a place for news sometimes the news is bad sometimes the news is really bad it's sad people get raped people get killed children you know exploited like but we are in a society like you have to talk about that and so for us like our business is built such that we can talk about that even when we know that we're gonna take a hit like there's one version of breaking points which is only YouTube ad supported that's a nightmare I know what that looks like that's just chasing clicks chasing clout stupid ass reaction videos and then there's the version that we have right now you know sometimes we'll do like 25 30 minute deep dives into Russian nuclear Doctrine you just can't do that anywhere else and that's what I love about it yeah I I love it too and I honestly I think this form of media is going to eat something like kind of I mean people see sort of the corruption they see the capture they're not stupid they're they know they come for the they sign up for the in-depth conversation let me ask you so you are our creature like us of social media and like digital media right and um that's kind of a double-edged sword right so like I get I guess a few a few thoughts to prompt this conversation because I want to get your perspective on like you know social media good or bad immediate good or bad one thing that's cool about um like podcast and YouTube is like podcasts we have an RSS feed we control that RSS feed it's ours it's like a a nice protocol that we can use to distribute and we decentralize technology decentralized technology right and so like we can put it out on Spotify we're not dependent on Spotify and put it out on Apple we're not dependent on them if you don't like those products if they somehow delisted us they go spin up another podcast player and you can get our podcast YouTube is not like that right like there's no RSS feed for YouTube we're kind of again we've been the platform before um I think like 24 hours or something they just pulled all of our crypto content yeah and you know the CEO of YouTube reached out they apologize that sort of thing but it's like an algo flagged us and they talking about crypto no good so and so we have that piece of it right it's not as decentralized as we'd like it to be of course and then the the other piece we have is um social media can be a place where I mean David and I met on social media right like we get so much information I get so much enrichment from like sources like Twitter for example I do think it's the base layer like you're talking about Powell he logs in he gets like that's how he decides when to move the rates this is a wealth of information since the bottom of society but it's also this place of uh outrage it's also this like all of this um it's hard to verify things this kind of disinformation that that goes on as well and so people have different answers to that of like what censor it let's not censor it what's your what's your take on social media in general is it good is it bad how have you leveraged it what have you learned about it and where do you think it should go so I have a complicated relationship like you guys you think I'd be sitting here if it wasn't for social media in 1990 I'm chasing a Fox News show which I'm lucky to get in you know at 56 years old it's the best thing that ever happened to me um yeah look I'm just gonna look at the good I think that like you said Ryan you and I connected because of social media that's how I know what you guys are when the SPF thing happens what do I do I look into the deep dive I read a good profile I go back and I watch you know Eric Voorhees interview with you guys we're on the confrontation I go you know I can look at 12 15 different sources all at once I can see Aggregate and awesome Twitter threads and yeah look I mean I think it's just incumbent upon us um as people and look I think it is what you it is what you make of it and you can control your user experience if you want to I think the biggest problem is self-control and you know maybe that's uh maybe that's a little bit too individualistic but some of the best health and fitness content that you can consume is on Instagram and also some of the worst in health and fitness content you can consume is on Instagram uh some of the best financial advice you will ever learn is on Twitter and some of the worst same with news same uh you know and with every category so it's really incumbent upon people to use these things in a way that benefit them and for me I have connected and met so many people on social media that I never would have met otherwise I've learned so much random information and expanded my perspectives and and uh just went deep and and met even met people you know in real life that I've literally only have connected with on Twitter so I look I think it's a net positive I think it's a net good uh does that do I does that mean that there aren't existential threats around missing you know the policies of misinformation all that yeah absolutely that's why I'm a big believer in just regulating social media quote unquote with the base layer of First Amendment if it's consistent we have 200 years of case law with the First Amendment here in the United States if it's consistent with the First Amendment it's not illegal let fly algorithmically everything is it is it fun all the time no um but guess what like living in a society is not fun all the time either the brave wallet is your secure

you've been listening to bank lists you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves and fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web free world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the evm with its own fuel VM which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers and lastly fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain-specific language Sway and a supportive tool chain called fork with fuel you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like solidity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the evm if you want to learn more there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel Network so on this censorship debate like yeah Twitter censorship debate must taking over like do you have a do you have a side do you pick a side or what would you say I see this is another thing look I love Elon like if from a just like a vibe's perspective like if look anybody who's ever been in a Tesla you'll you'll think differently that I actually think that that is an important fact is like a lot of people don't actually understand how revolutionary the car itself is like you basically turned a piece of mechanical Hardware into a software which is stunning I mean getting into a Tesla is like the first time you saw an iPhone 4. totally remember that yeah you know the silver iPhone and you're like holy this is a phone that's what it's like getting into one it's insane but so I respect him from a baseline entrepreneurial level that said I think he's made he's making some mistakes I think Twitter blue is a huge mistake um and the reason why is I think what we were talking about Jerome Powell all of that veracity of high level uh high like of elite information is probably the core value of Twitter everything I've read says that Twitter ads are and they're actually not particularly good Roi part of why the company never had major Revenue like meta or like Google so I'm a fan of charging like it's creating some sort of Twitter for Enterprise product basically tiered pricing based upon the number of followers that you have and then the number of tweets that you may want to send out paired especially with like a customer service function you know I've I've thought about that a lot like if you ever have a problem with a company what's the best way to get in touch with them you tweet at him and then American Airlines or whatever tweets back to you why why do they get to do that for free like that's a great that's a best real-time customer service software ever existed it's like you should charge them for it and then build build them like a CRM customer relations thing on the back end that they can use and they can pay a shitload of money for that and probably would but put that aside that's the first or good original take on Twitter that I've heard in a long time thanks man yeah I I I've really thought uh about that one because but the reason why I care is I want them to have recurring Enterprise level Revenue so that they are not impacted by the advertisers because Elon is really flailing around right now he's got a couple of you know the content moderation Council I thought was a disaster uh that's exactly what Zuck did over at Facebook we all know that it was a total and then every time when Zuck actually asked them about the whole Trump getting D platform thing they the Supreme oversight board was like no you decide it's your company so I'm like look like this is all a farce second he said uh freedom of speech is not freedom of reach that we will uh downrank quote hateful or harmful tweets who decides you know and and look and I don't want Elon decide I don't want anyone to decide that's why I said things should be consistent with the First Amendment because then you get algorithmic treatment of everything consistent with as long as it's not illegal as long as it's not doxing it's a free-for-all so on those couple of fronts like I'm not a huge fan of Twitter blue just because I don't think it will actually enhance the Twitter experience as evidenced by a lot of the fake accounts that happened I want him to set up proper recurring Revenue at an Enterprise level that doesn't impact the veracity of information and two I do not think algorithmic different algorithmic treatment of tweets is a good idea because fundamentally I don't trust human judgment as to what is harmful what is misinformation what is not uh what is true information oh that was another one the community notes function I'm totally against it I'm totally against any um fact check ability to dispute or anything arrangement of facts as I know and as you guys know from doing editorial stuff is by definition a fact checkable like you can always say you left this out you didn't put in enough Nuance like let everything float if people want to correct it with replies or quote tweets or whatever they can I'm really just saying just like let the free market take it yes I mean I it's worked for 200 years it's been a good system I think that like go ahead Ryan crypto people listening would have a lot of resonance in in terms of what you're saying because what you're doing is you're going back to like um base principles and core protocols like we very much think of like the Constitution as a core protocol that governs Society now that was written in you know penmanship and and you know uh analog documents but we also have protocols that um guide the internet right we're just talking about RSS well that's a self-sovereign protocol isn't it like we could take our RSS feed and go wherever we want we don't have to distribute on Spotify or apple we can distribute wherever um I think the problem with the internet right now is we have built so much in kind of the outside of the open internet and in kind of the Apple application layer this is very much where we see like crypto like playing a role so like part of our solution to to that was like yes to the First Amendment right would be a crypto take but then it's also yes to credibly neutral protocols that don't get to decide right so like Twitter could just be a protocol just like email TCP right you could have clients and it doesn't judge at the the base level what the text actually is there's no human decision makers involved there's no kind of like uh governance committee that's saying this is bad and this is good and this is information this is not but you can layer applications on top of that and people get to choose their own experience we've gotten away from that with the App Store and with the Twitter and with Facebook and that sort of thing and that's why we we see part of crypto as like restoring some of those values in small ways of like back to the open internet as it was originally envisioned but it's very much base protocols type of thinking I think everyone gets caught up in this um well if our guy gets control of Twitter it's all going to be great and the other side's going no if our person is in charge of Twitter it's going to be great and it's like an endless fight and we're not solving things at the protocol layer I don't know if you see that too but that's what we see I absolutely see it and actually my great fear is that they're coming after email coming after Google Docs uh my my biggest fear is ISP level blocks which I do think is coming we are one step away We Are One Crazy Event away from an ISP like remember the Parlor parlor thing that was a big event and look I'm not saying I like parlor like I'm not saying I even like what was going on on parlor but the App Store level Amazon AWS type D platforming all asynchronous or all synchronous despite the fact they're all different companies I think that set the stage for one day it's only one we're only one Crazy Event like Jan 6 9 11 or BLM protest away depending on who's in charge from some craziness like this comes through the fed or is this private companies doing this hang on can we just take a moment and actually uh provide some clarity for people who don't know about what the Parlor event is and yeah this is as a result of uh parlor was like where a bunch of the alt-right went to with this new app Twitter like it was a Twitter competitor yeah Twitter competitor right and uh a lot of the uh alt-right January 6 instruction movement coordination occurred there it's like when Donald Trump got de-platform the alt-right decided that mainstream social media platforms were not welcoming to them so they went to this place called parlor uh and then there what you're saying is there was this uh coordinated effort to D platform parlor the platform from the App Store from just wherever you can access it and what you're saying is that that was just like too close to the metal of like base layer internet uh protocol level censorship well I don't know if you guys saw this but uh after Jan this this was what scared the out of me because I saw when that happened the floodgates were open the sensors in Washington at the governmental level were loading a Department of Homeland Security Patriot Act 2.0 to go after Jan Sixers and you know under the guys you're like what was happening well there was a New York Times piece I think written by Kevin Roos which set up the war on signal on the signal protocol and they were like hey some Jan six you know alt-right figures signaled each other so we need to go after you know end-to-end encryption that's the end game and it's like the end game is going after the protocol itself and so like as you said like I am a major believer in the base layers and establishing them keeping them neutral keeping them out of the hands of the feds even with the private companies making it sure that they know it's like you cannot with this because when you do it opens up it is the gates of hell like and look at China right now the protests I mean I don't think people understand they can track you when you're wearing a face mask and sunglasses in the in the night time I don't want to live we hard resonate with the points that you're making like it is just like and these attacks it's almost exactly what we say when we talk about preserving the credible neutrality of the ethereum protocol these are the same words yes it's cryptography right and the the nightmare scenario is like uh a state level ban on encryption technology right and so but like and to be clear these attacks can come from the right or the left anyone anyone exactly look uh what the Trump Administration took extraordinary actions through the Department of Justice to pursue uh emails of journalists and uh subpoenas and that's you know that's another black box that all three of us we have no idea like the feds can access your information with basically nothing and then on top of that you know look the point is they can they can't go read the wired article that recently came out about the Google Dragnet over January 6. they used subpoenaed location data from thousands of people based on cell tower pings to find out exactly who was at a protest and geolocate them and then use that in court on top of using cell tower data to even pull the call logs of members of Congress and Senators who are inside the building on that event is all of us an apology for January 6 no but do I think that we should give up like our location data on our cell phones and normalize like at T just willingly giving this stuff away just because the feds are doing an investigation like absolutely not like we have to put the soccer so so um like 18t does that in with the fed and then uh disconnects your bank account boom basically right but you know that's it's funny the uh what happened the remember the Canada protest that was the biggest story in the country but for Ukraine they actually got kind of screwed because Russia invented Ukraine and they like felt wiped off uh in terms of in terms of attention but yeah I mean they were deleting your bank account they're ceasing crypto I mean what did you guys think of that in terms of uh from a crypto level how do we get around that we had how do we get around that this is this is why bankless honestly Saga this is why this is why um trustless peer-to-peer money systems and this is our great fears all of those things you mentioned these are um hazards these are um externalities of entering the digital world that that societies are creating which is all of these digital fingerprints that are uh improv uh like that can be tracked and can be captured and so like one of the things we see is like cash is going away very obviously I don't know I don't use cash it's so inconvenient when I'm talking about cash I'm talking about like actual Green in the US anyway bills in your wallet like nobody does this anymore and what was Cash though well that was like peer-to-peer it was Private the government couldn't get involved and it was a bearer instrument so I could give it to you and you'd have it peer-to-peer transaction in digital world we lose that but we're not replacing that with anything in the traditional banking system um US dollars in your Wells Fargo account very confiscatable is not peer-to-peer like and so what crypto does is it preserves sort of access to Value transmission networks um for people in case maybe their nation state goes wrong and it provide provides a banking layer to that too um so Ryan do you remember when we were talking about the truckers who are getting debanked yes uh we we talked about this on like our our weekly roll-up show our new show where we cover the week in the events we talked about this and and we were like this is bad this is why we go bankless blah blah blah what's interesting from this from the media perspective we were talking about audience capture is like a decent number of our listeners came to us on Twitter and we're like well have you guys seen some of the the that the truckers in Canada yes yeah yeah and and like well to some degree like no I hadn't heard of every single thing that the truckers were doing but like we got blowback from our own Community it's like well I mean like we all want to go bankless but you guys they were yeah they're like are you on the side of The Trackers and we're like no we're on the side of Base principles all right like when did we just when seizing money is okay I just went through this with the whole Andrew Tate thing I don't know if you guys know yeah so and I was like look I'm not saying I like Andrew Tate but when you have a guy declared bad and then he's on person from the internet in 48 hours that's pretty scary and everyone was like whoa you're saying Andrew Tate is okay no that's not what I'm saying no I'm saying how do you know how do you know who's next who who who decides I know who decides it's Taylor Lorenz it's Brandy whatever her name is over at NBC News Ben Collins um these like misinformation experts Oliver Darcy they can they can end you overnight like do you want to live in that world I don't want to live in that world and I yeah I don't know why it is so difficult and I empathize with that because every time because what they do is of course the point is it's always going to be an edge case guys precedents are set in the edge cases and then they creep in first it was Islamic terrorism that's that's the funny thing everybody was cool when it was just Islamic terrorists but you know what it's funny my my career early career was writing about terrorism and I remember I'll vividly remember this you know I I was a typical I didn't really think about it I was like yeah these guys I hope they get arrested I was reading a uh I was reading an affidavit by an FBI agent about a guy you wouldn't even know his name some 19 year old who got arrested for trying to join Isis FBI agent goes on Twitter sees one guy who tweeted something crazy makes contact now after making contact they chat for 12 hours a day for like nine months and then the FBI agent is like hey you should go to Syria and fight for Isis and the guy's like okay buys a ticket to Syria that's still not enough and he's like all right I'll meet you at the airport at the gate he shows up at the gate and they arrest him for material support to terrorism that's 25 years in prison I mean we're getting real close to entrapment there it's like because it's that question of well would he have bought that ticket to Syria if you never asked him I mean it's up in the air right and there's a by the way there are a lot of cases like this there was this guy named The Herald Square bomber if you look into it they basically told him to do it they set the whole thing up they were like go buy it from this guy the bomb materials all of this and you know now it's it's a question of like you know we had the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping case like he had 14 people involved 12 of FBI informants it's like how many there's more feds involved in this case than there are actually okay terrorism though yeah I know it's like I I do want to uh we even talk about a lot about like censorship in the way that it relates to media and I do want to act to zoom back out a little bit to dive down into a slightly different uh Rabbit Hole one of the ethos uh sagars about crypto is that we have this like Blank Slate to do everything again from scratch right like we can rebuild this system and hopefully not f it up this time uh because our current systems are like largely captured corrupted and broken um and so one of the new pillars out of this new industry that we call crypto is of course the New Media New Media institutions uh there's plenty of media institutions inside of crypto uh we have like the journalists and the News desks like coindesk and the block uh we have like smaller more uh Indie reporting entities like the defiant and and bankless uh but since we have this blank new slate of media institutions do you have any advice for us now that we have this new slate to not f it up uh like what what do you what lessons you have from breaking points that we should apply in this crypto industry to make sure that this whole system can perpetuate into the future without corruption start with the first principles start with building it so that you can't go awry in the way that they did and the way that everything went awry for them ultimately came down to centralization back in the I actually encourage you guys to read about the history of cable news it's fascinating there's a great biography and history of Ted Turner of CNN what it was originally conceived of how everybody thought cable was so stupid 24-hour coverage ultimately it led to the partisan Wars driven by a variety of things from ratings to budgets from the rise of MSNBC eventually to Roger rails creating Fox News and basically creating in 1996 the media environment that we all recognize today which was set on fire by the Monica Lewinsky scandal it's actually relatively recent the world that we're all living in right now it's a hopeful story because you can read that and say oh here's the exact time when everything went wrong it was Lewinsky when everybody came obsessed with that and then it was 911 a uniparty move of using this new material this new form of communication to convince the American people to go to war under uh false pretenses and from that period everything stems all of our politics today so now we're living in this reimagining in the internet and I still think we're very much in the infancy of the internet something AGM Antonio Garcia Martinez likes to talk about is look like the internet is like the printing press you know it was chaos when the printing press was invented there was a 30 Years War you know the internet has barely been around like the printing press revolutions and the restrooms yeah the Reformation like Protestant kings and queens dot you know the Revolutions of 1700 of then the the Glorious Revolution like so many things happened as a result of the printing press we are in our printing press moment so many things can happen so to use that analogy from a media perspective think about the incentives that were bad in finance for financial media in particular I think where it all went wrong was access so what I'm reading right now is a history uh is a biography of Warren Buffett from it's called snowball it's written in 2009 I highly recommend it the reason why is Buffett's life effectively tra and his wealth effectively tracks the U.S financial sophistication from the day he began investing in like 1930s all the the way up until he becomes the multi-billionaire or one of the richest men on the planet that it is today a lot of it was through centralization through access through manipulation and so what I would encourage you guys to do is think about how you can continue to grow and kind of stay true to an audience not just an audience to stay true to yourselves information while growing your audience without having to succumb to the inevitable inevitability when you do surpass them because you also have to plan for an environment in which you are the new mainstream nobody at CNN and all of them ever predicted they would be where they are today and but there was a big mistake by doing so so you kind of have to imagine and think about what it looks like whenever you are a big player because that is when a lot you know it's easy for me to say like all the things I'm saying what is it when it's gonna be harder when let's say breaking points you know 10 years from now the president of the United States calls me and says I don't agree with what you said no matter who you are I can tell you I've been on the side of that phone whenever people very very powerful people talk to you it's scary it's scary it gets in your head and people over time it eroded they gave into that so you have to plan and think about for uh that time if should it inevitably come and then you got to put the work in that's that's the one thing we've tried to maximize for on the um I guess the sort of the freedom side and the autonomy side is never to be beholden to anyone and so like so never take Venture Capital right right because absolutely you don't have to you could bootstrap this thing I mean we have the distribution technology now with the internet look at us and like yeah look at us and like people look at us look at us and like um I mean then that gives you another Master to serve somebody who wants their their 510x right you go public you have another set of shareholders um we don't want that I mean we want the content creators even myself to be like the people making the calls and then another aspect of that is like um we do have some sponsorship uh Revenue but like we have to be willing to fire any sponsor we have at any point in time and so we can't have mouths to feed on our team that would cause us to have to make some kind of Compromise type decision of what so we don't want to grow too big do you know like we want to have enough margin and what how we're building you want to scale sustainably feel sustainable and said that you always we always have the the ability The Leverage to be like this doesn't fit with our brand anymore you did this see you later and we're not afraid to tell you that like you know your product was  we thought it was good with like we have to have that ability to fire um our spots so that's another piece that um I guess we got to maximize and but do you think it's inevitable that New Media just like like eats old Media or do you think these like I don't know cable news msnbcs are like because I could tell you people in my age group I mean I don't like consume any of that all my media is internet media basically it's podcasts it's like sources that I trust like I don't trust what's happening on Fox news or CNN so like I don't I don't tune in there my what I have done many monologues on is we're in the phase where they're waking up so now they know so previously it was you don't exist so if you ask people in Washington before they'd be like oh he's wasting his time with YouTube you know whatever that's how they love to denigrate you YouTube as if YouTube isn't the most powerful it's way more powerful than uh cable news now it's oh he's an he's been saying this stuff on his show so now they're at a point they they get it they know it exists but next is the war and the war is where the danger comes because that is when they start to pressure exactly what I was talking about the isps they start to pressure YouTube they start to try and strike preferential Deals they use their legacy brand and influence influence to effectively guarantee them uh place at the table that they don't deserve so I don't think it's inevitable I think it will be a massive it's a fight you know another way that they might fight the war is um I'd be like oh breaking points okay I'm CNN this is a real thing now like how about an acquisition yeah I better you I but but again like how many people are gonna say you some people listen I mean I've I've been there when a certain ball shaving company offered us a lot of money to read an ad and I was like no yeah no yeah like it's just it's one of those things where uh but it's a surreal moment and you know you have to you have to be you have to think and you have to have that wherewithal to say like look there's something much bigger at stake here than like the check that you're offering me so it's one of those things where unfortunately like we're gonna have to pass on this for a lot of people though that's a difficult decision to your make you're right I think that but honestly I don't think they will come to that because by definition for all of us to succeed we have had to do things which are just not capable of operating in that environment like I could not get hired by CNN I have insulted and gone after almost every single major anchor on that Network like it's not possible for me to be congruent with their brand almost same with box same with the MSNBC so when I don't think banks would hire me or Ryan either right exactly like you guys are done and that's a good one no that's but could you ever work for someone again sauger I'm probably not no I don't okay okay so um we've got a few more things we want to cover with you yeah I I'm almost tempted like because there's a few things we want to ask is like just to Blitz this next uh this next section be my guest can we just hit politics really quick Another Broken institution and I'm gonna ask the real because this is not a politics show so but I want to ask the real maybe the dumb questions that are on top of the mind for for me anyway when I look at um politics okay so um the first is what about 2024 who's going to be running who's going to win is this a Biden versus Trump thing again like do we have to do that again really most likely yes my God I don't see I don't see a current uh way out of that predicament there are problems yes I believe I believe like status quo right now Donald Trump and Joe Biden will be the nominees of their major parties and I'll be headed up against you wow several things could happen what are the odds that if Joe Biden is elected that he dies in four years actuary tables I was gonna say take a look at an Actuarial Table my friend not good for him um uh look I there are separate there are a couple of ways out of this one is either a man dies possible they're both eight they're both like uh Biden just turned 80. I think believe Trump is 78 so that's very possible distinct second Trump is indicted and convicted indictment does not preclude conviction so that's possible conviction could be one way to take him all out although it's not without precedent that you can run for president from prison so that could set up an interesting um what that would be interesting a socialist candidate did it in like 1920 something I forget I forget his name but it is a great question they have to come to you yeah like I don't know I don't know what that would look like so that's that's one you know he could get invited he could get convicted uh the third and least likely possibility in my opinion is that he's defeated in a GOP Primary um by another candidate and I don't see a viable path for any candidate currently that the prospective candidate not even to Santa's Florida okay no I don't think so um I mean I could go I could give you a long spiel I I've done it many times but the most basic is this which is that if you look at preference for the DeSantis hype the truth is is that it's almost all college educated GOP voters who prefer him in an actual head-to-head matchup with Trump trump in terms of the base has a deeply special relationship he's the most popular Republican in the party since Ronald Reagan and his his level of support and enthusiasm specifically amongst the primary base is so intense second in any world where DeSantis were to run against Trump there would be several other candidates so for example Mike Pence is thinking about running right now Nikki Haley Mike Pompeo um several Senators uh Assa Hutchinson who's the governor of Arkansas so by definition the anti-trump vote will then get diluted so the only way that it might work if it was in a head-to-head matchup but even in head to head I don't personally I could be totally wrong all right I've been wrong okay all right so yeah how about this then because this stuff tells the next question if that's the lineup probability of a civil war all right of like some actual conflict right like I'm I'm like it was a zero probability for me like five years ago it's no longer a zero probability event what what do you think about this is this a possibility I you know it's funny I think if TR if the GOP had done much better during the midterms I actually would have said yes uh not not because of not war but like violence and the reason why is that would have set us up for like genuine constitutional crises like if a uh Doug mastriano wins the gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania like he straight up said he wouldn't certify the election uh you know in 20 uh in 2020 and the governor of Pennsylvania selects the Secretary of State but in all of the major Battleground States not only to the state legislatures stay Democratic or go more democratic the Secretary of State candidates with the gubernatorial candidates in charge all won their races so that will set us up for a less high wire scenario that we've had in Georgia and Arizona last time around which set the stage for stop the steal and the lack of election certification at the uh at the Capitol level so I'm less worried about that Ryan than you are although look I mean anything happened I don't know yeah let's do a blitz through uh economic stuff too um it kind of feels like um the American dream is dead that old institution um so I I mean two two factors you know one is inflation the other is wealth inequality um let's talk inflation first uh who's to blame for inflation it's a multi-faceted question um if I well what type of inflation where that's uh thank you for asking that question yeah it's like the type of inflation that we talk about on Bank list is like people people mistake they think inflation is just CPI but there's also another piece of inflation which is asset price inflation which is like wealth inflation you have to take both those into account but few do when they talk about inflation but um yeah I guess maybe past the last let's call it 10 to 15 years and then now now kind of current in both forms asset price inflation and CPI inflation so acid inflation obviously has to do with Federal Reserve zero interest rate policy over the last like 15 years has just dramatically changed I think our entire Society is not grappled yet with what non-zero interest rate looks like that's why like we're all teetering on recession uh you know uh you see all these major companies Walmart and you know Google and all this other cutting or uh downsizing for the first time Amazon even downsizing slightly a lot of that has to do with debt on their balance sheet that has just been zero for a long time that they have to start paying down you know it's interesting actually it's having a big media plays discovery which is the new controller of CNN they've got 67 billion in debt that they have to deliver on um over the like a five to ten year period which is uh having them curtail jobs over at CNN actually today in terms of layoffs so asset price like I definitely think that's mostly Federal Reserve um the secondary part on CPI that's a much more multifaceted question that has to do with demand pandemic uh Supply chains if to be honest maybe this is unpopular with crypto guys I think a lot of it is supply chain right now um because it's a Confluence of demand both from government printing and spending and people cash in their pockets on top of unprecedented like unprecedented demand combined with a supply crunch historically you know both from the invasion of Ukraine and just general chaos shipping and all that uh post pandemic so it's it's a tough one there is no one size fits all answer to that question I'm glad to hear you say like Central Bank and the FED because I think the politicians don't often talk about that and I don't know why maybe it's just they don't get it do they understand they're just smarter than they than they talk I think no no all right yeah yeah some of them good to know every once in a while uh but I would say your replacement level member of Congress no all right well let's well that is it's a very Bleak uh image of our leadership yeah um let's talk crypto real quick so um sure can you give us the perspective first of all on Ft TX like we've been in the bubble you know you mentioned the the Voorhees and SPF yeah um debate which had a role to play in in some of this of course but um we're very conscious of cryptos looking real bad to Outsiders and it doesn't matter how much people like Bank list say but it was just another bank where we trust with our private keys this was not peer-to-peer this was not real crypto everyone outside's like yeah sure guys another scammer in crypto what else is new um how does this appear on the outside what's your impression of it what do you think that like the media's impression of this is yeah I'm not gonna lie to you it's not good people are not happy uh I just did a video about how I lost several thousand dollars on block fi uh so that happened to me I'm sorry sorry uh that's all right look it was greed here's the thing they're paying nine percent interest I should have known you know turns out FDI FDIC exists for a reason especially when I heard specs let's put that aside uh I think look it's bad but there's an opportunity FTX is not even a story about crypto to be honest like that that is a theranos level Enron tale of Corruption of fraud uh so there's so much to say and think about it there's the political angle in terms of of trying to buy influence and work with the SEC and to try and get regulated and and bring his quasi-regulatory framework through humongous amounts of political donations there's that level that's a story in its own there's the media level of and you know this is what I think the real blame is is that the media has not done a good job of explaining like what crypto is there's crypto like actual like peer-to-peer money there is crypto companies like the block fives the coinbases the Geminis of the world they call them crypto Banks crypto Banks good that's that's a good way of putting it yeah there's crypto like Banks then there are like the charlatan like the crypto influencers so you know for FTX to be branded the quote Crypt or SPF to be granted the quote crypto Emperor you know in the New York Times and clearly because he not only donated to their best ideology but like really believe or at least fronted that he believed in it I don't know it's it's a fascinating kind of tale that said I do think it's an opportunity you know from the Phoenix or From the Ashes rise of Phoenix so maybe it's a good opportunity especially if Gemini goes bust which I think is probably you could tell me it doesn't look good for them uh based on what I've seen right now I think it's an opportunity to get back to First principles so like for me I got into crypto well before any of the explosion of all this wealth I met biology srinivasan in like 2017 and yeah and so he was somebody who was explaining to me you know that from first principle yes from first principles and also this was in the age of Bitcoin maximalism uh talking about like Bitcoin as like uh Bitcoin and of crypto as an alternative to the social forces and you know the monetary forces that were pushing us in a more centralized that I really vibed with that and I have not something along the way changed to let's all just get  rich and I think this is a good good opportunity let's get back to that because that was cool man that that I was a big believer in that that's why I got into Bitcoin in the first place how much of the uh breaking points Community is like crypto people like how much of our community and your community overlap I don't know it's hard to say I probably have a much less online audience does that make sense they're more they're a lot more like not I don't mean it's in a derogatory way like they're normies like they're like living their lives I'm probably the only news they really consume they're aware of crypto they probably heard somebody talk about it in terms of like personal assets invested probably higher than the general population and it typical for a millennial or gen Z or Gen X type person who is willing to flirt with it but generally doesn't know a whole lot yeah that that makes sense I um Saga do you have any um advice in terms of um how crypto can kind of repair it sounds like you're you're saying go back to First principles right go back to maybe yeah the bankless thesis of like peer-to-peer money which is don't store your money in crypto Banks and um you know verify don't trust that sort of thing is it more than that can can we do a better job communicating our message I mean you said media isn't talking about this well and they're certainly not but like how do how do we do better on this front probably the toughest element is going to have to be and this is uncomfortable is calling people out when they're doing really really well I mean I think there was a big opportunity to call out SPF and some of these guys and just be like this guy's a dog and I know that's really uncomfortable like I I get it um when especially when they're on top anyone can say it now seven months ago kid's a multi-billionaire you know like who am I to say it but let me tell you there's currency in saying it there's currency in challenging it this currency and calling out the charlatans and there's currency in staying true to who you are and as we have all learned through this time period like for me the only guys in crypto that I'm still really like but like the people who I know who are into it well before anybody was getting rich well well before they're the guys that I'm sticking with you know because we've ridden out the wave and most of them were calling out the nfts and some of the other Insanity that was happening and they're still in the game and so like again it's it's it's an opportunity right now like it's it really is there's a lot of disaffection and that's okay I I couldn't agree more and it kind of goes back to that uh Voorhees episode really who is like standing for basically crypto protocols he's been in it since like 2013 right he's been here for the right reasons I know reading about him yeah very very different like the classics the class of Voorhees class of um Balaji the you know class of even vitalik so um Sagar this has been a pleasure man I feel like we could go on another hour um but uh you're just really fun to talk to and
