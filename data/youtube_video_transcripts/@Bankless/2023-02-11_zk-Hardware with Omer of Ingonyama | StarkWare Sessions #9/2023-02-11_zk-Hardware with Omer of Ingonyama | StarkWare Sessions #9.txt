welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference like last weekend where over a thousand developers Founders Builders and investors attended the starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing this darknet ecosystem this is bankless's darkwear session series which are nine bite-sized episodes interviewing the founders Builders and ecosystem developers of starknet every once in a while in the crypto World a conference happens but not everyone is available to attend don't worry Vanquis has your back because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto in this interview we are talking to igno Yama Omar from ignoyama ignoyama is an interesting product where most things that we talk about on Bankers are on chain we're actually talking about Hardware in this episode ZK proofs are computationally intensive and especially for CPUs so igne Obama is working on building chips which are just you know Asics uh first fgpas and then A6 later to help speed up the prover set of ZK proofs and so while ZK proofs are computationally intensive we still want the ability for anyone to run those proofs and so the Bold case for igniyama is to put a bunch of ZK prover chips in all the hardware and devices that we use in this world disclosure Ryan and I are actual investors in to ignoyama so we have exposure to what Omar is building here but the thesis is that self-sovereign ZK Technologies are going to be so proliferated and we need ZK provers to be equally as democratized and accessible so that individuals can confirm their own ZK proofs that the fact that DK Roll-Ups and other ZK technology are valid when we have chips that are specialized for this we can extend this out to more and more people so highly aligned with a bankless philosophy so that's why we are investors I hope you enjoyed this interview with Omer but first a moment to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible cracking has been around for almost as long as crypto itself as crazy as crypto is Kraken has remained a rock for its clients building out a platform designed to stand the test of time Kraken is all about proof not promises which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves A system that lets kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange and for this reason and many more we've chosen Kraken as banknus's strategic sponsor for 2023 and once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty Fiat money into pristine crypto assets perhaps you should check out Arboretum where so much of the frontier of crypto Innovation is taking place arbitrim just announced their stylist initiative which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like rust C C plus plus alongside regular old solidity evm apps feds can use any coding language they like and it simultaneously drops layer 2 fees by an order of magnitude it's a big deal so many of your favorite D5 apps have already deployed to arbitrum like uniswap but did you know that uniswap isn't just for erc20 tokens anymore uniswap is also an nft aggregator too to make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFC purchases uniswap gives nft collectors and Traders powerful tools all from the Cozy comfy uniswap interface by the way it's also got a native Fiat on-ramp it's also deployed on like every layer too and it's got this Nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades crypto protocols like arbitrum and uniswap are becoming super powerful so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out if you're looking to upgrade your wall experience check out Phantom the number one wall of Solana which has recently come to both ethereum and polygon Phantom has native nft support giving you your own nft gallery from inside the wallet Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and ethereum ecosystems check it out at phantom.app and now let's get into the interview Bank this nation once again we are here at the starkware sessions in television even I'm here with Omer of ingoyama and ingoyama is doing something quite interesting that you might not be familiar with uh Omar can you kind of walk us through why we need ingoyama so like every successful technology in history um we consider there are three pillars to this technology we have the software the algorithms and the hardware so zero knowledge which is um a core technology in our space it's basically um a Cornerstone for trustless computing which is uh what we need for decentralization it's such is just such a technology and we want to make it successful we want to make it mainstream we want to make it at the hands of everybody so out of these three pilers basically what we do is we are taking care of the hardware and so this is the hardware Less in uh Once Upon a Time the bank location will know I got into the world of ethereum through GPU mining is also the world of Asics proof of work how does and this is the same sort of subject matter but as it relates to zero knowledge computation how does this how is this world similar to the proof of work industry and how is it also different right so uh Dynamics uh can be very uh there are similarities but I think one step before we need to understand what exactly is uh the connection or what do we need the hardware for zero knowledge and specifically you know zero knowledge uh it's been around like decades in Academia and only recently over the last few years it's doing the transition into um into industry and we chose in the space with uh represented represented by many companies what we chose is to focus on very specific type of zero knowledge approvers uh you might have heard about snarks stocks and companies such as zero knowledge roll up site and basically they have some very interesting properties this type of zero knowledge systems one of them is that the proof is very small and the other thing is that it's publicly verifiable okay so before we even go into explaining what zero knowledge is and why do we need it uh just in terms of like the analogy here to proof of work what we see that there is kind of like a trade-off because we gain all of this like very nice properties but we need to pay somewhere and where we need to pay is by Computing this oof so it roughly takes seven orders of magnitude more than the computation itself to actually compute the proof once you have the proof you have a lot of power right but to get to this point you need to spend a lot of money and compute power this is where Hardware can um can make a big difference you know it's still going to be seven orders of magnitude more computation but uh the fact that you what you'll feel in terms of um uh the cost and uh and and the time that it takes you we aim to make it as uh as simple as possible obviously but also as close as it's possible to the user experience and developer experience that we have by just running the computation now what it means is that you know as I said trusted Computing is your knowledge can uh it can mean many things there are definitely few applications that we see today that are touching or try to replace exactly uh the old mechanism of proof of work by something that's based on zero knowledge there are huge advantages of doing so but this is far from being the only use case so I think that right now we're talking about level that is way uh lower somewhat lower than uh the actual proof of work uh type of uh or mining that we had in the space but it's definitely involved it has some kind of uh relationships for example you can build something similar to a proof of work mechanism based on zero knowledge of course with many benefits that I can go over so it's been part of the trajectory of much of ethereum to actually get rid of Hardware like we wanted a proof of State because we don't have we don't want to have proof of work miners but there's a dynamic here about zero knowledge computations which also is part of the broad ethereum road map where we want like CK Roll-Ups with zero knowledge proofs and other reasons to apply zero knowledge technology to what we're doing here which means that are we committing to some sort of Hardware layer to the ethereum Future because of just the the commitment to zero knowledge yeah so that that's a good question and I think that um to understand it or to answer it first I do need to explain why ZK zero knowledge is useful in the context of ethereum so let me just take two like big Ideas one is scaling the other is privacy now in scaling what zero knowledge basically is doing is kind of compressing right I mean just like trying to simplify it a bit we try to compress many uh transactions that uh we just don't have enough room to put them on chain so we put only the proof and it's verifiable computation everything should be fine in a way we are saving a lot of money by doing so right um the end goal is to have to have it in in a full decentralized manner right we don't want people to actually or to create this kind of um um market around or this kind of Dynamics where you actually need although it's open only for certain type of actors you want to enable anybody to obviously verify a proof this is like definitely uh super cheap and efficient as I said is the properties of these like snark stocks that we chose but you also want the proving uh and Computing the proof to be done basically by anyone on even commodity Hardware uh or close to it such as gpus so this is just when it comes to scaling I don't think that we are committing in a way to um to a future where we actually need to pay more or to um consume much more electricity I think it would save us much more than um uh then in terms of uh when you try to compare it to uh to what we know until now privacy this is this is you know this is like an application this is like another thing that we can gain that was not accessible to us before but obviously at scale privacy on chain privacy is a little too I think it's it's kind of an application that zero knowledge is bringing and of course you need to consider the cost of such an application uh personally I think it's it's a rightful cause and uh would pay for you know a future that is is really great and it was to kind of put some effort into it in terms of computation long-term thinking again this Hardware is going to be in your I don't know your iPhone so part of the chip would run ZK it would be seamless right uh it would be very efficient and so on so again I don't think it's going to go into committing to uh where we were going for where we were coming from and and uh you know ruining this proof of fork to proof of stake um transition so um the idea that that I have for you the future of ethereum and actually even baked into the ethereum road map is to ZK the whole entire blockchain but then there's like applications that can use EK tough and there's other layer twos that can use ZK stuff all of this all any time of zero knowledge is executed upon that's a computation that needs to be run where are we today like how is that computation being done today and with the future that you have in mind how will it be done in the future right um so yeah that's true ZK um is very powerful and it can find use cases in many places and obviously all of flare 2 zika Roll-Ups and I think also at some point um optimistics or optimistic collapse would um would start using this technology to some extent uh so we are talking if you try to sketch like a graph of the number of proofs per unit of time so what I think would say is that now it's growing and it's keep going uh which is which is very interesting and at some point you know it will consume kind of a lot of electricity as you said any application that is building been built on top of the roll up eventually would require to um verify it on chain and it means another proof that needs to run not only that you want you know for um uh you want to open to on the same proof more than once so that in case something happens to one of the pullover you have like a backup right um so it can it can scale definitely there are other type of um uh ideas that are counter to that scaling which uh for example uh kind of packing more than one proof uh together so because basically you are proving a computation you can also poof another another move right so you can just stack them up in some kind of a recursive Manner and this kind of saves you a lot of the trouble this is a lot of what we see today in Zeke Roll-Ups um how they move like Stockwell for example moved into uh using recaution which allows you not only to stack proofs one or to another and eventually end up just with one poof it also makes these poofs way smaller right because you can just like aggregate them together and so this is kind of counter Trend to the growing need in um improves all right what will happen is that with the introduction of Hardware getting these proofs gonna be the the the the threshold or the barrier to get this like very complex move and computation we just get lower and lower and usually just like with other inventions what it means is that there will be more and more use cases using these spoofs so I think that overall uh we just seeing increase in the number of proofs but definitely it would be uh contained it will be contained at the hardware level it will be contained in the algorithmic level in a way that will be manageable and for us as a community it will eventually be a net positive so to use a metaphor would you say it's fair to say that ingayama is trying to build the engines to run zero knowledge computation like you're building the combustion engine for zero knowledge uh yeah kind of I mean we are building computers like you know you can look at the uh traditional computer architecture and something is missing I mean something that like you know a financial arithmetic some discrete math like the stuff that are the fundamental in the computer uh architecture is is not really accelerated it's not used in in AI network storage acceleration but it is needed in cryptography even not just zero knowledge fullyomorphic encryption um and even you know lattices and such like basic the basics of post Quantum cryptography everything is built on the same math we are just trying to bring a modern type of computer architecture that will support natively this type of um computations so is the idea that uh what you just said that uh we have this new thing in this world called zero knowledge proofs they're computationally intensive um is a future state of the world one where there is a new component a new hardware component in perhaps every single device out there my phone my computer my laptop that is specialized to run a zero knowledge proof is that is that kind of the future that we're looking at yeah absolutely I mean and and we also can can tell you know it's going to start from more of the silver side like the data centers this is where it's easier to kind of take a whole new computer architecture and just like uh push it and then get some uh get some optimizations in in running ZK uh approvers but you know phones that are like very the phone Factor very small it's gonna be very hard but let's say the centralized identity all right this is something that we know um several like phone uh vendors manufacturers are looking very deeply into so this will require some of these functions like some because that are relevant to their border like the computation but they can also fit inside like chips that are being manufactured by others um also you know when it comes to privacy eventually you need it in your hand you need you need full control so that's definitely going to be like in every one of our hands in phones and so on yeah yeah so I know one of the big conversations that's going out here at the software sessions is um account abstraction and how account abstraction uses the secure Enclave of a phone to store data to unlock you know assurances about a private key and so there's already the conversation happening about how does our physical Hardware impact the technology that we have in the virtual space right like right even though we're all love to be in the metaverse the physical nature of our Hardware is still very very important and so maybe another to use another metaphor is like we have this secure Enclave to store private keys and that's a physical component of our devices that help us do our crypto things and then what you're perhaps envisioning is that there's also going to be another Edition National part of a hardware that is meant to do zero knowledge computation to allow for zero knowledge computation to be done by the individual on their device so is that all line up with you yeah I think I think it does uh like when I look at the future in a world where ZK is cheap I mean there's no reason why you cannot just verify any computation you do I mean the entire everything you are on the phone including communication with secure enclave and so on can be verifiable right you can also output the proof that the computation was done correctly it's even more important once you Outsource the computation to someone else I don't know to the cloud everything can be uh verifiable and it should right um so I think yeah I think we are talking about kind of a new modern type of architecture that will also include a component that is specialized for this type of cryptography yeah and and if we don't have this kind of research and this kind of like r d effort that you that you're you're doing then we probably ultimately Outsource that proof generation to a third party which is not exactly what we're going for in this world of self-sovereign like technology is that is that a fair assumption it is I mean there's an ongoing research on how you can actually separate the compute intensive part from the Privacy uh preserving part of the computation it's not easy there are a few ideas uh and it's you know right now it seems very far away so I think definitely uh a way to go is to try and get everything done on the hardware locally and it's a future it will take a lot of time but we'll gather meanwhile there are many use cases and applications that can still run uh only on data centers uh by Miners and you know some people and Cooperative access to this like um to this like specialized Hardware that's that's for sure but yeah we are going into the um this like future where there's uh Asics that are like different chips that can be used in any type of um Computing device and can bring you this uh technology to the level that again user experience it's going to be completely seamless you won't feel that you are Computing a proof so maybe uh we can really judge about how trustless and self-sovereign the world is with how many how far your chips have proliferated across the world I mean it's it's one way to look at it um again remember that right now even the the all-ups the zika Roll-Ups all of them are um more or less centralized sure um so they're still uh far away to go we still need to uh uh and you know we have a hardware place so we are long-term thinkers this is how we are building the company um yeah I mean at some point I do hope that many of us would have this uh freedom of just no verifiable and private type of computer privacy preserving computation very final computation it will take time until it will get basically to be democratized and be by the hands of anybody yeah so the topic of Hardware is not one that we've actually talked a lot about on Bank list and so this is probably striking the imaginations of uh a set of bank positioners that doesn't previously get a bunch of attention uh walk us through the road map for like how a chip actually gets produced and what what is the roadmap for for ignayama right um so first thing to understand about us is that we're not religious about child work meaning that you know uh there are a few types of specialized Hardware with differences I can name a few fpgas gpus um and and of course Asics like this like specialized chips for us it's about finding where is the pain and then solving it and when I say solve it is about uh catering for for the little guy again we want to make the user experience be seamless uh that's the goal that's the ideal and what it means is that uh right now in terms of roadmap we are doing a lot of r d internally uh to kind of build our um uh hardware and our IP to one everything what we want to do is basically run everything inside of this like specialized hardware and then we try to feed the right solution to to um to the right problem right so you can think about let's take stock right we are in in stock and let's take Stockwell for example so for Stockwell right now the prover is centralized uh it's one problem it's not the most important problem they have they have also a problem with witness generation with sequencer they pay much more on getting uh the transaction on chain for fees than they pay on running the pover so when I we're talking with stockware and we want to develop Hardware what we basically try to at this point is just to move the bottleneck from the poover to somewhere else in the system okay now at some point these other places in the system would also have this their bottleneck removed the only button that I predict will remain would be the hardware for Zeke approvers and maybe you know a bit beyond but um right now it's just about being efficient enough and cost effective enough to move this bottleneck someplace else in the system that's one example obviously we have projects where we want to optimize on the throughput right we want to run as many proofs at the same time and we'll ask and we don't really care about the cost let's say there are other projects where we care just about the form factor we have a project by the way for uh um for filecoin well it's mostly about just replacing gpus with fpgas that are tiny right it's like small it fits a data center so it really depends overall our vision is and I think this is the long-term solution we still have these dedicated ships and to go to this place we need a lot of uh we first need to come up with an architecture something very similar to a GPU if you try to think about it like many many calls that run in parallel but are suitable to the type of computation that you can see in zero knowledge and once we have this figure out remember that zika and this public question many ask is it's a it's a fast moving uh space right everything is kind of changing how do we de-risk it when we build something that is meant to last for um many years to come and one way that we try to do it is by basically building it in a programmable way that's one thing and the other thing is to battle test it all the time right so every time there's a new ZK protocol primitive coming out from Academia event we try to kind of retim it and see if we can support it and to what extent and then we fine-tune our design hopefully uh we'll be able to go to a tape out which is do a question kind of there are no return point where we kind of say okay this goes and when it gets back it's in Silicon then it goes into I don't know Miners and whoever needs it um so hopefully we'll be able to go to this uh to tape out uh soon meaning when I'm saying soon it still means like you know can be in a couple of years um and it's really going to depend on how this Market is going to evolve we first want to Target all apps zika roll ups and therefore we are very much dependent on their decentralization efforts and we try our best also to to help with what we can Omar uh if somebody is interested by what you are doing what you've talked about here today uh how can they join how can they help what who do you need help from or how can people get involved um right so with this point we do mostly rmd um my team uh there are a bunch of very talented cryptographers mathematicians and Hardware guys like chip designers uh Architects uh and so on we are trying to build um an ecosystem in software what we're going to do soon is going to open source much of what we do Hardware is traditionally a very closed Source type of environment this is not good for a space we try to break this narrative we try to go and be and walk in the open be transparent and also put some code an IP out there for people to use and play feedback is critical from developers mostly that are going to build on ZK any type of application everything is is applicable um you can find us in Twitter Ingo um ZK we have a website we learned we have a GitHub with all of our stuff open we have a Discord that soon we're going to launch it officially right now if you are working on some technical problem and want to join the Discord meet the team this is a very good place reach out to me and I'll be able to connect you with uh with the team all right thank you so much thank you [Music]
