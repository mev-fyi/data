now pepsi getting into nfts pepsi mic drop they're rolling out an nft collection and i guess they beat coke to this we haven't seen anything with coke on the other hand i'm a little bit worried with these company large corporations and brands entering is this kind of a top marker at least don't say it pfp 10k we can say a top every single week it doesn't matter anymore there is no top hey bangla station happy second week of december david what time is it oh it is the friday weekly roll-up time run where we roll up the whole entire week in crypto which is always an ambitious endeavor especially when you're on the road yet the bankless nation does not stop we must always record the weekly roll-ups you are not just on the road though you're on the island i'm on the island yeah puerto rico is fantastic never been i went when i was six and i haven't been since but it is just as lovely as i remember okay so um like what's the puerto rico crypto scene like i mean what what part of puerto rico are you in right now uh i'm staying in con condado condedo which is like the beach side of san juan so capital puerto rico uh yesterday i was in uh dorado which is where a lot of the uh the perhaps the crypto wealth has ended up uh on the crypto side of uh puerto rico uh i also met uh joey krug last night uh former podcast guest yeah for the first time yeah how's joey doing he's doing great he's doing great yeah puerto rico overall a fun time a nice combination of uh just island vibes with like a burgeoning metropolis uh kind of kind of what's the you know it's just got a little bit of everything uh and the internet speeds here are great which is really important okay i was wondering about that and i've noticed your internet speeds are fantastic probably better than mine to be honest it doesn't take much okay guys that's a low bar all right but like um hey any thoughts like i know a lot of people were taught in crypto talked about moving to puerto rico many actually have um would you ever do that i i would definitely do that if i hadn't just moved to san diego and also fallen in love with it like puerto rico would be pretty damn high up on the list the life life is nice here i can't complain i can see i can see why people do it yeah all right guys well you you are plugged in uh to the weekly roll up which is where you find the best crypto news topics of the week three arrows capital david they just bought 400 million in eth i guess they are now unabandoning eth is that what's happening yeah you know i've always been a proponent of slow trading like people was like oh people a lot of people just like chased pumps and then three o's capital opened up a short two weeks ago yeah but now they're buying like come on guys we're gonna get into that guys that's gonna be topic of the week also how to protect yourself there's a badger dao hack you want to know this is a psa on how to protect yourself cardio cardano has shields everywhere it seems we're going to talk about them and we finally learned why oh my gosh and it's so like i knew a little bit of this but we're gonna find out more also sushi swap there's some drama this week open c i p nope pepsi nft drop that just happened the waitlist opens today as well so we got a lot to unpack on the roll-up not a lot of time to do this david we're going to consolidate this down to an hour today aren't we no i would not be putting my money on that yeah don't put your money there guys it's never going to happen because there's so much to jam-pack but this is still the fastest way to get updates david before we get into it wanna share some information from our friends over at metamask they are sponsoring this message and they want you to know that they are upgrading their hardware wallet experience david why don't you tell folks what that means oh so much yeah bit of ask and the combination of metamasking ledger or the hardware wallet has always been clunky especially in the last year but they have been teaming up because it's a very hard problem because they don't have google on board to fix and smooth out some of those clunky clunkiness about that uh so the performance of metamask plus ledger should be a lot uh significantly improved but also integrations with other hardware wallets as well including the lattice which we are big fans of and keystone a brand new hardware wallet on the scene now which is an air-gapped qr code based hardware wallet overall the power of going bankless while using metamask as your portal into d5 has never been stronger so uh go to banklist.cc metamask download metamask plug in your hardware wallets whichever ones are right for you and get into the world of d5 how about one of each hardware wallet you know it's not a bad plan either a little bit of redundancy i have like four ledgers i might as well just you know collect four of everything else you know yeah redundancy is good you know what it was funny david so uh earlier this week i tweeted out hey what's the the silliest thing you've ever purchased in uh in crypto right i got all these responses you know people buying dragon coin 2017 and such and one guy was like when i first got into crypto i purchased 10 ledgers 10 ledger wallets because i thought you needed a specific ledger for every single dress that you spun up so we bought 10 of them and uh it was just kind of funny it's like i you know i feel like i might have done that in the early days as well but of course hardware wallets you can have infinite addresses on your hardware wallet so you don't need to buy many uh many hardware wallets you just need at least one hardware wallet to protect those private keys uh anyway let's get to the markets man you ready that's yes absolutely what's bitcoin telling us bitcoin is down on the week started at 56 and a half thousand dollars hit a low of forty six thousand six hundred dollars uh currently is at forty eight thousand four hundred dollars right now so overall down fifteen percent on the week big big people talking about crab month crap month december i don't know if that's what's happening uh right now but maybe eth tells more of a story what's uh what's the weekly look on eth yeah start of the week at 4 500 hit a low of 3 800 on that big dip which happened on sunday i believe uh and then we are currently clocking in at four thousand one hundred and seventy five dollars uh we were we were much higher earlier uh we almost got above four thousand five hundred dollars this week not quite uh i was getting real bullish but it looks like we still have exactly what ryan's saying which is some consolidation december going on right now which i think is just perfectly fine i think everyone should just nice be nice and relaxed for the holidays relax through the holidays don't you don't want to be checking crypto prices do you remember you know 2017 where he's like couldn't even pay attention to anything else 60 times a day yeah yeah yeah i know there's a there's a lot of fear out there i don't think there's anything to be fearful of consolidation is good the the funding rates are really really low which means not a lot of people are taking leverage which means there's not a lot of people to liquidate if things go down i'm i'm just very very happy with where we are right now and i think january is going to be really really cool feel healthy it just feels healthy to me all right like yes 2017 was exciting but unhealthy okay it was just like cramming a bunch of fast food and candy and then 2018 it was unhealthy to the other side like crypto was dead 2018 2019 2020 was this weird place where it didn't feel healthy didn't feel unhealthy it was i don't know what it was but right now it feels like just the way it should be uh do you remember when we had ben cowan on the podcast he was like hey if crypto really breaks up uh breaks out to the upside in december i'll start to get kind of worried because the cycles are getting longer it's going too fast we need to slow down take a breath before 2022 but all of this feels kind of primed for next year to be honest i'd be happy for a quiet december myself yeah i agree i think the last time we saw a really fast movement was last may and we all know what happened then uh we went from ether went from like uh forty three hundred dollars on to seventeen hundred dollars that's what happens when things move too fast so a lot of the the first the unicyclers the first cyclers are fearful and a lot of the veterans are just very very content uh and so there is that dichotomy there so listen to sometimes listen to the veterans just be content we're at work i don't get the fear i don't get it i have no fear absolutely unless you're looking at this and your bitcoin maximalist this is the eth bitcoin uh ratio and it's doing things what things is it doing this week david yeah the eath is up 7.5 versus bitcoin on the week we uh we started at point zero eight five we are currently clocking at point zero eight seven uh really moving uh setting new highs every single day for the last week or so above and beyond what we set in in 2020 and 2021 and the number of days that ether has been higher than bitcoin has continued to drop is down i think below 110 days and and every time we go up is fewer and fewer days either getting close and close to complete unknown unpriced uh uh price discovery uh it was the word i'm looking for price discovery what's the number to beat it's just got to basically the ratio has to just basically double right i think uh for the for the yes yeah yeah not even flipping but yeah well for the flipping actually is it's pretty damn close to there as well i think if we double in each price and bitcoin stays flat we do flip bitcoin uh wow yeah yeah so like yeah the short-term traders that are looking for just the nice little round number of point one uh if we can get to point one i think i think the it's game on it's good what are uh like uh you you've been known to hang in some of these circles a little bit more than i have david but like what's the bitcoin maximalist sentiment right now are they just sort of uh ear you know fingers in their ears kind of ignoring it or is there a little bit of anger disbelief maybe happiness i think it's a it's a a forced ignoring uh i think the the silence that i've heard uh from these sides is just absolutely deafening when you when you heard bitcoiners talking about like the death of a theory when it was going down below point zero two people the bitcoins were not shut up about how bitcoin about ether was going to absolutely die everything's down in bitcoin terms and it's been up only since then for the last like almost three years 2019 was uh it was the darkest year for all of that there was a lot of that conversation lately so maybe it's just quiet resignation well granted now all the eth people are getting really really really loud so this could just be like the inverse you know who knows humility humility folks let's uh let's learn some t5 pulse no i'm talking to both of us as i do david 105 billion in d5 pulse a little bit uh crabbing as well so kind of just the sideways movement i guess flat from last week let's talk about the uh the dpi to eat it's not indeed it's down it's down moving on it's down uh no actually no let me see is it down um oh here it is it's down look it's below that red bar david oh come on dude that was the farmers forever ago we know it's been down we know we know their bottom call was wrong for adding this into post prod uh it's never gonna get old yeah okay but like okay hey let me can i take the inverse of this because this is funny to me but like i think it's down too low david i don't think this is gonna go down to forever and i think the bleeding against eath is going to stop and has to stop ryan's calling the bottom i'm not ryan is calling it what's the number point zero six eight right it's called the bottom no no i'm looking at this draw the line luke see that look on my face that look of like glee and exuberance or whatever that is that's the kind of look that people get when something has topped or when something has bottomed right sure i'm not saying it's like i i actually don't really care attention i'm bullish on both i'm bullish on uh d5 and i'm bullish on eth right this is kind of a funny place to be in but i feel like too many people right now are discounting d5 it's like saying that eth is going to you know appreciate relative to d5 forever and it's just not going to happen this is just another cycle that's playing out defy had a crazy year last year it's not going to do two of those necessarily in a row it was time for eth to recover relative to to to d5 of course now people are talking about like d5 as if it's dead or something it's never going to recover i'm not calling the bottom you're calling the bottom i'm not here ryan has joined the bottom callers i'm looking forward to seeing another line on this craft next week a bottom exists and it's got to be close it's all i'm saying but it's going to turn this into a another blue line i guess for uh for ryan calling the bottom all right anyway uh bed index what are we looking at david down 7.5 on the week start of the week at roughly 175 dollars currently clocking in at 144 dollars good combo though bitcoin eat and d5 it's kind of the our all-weather portfolio it's just kind of crabbing out though right now as it does hey well nobody noticed david guess what dye got a little bit more decentralized which is kind of nice what's the story here yeah there's there's always been a big critique about dye because up to a point something like 65 percent of total collateral in maker dao was usdc which is a big centralization risk especially when uscc has a white list which is controlled by a central entity so by proxy dai has that that centralization risk and that was like ever since the covet crisis right exactly we had that black thursday in in uh crypto where dye kind of de-pegged and almost you know died totally absolutely and and now usdc collateral is below 30 coming in at 29.4 ether collateral is at 43 so all die is backed by up to 43 of ether uh almost 15 of wbtc as well so starting to move back into the non-sovereign store value monies that's good a little healthier i think and look at this from chris dixon speaking about uh markets moving another way to uh to uh track markets is attention and he's doing google trends for w for web3 and interest is going up over time quite a bit bigly yeah web 3 is really finding it's it's moment right now i mean i think it's going to continue but previous to this year the web 3 meme was sort of dead uh i don't know it just it was kind of zombified and now it's made a big resurgence what do you think this means yeah for the podcast listeners it looks like that the search terms for web3 volume has roughly 10xed since about the middle of september 2021. wow so that is pretty cool uh you know a slow growth for all of us since the the whole entire 2021 slowly up into the right but once september hit boom like 10x since in the last like two months well dixon has been one a champion for for that model so uh for web 3 as a meme and so i'm not surprised he's tweeting this out and folks if you want to understand what web 3 actually is i would refer you to that podcast we did with them which are the five mental models for web 3. go check that out it's somewhere in the archives as well david here's a big story man we were talking about this uh was it two weeks ago three weeks ago the whole zoo um three hours capital abandoning eth um talk about that story and what just happened was three euros capital snapped up 400 million dollars in eth they've unabandoned eth it seems like traders gonna trade yeah so what happened was that there was a bunch of drama between kane warwick of synthetics and suzu uh kane was just calling out uh just traders uh who didn't really have long-term beliefs and were just kind of going from from bag to bag to bag and chilling their bags along the way and then suzu just doubled down on that and saying like yo yeah well like i'll abandon ethereum because ethereum abandon its users because of really really high gas fees that's why i'm chilling like avalanche so that was two weeks ago they opened up an on-chain short against eth at the time uh and now they are now buying eth uh traders gonna trade granted that short did work out because the whole entire market went down also granted the whole entire market went down but eth went down the least in that same time frame which really frustrates me because they were wrong and right at the same time they ended up making money but they could have made more money if they had shorted anything else but now they are buying i'm i'm totally okay with them making money and being traders in and like doing well in all market conditions totally okay with it what you know i think where the uh community had the big problem was this disparaging of builders this this idea that ethereum was somehow rejecting its users when no it was actually protecting its users it was making sure that the network stayed decentralized long term and this is uh i guess a a control a command z you know of uh of like the undo button that suzu and three arrows capital pulled not less than two weeks later and this was also interestingly is at least the local top on the um the uh avalanche appreciation relative to eth right like that's gone uh down a whole lot since that tweet too so it's just totally a top trade and this is uh suzu talking about it's he's saying look i couldn't let you guys jerk off watching the burn without me that was in his original tweet too eath layer 2 is still unstable newcomers layer one excuse me it's still unstable for newcomers show it to your gram if you don't believe me so you're saying i'm still right doubling down on that i'll still bid it hard on any panic dump like this weekend obviously 100k ethan's dust for what it's worth more coming what does this tell you this this is why you can't just follow traders because they trade first right like they they move quickly and like building chill baby yeah just because they're buying one thing this week it doesn't mean that you have no idea what they're going to buy next week just following traders doesn't work i mean maybe it does i don't know it's just like it's so much mental capacity that's why ryan and i are big fans of long-term thinking it's it's it's it's there's plenty of upside and long-term thinking in fact i kind of think there's more and there's also a lot less stress um people think when they come into the space that they just need to be a trader uh so many people ask me it's like oh you're you're in crypto so you trade right like no no i'm i podcast i don't trade yeah it's so very very so true davidson you don't have to be a trader you don't it's like when you enter an rpg right multiplayer rpgs like it's like choose your character class you're going to be the barbarian the warlock the necromancer oh are you gonna be the traitor are you gonna be the holder are you gonna be the builder are you gonna be the settler you get to pick and you don't have to pick the character class of the trader so many people default to that and it's actually like one of the hardest character classes to play i think one of the least rewarding in my opinion right but like this is i picked my character class and i'm holder investor settler right and i i i don't even want to dabble with trade like i'll do it from time to time like i'll cast a few spells whatever but like that's it it's also the most crowded class everyone picks the traitor right and like and one of the reasons why is because people are people feel fomo about about crypto right so like all right how do i feel fomo how do i get more crypto outsize other than just buying it and so like that's where a lot of people like think that they can trade or they just take on leverage there's other ways to take on leverage and what i mean by that is like building something is leverage right like if you build something successful you can have outsized returns uh if you want to uh be be a connector be a podcaster to every other way like social capital there's other ways to have outsized exposure to this industry other than just trying to maximize your trade and profit um so i will leave listeners with that to chew on there's other ways to get outside exposure and it's not just necessarily trading or gaining taking leverage oh i totally agree one of my favorite ways to do it by the way is join a dow early that has some issues and then contribute right start building out that dao is a great way if you're the uh the settler character class i guess uh let's talk about this too we teased this in the intro why are crypto influencers shilling cardano the eta token this is a comment from somebody on twitter who gives actually the answer to that and first i want to just say i feel like i see a lot of shilling of cardano around quote unquote specifically youtube influencers right which is not it's like you and i david i guess we're accidental youtubers like i don't even know how we by necessity yeah right so like we started the podcast like we're just trying to get the bankless message out and uh youtube is another way to do that but i wouldn't call us like native youtubers but there have been crypto native like i guess crypto influencer type youtubers this has been a very large um you know i guess class of individuals and a lot of like very popular ones that i don't frequent but i've noticed a lot of them are shilling all sorts of things that we don't talk about very much on bankless why do you think that is and then what's the answer here yeah so uh certain certain tokens that and certain projects very much understand the surface area the massive amounts of surface area that's generated from social media platforms like youtube where do people go when they want to learn about something youtube's often the first place so it's a great place to throw a throw a net to capture eyeballs and then when you throw in an incentive structure which is being what is uncovered by jack in this tweet thread here that's really where like the fuel goes into incentivizing these these youtube chillers and so if you scroll down right into the second tweet he goes when you look at crypto uh make sure to look at the incentive structures these are the mechanisms that make rises uh price uh price rises and falls who's motivated to hold to advertise to buy and sell the key mechanic for cardano staking about 70 percent of ada cardenas token is locked in steak pools the rate on your staked cardano is about five percent steak per year roughly matching about the ether is taking per year give or take um but what about the rate for someone who runs a staking pool which is a a component of contano which is uh part part of its design structure about how you stay you stake inside of a staking pool because you delegate your way your stake that's not part of ethereum structure so the rate for those who run a staking pool is over 100 percent a year as in you almost double and you double your your stake on your sake rate every single year so that's like if you staked 32 ether in one year you'd have 64 ether the next year validators are doubling their money yearly off the locked front of stakers while stakers are only earning about five percent this is roughly how banks work banks like hey come give us your money we'll give you a very very low apy while they go yield farming in tradify and get like you know 30 percent apy and then they pocket the difference this is the same business model if you're uh jack continues in his threat if you're a cardano you've got to incentivize people to promote the asset the more you pay the validators the more they will work to promote ada that and you get to stake it if you've got a captive audience it's a beautiful business model so the system works like this your neighbor greg watches a video shilling cardeno they buy some ada they lock it up in their favorite youtubers validator pool they make five percent the youtuber doubles their money yearly greg waits for ada to moon this is not just a conspiracy theory cardano actu actually recommends that validators set a part of their budget aside for running a youtube channel they are actively promoting this as part of the structure for youtube youtubers talk about how easy it is to set up nodes like there's no conflict of interest so how much do these validators earn like a lot uh a lot a lot a lot and this is exactly the same model that bit connect had in 2017 they the amount of bit connect youtube videos youtubers promoting bit connect was off the charts you could go anywhere without it it was the business models like hey and all big connect was was a ponzi scheme this is a ponzi scheme this is a how these things work youtubers promote the things like hey come in deposit your money and it's just more and more and this is how you get inflows and this is why cardano has pumped in the ways that it has because it is a gigantic ponzi and i'm not afraid to say those very harsh words i i said this on the wolf of wall street podcast forever ago saying cardano is basically a full-fledged scam and all the cardano shields of course took offense charles hoskinson took offense i feel like this is exactly what i was kind of talking about i had the gut take then now we actually have the data it's crazy that like most of the of crypto people didn't actually realize this very simple thing was happening because no one who's actually in crypto actually pays attention to cardano there's nothing actually there andrea end brand david wow okay yeah so if you want to understand what the outcome is you have to look at incentives and the fact that so somebody might hear what you just said and say but david what's what's different let me talk a lot about um ether and that has a staking uh system associated with it and so like aren't you just pumping your bags in this way but what's different here is like um this is rewarding and incentivizing youtube influencers and marketing above like utility of the actual project right that that which there is it is providing yes of which there is none or there's very little right now or it's it definitely does not um match the market value compared to other projects right so there's all of this incentive to talk about the asset to stake the asset particularly with like the marketing arm of the network which is these youtube influencers and uh other networks don't incent in the same way so yeah it's troubling but like it's just it just kind of explains things to me a little bit more and now i can go back to ignoring cardano because i'm not using it to go bankless because there are no applications that i can actually use and that that's at the end of the day what you should be looking for if you're in the crypto journey i feel i feel sad sometimes like i feel bad for for people who are new because you have to develop an expert [ __ ] radar in this space uh it like in particular if you're new that's pretty hard like you have all of this noise coming at you and you have to stay very tuned into what channels you consume what information you consume what resources you consume it's very difficult to separate the like the signal from the noise but that's a skill you have to develop if you're on this journey one of the best things you can do is actually if you want to see and validate what someone's saying is actually start using the networks use the projects right uh so for me cardano has never passed that test because there's nothing i can actually do on it so this is relegated to the ignore category for me but uh if this does explain some of the price pumps that we've seen particularly over the last 12 months or so okay unit swap labs over the last two weeks unit swap v3 24-hour volume record 4.8 billion in 24 hours that's a new all-time high a weekly all-time high value of 21 billion more each to us dollar value than coinbase incredible i mean the unit swap story i felt like was a big deal last year and that was kind of its breakout year but it's still a big deal in the background uniswap is just chomping liquidity and continuing guys we are going to get to the releases of the week and the raises of course and talk about some of those news items you can't uh you you can't miss but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lido is here to do lido makes sticking accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access staking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lydo.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the leido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eth terra or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to seven point four percent interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy or you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemiini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless all right guys we are back talking about the hot releases of the week the first is this uh poep plus git coin combined get po app what is this and for people who aren't familiar with poap maybe you could give a quick explainer on poap itself oh i think more people are going to be familiar with poap than github on this channel proof of attendance protocol it's basically you scan a qr code and you get like a pin it's basically like a virtual digital pin kind of like an i voted sticker but it can be for for anything uh so i got one when i went to the mediverso conference uh yesterday i also got one when i went to east denver 2019 2020 uh 2021. i gotta collect all the poeps got one for mariano conti's birthday party uh just like yeah fun fun little like i attended like stickers and also uh many many other things as well you also get one if you're a bankless paid newsletter subscriber we give you the bankless uh premium poep badge because you were there you were as you were in 2021 and these are great community generation tools uh for they can be used for so many different reasons get a hub which is where a lot of developers come and uh deposit their code it's a code repository uh it allows for asynchronous collaboration and uh adding and appending code with this the uh the thing here is like hey like if you did something did you complete the bounty or did you just submit code did you do something you get a poe app uh and this is a great way to actually create the footprint create the surface area for rewarding people at least that's the first use case that comes to mind for me uh poeps are really really good for just finding out who actually participated in what uh and so if you could uh now github can introdu in in uh integrate with poe apps to actually generate some sort of like registry of people that actually contributed among many other possibilities so that's really cool i think this is a really important primitive david because it's like recognizing rewarding uh contribution and like being early and actually doing something so it's rewarding activity but really what i'm i'm really looking forward to is all of the applications that we build on top of this primitive on top of poeps because i feel right now that um poeps are kind of like a little bit like two-dimensional in that you kind of collect them you add them to your your stamp collection but still there's not a lot of utility built on top of it so i think the next chapter for poep and projects like this is what all of the things that you can do with your badges so proving that i was a bankless member look at all those david's showing his phone with all these apps right it's like so these are all social proofs and what can he start to do with these in the future what can he unlock what additional benefits does he get and there are some early experiences with this but i think an entire ecosystem is going to be built on top of these things and things like them david let's talk about this missouri governor missouri is an analytics firm a media firm as well they just released a governor uh interface and it's an application that allows you to it's kind of an aggregator across all sorts of different dapps on uh votes it's like what are the proposals going through in all of these different dows out there and let me search for bank list i can do that i think so these this is the bankless dow these are the different proposals that are up for discussion you can connect your wallet you can view the you know the the status uh and this is not just bankless of course this is like you know let's type in uniswap uniswap um deploy unit swap v3 polygon pos chain created 20 days ago status succeeded category integration really cool to see a user interface on all of the big decisions that these digital organizations are making uh in web 3 so a nice ad to the space any thoughts there no that was a great great comprehensive roll-up ride nice job that's what we do here we just roll it up why don't you take arjun stark stark net launch uh they just released something this week yeah we talked about this in the last two roll-ups it's finally here almost it's for here for developers is currently a developer tool but argent on starknet is now available in the chrome store uh and so this is going to be i think a really fantastic way to engage with crypto on a very secure smart contract wallet smart contract wallets are definitely the future arjun is one of them being on a layer two is much better than being on a layer one uh and so now that is now released in the chrome store as a developer tool it'll probably be production release i believe by the end of the year is what they've hinted at that's what they've hinted at i can't wait to say gm to the arjun app um another thing i'm looking forward to okay ramp network they are a fiat on-ramp and here's their commitment over the next few months ramp network will provide universal global on-ramping to all major l2s and then they list them optimism arbitrage zk sync starkware loop ring boom all of them nice job this is exactly what we need this is exactly what we need this is ramp doing this uh all of the exchanges are going to fall suit follow suit all of the fiat on-ramps are going to follow suit we're going to have bridges onto layer twos directly so that we don't have to deposit individuals in the middle of manhattan which is mainnet and give them like a few dollars for a cab right and like say enjoy your day enjoy your holiday in new york city yeah that's that's a recipe for like not enjoying new york and uh you know sleeping out on the streets instead we're gonna deposit them to layer two which is the way it should be uh these on-ramps are coming expect this early next year ramp network doing big things in that space uh david let's talk raises ftx billion dollars in new funding at a 32 billion evaluation wowser they also just raised 420 million and 69 000 not too long ago that's right i feel like this is like two months ago yeah that's right maybe six weeks 32 billion dollar valuation that's that's within striking distance of coinbase if i if i'm uh getting my numbers right what do you do with 1.5 billion if you're fbi yes you buy buy sports leagues at this point i don't know yeah like you just push more more more names and more different parts yeah they're i mean they're killing it in every single direction basically so like you got you got to say congratulations for to sbf well his uh congratulations sbf maybe now you can unblock me now that you've heard that um but like so what do you think the um i mean his goal was what jp morgan no bigger than goldman goldman sachs yeah he won't know he wanted to buy goldman sachs i want to buy goldman sachs so how big is goldman sachs i wonder i'm bigger than bigger than yeah everything about everything about crypto and ftx yeah i mean getting close though every every six weeks gets a little bit closer let's talk about this volts interest rate swap automated market maker just announced its race six million dollars led by framework ventures what is volts yeah vols is uh part of this new category of uh of defy apps that are separating principal and interest rates to allow for just an interest rate markets uh integrating with an amm which is pretty revolutionary uh we've had van spencer on the podcast a number of times for our bold case for d5 very big episodes we like we like france uh vance and uh we also like france yeah we freedom of future of finance right um and so yeah this is it's not live yet but they did raise a 60 million million dollar seed round of which ryan and i were a part of so disclaimer yeah we're definitely bullish on that you know what else we're bullish on though is jobs let's talk about jobs do you have a job in crypto if not you should david can't dance because he's in puerto rico but like imagine sitting dancing [ __ ] it fine he's imagine him dancing in the background as i'm saying this uh you know i can't watch because i got to read these things out senior back end engineer at smart d5 product manager smart d5 accountant smart d5 senior software engineer popcorn community ecosystem lead that's at dydx check that out crypto research analyst you got to be an nft specialist for bitwise another one for smart contract platforms and web 3 and another governance specialist all of those at bitwise ahead of growth at dex guru technical lead at draft league head of ethereum research immutable head of tokens immutable community manager dexable lead engineer hat stop finance community manager egronum and also cto iagronum thank you david for getting us through the jobs of the week that's not all of them though if you want to see the full list of jobs go to the bankless job boards at banklist.pallet.xyz jobs hit subscribe and you can get access to that uh david thank you man thanks for your contribution you really if you if you want to make me dance for longer you can hit up the bankless twitter account to submit your job uh and i dance as long as the the jobs list keeps on growing so i can also read slower guys i will stop dancing all right guys let's get to the news hey let's start here it was a big hack last week this happened after the roll up or just like while we were recording last week's roll-up but now we've got the details and what happened badger dao was hacked this is a tokenized bitcoin protocol on uh on ethereum but the hack was somewhat unique okay so first of all one thing that was unique it's a lot of money 120 million dollars it's inverted bitcoin that's right in in all of the scheme of hacks also the way it was hacked as well most defy hacks that we've seen up to this point have been like there's a bug in the smart contract wallet there's uh an issue with the oracles um you know some code has gone wrong somewhere okay this was an attack on the user interface right side of things user is the first time i've seen this me too could you describe like what happened david so how did this attack happen yeah so i'm not too sure what a front-end interface means but i think it's a man-in-the-middle attack i think well the front-end interface is like it's so it's not on the smart contract code right it's like in the api layer right they somehow injected so like when you're clicking a link on the website you're interacting with the front end and it was in that layer of the website in the dap that the malicious hacker injected this code right so some some day some data was hot swapped the data that was supposed to be sent to ethereum was was nagged by an attacker and was replaced with a different set of data and then i'm assuming somebody with their private keys approved that uh i don't know how that resulted in the whole entire treasury of badger dow getting snagged but that's that's what happened so well so it happened so so it happened like an address at a time what actually happened so i i think anyone who's used listening bankless and used defy has seen this before when you're using metamask and you're um you know doing something in in a defy app or you get this like approval message uh in metamask you want to approve this this website or this app access to you know your eth tokens or your erc20 tokens okay so the hacker actually hijacked that message and made the message actually grant approval to their address to then siphon all of the funds out of these addresses so i believe what happened david is uh like an address at a time um was stolen you know around like two two hours or so and the i guess the insidious thing is i don't know how many times i've clicked a link that just says approve without going into details and actually looking at it okay sure i'll prove that yeah okay that's like that's like approving somebody to like oh yeah you're free to walk into my bank account my fault and just like do whatever it kind of becomes like how how often do you read the terms of service right when you like sign something right you get you just too many approvals and you can't check them all but this is this is why i migrate private keys every now and then yeah i don't know a lot of people who do that but like so i just yeah it's been great for androids let me tell you that yeah i just pick i just move wallace where like roughly once a year and just like just thousands of addresses infinite addresses yeah i'll tell you unit swap was fun you got to find him though don't lose him um this is a psa from cryptocat helping us out with that so a little bit of metamask hygiene can go a long way so that this doesn't happen to you the first tip he has is know what you're approving check the approved address yourself don't trust the site's user interface take the address manually from the metamask data and look at the contract on ether scan okay how often have you done this never okay if it's a large sum of money make sure you are doing that and then what are you checking you're checking is the contract brand new you're checking who deployed it where do the funds come from just double check go check in either scan double check is it a proxy secondly i think this is huge know how much you are approving all right when you get these approval messages on metamask you don't have to blanket approve all of the tokens all of the assets in your in your address you can just set a custom spending limit so if the trade is only one each then just set it for one eighth don't give them access to all of your eth and that address necessarily make sure you're setting approvals per token be extra tight with your approval on proxies you know the fourth uh thing here he recommends uh revoke dot cash is a great tool so do some quarterly review of your approvals you can click this app revoke cash and enter your etherdress and it will show you all of the websites you've previously given approval you should go ahead and revoke those on at least a quarterly consider those like stds like you don't know which one is going to be going to be the one that gets yeah so exactly exactly so this is just good hygiene as we said um if you're doing infinite approvals you should have a good reason for it should never be your default stay safe out there that's the psa guys i think it's something we can learn from this exercise also interesting nexus mutual didn't pay out why didn't they pay out david right so nexus mutual is an insurance defy insurance so it protects against hacks it protects against smart contract hacks this was not a smart contract hack the smart contracts for badger are un well i don't know if they're secure but it wasn't an exploit it wasn't a smart contract exploit so those in theory those smart contracts are still fine the front end is what got hacked nexus mutual doesn't cover the front end so the next expensive is not paying out people that lost money in badger uh which is kind of like you know kind of the same old things that we see in traditional insurance like oh what let me check the terms of conditions oh that was like you know volcanoes that wasn't covered in your in your insurance like that that you don't get that one i guess so but it's also fair i mean their their contract is always they're you know insurance has always been about smart contracts doesn't cover economic risk oracle risk doesn't cover user interface risk so it's also fair that actually was in the terms um so i understand that side of it too also this is why it's important to go bank list because celsius network was a centralized borrowing and lending agency had money in badger dow so celsius uh you put your money in it's kind of like compound or ave but basically they go out and they yield farm and defy on your behalf and then kind of just like a bank they get some amount of apy they pass some of that apy onto you they pocket the difference but they are farming with users monies and so there's a there's a misalignment of incentives there because you know they can take on risk and they need to take on risk in order to get the yield and so they lost a decent amount of money in this badger dao d5 hack and overall i would suggest that if you're going to use celsius make sure you aren't just using it out of convenience use it for a specific reason for specific uh you know metrics uh don't just use it because it's easy uh custody is really really important and something could have happened that could have completely wiped celsius out we don't know um it's kind of like tether we it's a black box we don't know what's going on behind there and the d5 alternatives are just far superior in my mind so that's my personal psa there yeah i i agree with that too and i think like block fi and anyone who's taking custody of your assets and generating some return if um if they're like a crypto bank you have no idea what they're actually doing with it you just don't know it's a black box now in this case celsius said look guys we'll cover all of if you lost money we'll cover it not a problem right you understand the celsius is growing so fast it's so big at this point they have the fun store to do that that's not so much what i'm worried about what i worry about with these schemes is it's kind of like the traditional banking systems where you just don't know you put in the black box you don't have transparency uh and i guess that's okay but that is an element of trust right and with defy like you deposit your funds in wi-fi you can right-click view source and understand exactly where it's all going if you want to you can understand the risk profile of what you just did whereas this is a black box type system so uh yeah just because article says according to twitter speculators celsius may have lost up to 50 million dollars as a result of the exploit um i don't know how much research went into that number again just speculation but oof big oof yeah and celsius can afford it and they will because it's about their their brand but what if it was 500 yeah what if it was five billion right i mean next time it could be right this is kind of what we're dealing with here anyway another another exchange got hacked another central this centralized exchange in this case bitmart i didn't even know this existed i guess it's a walmart for bitcoin i don't know bitmark uh 196 million was hacked and lost that's a big number and and by the way the the badger dow defy hack 120 million also a huge number as for when it comes to default hacks usually hacks are the single digit millions maybe 10 like double digit millions triple digit millions do not happen often they happen way more with centralized exchanges uh but even this centralized exchange of hack of 196 billion is a big hack that's big the reason why centralized exchanges are often bigger than defy apps is that centralized exchanges consolidate so many deposits into the same wallet so there's a big big honey pot that doesn't necessarily happen with defy apps by the way the nature of their construction but yeah over 100 million in various cryptocurrencies on ethereum and then 96 million on binance smart chain was hacked from bitmart um one of the one of the multi-stakeholders like one of their accounts was compromised something to that effect right it's like when you put your funds in a centralized exchange it's like just a gigantic ball vault yeah right and they have to have good security processes multi-six signers but sometimes that goes wrong you know what i was also interested in is what did the hacker do when the hacker took the funds okay this is just sort of interesting to me so let's say you just go you make off with 196 dollar million dollars in various crypto assets david what do you do with it all right well this individual one inch swapped the assets for eth okay and then went to tornado cash and then sort of mixed them up privacy style what's interesting to me about that is like how quickly when a hacker goes and steals something they go to the the best money possible the most based money possible the most saleable good possible right the good with the money with the strongest settlement assurances the strongest property rights yes and that happens to be eth particularly eth when you have a privacy layer in between uh so it's all going back to ether i guess hackers know the best money you want to know it's money go see what the hackers you know uh translate it into let's talk about this david the free ross movement they took a leaf out of constitution dow's book what is that headline telling us yeah so ross albrecht the famous dread pirate roberts from the silk road the guy that spun up the silk road and then went to jail for life for it i think two life sentences plus 40 years for a non-violent violent first offender uh absolutely crazy they just made a huge example out of him and the conspiracy is not because he was selling drugs but because he was using bitcoin that's a different story for a different day he's in jail for life um but he is all he he follows because of through the help of his mom he follows the crypto world just because he's interested in it uh and he is releasing nfts to raise funds to help free himself but also to help pay for loved ones that can see other loved ones in jail so one part charity one part trying to free himself from jail the uh the pleaser dao has started up free ross dow and so they made it they made free rostow they contributed some of their own funds to free rostral they collected over uh 2 800 each to in order to wait on this ross ulbricht nft they won they won with a winning bid of 144 1446 eth uh so free ross dow owns the ross ulbricht nft and i can't imagine a better dow to to own it um now there's now a community around this nfc and i believe the plan is to fractionalize it and turn it into a currency and take and continue on the story so congratulations to anyone that donated money to free rostow this just reminds me of the constitution now of course it's a smaller story it's not the constitution it's it's something smaller but um it is an example of a community you know buying something together uh toward a common good and tokenizing and turning it into a dow to do something more what what what's free ross dow going to do next uh yeah no i think the plan is to fractionalize it probably with fractional uh and then turn it into an erc20 token and make a currency out of it and then use that to fund further developments that can also help free ross so there could perhaps become an economy around this free ross movement yeah there's just really interesting experiments going on maybe before you move on something that uh i think is super sickening is that a bunch of bitcoiners we talked about this when when uh ross minted the nft they hated the fact that he was minting an nft saying like how do you how you lose your base in one easy step you mint an nft and because the base being bitcoin maximus forgetting that ross ulbrick's not a bitcoin maximus he just used bitcoin in 2013. uh so everyone was winning in 2013. yeah a bunch of bitcoiners were trying to generate funds in order to buy the nfts in order so that they can burn it justice in order just to spite the movement which just tells you again how much they lost the plot they're just like burning their hero at the stake and they've done this so many times because you can't go against bitcoin and so like they were trying to do they were trying to do the same thing that free ross dow was going to do except instead of making it public to good they were just trying to burn it and eliminate it from existence and you know you can't beat ethereum at capital generation that's what we're good at so once again like beaten by ethereum you can't bet against ethereum it doesn't work yeah absolutely it's it's very weird to excommunicate members of your community i just don't understand definitely we've seen this in religious uh circles i guess we see it in crypto tribalism as well uh new york times though i guess maybe they're getting on board they just use the word tokenomics in one of their articles yeah and that's the whole sorry tokenomics now part of the new york times vernacular cool maybe it's gonna be webster's uh word of the year next year we'll see let's talk about this google their former ceo eric schmitz he just joined chain link as a strategic advisor so i remember eric when he came on board at google he took over for the two uh co-founders who were like in their like late late 20s or something and said he was going to provide adult supervision for google right that was kind of a joke and get them through the kind of the ipo in the 2000s so it's pretty big name in the tech scene and now we're seeing web 2 graduates getting into web 3 which is pretty cool so joining chain link i think that's a that's a big step and i wonder if we'll we'll continue to see more of that moving forward um let's talk about this david so interesting thing i was i was kind of tracking is this idea of censorship all right we'll get back to a story about dfinity in a moment and the concept of censorship but i think it's important here's a chris dixon tweet youtube suspended my account for posting a defy hackathon video he's quoting someone else who said this apparently maybe youtube um suspending accounts for content it doesn't like now we don't know why exactly what triggered the the suspension algorithm but we're starting to see that more and more uh here's another one this is uh on twitter this time a nancy pelosi portfolio tracker and a maxwell trial tracker these are accounts spun up to track nancy pelosi's portfolio i guess and you track the the maxwell trial their accounts were suspended yeah assistance too 217 hundred thousand uh yeah two hundred and seventeen hundred thousand followers for the nancy account and then over half a million followers for the galen maxwell trial tracker suspended uh and you know the gale maxwell trial did not get any coverage by legacy media instead there was a bunch of just news of uh like you know but uh others other stuff other drama uh and that you know the conspiracy is we all know jeffrey epstein didn't kill himself and now people are saying well the gayley maxwell trial is being suppressed uh so censorship is bad well is it like so yes censorship is bad but like we don't even know why these accounts were suspended right and that's that's the whole problem with it like they broke one of twitter's rules you want find more information look at our privacy policy like what but what rules did they break why were they suspended you're once again reminded this is not a public protocol this is very much you're in a corporations playground right and so they can suspend you they can kick you out of their restaurant for any reason they feel like and they don't have to justify their actions except maybe in the in the court of public opinion okay this is what we're talking about this is the potential for censorship this is why we want to build web3 platforms that don't have this loophole the original web one platforms didn't have a censorship loophole either right hd uh http smtp right these protocols basically didn't have the ability to give any centralized actor censorship over them they were credibly neutral they were free anyone could use them you could use them for good purposes you could use them for bad purposes but they were free okay web 2 has moved away from that this is sort of what i worry about this gets back to the point where i'm relating this to maybe to a crypto project in dfinity i saw this governance proposal in dfinity someone flagged my attention to it it was basically a conversation of dfinity of course is a decentralized kind of like storage compute uh protocol um it it can be if its vision is fulfilled very complementary to many of the other things we see in crypto right it's like particularly like maybe in ethereum maybe a uniswap front end could be stored on top of dfinity and the promise of something like dfinity in the internet community is censorship resistance okay so we don't have the problems we just saw with youtube and twitter and web2 but here's this governance post it's basically talking about one of the dfinity nodes um some a container some some some content was uh posted on top of it that nintendo is saying we own and this is copyright infringement okay it's like a super mario 64 emulator on top of a divinity contract and so governance post in the community saying community what should we do about this we would propose that dfinity had the ability to remove certain content a remove canister remove some things if it infringes if the community votes for it to be removed okay and it's like to me red flags start to go off when when crypto communities talk about that okay it's like okay mario we'll just like have a vote and we'll just remove the thing you send us an angry letter so we're just gonna remove it okay this is just like a very small case of this but what happens if a nation state basically says hey if you use the word i don't know voter suppression or maxwell case right we want all of that content removed it's not nintendo sending you that letter it's like the fbi sending you that letter or it's like um the ccp in china is sending you this letter okay it's like if you have the ability to censor content and turn it off then it's not decentralized it's not censorship resistant and then i go back to like what's the point and the thing with in the dfinity case is they're saying well it is still decentralized because the community gets to vote whether this specific piece of content gets uh removed or not by token vote but like who owns the tokens all right dfinity foundation like members of the community insiders shareholders in a corporation so i'm like back to like okay if we're leaving a token vote loophole open for these things that matter a lot aren't we just reverting back to the shareholder like what's the difference between twitter shareholders saying no you can't have that content and dfinity token holder is saying no you can't so just an example and i'm not bashing dfinity i think like maybe they're trying to do fantastic things okay but like this is just i'm not specifically bashing dfinity is what i would say i'm bashing the concept of token vote right on the protocol dictating important governance decisions because if if nintendo sends you an email like please remove our ip right like that's just like a breeze of the sort of you know resistance that's going to come for content in the future and if you're falling over at that you're never going to make it you're never going to build something that is censorship resistant and anyway i tweeted this out i got some back and forth from people who are like but ryan it's it's copyright it's an ip are you saying that child pornography and like uh you know terrorism should be allowed on these platforms like what are you actually supporting like what are you supporting these are censorship resistant don't don't give me the child porn and terrorism schtick that like mainstream does about this right you either believe in a credibly neutral open free system of expression or you don't and you believe in the benefits of that system versus the cops or you don't but like let's not have this you know censorship resistant decentralized theater anyway there's my long rant you got one earlier dave but that's my long rant any thoughts on that yeah if you go back to the to the governance proposal to remove the thing uh about the child the terrorism and child porn like well here's a actually up from a post while the internet computer is designed to be censorship resistant in order for it to be adopted as the world computer by the mainstream it's critical to abide by laws against terrorism and child porn et cetera as well as regulations around copyright infringement and intellectual property rights uh let's not equate copyright infringement and intellectual property rights with terrorism and child porn and it and i want to just it's it should start the sentence should stop here it says in order to prefer to be adopted by a world computer by the mainstream it is critical to abide by laws what no no the cool thing about crypto is that it is a new set of laws that is the whole point we do not abide by old laws the whole point about crypto is we are a new social scaffolding structure that is not the same as the old social scrafting structure uh and so this is the difference between on-chain governance of a token vote and in ether holders if you if you want to be a proof-of-stake estate validator on the ethereum network you have absolutely no control as to what goes on the ethereum network you just validate it you just approve it that is the difference and so this dfinity is a web 2 protocol with decentralization theater layered like a theater just layered on top of it it is not what we are here for there's no property rights there's no and there's no self-sovereignty of the user uh yeah like it does it just doesn't exist outside of the existing property rights we already have which is if you're saying the nation state gets to control different regulations to different jurisdictions get to control this then you're not web three are you not crypto are you just another web 2 thing right which is cool but like we already have that like may as well host an aws aws will respond to nintendo's letter too this is just that this is just what frustrates me about this david it's like i feel like there's a lot of decentralized theater going on and i feel like we need to because we're here early like we need to stand up for cypherpunk values right that's the entire point of this thing in general i i do worry about having like coinvote being sort of a proxy for centralization and i'm most worried about that at the base layer right the things that are supposed to be more most decentralized i don't care if a dow has a token vote yeah coin vote happens at the app layer and when it's appropriate yep right agreed anyway moving on uh let's talk about this sushi swap speaking of drama there's some more drama what's actually happening with the sushi swap drama david i think this drama really got uh triggered because of the falling sushi price overall like d fights down sushi the sushi token price is down even more and so that causes a bunch of community angst uh and so there's been a lot of friction between the leadership behind sushi swap which is you know a very flat organization it got started just as a vampire attack on uniswap and also started branding itself as like the the non-vc version of unit swap and generated a lot of community attraction that way built and then mean stuff build some cool stuff and and meanwhile it's run into just organizational issues how do you actually organize as a an entity without creating hierarchy and so i really wanted to be a very flat organization flat organized organizations are really really hard especially when you don't have typical organizational structures to make people comply by right a lot of the anonymous developers of sushi swap just don't have a lot of transparency there's not a lot of transparency going on between the devs and the community there's been a lot of friction there joseph de long the cto of unit of sushi swap really just declined uh what's the right word um pushed back against all the community fud against the sushi community's fud against sushi the team uh and said this is this is ridiculous guys like i work my work my butt off trying to get sushi swap in fact i actually want a pay raise and if you don't pay rate if you don't give me this pay raise i'm just going to leave uh the community decided to not give him the pay raise so joseph de long has re resigned as ceo of sushi swap and uh there's apparently a lot of the sushi swap communities was just like harassing him inside the discord and on on twitter uh and then there's other um uh sushi swap team members as well which have been um accused of just trying to you know pay themselves right using the the sushi shop treasury to just fund their own their own uh their own pockets uh and we've seen this before like when wherever there's governance and control over things people try to access that that's just what happens over time that's where incentives go so overall there's a bunch of sushi swap drama that's going on and it seems to be that sushi swap is going through a tumultuous time sushi swap has gone through tumultuous times before it's come out bigger and brighter on the other side no i have nothing to say if it's actually going to happen again every single obstacle presents its own challenges um we will see where this goes governance is hard right you know particularly like dow defy token governance and there's this idea of the the tyranny of structurelessness which is like if you have structurelessness that actually is a governance decision and that comes with its own tyranny as well and i do feel like sometimes in crypto we're guilty of just saying like it's decentralized right like as if that is is a complete fix on all governance issues and if that is the optimal way to make decisions in every type of organization right and uh yeah i think there's just some growing pains happening with dao's as a result of figuring this stuff out yeah without structure and hierarchy in order like everything kind of devolves into like who's the most greedy and also the most loud and most aggressive loud greedy cabals almost like violence right it's like anarchy you know anarchy completely um anyway there are systems and designs around this but i think they'll take some time to evolve too uh david vitalik wrote a fantastic post it's called end game post's so good it crashed his website so i actually couldn't access this when it was uh first published but i've read it it's a fantastic post and really this is an extrapolation i think on the end game for ethereum for other l1s and also for rollups we don't have time to get into all the details but we will link the post in the show notes and i guess maybe this is some homework for bankless listeners go read this post because we're going to have italic on the podcast toward the end of this month i think it'll be our first podcast of the year where we're going to go over this post we're going to go over the ethereum roadmap his thoughts on crypto and see what he's thinking towards 2022. so psa this is out there stay tuned for that episode it's coming soon uh let's get into some nft stuff ubisoft all right so there's some i guess good news this week in nft land that ubisoft was going to become the first major gaming company to actually embrace and launch in-game nfts they were doing this on tezos after years of dabble dabbling they said it was time for ubisoft to take nfts and crypto gaming to the next level so that was exciting at first that's the first thing that happened and then apparently they put out this video on youtube a trailer of what they had in mind and this trailer on youtube was so disliked david like the down vote ratio to upvote is like five percent upvote ratio and 95 down vote it got so bad that ubisoft actually decided to pull the trailer from youtube and i don't know that that means they're gonna you know pull their all their nft uh plans but that was definitely like they they saw that shot across the bow from the community just saying we're rejecting this we don't want this we we don't want nfts in our game and so i was thinking about this a little bit i know we sort of talked about this before but like why is this happening because this isn't the first time all right so you remember a couple a few weeks ago we were telling you guys about discord and they were the ceo of discord was teasing and integration with metamask uh and then not two like less than two days later he came back and said nope we're not actually doing that that was just a test idea walked it right back because the community hated it so much now uh video gamers and video gamers are huge you know users of discord of course uh they're chasing ubisoft away from nfts so i'm trying to figure out why like why do gamers hate nfts and i you know ask the community talk to some people in the space talk to some crypto gamers listen to some youtube videos and i feel like i now have a much more nuanced answer but before i get into some of the like the things that i found david what's your take why do crypto why do gamers hate nfts i mean i think some in the crypto community will just say they're ignorant they don't know any better they're using like environmental fud as a reason for hating it and they just want to hate things so they hate it um i think there's more to it than that but what do you think i think gamers really care about games and the games that they like to play and a lot of people just don't like change regardless about crypto well like rob's about anything people don't like change and gamers are really a really sensitive cohort of people really really really really picky oh yeah oh big time yeah kind of kind of wise snobby like a little hipster snobby type yeah yeah like kind of spoiled brat type i mean i consider myself a gamer but the gamers that really care about gaming they're they're yeah they're just picky and whiny uh and so we we have to understand that like when you integrate nfts into a game it's changing the game like things change when that happens and people don't like change especially gamers gamers want what they want and and you know game companies have historically listened to their communities because that's where all their revenue comes from so like i'm not really surprised the the difference is is that nft integrated games like asset integrated games can produce brand new communities that are completely new from completely different subsets of the world and those communities don't exist because nft games don't exist yet and so the future communities of the world like the unborn child's don't have a voice they're not born yet and so there's no other community to push back against them because the whole point about adding nfts is to create something new and so this is like trad gaming we have now have we now have trad gaming ryan and we have incumbents we have the trad gaming community who just doesn't want to to see change happen yeah i saw a take from scott lewis of a defy pulse who was very much of like you know gamers are big escapists right like the world out there is scary and crazy and you know making a life for oneself and career is really really hard so they go to their game where nothing really matters and when i say nothing matters i mean like yeah nothing economically nothing matters when you play your game there's no assets inside the game and so when you actually put monetary assets inside the game things matter a lot more like things become really really real when you when you find gold in the game if that actually translates to something that you can sell on uniswap start your decisions start to become a lot more have a lot more consequences and i mean that really removes the concept of escapism and when a lot of these gamers are just used to being able to just dabble around and not think too seriously as soon as you put money into the game it's going to get a lot more competitive and a lot more real like imagine like like professional professional like we know like yield guild games right that is a dow of gamers who are taking actually infinity seriously uh and then they are playing that in order to make money and so like imagine like gamer casual gamers are not going to go up against like vc backed gamer dows where they're going to after they're taking the game really really seriously uh and so again the change is hard change is rough uh and the the future community gamer communities of nfts of which are going to actually fund real lifestyles and real salaries and real careers don't have a voice yet there's only the trad gamers out there yeah i i i think that's good and just you know to maybe get imagine you're you're a gamer right and you're working kind of you're a dead end job that you don't really like right you go you log into your game during the evenings and like you know you're a badass in that game you're a level 60 warlock yeah you're like armored you need armor yeah and you're like a clan leader right you have this alias and you're just a badass imagine now you have to compete economically against su zoo and three arrows capital for like the dragon armor that uh you really want right and they have all of this capital from the real world from the outside world they're gonna just like decimate you yeah you've just like your your status your escapism everything that was fun about that game has now been kind of destroyed and so i get that and i think that's um that's maybe a kind of a hidden motive about this and the way that you know i think gamers might phrase this is yeah when you add financials uh it just stops being fun what gets paid gets played is how board elon musk responded to this um i would also say there might be a few other things at play i think possibly us you know maybe western gamers are kind of just missing it i heard from someone in this thread somebody from indonesia and he's like all the gamers i talked to in indonesia are all about nfts i don't know what the us is missing but you guys are behind right and so that's an interesting take this might be sort of regional um also back to your point about like uh kind of this not coming from the bottom up community i do think that the ubisofts and the ea sports like the these are like corporatized companies that the gaming communities traditionally hate and they've dealt with like downloadable content it requires a fee they've dealt with like microtrac transactions that require a fee and it's funny it's like the investors in the boardroom at ubisoft talking about nfts is not coming bottom up from the community saying hey we created this fantastic ubisoft mod game mod and like we built it and it's community first right so it's coming top down rather than bottom up which is a problem they just haven't they haven't seen the killer app yet right axe infinity wasn't for them they're waiting for like this aaa level game they just haven't seen it yet so i feel like it's something that's going to be resolved but i don't know if it's going to be resolved this cycle okay because what we're seeing is like a lot of large corporate gaming companies enter the nft space like kind of when it's really hot in order to make money the way they saw dollar signs with microtransactions and downloadable content and i don't think that's the way you're going to get the gaming community on board it has to come from bottom up so maybe that's what's going on and i think this fits into just the broader theme that we see with crypto is that the traditional already established institutions out there are going to be replaced by brand new institutions rather than coming along from the ride and it seems to be the community saying like hey like don't go there like don't yeah stay stay here which leaves a lot of room for new gaming studios and nothing really like there's a lot of things that need to get disrupted in the world banks being like probably at the top of that list gaming companies are not far behind there's a lot of entrenchment there's just a lot like with record labels lack of innovation yeah yeah and so like i think that's just leaves a huge opportunity for brand new gaming studios to embrace nfts in a way that the corporatized like big big gaming studios never really could anyways because they're boomers and they don't get it you know trad gaming blah blah and so i i i think perhaps the next gaming studios are going to just be birth because of this movement because of this resistance yeah i agree and so from that perspective look you know gamers crypto stands in solidarity this is a bottom-up movement let it be your movement start embracing nfts as you as neutral technology and building on top of them that's how you get ahead um perhaps perhaps take life more seriously and stop being such an escapist [Laughter] that's that's david's tough life advice here yeah yeah uh what's happening with openc all right so there was talk of maybe a token but now it looks like they're going in the ipo direction so they're taking a chapter out of coinbase's book and so members of the community are like come on we want a token what's happening here david yeah uh we kind of suspected this for a while openc it's a centralized company it's a centralized protocol it's basically just essentially like a ebay for nfts uh it's got smart contracts on ethereum but they're not openly verifiable uh so i think they're kind of just leaning into the whole centralization thing but like much to their benefit and success uh and it's just going to be continued by apparently an ipo i think it's basically an open secret at this point even though this ipo is not confirmed it was just a hint but i mean i'm going to go ahead and put my money on an ipo and of course people our users are bummed by not having a token we want tokens we like airdrops we like being gifted equity because we want these things to be community owned and community operated but open c apparently that's just not their vibe that's not their ethos they want to do an ipo which once again leaves a big void for the dow version of open c the d5 version of openc of which there are some uh and so that's how the cookie crumbles i guess yeah i agree uh they are also hiring the lyft cfo to become the highest cfo they yeah they have hired uh and this ceo i think was um pretty instrumental in getting lift over the finish line towards ipo so that's the direction they're going in it's kind of the coin based direction and i don't hate it but to your point david it just leaves room for a more community oriented competitor so i expect to see that emerge too every niche will be filled in crypto don't worry guys it just takes some time and every stocking will be stuffed by crypto stuff so this came out of the wall street metaphorical stocking yeah uh so crypto nfts and tungsten cubes a guide to giving cash in 2021 on the wall street journal and so wall street journal kind of wrote a very quick short article saying hey here's a bunch of like uh you know christmas gift ideas you can you can give people some nfts you can give people crypto and also tungsten cubes i guess they somehow like that is a physical thing that can go in your stocking however it'll probably stretch your stocking out because they're really really heavy uh interesting to see this being part of bloomberg are you excuse me wall street journal yeah are you at the point where you'd give an nft for christmas to somebody david okay i did i had uh no because my family's probably tired of it i have given your sister give it to you yeah she doesn't want it she doesn't want it i have given an nft as a gift before and let me tell you onboarding people by giving them crypto either with money or nfts really really works like a lot of the objections that people have just go out the door when they just own the damn things so like if you ever really want to get somebody into crypto just give them something like it'll it'll work i promise but you don't you don't have anyone on your list who's like because my thing is uh a lot of my family are people on my christmas shopping list like they just wouldn't appreciate it right sure they'd appreciate it maybe as like a free bonus gift but if i'm like this is the thing i bought you for christmas you know it's an nft you can look at your they'd be like oh cool is that really what they want yeah yeah you give people what they want not what you think they need well how excited would you be to receive an nft then uh i mean the last nfc i was gifted was a cool cat and it went from like point zero two e at the time of ownership to eat and then that's when i gave it away and then i watched it go from two e to like 15 ethan like [ __ ] [Laughter] i i will say if you do giving nfts or or crypto to someone during christmas make sure that you retain a copy of their private keys because they will probably lose them so give them and be their custodian you just want to do with our small bankless team we should do an nfd secret santa and somebody should write the app so we could just all buy uh nfts for me you know for each other anonymously secret standard style maybe someone will do that holiday fun ryan i don't want your turtle [Laughter] man you saw right through that it's not even working on you i guess we've been podcasting together too long huh the matrix they just sold out so the matrix had uh is releasing a new movie i'm excited to see it a hundred thousand unique pfp erc 721 nfts were put up for sale to celebrate the the matrix and it's all sold out a hundred thousand hundred thousand that is crazy that's so many look at this uh this is all on a side chain right so um people don't have to pay for gas fees of course which makes onboarding easy um i don't know are people buying to speculate do you think or these a lot of fans are these insiders like what is going on huh yeah you can buy it with a credit card yeah the big takeaways are there was a hundred thousand of them for reference there's only ten thousand crypto punks there's uh like 888 cool cats i think there's ten thousand board apes a hundred thousand is a lot of people you could buy these with a credit card uh so that just is you know great consumer adoption uh and you can buy them on a secondary market that is on the palm side chain was an ethereum side chain i think spun up by consensus uh and they're also denominated in die so i'm seeing a lot of like hybrids dominated and die yeah you like you can buy it with a credit card but when you resell it you resell it and die uh so like this is really doing a great job of meeting consumers where they want to be first it's uh yo the matrix so very well these are them yeah and you again buy them with a credit card so you don't need crypto and then you have nfts uh and i bet i bet you they obfuscate gas i mean i don't know if that's true or not but i bet you they do uh and like these things are done denominated in dollars on the front page so it's like dollar sign 120 even though it's nominated and die because you can do that so like it's really just a perfect meeting in the middle of like just enough crypto but still a lot of just like consumer like ux that that consumers are prepared to expect there you go these are selling for like 130 on the floor i don't know i don't know what makes these things matrix nfts granted i haven't seen the movie but these are just like normal people these are just these are just people yeah you're not seeing it i'm sure there's some better ones up if we go up the base scale i'm sure like there's probably neo somewhere in here right he's got to be the rarest who knows i haven't looked at this in depth but pretty cool look every every game studio is doing this so is every brand adidas just entered the metaverse they bought a board ape yacht club nfc is that right yep yeah and then they dress them up in adidas swag so the adidas swag is not part of the og board apes so they kind of drew that art on but the ape is real uh they've also been collaborating with g money who was just through the meta versa conference that i was at and so uh adidas taking nfts seriously and go getting right into it that's awesome yeah crypto punk purchases nft purchases now pepsi getting into nfts pepsi mic drop they're rolling out an nft collection microphone nfts like the nfcs are microphones yeah so they are dropping the microphones uh and so it's like you know generative you know profile picture nfcs and they're microphones like the 50s style so that's that's kind of cool uh so the this got announced literally as ryan was pulling up the links for this i saw this on twitter and so we've we last minute buzzer beater threw this into the agenda the wait list for this opens tomorrow as in today on friday for the for you listeners tomorrow the time i'm recording today for you the listener right now uh and so you can join the wait list for this uh and get the mic drop pepsi and if it's on the waitlist for the microphone pepsi yeah i'm excited for this i'll be excited for this sure like i'm not going to put too much eth into this but like i'll i'll be a part of this for like really i do not want a microphone nft but like i don't know it's pepsi yeah no it's cool and i guess they beat coke to this we haven't seen anything with coke on the other hand i'm a little bit worried with these companies large corporations and brands entering is this kind of a top marker no at least don't say it pfp also 10k we can say a top every single week it doesn't matter anymore there is no top there's no i i i i don't know though i i do feel like on the back of our kevin uh rose podcast where we talked a lot about like hey there are a lot of pfp projects spinning up right there's crypto punks and port apes and some of the blue chips but there's a whole slew of long tail and it's getting crowded up there i don't know see what the appetite is but all the matrix nft sold this one's really cool uh this is in geekwire.com tech entrepreneur is opening seattle nft museum ryan can you scroll up because i'm reading the headline uh to showcase digital art form in a physical space we're getting our first physical nft museum it's in seattle i think that's really cool so when i go home well it's not going to open until mid july january but next time in seattle after it opens i'm totally going to go check it out it's a digital art museum and so kind of like i was talking about on the state of the nation that came out yesterday the world of displaying nfts is pretty nascent and needs a lot of maturity and development and so i'm really excited to see what they got in show a physical museum a physical space with nfts and that's really really cool i expect that we see more and more of these as nfts mature i'll be uh do you visit museums do you visit regular museums very often sure yeah totally when they suit my interests 100 i i love a good museum particularly like a good history or art disease it's a big history yeah that's really cool for sure nft museums man they're coming okay uh what's this yeah wow real quick we've had him on the show two times uh and he has just uh had his first christie's auction issuing waveform this is a physical piece of art so this is not an nft um but well it's actually both those it's both it's a physical piece of art it's a it's a waveform so if you've ever recorded audio you see that waveform show up uh it makes sense because blou is an artist so he's editing music uh and so this is a one-of-one nfc produced by blau that grants a hundred percent of the rights to the owner of the waveform so yes it is an nfd there's master recording publishing rights entitled to reproduce commercialized edit remix rename and release waveform or any derivative of waveform master and from the from the beats original form so like you get the og uh content and then you also get to remix it and sell all possible rights ever so you get full sovereignty as the owner the auction ends on december 7th at 12 p.m eastern time uh no that already ended we already sold it three days ago yeah yeah uh and so yeah congratulations whoever bought this and again congratulations to blau for pushing the frontier and the fringes of what it means to sell an nft and also in connection to the actual artist so really really cool this is kind of cool right because he issued it out on his uh his platform which uh called royal which um contains nft rights i was just listening to this a little bit in the background as you were talking david it's a pretty sweet jam you could make a good podcast intro nice yeah i'll just take it well wait we can't buy it because somebody already bought it that's true well you could always buy a secondary you know just out of markup i guess all right what's uh we're into bitcoin news okay so okay yeah so uh bitcoin is really really bullish in november because a plan b stock to flow bottle predicted a hundred thousand k that happens by by december or 98 000. uh no way i didn't realize it yes by december yeah so in order for a bit for plan b's famous stock to flow uh model uh stock to flow this is bitcoin canonical this is very important in bitcoin circles right because it has been right for the model has been accurate right a lot of people think uh stock to flow is just complete nonsense and i find myself in that category basically stock to flow is saying that supply creates the price uh and so it's basically saying scarcity will create price uh and so because bitcoin is becoming more scarce therefore price will go up i think that's completely backwards a lot of people agree with me a lot of uh people support this model anyways because of the immaculate nature of bitcoins manifest destiny just go up in price and so this is like this is the gospel of the bitcoin stock to flow like model uh and it was supposed to hit 98 000 by the end of uh december uh by the end of november but instead of going to that level we are seeing bitcoin covering in the 40 high 40s low 50s and if people really capitulated right when bitcoin went from like 57 000 down to 47 000 inside of an hour when it was supposed to go from 57 to 98 000 uh and so this is the first miss of the model and and i kind of think like in a uh raoul paul says like the reason why stock to flow has been so accurate is because it's accidentally mapping on to network growth network adoption uh yeah it's a logarithmic process network adoption basically it's like yes it's an exponential curve but no you don't just get to create scarcity and then have that create price uh and so uh a lot of like a lot of politicians feel shaken right now there's a there was a uh bitcoin magazine and ck from there was uh hosted at uh twitter spaces saying we are in uncharted territory as in like oh stock to flow finally hasn't predicted anything and i'm like yeah come on guys like such [ __ ] stupid sorry well so like okay so uh this might be rejected in bitcoin canon then bitcoin maximus cannon right or or maybe there's a way to like tweak it and you know adopt it so like a new model in the future it was like always right just with this one tweak we missed the first time around i i'm not sure how the culture is going to kind of evolve it but to me it just seems like the the fundamental idea that supply would predict price is wrong because like from an economics perspective it's a cartoon in the horse it's it's supply and demand is where you get price so if if you don't know the demand function right like you don't know where demand intersects with supply how can you possibly get to price there's two sides to that equation if all you're looking at supply and saying that somehow triggers demand you're just looking at it's like you know having a pair of scissors and just removing one blade and trying to like cut with the other blade of scissors like you need both blades of scissors to get to price supply and demand two blades i don't understand how that works um but you know bitcoiners will figure it out bitcoin's still going to go up i'm still bullish bitcoin just uh i just never really understood that yeah never understood that model it it seemed like there was a lot of um hope pinned on yes one tiny one tiny perspective here um microstrategy's got a lot of hope meanwhile yeah yeah microsoft 82.4 million dollars more of bitcoin uh uh 1 434 more bitcoin like can't stop don't stop it's at this point it's just kind of like i start to cringe every time i see it really yeah it's just too much bitcoin yeah of course it's gonna be do something else with your money you you already have uh like half a percent of the big ones like why do you well you know part of it is part of it is like most people when they dollar cost average in it's like quietly right you're not like making a big production of it but microstrategy and sailors like i bought this week and like it's blasted on the press everywhere so everyone knows it well actually well they don't actually blast the press this is the this is the the block and all the crypto media firms and it's paid media that picks it up and so like yeah we reported on it every single week so actually we're the victims here maybe we okay so we're causing this excuse me yeah we're not the cause we are the causes of this maybe we should stop talking about it yeah yeah well apologies to uh to our listeners but you know we're trying to find bitcoin stuff to talk about so sailors sailor is buying the the dip i guess uh let's talk about this this is big u.s house committee they brought six crypto ceos in front of congress one of them was sbf we were talking about earlier uh this is uh in front of the house i believe yeah the house committee so look it's a full video here people can watch it if they have time we'll include a link in the show notes you can watch it on youtube it's four and a half hours all right i did not watch all four and a half hours i don't think it's worth it either there's there's plenty of quick tldrs and we'll try and get them to your world let's give them the tldrs um guy you go for tldrs jake travinsky what's he saying about this yeah jake tweets out today's house finance senate committee uh uh i think that's what that means uh was the most positive constructive constructive and bipartisan public event on crypto i've ever seen in congress ever i mean that literally it is a testament to the effectiveness of the industry and the community engagement in dc in recent months we've made shockingly big progress he's got some follow-up tweets as well um that's huge though so like something bullish did j you know jake is kind of a straight shooter right he's a great very real very pragmatic and for him to be coming out of this four and a half hours i guess i'm sure he consumed all of it positively like constructive was his words bipartisan public event on crypto the best he's ever seen literally that's awesome something good must have happened i think part of this is it's some some people members of congress actually coming to the defense of crypto actually understanding it for the first time so in previous sessions that i've watched dave and this is part of the reason i didn't watch this whole thing is because i i feel like i've seen this show a hundred times and i just don't want to watch it again but previously what you'd see is a lot of staunch uh critics of crypto right like the brad shermans of the world which would talk about like harping on how terrible krypto is how how dumb it is how stupid it is how it's you know you know terrorism linked and just money laundering and drugs and all of these things and then everyone else kind of just sitting back and listening there were no defenders no one was like hey wait a second here's the here are the good things that crypto is doing now here's a congressman from ohio tweeting this out today we have a hearing on digital assets and blockchain web three there's that word again the bulk of commentary in congress has been on individual assets and relating to the traditional finance world this misses the bigger picture entirely fundamentally web 3 is a computing revolution that has the potential to solve some of the internet's most frustrating problems by putting power directly in the hands of the builders and users who make it all possible quotes a chris dixon tweet web3 is the internet owned by builders what chris dixon said the potential of web 3 is enormous and the biggest mistake we could make now is rushing to over regulate a space that is in its infancy and so very true uh so very few in washington truly understand so listeners have heard that a thousand times on bank list this is what we preach this is what we ban the drum on so many people heard that for the first time because a congressman said it like not one of us a leader in this space and so like yeah maybe that was just like basic like you know a summary of the principles of what we talk about but so many people like it it hits differently when a house of representatives member says this and it says it in the right ways and in accurate ways that is just fantastic and you see the tweak it's less on the cryptos money narrative and more on the web 3 narrative that gets a different cohort i'm also seeing kind of the the lobby narrative efforts of crypto actually paying off as well like lots going on behind the scenes i think to make these kinds of statements um possible here's another take from jake that though when someone asked him hey in 20 words jake what actually happened here he said the committee members said surprisingly supportive things and asked good questions the witnesses were great too also brad sherman was there brad sherman strikes again this is crazy what was brad sherman on about uh during during this uh during the session david did a few things here here's a tweet why don't you read it out yeah bret sherman was trying to i think make a farce of crypto uh and there's plenty of things to make a farce about like ryan and i make a farce about parsons about crypto all the time crypto's stupid a lot of your time a lot of the time crypto is really really dumb uh and so this comes out of block work summarizing what brad sherman said today when testifying during congress representative rav sherman said that doge could potentially replace ethereum and hamster coin could potentially replace a doge he also asked what about mongoose coin as a result of this hamster coin is up 66 percent mongoose coin token was created so brad sherman just tried to try to say like oh this there's a bunch of just like craziness going on it's totally fake it's just weird memes it's just like memes and tokens and like why why are we even talking about this and so he's just tried to make a farce of the whole entire industry to just discredit and discount us and my response to that is like all right brad like if we're a farce why are we talking then stop talking about it man it's just a farce like why are we talking about it stop bringing it up like whatever yeah just ignore it yeah you could just ignore it why are you wasting your why are we literally having a committee meeting in congress about this if it's just a complete farce just go just go home brad like why do you if what you don't need to defend mongoose coin if it really is a joke unless you're really threatened by mongoose coin brad yeah maybe you are that's what's going on jake sure vincent follows up saying a short break in today's otherwise extremely supportive house finance senate committee hearing for brad schuman to ramble incoherently about his hatred for crypto it reminds us that he has a primary challenge in next year's midterm election from our friend and fellow bitcoiner and crypto supporter akita rhodes uh so let's see if we can get akita uh we will get to uh akira's twitter handle into the show notes go follow her we're going to support her and her election so she can get brad sherman and mongoose coin conversations out of congress and perhaps some more informed and more accepting versions of web three uh and so uh where where is akita rose uh what did she represent what uh state or uh 30th district let's see um california 30th congressional district in 2022 in california okay so if you live in california and you are voting in california uh vote for akita rhodes for the 30th district san fernando valley so if you are listening that and that is and she is your representative uh please participate if you can do one thing when it comes to voting just at least vote for her absolutely maybe that's why brad is feeling a little threatened uh jake good at the end kind of summarizes this all it was great but let's not get too carried away he says i don't want us to get too carried away by how well yesterday's hearing went the house financial services that's what it stands for david house financial services not senate they've come a long way but it's not like our antagonists have just disappeared senate banking has a hearing on stable coins next tuesday fair warning it may not be so friendly i think that's the case i think there is some regulation coming for stablecoin that's that's a key area and i'm completely fond of that too stablecoins i'm fine with stablecoin regulation that's fine if it's centralized it deserves to be regulated that's exactly right so but i'm just like don't apply the same rules to something in centralized and decentralized anyway look man congress it's 2021 congress is maybe starting to get it maybe it's starting i think that's the efforts of this community efforts like people like jake if you've ever donated in any of these like uh grants for uh political advocacy for crypto then you've played a role too if you've ever called your senator or congress then you've played a role in all of this too uh david let's overall i will summarize that whole entire thing as yeah summarize the summary cautious w it's a cautious win and we don't get many w's yes that's it yeah yeah it doesn't happen it doesn't happen now we got to work on the biden administration anyway gemiini is partnering with colombia's biggest bank for crypto trading this is pretty good new big news the partnership will allow ban columbia customers to trade a number of popular cryptocurrencies including bitcoin eth and litecoin traditional crypto banks crypto exchanges getting into traditional banks and doing it at jurisdiction at a time pretty cool to see yep uh countries getting crypto peeled let's do this thank you thank you by twin for helping crypto pill the country of columbia we're working on it meta uh this is facebook i always forget when someone says meta meta's crypto wallet which is uh formerly known as facebook novi just launched on whatsapp why is that a big deal yeah it's a big deal because it can start contrast to all the lack of progress on the libra front it seems that meta is actually making progress on the metaverse front uh crypto wallets now in whatsapp whatsapp has like a billion users or something like that something absolutely crazy uh and so there's now crypto there uh and so progress actually happening this time in stark contrast with libra there we go guys we are going to be back with the takes of the week you don't want to miss them you don't want to miss the meme of the week it's a good one neither do you want to miss the moment of zen but before we get to all of those great things we got to stop and tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this show possible the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a

the week the first one from naval who's my favorite one of my favorites on twitter when building a portfolio of investing uh investments that can have non-linear outcomes never sell early you may be right most of the time but the one time you're wrong will cost you most of the returns okay when building a portfolio of investments that can have non-linear outcomes never sell early because the time you're wrong will cost you what do you think he's saying here well i think his follow-up tweet is really uh helpful as well because not selling can actually be really really toxic right like you can not sell while something goes to zero and so he follows up saying fallowed reasons for selling you've completely lost faith in the project you can redeploy into a better investment uh it accounts for too much of your net worth you have a personal uh expenditure to make right so like trying to be pragmatic about the things but what naval is when you buy a house you want to pay off student loans something like this right right and so what noval is saying is like especially in the world of crypto where exponential returns are actually commonplace humans don't think in exponentials we think in linear terms we think in incremental returns like especially the traditional stock market before it turned into basically a casino for for traditional hedge funds which is what it is now it used to be like very modest five to seven percent so a good day would be point one percent like let's not get too crazy crypto comes along and bitcoin goes from zero to sixty thousand dollars in ten years uh and ethereum does that same like same movement in half the time or not the same movement half the movement in a quarter of the time uh and and so like people it just bl it breaks people's brains exponentials break people's brains so what snowball is saying when you are on the cusp of something that has the potential to do a thousand x the worst thing that you can do is sell at a 10x like even a 10x is crazy and the worst thing about 10x is you can sell it to doubling and it goes all the way down the line so if you really really really believe in something why sell and and so like this is why i never sell ether because i'll sell all like i will make the mistake of selling too early on a tokens that i believe could a 10x or 100x just because i also fear that i will get lose lose out on ether denominated returns and so like two things are gonna 10x there's there's a difference there but like when you have exponential returns you have to leave some on the table this is the only actual like trading advice i've ever heard vitalik say maybe not trading advice but like financial advice he always says don't sell everything always keep something on the table and so i've taken that to heart and that's definitely benefited me in the past where if something goes 10x i don't sell all of it i sell 90 and i leave 10 on the table and that has treated me very very well but in the past yeah that's the other thing you can do exactly right you know you don't have to sell all of it if you do sell right but but i do think that the the way people lose money in crypto the thing that cost them the most in crypto is two things either they they don't get in early enough they wait too long right if you're listening to this it's probably not you you're probably already in crypto so the second mistake is the mistake you're more likely to make which is you sell too early you sell the thing too early and what we're talking about here is again things that are non-linear which is almost all of crypto it's like it's either going to the moon or it's like not gonna be worth anything this thing either works out or it doesn't completely unlike other assets that you're used that you're used to and so the mistake that you're more likely to make is you sell for a 5x or 10x thinking you did really well in one cycle but long-term you kind of you kind of lose out so this is great advice and i've got in the habit of like never selling things like pretty close to that like i very rarely sell things that i have high conviction because you just don't know when they're going to pop right um as long as i ask myself hey did my investment thesis for this asset change the answer is no just wait longer what do you have to lose right but if you lose convictions and the reasons involved was saying then maybe those are reasons to sell but you're going to lose a lot of money in crypto by selling too early and i think that's the takeaway here it also really really helps to have actual conviction in the assets that you buy that really helps you not selling yeah you have to how do you develop conviction david fundamentals you research and you pay attention to fundamentals because fundamentals are real and then once the fundamentals are real then you start making memes about them yeah it also takes time yeah i think it takes time to develop conviction you don't get conviction on something overnight takes a lot of research but also like time holding the asset and all of this why is this also good it's good for your life too it's not just like it's life advice okay because then you can start to be zen during these down terms uh you know if bitcoin lost 20 percent whatever what's 20 in the face of 100x right yeah it's all temporary all right what's this take uh punk1456 says eat flipping bitcoin won't be the end of this bull market it will be the beginning chills and so what we talked a little bit about this last week uh and it it the shift around crypto will completely change the whole structure of crypto will change when eth is number one ethereum is number one because it's not just like bitcoin is just bitcoin ethereum is like web 3. there's so much to do on ethereum the optionality for doing anything is infinitely more infinite like infinitely more than what it could be on bitcoin and so i think when when ethereum flipping bitcoin it flips bitcoin and you see that ethereum in that number one spot people will actually look into like i've always thought that bitcoin is pessimism about the future it's like the risk off crypto asset which is weird to think bitcoin is risk off but it really really is uh ethereum is the optimistic future as in like the potential future and so you can mint tokens on ethereum you can do dowels on ethereum you can do whatever you want on ethereum and that culture that that uh that just installation of values as the potential to have anything in the app layer that being the number one thing and the top of the charts really sets the tone for the whole rest of the industry uh and so just the the surface area for potential being number one i think will completely redefine what it means to be crypto do you literally think that's the beginning of the bull market though no it's it's more of a uh yeah if we're talking about specifically asset prices i'm taking this on a little bit more of a uh metaphor i'm bullish on all things crypto inc not net sometimes that's not just price but more about potential right uh you know just innovation bullets around innovation uh and so so maybe i'm taking this in maybe in a different direction than punk four one five six uh that would be really really cool if that is the super cycle if eth flippings bitcoin and then we continue to do another cycle yeah that would be pretty cool that that would be i mean we might see some big downturns between between now and then but yeah downturns means liquidations folks so don't get out over your ski tips let's talk about this i thought this was a really good post by uh our friend [ __ ] mccormick um and it's really he talked it's the concept of the pareto frontier okay so he does two things on a graph you've got one axis uh and another axis x and y axis and on one axis you have money on the other fun you have all of these dots work and that's it yeah okay yeah so money is like stuff you have to do and fun is like everything else so he i think he doesn't actually just mean like you know fun it's more like as as you were saying like fulfillment leisure all the other stuff that isn't incorporated in money and he's basically it's a gross simple oversimplification but human beings do things that optimize money and fun right and so he gives examples reading a sci-fi book that's a seven on fun it's a two on money reading a finance textbook that's a two on fun not very fun but it's six on money it's going to help you later in life you're working in investment banking 80 90 hour weeks that's a one on fun but hell you're getting paid for it that's a nine on money right and he's always like the things we decide to do are all of these dots and what we're trying to do is get kind of the dot that's closest to the pareto efficient closest to the top you see that here that try to maximize the money how do we find the 10 fun 10 money it's that's probably impossible but you want to maximize both numbers as much as possible yep and he's like the 10 the 10 fund 10 money that's what we're all looking for and if given the choice we choose that over like a a five fun five money obviously and he's like okay so that's the pareto frontier that's how you define it what does web 2 what does web 3 do oh it combines fun and money so it moves the pareto frontier up so now rather than doing a 10 fun 10 money type of activity we could do a 15 fun and 15 money activity those are bigger numbers right i like that we have no more points because we're combining fun and money right and this is kind of like what i talked about like even us doing this roll up i was thinking to myself you know what is this right it's just like it's money right but it's also fun right it's pretty high on both scores this is web yeah this is web 3. this is crypto right it's like combining your interests all the fun leisure stuff activities all the hobbies that you'd be doing for free anyways if you could with money like people who are deeply invested down this rabbit hole tend to do really well and are doing well you've been a bankless listener for like the past two years and if you've actually like gone down through this rabbit hole with us uh you're probably doing pretty well like it's probably worked out for you right and you've had fun while you're doing it hopefully so i really like this analogy there's more to this article we'll include in the show notes but the optimization of money and fun that web3 and crypto bring i think is the true revolution here and what's this doing for humanity well we're no longer stuck at 10 fun 10 money now we get 15 fun 15 money 20 fun 20 money right it's like better progress that's what this maps do i wrote about this in my future of work article on on bank list when i talked about what what it means to work for a dow because dowser opt in in multiple ways you get to pick which dow you want to work for and then inside that dial you also get to pick how you contribute right and so we finally find ways where humans can labor in ways that align with their human incentives with their human values pick which dow's the most fun pick which work is the most fun inside of that dow get paid for your contributions uh and so the future of work is just more fun that's great that's great news i love it that's great uh here's the take eric voorhees our friend own ethereum because it moves fast own bitcoin because it doesn't i've heard this a lot i think this is really emblematic of when eric came into crypto and so the meme here is that bitcoiners criticize ethereum because it moves fast and break things uh and then ethereums criticize bitcoin because it doesn't move at all uh and so while like i actually disagree with both of these things ethereum moves really really slow uh and like we can see that in the fact that we all thought proof of stake in sharding was going to come in 2018 and now it's 20 the end of 2021 2022 we have proof of stake kind of but it's on a different chain and we don't even have any sharding uh and so like it's weird that uh bitcoiners criticize ethereum for moving fast and breaking things and then also that they never ever ship any actual other promises right like and so but but the things you talked about david that's lightning speed for bitcoin everything you just rattle off they're like oh my god that's so fast right and so eric says like bitcoin it's it's a rock it doesn't do anything it's going to be the same bitcoin in 2010 and 2020 and 2030 and that's the investment thesis behind bitcoin it's stable it's going to be exactly what it promises you in whatever time frames and aetherians are like i'm sorry but that's unsustainable because the way that bitcoin is built is long-term unsustainable because of the security budget and and all that stuff you have to actually move forward at least a little bit and meanwhile like ethereum ethereum doesn't move fast at all the governance process for ethereum is so slow developer consensus is very very methodical and very very secure we are the slowest moving blockchain and except for the fact that bitcoin is the only difference and that's one standing still you know what's moving fast and breaking things both avalanche and solana which have actually gone down because they go too fast that's too fast that is too fast ethereum is in the perfect goldilocks zone of moving forward but not getting out over the ski tips bitcoin is standing still and that will be the death of it and if you go too fast then you're too centralized uh and so i actually i actually probably would have agreed with this take uh as written in 2018 2019 sure a lot more than i do now yes right because i think um at that time there was so much uncertainty in ethereum's future that i now see like much more certain right and so the the the idea of holding bitcoin in case ethereum fails was kind of a good value proposition then right but ethereum has come so much further since then right the beacon chain eip 1559 you know the roll-up strategy is actually working that i feel like this no longer i'm at the place where i feel like you you need a lot less bitcoin to provide redundant like to provide a hedge against uh ethereum failing ethereum execution risk remember that conversation we had with preston uh pish right just a few months ago and he was very like why why do i why do i prefer bitcoin so much over eth why do i shun eth why do i execution risk he kept going back which is i love that excuse because the more people that say they don't buy ethereum because of execution rich just means that they're all going to be buying ether after a sharding and proof of steak ships which means those people are going to be buying ether at ten thousand dollars which is how we're going to twenty thousand dollars i guess right so much execution risk has just been boiled out and so much you know there's not that much execution risk left at least from my perspective maybe you and i are kind of living in too much in the theorem land though i don't know um i think that's it man let's get to uh what you're excited about this week what are you excited about david this one's a little bit retroactive but also looking forward into the future i've spending time at metaverso maniversa is a really cool conference because it's specifically a very core group of people that really understand crypto right like there's a lot of people at like mainnet mainnet was huge it brought on a lot of people that were brand new to the space and like i'm talking to them and they asked me like oh like what do you think about defy and what do you think about nfts and like oh come on guys i go to the mediversal conference and like people are talking about these cool new experiments these brand new artists these new concepts new solutions and people at mediverso understand it they get it right like so props props to g money and serotonin and and all the all the people that helped through through the mediverso event and i also felt the same vibe at emcon in uh in denver right before a main net right very core group of people who are really on the fringes and a lot of the same people that were at mcon were also at metaverso and so what i'm really excited about ryan is that there is just this very core group of people that travel around the world for all these different conferences and we all vibe together and it's just like this digital group of nomads that don't really actually there isn't actually one spot that we meet up at we just meet up all over the world it's a very i feel very privileged to have this group of people that i have resonate with in different corners of the world they all get it uh and so if you want to if you are interested in tapping into this energy i predict that the next time this group of people all get together and people float in and out there isn't actually like a curated list of who these people are but it's more about the installations of the vibes that these conferences attract i think the next conference that's going to attract this kind of energy is east denver uh so i guess the answer might of what i'm excited about ryan is i'm really excited for eat denver it's coming up in the third week of february um it's where i got into crypto in the first time and just the vi the vibes have always been good there and so i'm looking forward to one more round of good vibes of denver make sure you print out some articles and pass them out there david i don't think the listeners know that reference that that's david's original denver story guys so uh yeah story for another time but your first eve denver as i recall david you were actually like you printed out an article that you wrote you're really excited about three of actually handing out physical copies of of your articles yeah i had like 20. 20 pounds of paper in my backpack i was like hey will you read this like please give me a feeling it's it's a great superhero origin story man and uh that that was like 2018 right so it's like three years ago february 2018. yeah wow how far how far crypto it'll be for four years ago it'll be four years ago when we do yeah four years ago of course because we're going to 2022 incredible man incredible progress what are you excited about ryan uh look can i be the guy who's excited about d5 right now at a time when the d5 narrative is like in the toilet okay and i'm gonna call it the bottom because you've called the bottom you called the boss right ryan's calling the ball i'm calling the bottom without not without calling the body without naming a number look man i'm just like uh yeah that's the safe way to do it david because then people can't regret about you and memes about you um i look i'm looking on even just token terminal and the price to earnings ratios of these things which is like the capital that you know these assets are generating relative to their value the revenue that they're generating are just so low look wiring 7.45 p e ratio okay uh d y d x is 10 axia infinity 12.4 maker dow 18 uh mcdex mcdex 24.52 i mean these are priced as if they're like proctor and gamble okay this is like general electric pe ratio prices and we're in d5 like the fastest growing money system financial system that the world has ever seen and so i feel like it's only a matter of time before some of these things and you catch up and you know nfts at this time last year were like not a thing it was all about defy everyone's talk crypto gets crypto gets obsessed with narratives and then they go overboard with it but like the time to make a buy make a purchase look at investing in something is when no one's talking about it and i i feel like the world is still pretty it's quiet right now on d5 this feels like nfts from last year maybe dowser in a similar place but i'm getting increasingly bullish on d5 again and i'll just remind folks that layer 2 is going to open up a whole new generation of d5 protocols so the other thing that might be true is the winners of the previous d5 cycle might not be the winners of the next cycle but think about d5 as an asset category because i'm thinking about it i think there'll be a lot going on in d5 in 2022. that's it on the bottom i definitely agree with that i think ether needs to stop running up so aggressively in order for d5 to turn around and so i don't want that to happen we definitely don't want that to happen so i think why can't i have both if i if i had my perfect future ether would run to point above 0.1 btc and and then maybe crab for a while there just to not get out over our ski tips and then d5 makes a big move that's that's my perfect version of the future are you ready to make a prediction on that future david shut up give me some numbers i would like to say that like i made the mistake of being wait like making a call that i did not really have too much conviction and just but at least you made the call it's what you're about to say right yeah sure it's true it's true it takes courage to do that remember raoul paul yeah i will not be doing this on the podcast no but raul paul he made what what do you say you're in prediction this was like four or five months ago when we had on the podcast you said like uh do you say 30k eath 30. hi something high i'll go back and look see people forget so sometimes you could be safe about these predictions because people will just forget them yeah we bring it up every single week we don't don't forget it i just need to i need to strip it from the agenda yeah strip it from the agenda in my memory but like we'll stop talking about eventually uh david meme of the week let's get to it man what is this what are we looking at uh parking signs yeah we're looking at parking signs yeah uh raj gokal says attempting to access wealth generating capital markets as a non-accredited u.s investor and so we have a parking sign like st like pole with a bunch of parking signs on it and so here's the first one no parking 11 am to 1 pm street cleaning tow away zone school days no stopping 7 30 to 4 monday through friday school day exceptions 15 minutes monday through friday 7 30 a.m to 8 p.m school business toy school days one hour parking uh time some some other times district permits exempt number four toe away zones one-hour parking non-school days friday from sunday to 12 from friday to six no blah blah blah blah blah a bunch of so like the idea is like here's how you like make sure that you compliantly invest in stuff follow this like litany of regulations and then until it's impossible and then you can invest yeah absolutely and you know raj should know raj is one of the uh the co-founders of solana of course and they did their their crowd sale uh or their their their funding rather than so they benefited from getting through this regulatory gamut huh well they did they did it for accredited investors and here's the thing about solana is like i don't it's not their fault it's not their fault it's honestly not their fault it does matter but it's not their fault it does it does matter but it's not their fault it's the sec it's the accredited investor laws basically said if you have a million dollars and you're rich you have access to a whole set of investments the cool ones that dumb poor people can't right right by poor i'm saying like people with less than a million dollars in assets these are our credit investor laws on the books anyway we're getting all serious and it's mainly weak time but like i hate it credit investors memes are very very serious right or at least they are they are serious this is a serious means down with the credit investor loss yep guys that's it none of this has been financial advice of course it never is eath is risky bitcoin is risky defy is risky you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us
