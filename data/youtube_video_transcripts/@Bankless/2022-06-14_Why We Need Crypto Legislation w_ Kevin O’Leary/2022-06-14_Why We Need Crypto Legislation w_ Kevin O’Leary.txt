as you're in washington you're looking at the senator columnist legislation some other legislation are you optimistic that they're going to get it right they don't need to get it right they just need to get it we got to move forward on something here and i'll tell you why the majority of invested capital on earth is held by sovereign and pension plans about 90 plus percent of it they own zero crypto and so for all the excitement about bitcoin 800 billion that is absolutely a giant nothing burger it is totally irrelevant it's not held by any institutions that matter and i always ask these institutions and these sovereign funds what allocation would you put into bitcoin and they said well we can't because our compliance department won't allow it because the sec hasn't ruled on it yet but they would allocate 50 to 100 basis points now when you're running a trillion dollar mandate that's a ton of money and that's a huge amount of demand that would come into the market it would be good for everybody involved in crypto but we can't do it without policy
