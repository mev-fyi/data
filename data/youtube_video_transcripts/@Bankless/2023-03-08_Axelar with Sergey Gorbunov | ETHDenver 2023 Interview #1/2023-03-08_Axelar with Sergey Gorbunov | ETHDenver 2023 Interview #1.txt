[Music] thank you welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet finance and sometimes that Frontier is at a conference and here we are in the very first day of East Denver the actual official Ethan event has not yet started but we are at the axelar interop summit where a bunch of interoperability conversations are taking place so what's going on behind me and I pulled in a ton of guest interviews like I always do when I go to a conference so you don't have to go to the conferences that I always go to and so here at the interrupt conference we have conversations with people in the cosmos ecosystem there's this brand new chain called axelar which I'm learning quite a lot about and then there's also conversations about layer twos and the ethereum layer one so not only are we talking about the app chain mesh networks thesis that Cosmos has we're also talking about the layer 2 and layer 3 and super chain and Hyper fractal scaling Cheney changiness there's a lot of change going on but the interoperability Summit is all about how do we obfuscate all the complexities of those chains so in these interviews you're going to hear me talk to Sonya Agarwal you're going to hear me talk to Sergey of axelar we'll talk to sriram of eigenlayer we'll talk to Stephen goldfedter of arbitrom anyone who's anyone really working in the interoperability space all of these conversations were super fun they happened right here so you're going to see a person right here next to me as we talk to them here at the axillar interrupt Summit so we want to thank the axelar team for hosting me and all these interviews that were able to bang out so quickly here on the first day of East Denver bankless Nation I hope you enjoy them but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make all of these interviews possible Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023 why because Kraken has been around for over 12 years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable with over 9 million users and not a cent lost choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no-brainer we need exchanges like Kraken to provide the on-ramps to get people to go bankless and kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor if you're unsure about your centralized exchange or on-ramp perhaps open an account with Kraken today and if you're unsure about the rest of web 3 well then maybe you should get your learn on with metamask learn learning about crypto is hard there's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry until now metamask learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about web3 if you are a company trying to onboard employees or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your Boomer parents metamask learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons making learning about web3 fun and easy now once you're through kraken's Gates and you've taken the metamask course on what's a DEX you're safe to make your first stop into the world of D5 where better to start other than uniswap uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps but it's now also an nft aggregator as well making uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading Tech that's out there uniswap's a big announcement at East Denver is their uniswap wallet which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big old bully about crypto apps in the App Store uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem so if you want to use uniswap but with the cheapest possible fees then use uniswap on arbitrum the arbitrum layer 2 is the host of ethereum's most vibrant defy and nft communities arbitrary is already surpassing the each layer 1 in transaction volume and it's not even close to full capacity with so many vibrant communities on arbitrum arbitrim is a good place to call home for the era of layer twos speaking of settling into new homes the Phantom wallet is now available on both ethereum and polygon that's right the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the ethereum ecosystem Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying nfts making nft trades swapping tokens staking tokens so if you're a multi-chain surfer or an nft power user then the Phantom wallet is for you it also comes in Mobile check it out at phantom.app now let's get into the interview and since we are at the axlr interop summit we're going to start this conversation start these interviews off with Sergey the co-founder and CEO of axelar which is a brand new chain that does a lot of the interoperability that spawned a lot of these conversations so we're going to get to Sergey and axillar Bagless Nation we are here at the axillar interop summit and I'm here with Sergey the co-founder and CEO of axlar and also the host of The axlr interop Summit uh Sergey how's it going it's going great how are you good good good good so this is quite the full event yeah of uh the interoperability Summit what is the vibe what is the point of this uh conference so the vibe is awesome I think we'll have a lot of builders that are here we have a hacker stage back there we have a Gateway station there people are learning about interoperability people learning about what are the tools available at the end of the day what we try to do is try to think about what is the future web3 needs to look like and from our perspective the future is interoperable where users get to interact with any asset any application any change with one click but to get to that point we actually have to build a lot of things along the way right and so the goal for the concerts was to kind of come together all the different ecosystems all the different players figure out what are the missing pieces in the stack how does the developer experience need to look like how does the user experience it to look like and talk about the future of Y3 and what kind of communities are represented here uh so this is of course East Denver is what's going on all week but I think the interoperability Summit has attracted a specific type of Builder who's represented here so actually I think we have a folks from all kinds of communities so we have a lot of different layer ones that are participate in an event right it's a lot of kind of ethereum layer uh ethereum folks a lot of layer twos as well every layer 2 needs interoperability as well uh we have folks from you know Avalanche new ecosystems that are emerging sui and so on and so forth um so those are ecosystems that are represented here and then we have a lot of developers right developers actually want to learn how to build these interoperable applications and it requires new types of software it requires new types of stacks to be built so we have an amazing lineup here of developers that actually learning from all the participants and what kind of problems are people running into like what are the solutions that people are looking to get solved here or what's the what's the the New Frontier of innovation that people are really working on yeah so I think uh to me I think the big innovation is like how do you actually think about developer experience building in the interoperable future right so whenever you're talking about it's not just how do I deploy my contracts on one chain but it's about how do I get my application to be accessible from any chain from any wallet right and so a lot of the questions that developers have what is the architecture of this right and we're talking about things like Hub and spoke model peer-to-peer contract calls to each other what are the interoperability protocols underneath it what are different security assumptions between them right we've seen a lot of hacks in the space throughout the last year behind various like centralized Bridges and things like that so think about the security right how do we continue improving it how do we continue to increase in the bar um those are some of the questions that are here and what is axillar and how is axelr fitting into this whole uh Vibe and interoperability uh stack that we're talking about here yeah so the very high level axler is actually a full stack interoperability solution right so the way to think about it is there's the actual Network which is a decentralized network that's responsible for connecting different ecosystems and moving messages across them okay but then on top of the network we have a layer of services that are built around it so things like relayers things like gas Services right so to enable you to interact with any application across any chain we actually don't want you to have to pay gas on multiple chains right so there are things like gas Services where you can pay in one click on the source chain and even if your transaction needs to execute across five other layer ones or layer twos it will still go through right so it's almost like account abstraction types of techniques and then on top of it very simple uh kind of monitoring tools sdks that developers actually interact with right so that's what we've been thinking about at axler is like what does the stack needs to look like what are the different layers and it's a lot more than just you know kind of pairwise protocols how does a chain a talk to chain B this is just one of the components that needs to be built along the way and you said axillar is an interoperability Network it is a blockchain blockchain network it's a blockchain network itself yeah it's been designed though to move information across other networks so it is meant to service cross-chain composability interoperability it's not meant to be a blockchain in of itself kind of like how Bitcoin and ethereum are what is a blockchain meant to serve other blockchains exactly yeah it's it's services to scale interoperability right so we actually just announced yesterday that we're going to be launching a virtual machine on Axel or not with the purpose of building applications but to help you manage new connections to help you manage your application deployments across other chains so you can think of it as a service network its job was to help the ecosystem be more united for main class listeners that are familiar with like the Cosmos app chain mesh mess chain Network how is actual are similar or or different to that how does that fit in yeah so Cosmos has traditionally been powered by kind of ABC protocol right so IBC protocol you can think of it as a pairwise protocol that tells us how you and I can talk to one another right right but whenever we're talking about interoperability it's really like this full stack that we have to think about from a perspective of developers and users right and so pairwise connectivity and the protocols beyond that is just one piece of it but then there are all these other things like how does routing happen across you know hundreds of networks right how does the gas Services work across networks how do you build an application to actually leverage these protocols in a simple and efficient way and so those are the things that we're talking about I think one of the kind of lessons that we learned throughout the last year working a lot of developers is that not a lot actually building an inner chain but they're all thinking about it right right it's actually hard to build and it's uh and so we're thinking about how to make it easier right and so with kind of the solutions around the actual Network that's always the goal with developers in mind providing those services around the network on a recent episode we did with uh Jesse from coinbase about the base chain uh we talked a lot about the chaininess as well as we had the same conversation with the optimism team and people are like kind of getting chain fatigue yeah because there's so many changes out there and having to navigate and remember where your assets are across trains is uh was once fun and is now an encumbrance and it sounds like that's really the same kind of problem that uh axelr is going after so we have the blockchain network but then really the infrastructure on the top of it is really to to promote uh abstraction a way of all of this chaininess so we can stop being so chain focused is that kind of the perhaps the point of axolar and also the interoperability Summit that we're here at today yeah absolutely I certainly think that for us as an ecosystem to scale we have to have more and more chains okay like we have to isolate resources we have to make sure applications can customize their deployments and things like that but from a user perspective it's kind of impossible to interact with all of them like you said and we've seen it throughout the last you know bull cycle right where people kind of are flipping within different walls figuring out how to get gas on one chain to another just to execute a single transaction and we actually lose a lot of adoption as an industry because of that sure and so I think figuring out the right abstractions figuring out how do we change the developer experience how to change the user experience to abstract all of this away is the goal right in the same way as you build an application like in the cloud today whether or not you put it in AWS Cloud you know Microsoft Azure Cloud other clouds other networks can still interact with the application right people from different regions different geographers can still access your application but that's not the case today in the blockchain space today you deploy it and you only have distribution for that Network and for that users we need to connect it it gives us better distribution better ux at the end of the day yeah I'm seeing a lot of similarities between what's going on on top of the like ethereum Layer Two space yeah we like the optimism super chain is this same kind of vibe where we're like many many chains but also mainly standards and abstraction layers to make that just one seamless experience exactly Cosmos is trying to do the same thing sounds like axlr is also trying to do that between all the networks and I'm really seeing just kind of a meta shift in towards this focal point of more chains but less complexity yeah that kind of seems to be what this focus of this interoperability Summit is here today for bankless listeners that weren't able to make it here today what would they have I've walked away with or what would you have hoped they had walked away with if they had attended what lessons have you learned and what conversations have you had that you were thought were valuable and overall just again for people that weren't able to make it what should they have walked away with if they were here yeah so I think from a developer's perspective back to your point I think a lot of developers are kind of tired of thinking about what you need to think about right and so I think kind of uh what we're trying to say okay let's start to think interchained all together right new developer abstractions new developer programs new way of building applications and so you know I think the whole conference is going to be recorded so it's going to be accessible on YouTube you can see some of the workshops you can see a lot of the folks that are building around the interoperable future sdks you know Stacks that have been built and kind of start to think interchange right I think we have to solve this problem to continue scaling as an industry if we don't I think you know we're not going to be able to attract more users and so I'm really really positively excited to see all the different ecosystems that previously been kind of fighting against each other right in some sense it becoming more and more united to understand that you know it's good to have whatever 20 000 developers that shuffle from one ecosystem to another but it'll be much better if we can attract many more thousands of developers to the ecosystem to actually solve real problems certainly well Sergey thank you so much for walking us through the the interoperability Summit and also hosting it in the first place thanks for coming by if listeners want to learn more where should they go where's the top of the funnel yeah so uh a you can go to interruptsama.com you'll be able to find a lot of speakers and kind of panels from it you can learn more about axler axler.network and take it from there cool thank you so much thanks for having me cheers foreign
