there's a lot of polarization and i get it but i think the more that we can try to understand each other and see where the other person is coming from the other group is coming from um the more valuable that will be so that's what i would say to society is trying to understand each other better which is so easy right and in terms of individuals i think like really education and this is once again a bias that i have but education is literally the most powerful tool that there is like the more that you know about the world the more prepared you're going to be for certain things the more that you're going to understand what's going on around you and that really helps to to combat i think maybe nervousness or anxiety around the future because like there's an element of this stuff that you just can't control right like i i can't stop russia from invading ukraine and it makes me kind of sad that i can't but i can make content around it and other people can make content around it and consume information around it and i think the more that you're able to learn the more powerful that that is going to be for your own decision making process
