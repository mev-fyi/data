[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david how are you doing today i'm doing absolutely fantastic ryan we had haseeb qureshi on the bankless podcast i am the son of an urban planner my dad's an urban planner and haseeb reminds me of an urban planner and so we we get haseb on who wrote this fantastic article about ethereum 2 and how the landscape of ethereum 2.0 will kind of stratify and separate into you know a downtown manhattan area and urban urban and suburban lands and then also farmlands and it was a really great piece that kind of triggered our our interest in getting hasib on we also talked a ton about automated market makers una swap curve balancer and how these uh applications these systems really are at the heart of crypto and why they are so revolutionary and different and what they really have to offer ryan what was your favorite part about this episode you know what i don't know if i like the first half or the second half better because they were both awesome right so in the first half we talked about automated market makers and if it's never clicked in for you like what uniswap actually is and why it's powerful and why it's grown to like you know 30 billion in annualized volume over the past few months i think this will make it clear i think you'll get a clear understanding based on the way haseeb explains it also a lot of people do not have a vision of what ev2 looks like they know abstractly that it's coming and it's this thing for ethereum but hasseb's analogy where we talk about cities and the suburbs and the farms like nails it at least for me i have a very clear vision of what eth2 with 64 different main chain shards will look like and that's really exciting i tend to think probably like you do with like i think in analogy and i think in like kind of imagery and pictures and this just paints the pictures on both automated market makers and eth2 hassep is just a fantastic communicator and then we finished off the conversation with an is eth money or is it not money conversation which is always a good conversation to have because getting people's varying perspective on that answer is always how we come to the true answer of whether eath is going to be money or not or what that even means absolutely yeah it was it was a good take by hasid there and i actually probably agree with many of the things that he said in the way in the language he used more than disagree so it's definitely an interesting conversation david before we get into the interview we should talk about our sponsors the first sponsor i want to tell you about is ave ave is a defy protocol that you absolutely have to check out what can you do with it you can lend you can borrow banklessly all on ethereum so you could do things like lend dye to the protocol it will magically transform that die into an interest bearing diet account not just die all sorts of crypto assets on ethereum you can also borrow against it um ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well and they've recently released avonomics which is their token economics upgrade you can read more about it we will include a link in the show notes so avenomics grants key decision making to ave token holders it creates more safety and economic incentives to reward critical growth one of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked ave becomes a collateral of last resort you can find out about ave avonomics start using the protocol at ave.com that's aave.com for those of you that have been transacting on ethereum you've noticed that the gas prices have just been insanely high you know 60 way on a good day and sometimes all the way up to a hundred way which is really reducing the amount of activities that is really feasible to be able to do on ethereum this is where our newest sponsor loopring comes in loopering is a zk roll up scaling protocol for ethereum for both trading and for payments zk rollups that stands for zero knowledge rollups it's basically cryptographic magic it allows you to combine activity and transactions into one single bit of information which means that massive amounts of transactions can be bundled into a very small chunk of information which reduces the gas per transaction at loopering.io you can find a zk rollups based exchange and also a payment mechanism all with the same security guarantees of the ethereum l1 blockchain which is really important so loopering and zk rollups allows you to scale up transactions tradings payments into thousands and thousands of transactions per second but with the same security guarantees of the main ethereum blockchain which is just incredible in september loopring is releasing the loop ring wallet this will be a mobile smart contract wallet with zk roll ups tucked in natively i'm really excited for how this is going to impact the adoption of ethereum the rest of the world will be able to experience venmo type transactions but with the same amount of truthlessness and security of the decentralized future ahead of us so if you're a trader that's being eaten alive by gas fees visit loopering.io to get onboarded into ethereum's cheapest and fastest exchange all it requires is an ethereum address and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free and transferring ether and erc20 tokens on the platform is completely free if you visit loopering.io enter the code bankless in order to get the highest vip tier for six months so check that out there's a link in the show notes visit loopering.io enter code bankless alright guys let's go ahead and get right into the interview with haseeb qureshi of dragonfly capital bankless nation we are so excited to have on the podcast hasib qureshi he is a partner at dragonfly capital formerly worked at metastable another crypto fund he was a dev formerly at airbnb so he's got some technical background he also has some pro poker playing background i've heard a ton of intros to see if he's got a you know very interesting eclectic resume and the way he got into this space was interesting as well haseeb you are one of my favorite thinkers and investors in this space welcome to the bankless podcast sir thank you and thank you for having me you know what we're just we're not going to do this like we do typical podcast episodes and do kind of intro and everything like that we're going to get right into the meat here um you had a really fascinating tweet i think uh it might have been a month ago six weeks ago and it and it went like this it was what's the big intellectual miss you've had in crypto within the last year and then you talked about yours which was uh missing decentralized exchanges in particular missing automated market makers i want to get into automated market makers in just a minute and like maybe explain that run through it but can you talk about why you tweeted that why is it important to talk about the the intellectual misses that uh we've had in crypto as investors yeah i i think crypto is such a weird industry in which to be investing because it just evolves so [ __ ] quickly that as an investor you you need to be changing your mind every year or two about your fundamental understanding of how the space works like there are so many things that i believed in 2017 that i didn't believe in 2015 and there's so many things i believe today that i didn't believe in 2017 and i'm sure that two years from now many of my assumptions and mental models are also going to get invalidated so you just you have to constantly be willing to change your mind and to listen to what the industry is telling you um and so anybody anybody i know who's thinking very deeply about the space who's coming up with theses and mental models of how these things work some of that stuff is going to be wrong and the worst mistake you can make is not to notice that your mind has changed that i think is the is the biggest possible error you can make your hyper investing because it's one thing to be wrong everybody is going to be wrong about a lot of stuff um but the biggest thing is to not learn from the fact that hey you incorrectly predicted how this thing was going to turn out and kind of do do a little bit of intellectual postmortem on yourself right of like what did you miss why did you get that one wrong for me amms were the big miss for me i was a big bear on dexes in 2017 and my whole theory on why dexes were not going to work was beyond the obvious stuff of just like performance and fees and blah blah the big the big thesis that i had about why dexes weren't going to work was because of the huge amount of adverse selection on deficits so if you look at you know you remember like ether delta and fork delta back in the day the the assets that were getting traded on these exchanges most of the trading volume was in really low quality assets so it was in the really crappy stuff that basically would never get listed on a binance or on a coinbase or whatever it was all the lemons basically exactly exactly a long tail of assets it was the long tail of like obvious securities or like kind of shady tokens or you know uh you know like spank coin and stuff like that like that was the kind of thing that was really thriving on uh ether delta and the other decentralized exchanges and it seemed very difficult for it to break out of that loop right like that it's like okay great this this exchange is going to get known for listing and trading the stuff that nobody else is willing to trade that is not a strong like that's obviously not a strong place from which to build a really significant market uh and so i basically wrote off dexes and i remember having a lot of conversations with people back in 2017 who were very excited about xerox and you know on-chain exchanges and idecs and all this stuff and i basically wrote off the entire category because i thought this is just a fundamental problem that isn't going to go away if anything is really valuable it's going to get listed on a centralized exchange and then people are going to trade it there and liquidity begets liquidity and liquidity the network effect right like i mean all these really obvious arguments and i i missed what amms could do to change that equation and that's been that's been a real educational process for me is trying to trying to sort of do the five wise excavation on why did amms win in d5 all right so let's dig into that so um i'll confess like i missed it too like i saw uniswap and i saw it as an interesting project but at the time i would not have predicted the success and the rapid success that it has seen but uh you've you've written an article about this um that kind of explains the rise of automated market makers and for folks that have listed the bankless podcast for a while we'll include some other episodes where we explain automated market makers in the show notes and what those are the unit swaps of the world but i've actually heard people in the bagless community tell me has seen that they didn't truly understand amms until they read your article like you articulated it in a fantastic simple way maybe you could articulate it for us uh here like what the heck are amms we've called the money robots we've called them you know constant function market makers but like what are they explain it like i'm five explain it like you're five okay well i i don't think five-year-olds know what market makers are so that might be a little bit but but i'll i'll explain it i'll explain it like you're you know uh like you're like you're a financial newbie but you know some of the basics good deal so sorry five-year-olds yeah yeah you're trying to drop off so so basically in amm so when i say an amm i'm really i'm going to be describing it as one because it's the easiest to explain and to understand you know so every market maker uh their job is to provide liquidity for to a market basically they are willing to buy or sell an asset whatever it is that you want and they're always willing to put you a price or usually always win a bunch of price and the critical question for any market maker uh is how do they price those assets so let's say i've got you know the example that i give in the in the article is let's say that i've got some apples and i've got some bananas and that's the currency of our weird little fruitarian universe and i i'm willing to buy apples for bananas or i'm willing to buy apples or won't buy bananas for apples okay and what i need to decide is what is the exchange rate that i'm going to offer you based on how much you want and what is in my inventory so there are lots of different ways that you can do this right like you could you know if you're a real market maker what real market makers do is they like look at the big fruit exchanges and they look at like what's the exchange rate and they try to figure out you know can i if i if i buy this from you can i go arbitrage it on a real exchange what's the liquidity what's the volatility all this stuff they're trying to figure out these like 100 different dimensions that go into some big model that decide how they quote a price to an end user right this this is what market making is and it happens every single day on exchanges all over the world in crypto and outside of crypto it's the oldest thing in the world so amms are a way to create a completely like you said a robotic algorithmic market maker that lives entirely on chain basically meaning that it has a very simple formula that decides how it buys and how it sells all on chain and all of its inventory meaning all the apples and bananas that it owns so that it can buy and sell to people all that also lives on chain except it's not apples and bananas ethios dc or whatever how does uniswap actually work and the answer is probably a lot easier to read and to see a visual metaphor for this rather than try to hear it explained then through audio but just for the sake of completeness what uniswap uses is it uses a pricing function called the constant product pricing function and basically it means this so i i have some apples and i have some bananas when you multiply those two together the number of apples multiplied by the number of bananas let's say i have 50 apples and 50 bananas uh actually let's make it easy let's make it 10 and 10. let's say i have 10 apples i have 10 bananas multiply these two together you get 100 right and so the rule in uniswop is that the the product of my apples and my bananas no matter whether i'm buying or changing the amount of apples versus bananas in inventory the product of those two numbers must always be equal to the same value so it started with a hundred it has to always be a hundred so if i let's say that i then uh let's say that i then sell five bananas um so i'm gonna have five bananas less right if i have five bananas i need to figure out how many apples i'm gonna charge for those bananas well we said the rule is that it needs to still equal 100. so 5 times x is equal to 100. solve for that the answer is 20. 5 times 20 equals 100. so i need 20 bananas which means i need to charge uh because i originally had 10 minutes i need to charged another 10 bananas to sell you five apples okay that was a mouthful probably hard to follow that verbally but if you read the article it's easy easier to understand visually and so basically what that results in is most of the time uniswap given this very simple pricing curve if people are buying relatively small amounts is going to give you a pretty good price but the more that somebody buys and the more lopsided the market maker's inventory becomes the worse and worse price is going to give you um so that's how uniswap works in a nutshell and it sort of automatically tries to rebalance itself by basically doing what i just said right like if it if it's inventory gets too imbalanced then it starts quoting more and more ridiculous prices going one way and more and more generous prices going back towards equilibrium so it's almost like this like rubber band is pulling uniswap or pulling in this automated market maker back towards the equilibrium of trying to have balanced bananas and apples in the pool assuming that the real exchange rate of bananas and apples is one to one so that's you just swap in a nutshell there's way more that we can talk about but like honestly it's it's uh it's not the easiest thing to understand from uh listening to it from somebody just talking you're here but that provides me a way to buy one apple without you know the thing i'm trying to avoid which is a bad price you know market makers would call this slippage but it does not provide me a way to buy say 50 because if i buy 50 what's going to happen to me so if you buy 50 well so the example i amended it was 10 apples in inventory right so if you want to buy all 10 apples you want to sell out the market maker one of the properties of unit swap of course is that it must always be willing to approach you a price so if i want to so you can just do the math right like so 10 times 10 will equal 100. if i want all 10 of the apples then 0 times x has to equal 100. so then you have to divide by z you're basically going to divide by zero which means that literally it's charging infinite in order to get in so you you cannot buy all of the inventory in unit swap that's one of the rules of ninoswap is that as you start buying up more and more and more and more of its inventory as the inventory gets arbitrarily small the price gets arbitrarily high and so you know if you want to buy uh you know 9.9 apples like uniform is going to charge you some [ __ ] absurd price you're charging like you know 10 000 bananas in order to buy 9.9 apples or something you know in order to make the math work and some people may think this is a flaw right because you know apples will never really cost infinity dollars that will never that's not a realistic scenario however it is important for this primitive which is uniswap to be able to price things in such a wide uh such a wide discrepancy and and it's largely also just a function of needing to be able to count for like the different uh decimal places or or supplies of tokens that are on ethereum where i can go mint you know 10 trillion tokens and then supply them for over one ether and you know it looks like that that market is completely uh off balance but that's just because of a function of the the decimal place for that particular unit and so it's actually really important that this uh the automated market maker model can price things out to infinity because it allows for any token to be able to fit somewhere in that curve it doesn't really matter what the decimal where the decimal was placed or where the supply was initially created yes absolutely now that said uh since the invention of uniswap there has been an explosion in different kinds of amms that use different kinds of curves so you know the the amm uh the unit swap curve is this x times y equals k so the two assets multiplied together equals a fixed constant this is called the constant product pricing curve um but there's a but there's a bunch of other ones that people have come up with so there's one called curve which is now this mixture of constant product and constant sum which a lot which is better for stable coins or for mean reverting assets uh there's one you know the balancer uses kind of arbitrary uh sort of kind of constant product but across arbitrarily many uh uh or uh pairs so not just not just sort of two assets together and then there's foundation and actually foundation uses a variant of unit swap that actually can run out of inventory because the foundation what it does is it tries to sell limited edition goods and uh if you're if you're selling goods like let's say i'm selling like t-shirts right and i'm like signing each of these t-shirts or whatever uh well i actually do want all of the inventory to get drained at some point like i want i want to sell out like that's kind of the point if you're selling assets um so for you know if i'm selling apples and bananas maybe i want to make sure the the amm never runs out but for other amms actually maybe it's completely reasonable that the amm should at some point run out of inventory because when it does you know what happens is just okay well all that's left is profits that can be they can be taken you know the fees that were generated by the pool can be taken out and then other people can come in and recapitalize the pool so there's no uh issue in principle with a with an amn uh running out of inventory uh but it just so happens that that you know most of the amms today balancer uniswap and uh curve they are designed to never run out of inventory so one of the there's a few things about the amm model that formalizes different market participants and i see the efficiency of the amm model comes from this formalization so in in the old world in the world of order based uh exchanges uh or just the order book model you have market makers and you have traders and they're kind of just lumped together like they have different behaviors but they're really this the same participant they're they're all looking at the same exchange they're all doing the same thing in the amm model they have been placed into two different buckets and that's actually where a large amount of efficiency comes because the market makers can are their job is much more simple which is to simply supply put deposit assets into a contract where on the order book model uh you they uh the market makers have to actually do things they have to actually engage in activities right and that actually requires like actions over and over and over again and the when the amm model has just relegated this to a a money robot right where you just deposit your money and then the algorithm takes care of that that for you and what really is innovative about this is that uh it turns going from a peer-to-peer model which we like we like the terms peer-to-peer but in terms of exchange that's actually relatively slow and it goes from it goes to a peer-to-contract model uh are you i'm assuming you're familiar with the term peer to contract yes yeah can you go into the peer-to-contract model what that is and then just the implications behind a peer to contract model versus a peer-to-peer model so in a peer-to-peer model the idea is that you know you can sort of imagine like let's say there's 10 000 people who all want to trade right and in order for those 10 000 people to all want to trade each of them needs to get matched up on the other side you can imagine left side and right side of your you know imaginary wallpaper here uh 10 000 people on the left side if you're doing a peer-to-peer model you need those 10 000 people to somehow get matched up on the right side and to get this big web of connections all going together to match them up with people who are taking the opposite side of the trade and while in principle like that makes sense and that's how most exchanges in the real world work and how most crisis company works trying to translate that into an on-chain environment basically means lots and lots and lots of transactions lots of gas costs lots of people having to to you know post orders and take orders and fill orders and uh there's there's an enormous amount of complexity that's to be foisted on chain and it wasn't obvious three years ago that that was going to be a big constraint but in the pure contract model it looks a little bit different so you have the ten thousand traders on the left side but on the right side you just have a single contract and everybody on the left side is just talking to this single contract you can imagine this like big web of like a thousand threads all pointing to one node uh and that and that's this one or a curve or balancer and in this world it's a one it's it's much more uh transaction and gas efficient there are many fewer things that need to happen on chain when everybody is just talking to a single contract and the second thing of course is that the the liquidity uh meaning like the amount of capital that actually needs to get locked up in the orders and put in different places it's much easier for all that to get aggregated in one place and the network effect of hey here's where all the money is and therefore here's where all the liquidity for trading is it's very easy for that to not get splintered into a bunch of different places so you don't have to worry about oh well you know am i going to find this token on ether delta or on idacs or on radar relay or on this thing or that thing uh instead it's like look unit swap is just like the natural point of convergence for all of the liquidity that that wants to coagulate onto each usdc or you know whatever are the big markets in crypto um uniswap has sort of served as this national shelling point for all of that it's it's the other thing that i think is also very different about providing liquidity to uniswap versus providing liquidity in a peer-to-peer model is that of course providing liquidity in a peer-to-peer model on an order book uh your the peers need to themselves be very active in putting up that liquidity the makers the people who are actually putting up the orders uh they need to be constantly deciding okay what exchange i'm going to put the order on when am i going to put it on how am i going it's a very active process to do that market makers generally charge money for the obligation to provide liquidity on your platform and if it's not worth it to them if it's not profitable for them to do so then they're going to charge you a lot of money because it's not in their interest to just do it anyway uh whereas with uniswap it's incredibly easy you just click one button you send a transaction and boom now you're providing capital to the market and this sort of one click set it and forget it experience that near swap has created that has been i think a big boom to making the uniswap market more and more liquid and thus more and more competitive with other alternatives for for uh trading some of these assets so i think we've seen unit swap just become the shelling point of liquidity and especially over the last like month or so where unit swap volumes have started to really get competitive with centralized exchange uh volumes right and so uh is it where does the role in a world where the amm model really just takes over and it kind of positions itself as kind of a center point of ethereum and and liquidity on ethereum what what is left for the world of the order book model like is does the order book model still provide something useful or is it kind of just inferior in in every way so i don't think the order book model is dead i i believe personally that the the dominance of amms has really resulted from the extraordinary constraints of ethereum 1.0 basically if you're if you're constrained to highly expensive transactions uh you know sort of not a lot of computation that you can do per unit time um and you know all the other things that we understand about what makes ethereum fairly difficult right like being being a maker on ethereum if you're actually posting transactions on chain continually to an order book uh that that is just very expensive and it doesn't really work well for the model that that uh ethereum ethereum uses and so of course most of the order book exchanges that we see today are using off chain order books that then get only only settlement really happens on chain so dydx idex most of the most of the order book exchanges that we see today they actually host their order books off chain so there there are a couple things that i think are important to understand about why order books have not been successful in ethereum and what would make them successful so the first thing is that right now order books are too expensive and if they're too expensive and you can basically get lower trading fees and better liquidity through amnes then people people are going to they're about to do that um which which is is unsurprising in some sense right like an amm um an amm is almost like the otc desk experience basically says like look instead of us going on an exchange and having all these complicated moving parts of you know orders and limit orders and and you know these these various different kinds of trading types which are very difficult to implement you have to worry about gas costs have to worry about settlement time to worry about trusting the coordinator all that stuff you know the coordinator itself like they might be operating in exchange or is that illegal what do they need to do in order to protect themselves there's all this complexity that goes into running an order order book exchange on ethereum today and if you're willing to do all that [ __ ] why not just run a centralized exchange and like make your life a lot easier right so to that end uh i think order book exchanges have a much more difficult time competing today and so uniform kind of just looks like an otc desk it's basically like hey come here tell me what you want i'll fill it using using some set of rules right and it's unsurprising that the otc desk experience is simpler and it's easier to implement and there's less moving parts and it works better in a very constrained environment but there are two things i think that will change that one is that there's going to be of course more scaling solutions on top of ethereum so talking about layer twos you can talk about you know uh interoperability solutions like polka dot or cosmos and of course there are other layer ones that are i'm sure we'll get to talking about this other ones that uh want to you know sort of build bridges with ethereum and take on some of the ethereum overflow traffic uh so that's that's one thing is that the scalability constraint is going to at some point get ameliorated but the second thing is that uh uniswap works very well for certain assets and works less well for other assets so what i mean by that so one is that derivatives which i think are a big thing that that uniswap or the trading demand in crypto is going to increase for uh already in centralized exchanges derivatives account for the vast majority of crypto trading volume relative spot uniform works reasonably well for spot trading but it's not particularly well suited for trading derivatives and a large part of the reason for that is that derivatives uh because the fact that they're often traded with very high leverage uh it's they're extremely sensitive to relatively small changes in the in the price and they need fast liquidations right your ability to get highly leveraged is contingent on your ability to unwind a very highly leveraged position in a time of high volatility that's what constrains you from being able to offer 2x leverage to 5x leverage to 10x leverage to 50x leverage to you know bitmex 100x leverage um nothing on chain today can offer 100x leverage it's just absolutely impossible because the amount of capital you need to liquidate would be way way too much for you to do in a reasonable amount of time on on ethereum today and that's one of the reasons why you know uh you just that kind of thing would not work through a pure amm model amms aren't sensitive enough to quick changes in price and volatility uh order books are designed exactly for this right the ability to cancel orders move orders around to totally reshape the the shape of liquidity in a market that's why order books are exist the way that they do right like if you look at an order book and you see the buy the shape of the buys and the shape of the cells those are that's a price curve but it's a price curve that's rapidly changing in real time responding to real-time volatility uh that is very important if volatility is really really big and leverage is really really high but in a world that which is very low leverage such as if you're trading stable points or if you're trading you know ethiospc spot market then uh trading trading just you know through an amm for spot works totally fine so i think these two variables are the biggest things that are going to drive more demand for order books in crypto trading uh but it's very clear that that stuff is probably not going to work today on ethereum 1.0 given how incredibly congested ethereum 1.0 is yeah we definitely want to get to the topic of congestion on ethereum 1.0 and charting and scaling and all that but to get to tie off this this amm conversation is the order book the order books in amms are kind of like opposite ends of the spectrum but is there like a room or a potential for these two um these two mechanisms to have like some sort of elegant marriage where there is an order book that is based on top of an amm is that a reasonable thing or is this more like oil and water so it's possible in principle right you can imagine an amm that uh you know amms you often see this this uh smooth price curve right you can imagine an amm where uh in the middle of this price curve somebody decides hey you know what i'm gonna set a limit order and i'm willing to buy uh you know five thousand uh uscc at this exact price of e right and you can imagine if you if you sort of juxtapose that onto the curve of the mm what you would see is in fact the amm goes up to that point of that limit order and then suddenly there's a flat line where you know basically any trading volume is eating into that limit order and then the curve continues after the limit order's email does that make sense are you guys seeing the sort of the it's almost like a single shape thing that goes back to being curved at the end of that limit order um you could do that that totally works and makes sense in principle as being a way to intersperse limit orders with an amm now the question of course is like okay well so on the curved part of the trading volume the liquidity providers to the amm are getting the fees right on the flat parts the people who are providing the limit orders get the fees right because they're posting orders basically to an order book exchange and so you can imagine like having a an order book slash amm hybrid that some parts of it are curved but in between there are these like jagged parts that are the limit orders and anything in between is getting filled by by ams so it sounds kind of cool but i personally don't believe that this is a stable equilibrium and why do i say that i say that because i think what would end up happening is that the limit orders would all center around the the they would basically all center around the the true price right so let's say the true price of each usdc just for simplicity let's say it's 100 right and that's the true price and so basically a bunch of people would be willing to put limit orders at a hundred dollars and so you get this really flat portion of the curve right at 100 right just this big long flat line a bunch of people are willing to buy and sell and take a point three percent fee but then once all of this liquidity gets eaten up and people want to keep buying past this point well then the people with limit orders are kind of like wait wait hold on if you guys if you're buying past that something might have moved in the price right like something weird is going on somebody is buying tons and tons and tons of of of eath thinking that somehow it's like super cheap that must mean that eat this pumping out in the real world and that suddenly you know uh i'm i was mispricing myself and so what what what's gonna happen is that uh when you start eating into the uni-swap curve and you're no longer in limit order land uh what's happening is that you're just getting pure and permanent loss right only the the trading all around the mid-market price is happening through limit orders and the trading uh farther up the curve is just like big volatility moves that are getting that are basically screwing over the the uniswap lps and so i think what would happen is that you end up getting this ad again this sort of uh this this tug of war where all the good fees the good trading which is around them the market price gets eaten up by the limit orders and all the bad trading which is just like you know uh uh getting run over by uh by bad pricing uh that is going to be even by the united swap lps the units of lps will drop their liquidity because they're not losing money and basically you devolve into an order book that's my theory of what happens when you try to combine the two but of course that only really works if like the limit orders are can be you know withdrawn and placed fast enough for this whole thing to work and make sense um which only really works if like the gas fees aren't insane for people to pull it to to add the liquidity and to pull the liquidity and to do the kind of stuff that people do in limit order land um and so it's kind of like when that's too expensive for it to make sense people aren't just gonna people just aren't gonna provide limit orders at all because it's just too expensive for them to manage their limit orders on this exchange uh but once they do and once it starts becoming profitable for them to do that then you're gonna get this very quick move into this other equilibrium where it's all limit orders and no uh no programmatic curve-based liquidity that's my theory well i mean all these theories need to be tested of course but um that that theory seems to match some of the contours or the constraints let's call them of ethereum and of blockchain which like that appears to be why automated market makers have been so successful right back to your point i think you used the term that uh ethereum has the computing power of a decentralized graphing calculator right now right i thought that was a very colorful way to put it but um you know play your strengths right so what are the strengths of ethereum it's global pooled state it's completely permissionless low regulatory surface it's programmable infinitely what are its weaknesses there's no price oracle you have no idea on chain what the price of something is low throughput is obviously a weakness as well and that's why you've got something like automated market makers succeeding on ethereum but i want to ask a question so in traditional finance is there any kind of analog to this like are automated market makers do they exist in the traditional finance world at all and we we talk so often about um define you know crypto is basically replicating all of traditional finance over time right maybe a much accelerated rate making it digital making it programmable is there anything like a uniswap in the analog world i mean in a sense there is in that you know if you ask like you know are there programmatic market makers today yes of course there are you know like most market makers today who are you know trading on stock exchanges and you know filling orders in fractions of you know like fractions of seconds they are almost entirely run by algorithms but those algorithms are not publicly viewable they are not easy to manipulate or i mean obviously people try to manipulate these algorithms but they're not trivial to manipulate and so in some sense like yes absolutely this is this has precedent right like most market making today is algorithmic you can't see the algorithm and the algorithm moves and updates much faster and it takes in a lot more inputs so there's a bunch of machine learning and there's looking at you know order books and modeling liquidity and all the stuff that goes in inputs to this algorithmic pricing when you hit some api and actually request a quote um but the the difference is really one of degree not one of kind i think yeah that makes sense all right so let's talk about unit swap versus other curves right so we talked a lot about the specific way uh uniswap sort of calculates its price curve is uniswap the final answer on automated market makers like will everything network effect pool into uniswap or are there places for other curves we've called this before like the you know the automated market maker uh robot wars where one curve fights another curve and they're all in this big battle for you know a bunch of liquidity is that how you see it i think this is this is right uh to some extent in that it's pretty clear that there's going to be a lot of competition among price curves that are better and better suited for the particular assets that are being traded right so in a way uniswap you can sort of imagine unit swap with always using this x times y equals k price curve basically implies like look i don't know absolutely anything about how these two assets should be trading relative to each other right so it's sort of the the no knowledge assumption so sort of zero prior about how these two things should be traded relative to each other but if you know something about how these two assets should be trading relative to each other then in principle you should always be able to do better than your swap at least to some extent right so if you know for example that this these two assets are less volatile relative to each other than the average pair of assets then of course you should be able to get a tighter pricing curve than uniswap and do better right and of course if you know these two assets are especially volatile or they're especially inverse correlated relative to each other then perhaps you should create an even more aggressive pricing curve that has even more slippage than your swap does you swap is sort of like this goldilocks thing that basically doesn't make any assumption that it's kind of good for everybody probably hopefully but as the universe of amms opens up and more and more people innovate in particular amms that are designed uh sort of hand-crafted for particular markets then of course you're gonna get better pricing so you know the way that the way i think the clearest way to think about it is that what unit swap really ought to be doing is emulating what real professional market makers do right so they're real professional market makers who mark and make on binance and on coinbase and on all these exchanges and they decide how they're going to price things for different orders right and very often you know they're like otc desks that will get an order from somebody to say hey i want to buy you know uh you know five thousand each some huge order right and they're going to decide okay i'm looking at exchanges i'm looking at what else is out there and i'm decide for you i'm going to tell you look here's my quote uh and then let's execute it right so uniswap the ideal version of an amm should really be closer and closer to if you actually did the your homework right and you actually asked that otc desk or all the otc does and you average what does their pricing curve look like if i ask you for one eighth or ten eight or a thousand or ten thousand each right like what does it what is the shape of that curve you want uh uh the ideal version of uniform would have as close of a curve to that real optimal market maker as possible right now of course that's not possible in principle because that real optimal market maker is taking in a lot of inputs that aren't available on chain but insofar as you can closer and closer emulate that real market maker you're becoming more and more competitive with the sort of final form of what an arbitrarily unconstrained market maker would be able to do so uh now one very obvious thing you can do is just get a sort of more price competitive curve so curve curved rfi uh that is the uh it uses this thing called the stable swap curve which is a mixture of constant product and constant sum but long story short what it does is it is it gives you a very flat part of the curve near uh one to one which basically implies that the two assets in the pool probably should be worth about the same and in a very large band of potential trading volumes or balances of inventory really they should be priced around the same you should be priced very close to each other and you don't want to offer a lot of slippage until the trades start getting really really big and that makes sense because you expect if it's you know usdc and usdt those two should probably trade really close in line to each other because you know a bunch of those two assets yeah they're supposed to be worth the same but i think in general this this march of more and more intelligence being baked into the curve that that trend is going to continue but i think it can go even even more broad than than just choosing a curve there there you can imagine other inputs that you could take into the market to determine uh not just the the you know the two assets that you have in the pool how much of x and how much y do i have which is right now the way that all of these assets are being priced using amms but you can imagine using other signals as well to make you determine in real time how you're going to change your price right because that's what real market makers do real market makers that are actually competing in the largest markets in the world they take in lots of inputs in order to decide what the real price should be more than just knowing what their inventory is and so they look at other order books they look at volatility they look at all this other stuff right so you can imagine a real another market maker that would start taking in readings of volatility and if an asset is particularly volatile like let's say we're like in a black thursday scenario right and like things are going off like crazy and uh you know coins are dropping in price and suddenly you don't want to be offering anywhere near the level of you know the generosity of of quotes that you were offering before now you want to really start blowing out your spreads and really start offering really bad slippage because the market's moving fast and you don't want to be giving away a lot of money right now in a situation like that you can imagine a an oracle that's a uh that that sort of gives you some reading of volatility and tells you hey guys market situation is getting worse let's make the curve more aggressive right now and alternatively you know we had we had a good period of time when volatility was really low before this recent you know uh d5 bull run uh and in a period of low volatility you might say hey you know what normally with ustc eth we quote x times y equals k but it's really low volatility right now prices haven't been moving much let's just start flattening out the curve a little bit and offer lower slippage right and so you can imagine all sorts of different inputs that you could be taking in to determine the way in which you're changing your pricing curve and i think we're going to see more and more innovations around amm design that allow more mutations of the the way in which you do pricing based on these other external signals let's talk a bit more about some of those next generation maybe i don't know if the term is used anywhere as he but like smart automated market makers um you tweeted out something about like i just i just got this recently about a smart amm of the type i think you're describing called dodo maybe do do um and uh that is an automated market maker whose curve receives like updates in real time based on some third-party oracle right um or external oracle i'm not sure whether it's a non-chain oracle or an external oracle is this the kind of thing you're talking about like how does something like dodo work so yes so this is exactly the kind of thing i'm talking about so dodo is a is an amm that basically or you could call it an smm if you want to be cute about it um dodo is an smm that you know what i like that term i'm going to start co-opting here we did it we just me and we created a new meme right here bankless podcast that's what we do dodo is an smm and the way the dota works is that uh so here's kind of the uh the abstract problem you can imagine that dota's trying to solve so uh let's say your unit swap your mid-market price is x and you know we talked before about like this limit limit order problem right if you're mixing limit orders and you know regular uh amm slippage like you what you really want to do at any given time is concentrate more liquidity around the mid market price because you know that like look if if the real price of eth is or if usdc is like you know uh a hundred dollars then i'm kind of you know most people are willing to provide quite a bit of liquidity at that price because i can go hedge it out on binance or whatever and you know it's perfectly fine right like i don't actually want to offer that much slippage away from the mid-market price uh the problem though is that it's very difficult for us walk to do that it's very difficult for uniswap to say you know what i'm going to take your mid-market price flatten out the curve over here and offer a lot of liquidity at this price and then once you start moving away from this then i'll start offering more slippage right why is it hard for unisoft to do that the reason why is that it's very easy to manipulate unit swap using a flashlight so or or even without a flashlight at any given time if let's say uniform had this rule that at the mid-market price you can do a lot of flat trading at the mid-market price just pay the point three percent fee but then as you get more and more then suddenly the uh the slippage starts ballooning right the problem is that what i could do is i could first move the price for some like ridiculous you know use a flashlight move the price some ridiculously high number and then do a bunch of trading at that ridiculously high number because now you've flattened out the price grab at this ridiculously high number and unisoft has no idea what the real price is unicef is just responding to like whatever's happening in in the pool right and so then i would allow a bunch of trading at this like stupid stupid price and then the flashlight could move everything back because unit swap is symmetric uh you'd get all your money back minus point six percent fees three percent of the way up and point three percent of the way down uh and then you could just basically make like a bandit away from municipal so that's why um can't do this it can't do this because unit swap does not have an oracle that it can rely on to know what the true price is if it did then it could consider flattening out the the the curve around wherever the true price is and concentrating more liquidity there this is what dodo tries to solve because you cannot use uniswap's mid-market price as an oracle or any amms mid-market prices in oracle um it's actually kind of weird to think about right because at any given time because of the way these amms work you should expect them to have the correct price within the margin of the transaction fee right why because if it didn't have the correct price then somebody could go and arbitrage it and make it in time everybody you know their kojillion bots sitting there trying to arbitrage you know swap and all these amms and so you can sort of take this as an invariant basically that at any given time any amm should have the correct price because otherwise it would have already gotten arbitrage however you cannot rely on it because the moment you rely on it you're going to get [ __ ] because somebody is going to manipulate the price in a split moment move the price way out of line and then [ __ ] so it's all it's like this weird quantum thing where it's like it is the price is always correct except when you're looking um and so you can never use the the amm itself as a price oracle unless you're using like a t-wap which is kind of you know what what uh yourself is doing but even that is like kind of individual uh but to a lesser extent so what dodo does is says look we can't use our main record prices in oracle but we still want to concentrate liquidity around the shoe price and so we're going to do is we're going to use an external oracle that is not like a like a uni-swap style oracle and so what happens you know let's say they're using chain link chain link gives an update every 20 minutes and or every 0.5 change in price and so every 20 minutes and or 0.5 change in price you can start to flatten out the curve flatten out liquidity around that point because that you know is not going to get manipulated insofar as you believe that chain link is not going to get manipulated um and so that is a reliable way for you to actually do the thing that most market makers do which is to flatten out liquidity at the real price and to treat the real price as like especially a a place where you want to be especially generous and offering liquidity without giving too much slippage uh so that that is the that is the idea behind dodo uh and it's an example of what we were talking about before about emulating more and more what real market makers do right they give a lot of liquidity around the true price and the farther you move away the more it's like oh [ __ ] hold on something's happening in the market we're getting bowled over maybe we should start offering more and more slippage because we don't really know what's happening right now okay this is so so that's a smart automated market maker which is fascinating at the end of your post you offered this kind of tantalizing i guess um a sequel option which uh was a post called unbundling unbundling uniswap um i'm not sure if you wrote that yeti but this is kind of what like you were talking about if i'm going to guess basically that uniswap is sort of the general purpose but all of these you know specialized amms including smart amms are going to rise up and take pieces out of the general purpose because they can succeed at something that unit swap cannot succeed at is that what she meant by unbundling unit swap was that what the post was going to be about that is a part of it but there's a lot more to that piece i'm i'm kind of that piece i hope is going to get published in the next week so i have a i have a rough draft and right now it's getting edited but it's taking me a while because crypto's been insane this month but uh in short yes but i don't want to give too much away well fantastic hopefully by the time this episode comes out that post will either be live and which we can include in the show notes or it will be on its way but it kind of appears to me that what we're sort of i guess maybe contrasting or seeing which which of the the weights is higher is there's definitely a liquidity network effect that happened with automated market makers right that's undeniable right so um part of what uniswap is doing really well is it's getting it's sucking in all of the liquidity and the more liquidity it has the lower the slippage the more liquidity it gets liquidity gets liquidity as we've said so often here um but that is you know doesn't necessarily guarantee it's going to win because the the counter ballast for that is all of these other new automated market makers are going to try to take chunks out of unit swap um because unit swap is basically a fairly you know called dumb simple automated market maker so it's almost this war against like liquidity network effects versus sort of the specialization that can be gained but you know people will come to different conclusions on how that will pan out right it's like you know amazon.com did sort of win with the general purpose e-commerce you know retail site over a you know a diapers.com and you know many other sort of specialized niches is that kind of the the battle in your mind are those the two opposing forces here sorry what what are the two opposing forces in your mind network effect versus specialization i suppose ah yes i think that's right i that said i i don't think it's necessarily correct yet that unit swap has a network effect i think i think it's a little bit too early to to call that one um and here's what i mean by this is that uniswap it clearly is successful and it has a great brand um but there's no obvious thing in principle that allows you swap to say look if you want to create the next liquidity pool you should obviously do it here that that's what a network effect is right a network effect says the bigger you grow the more of the more difficult it is to unseat you um right now if if uniswap's network effect is purely around slippage that it's offering then i think its network effect is going to be very short-lived there's really more of a scale effect than a network effect and i think in in that sense like you know something i described like dodo which does more work to concentrate more of the liquidity near the mid-market price can very quickly actually offer better slippage than than your swap can um the and so that to me does not feel like a real moat um it's certainly true however that uniform has become the natural shelling point so that you know if if you want to get quickly integrated into uh you know all the wallets and all you know and coin market cap is automatically indexing you know swap markets and you know all these different uh integrations that uniform has that is something that's not a network effect but it is obviously an advantage that they have and just being integrated into a lot of different uh in a lot of different applications to me i think there's it's still an open question how this market is going to play out so i think in the long run uh you're right the specialization network effects are the two national counterbalances but the thing that we tend to see in normal financial markets is that the the exchange venues themselves are the ones that gain network effects but individual market makers are ultimately beholden to whoever actually owns the the relationship with the customer right and so who is the customer in the sense the customer is the person trading on d5 does unison own the defy trader that's the real question i have at the end of the day right like where is the defy trader going are they going to unisop are they going to their wallet right are they just owned by coinbase wallet and when coinbase wallet has a or you know uh imtoken or whatever wallet they're using for ethereum trading uh you know are they do they have allegiance to uniswap or will they just say you know there eventually there'll be some token like buy token sell token interface that will route to the best amm on chain in which case the unit swap will just be commoditized to the extent that it offers the best price it'll get used and if it doesn't offer the best price it won't get used uh or will something like one inch or dexag or matcha will these become the things that actually own the front end of of defy and i think to me that's the really most important question if you own the customer and the customers ultimately cares about you and you're the way that they're going to interact with this universe then it doesn't really matter if anybody can offer better pricing than you because because you own them uh but if if people are only coming to you when you offer the best price then you don't have a network effect you're commoditized that is the real question that i think is is still unresolved in d5 that is the question i think we will see playing out in the in the months and the weeks and the years to come hey guys going bankless is a journey and you don't have to do it alone so here are some fantastic bankless tools from the sponsors that make this show possible as we all go westward we need to get our values into the crypto world but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent seeking institutions and that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks monolith coming soon to monolith is an on wrap directly from your old world bank account into your smart contract wallet on ethereum and for those that don't know monolith also has a defy card which uses dye in your smart contract wallet but on the visa network so you can go to your grocery store swipe your defy card pay for your groceries like a normal person and still be part of the crypto bankless cryptoeconomic future that we are all excited about so you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary which is just absolutely fantastic so in order to get started go to monolith.xyz and get your bankless visa card today i want to tell you about another bankless tool that i personally use it's fantastic this one is for our us listeners it's called rocket dollar so if you have an ira or a 401k the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage show so your fidelity account your schwab account that means you don't have good access to crypto the only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form and it's marked up like 5 x 6 x 8 x the price you're getting ripped off so what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail set up something called a self-directed ira or self-directed 401k we've written articles about this on bank list that will include the show notes rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up they help you with the paperwork you can break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get 50 off so make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com to get 50 off you wrote this fantastic article in bankless um exploring how d5 would actually look in ethe 2.0 so it's it's called definite 2.0 cities suburbs and farms and there's a you know fascinating analogy that i'm hopeful you can explain but just to relate relate this to the automated market maker conversation right um it may be the case also that location matters a lot network effect inside of a specific geographic location by geographic i'm being precise i don't mean like um you know physical boundaries i mean sort of the the the chain that um the the protocol resides on so unit swap right now has a fairly uh decent place on the ethereum main chain which is kind of like the the manhattan if you will of um of ethereum and of d5 that's the center of all activity and it also has the value proposition of being optimized to have fairly low gas fees so that gives it some competitive advantage here but let's let's talk about how this all plays out in ethe 2.0 because in 2.0 we don't just have one main chain essentially we have 64 of them so they multiply at least that's that's the vision so can you talk about your articles cities suburbs and farms what's the analogy here when we get to e2.0 and sharding how is d5 going to pan out so the motivation for that piece was i've been having a lot of discussions with people about ethereum 2.0 especially because ethereum has been struggling to to handle all the congestion from d5 and and a lot of people have the natural question when they when they think about how sharding is going to work and so for those who are not familiar sharding is basically this idea that instead of having just like one blockchain you now have i got 64 blockchains that are sort of all moving together and they can all talk to each other asynchronously so they can send each other messages and the messages take a little while to arrive but they can all transfer assets between each other and so on so that's the vision of how ethereum 2.0 is going to scale and so the natural thing of course when you're looking at a complicated system like this is you want to ask the question of like well how are the applications that we use today going to fit onto this new vision of the sharded blockchain and if you think about it very long you'll notice that so many things in d5 work because they are composable meaning that they all live on the same blockchain and therefore in a single transaction you can atomically you know get a flash loan trade on an exchange refinance a cdp or vault or whatever you can do all that stuff atomically in a single transaction because everything lives in the same chain and if ethereum 2.0 looks very similar to a through 1.0 you can imagine that the day that we all begin on ethereum 2.0 there's going to be one shard that becomes the d5 shard and that d5 charge is going to attract all the projects and then all the projects are going to come onto the shard and they're going to use up all the space and it's going to get congested and we'll be right back where we started where you have like one congested chart and 63 charges where nothing's happening and like what was the point of all that right and this is this is a common argument i hear people making when they describe the problem with sharding and i think they are absolutely correct that that is what's going to happen but i think they're wrong in being concerned as that being what's going to happen and that was the motivation behind trying to give this this metaphor of the cities the suburbs and the farms so i'll sort of walk through it very briefly so you can imagine the day that ethereum 2.0 launches okay there's gonna be a lot of people who show up and say wow look at this big empty this big empty block chain and all these empty shards uh i want to start i'm gonna start setting up shop and start doing stuff right and the first thing that naturally is going to happen is that they're going to be people who you know let's say the first thing that happens is that uh you know some dex sets up shop and they say hey great you know dydx we're finally here we want to we want to start trading on chain uh and so we're going to pick the shard right and see some other uh token projects he's like oh do you idx is here probably some assets are going to show up here so i'm going to i'm going to build here too and very quickly you get this coagulation that people are predicting is going to happen um and that that's natural because of course you know these different token projects they're going to want to decide where they live and they're going to want to choose if i really value composability over anything else then i want to choose the chain where i'm most composable with other things for the same reason that you know if you're deciding where you want to start a business well you can decide to start it in san francisco where there's a lot of lots of other businesses and lots of talent and this big network effect of all these things but of course you have to pay higher rent it's a lot more expensive to you know the taxes are higher like the cost of staying here is in san francisco where new york city is baked in to to your your uh uh sort of the contract that you have to sign in order to stay here and to make your home here and so the same thing is true in crypto if you're going to decide to home yourself on a chain that's very congested and very expensive you'll only do that if you're willing to pay the cost of facing the higher congestion and the higher the higher gas fees but you'll only do that if it's worth it to you because the value that you're going to derive from being in that quote-unquote city so isn't that terrible there's going to be this one d5 shard all the d5 stuff will be happening there and then you know it's going to price the rest of us out the same way that ethereum 1.0 is pricing out the little man uh but i don't think that's correct because what will happen is that there will be you know there will be other shards that basically people like you and i you know we're not blails we're just average joes uh we we decided like hey you know what i'm going to take my assets and i'm going to go park them over here on this other chain where you know i can get reasonable rents it's not super crazy to do transactions on this chain and these chains will sort of be the place where ordinary people decide to live and these will sort of be like suburbs you'll have some token services right like there will be tether there's going to be uscc there's going to be some dye that's tokenized and made available on these things there will probably be some market makers you know some simple amn pools and uh some some simple things that you can use for for the random things that you want you know like sort of atm machine style style things that you'll see out in the suburbs right you'll have a mcdonald's you'll have a burger king but you're not gonna have you know uh these really really fancy um you know like uh bloomingdale's type department stores you know like those those are really if you want to if you want those go into manhattan right go do a cross chart transaction go into the really expensive shard that's where you can buy the crazy exotic stuff but most people don't need that at any given time most people are happy to sort of live their lives out in the suburbs where the transaction costs are cheaper congestion is lower and you'll be able to do most of things that you want to do right so there will be a shard purely for defy that's very expensive there might be a shard purely for exchange settlement that's also very expensive where there's lots of transactions going on there'll be a lot of shards for people like us just living out our lives then there will probably be some shards where nothing much at all is happening and those i i like into being the farm charts where there's basically almost no important economic value happening on those charts and in that case you know those are the places where you know today people have talked about oh you know what if we would put our data up on ipfs or put it up you know put our supply chain data or you know this or that uh write it onto ethereum well those will be the places where basically nobody's living there's no financial economic activity um and so anything that's happening there is really just kind of people using the blockchain as kind of this big dumping grounds uh kind of like farmland you know like you can go build some some big warehouses out in the middle of nowhere where you can put your stuff where you can just build this big farmland and put cows there and it's okay cows don't have to be super super valuable for you to use the land as long as nobody else is there you know uh have at it and so this this vision of this heterogeneity between different shards having different levels of congestion and different economic value is very consistent with the vision of the world we already understand right that's how the world looks that's how different economies look right there are high value economies where look if you're going to singapore or if you're going to hong kong those are really expensive places you don't want to go you know build a farm in singapore it's just a really bad idea you know but it's okay for singapore to be that's okay for singapore to be or hong kong to be these financial centers and instead have uh different locales be used for different things and optimize for different economic equilibria and that was the core insight of the of the piece that i tried to convey that analogy it's a brilliant piece and folks should go re read that piece certainly we'll include in the show notes i you know i think for for um folks who maybe had the question all of this doesn't happen in a centrally planned way right it's it's organic it's supply and demand mechanisms the way a city sort of evolves it's not necessarily centrally planned it just kind of evolves in in the way that it does and part of the reason for that is as you're saying haseeb i'm understanding it correctly um one shard will have a different block space supply and demand dynamic versus another shard so you might have gas fees in the d5 main chain shard that are like 300 gray for example but in the farmland shard where there's no activity it's basically like near free to get a transaction in so all of this economic activity almost organically naturally load balances is that the case that's right and wrong i mean when you say load balances i i certainly don't think which is what many people imagined was going to happen with the tier 2.0 that you're going to get uniformity across all the shards you're not going to get uniformity you're going to get heterogeneity but that heterogeneity like you said is is good like the idea that you want everything to be uniform is the hallmark of central planning right it's the idea that you know uh like okay we want to make sure that uh you know when somebody somebody builds their next business inside new york city like well new york city is too crowded we're going to pick up that that uh business and we're going to go and move it over into you know jersey city because new york is too crowded we're going to pick it up and worse yet move it over into some farmland in wyoming because new york is too crowded right that would be that would be that would make sense if your goal was to achieve economic uniformity but that should really not be your goal that's a terrible idea right totally the point of like why cities form in the way that they do and i think the same thing will be true in block shows blockchains are fundamentally they're they're they're fundamentally economies and as economies you want them to be able to sort of engage in their own uh organic reasoning about where things should go and why they should go there okay so it's not load balancing the way a network router might route traffic from one place to another in an evenly distributed way but this is more danny ryan has used this term um more economic load balancing that sort of just happens because i'm in uh new york city and my gas fees are too expensive so i'm moving out to the suburbs no i'm moving to the to the farmland way outside somewhere in jersey right that's that's kind of what happens where does layer 2 fit in the mix here in this in this whole set of analogies so you've got different shards that are cities and suburbs and farms and then you have layer two out there is it interacting with with any of these shards and uh what's kind of the analogy for that how do you think about that that's a good question i think layer two so i i i'm mindful that at the point of which i introduced layer two i'm starting to really distort the analogy so i don't wanna i don't wanna lean too much on on any of this but you know the way that i described layer 2 and the piece is that layer 2 is kind of like a shopping mall you know it's it's a very condensed very highly efficient place where you can bring together a bunch of stores that kind of work together or sort of have have some natural synergy uh and allow everybody to sort of come to this one place to go shopping in the in these relatively small number of things and that and it works it's it's efficient it's great it's an awesome way to scale commerce and of course we have shopping malls everywhere in the world people realize yeah it's a great idea however it doesn't uh so one thing is that layer 2's almost everything that we've seen in the realm of layer 2 they have very very natural scalability limits right so looking at something like or it's something like a somewhere in the neighborhood of of 10 to 100 x uh probably on the very lower side maybe like 10 to 20 x and o r stands for optimus square loops like your your throughput limit is like somewhere in the order of 10 to 20x zq roll ups have much higher throughput limits but the problem with zk roll ups is that it's much more difficult to do arbitrary computation on gk roll-ups right so if i want to port like synthetics over to zika roll-ups there's a lot of work that it takes in order to rewrite all the contracts in ways that they can be proven in zero knowledge uh it's extremely non-trivial uh optimistic roll-up is nicer it's sort of just like having ethereum 2.0 where you can just drag and drop contracts into this new model but the the scalability limits are are significantly constrained relative to what you could get otherwise so the answer is that like nothing nothing today on layer two is a real uh magic bullet i think for solving the scalability problem there's going to be more need for heterogeneity and it's already obviously true today that uh you know once we're gonna get once we get some layer twos like they're they're one they're you know i i had a much more coherent their two pieces a year and a half ago when you know i i remember like backing uh batter labs which is one of the very first zika roll-up projects that innovated a lot of this stuff um but the honest answer is that it's taken way longer than i think anybody thought it was going to you know starting with like plasma back in what was it 2017 that i think the plasma paper came out all the way to today and having very little unfortunately to to show for it given all the amount of hype that that has gone into this stuff so i think we have zq roll-ups starting to really work optimistic roll-ups haven't really shown their faces yet um but it's very difficult to generalize these things across all of d5 and so i do think that it's going to take uh you know other other you know transition to a much more scalable underlying substring for this full uh blossoming of economic potential to happen so haseeb in this uh cities farms and suburbs metaphor which i'm a huge fan of by the way because it fits right into the bankless metaphor of being like a nation right being like a nation right and so it's a geo it's a geography full of of economic activity and while these things aren't physically located you can still get some sort of relational uh physical relational space right like these things have borders with with other things and we can kind of position these uh applications in in relation to other applications and that's kind of how we get this like geography and they all share the same security same military same yeah the same military ethers i like that yeah so in the in this world where does the liquidity live so imagine i am a apple farmer in the farms of new york uh upstate new york and i need to get my apples to the market in like manhattan or maybe just outside of manhattan do i have to go and make a cross charred transaction in excuse me do i have to go and make a cross-shard transaction in order to find the liquidity to sell my apples or is there going to be liquidity kind of spread out in all of these shards how do you think how do you think that's going to unfold i suspect that liquidity will be very tiered across these charts in the sense that you know it's it's kind of the same answer as today right like if you're if you if you want to buy let's say let's say you want to buy um what's a good example uh let's say you want to buy a thousand apples okay and uh for whatever reason in the real world we're not making it theory of analogies real world you want to buy a thousand apples if you're out in the middle of nowhere and you want to get liquidity like buy these thousand apples at a reasonable price um if you literally just go in like you're in some small town in the middle of nowhere and you want to buy all the apples like well the apple shipment comes once a week and the truck only comes in every sunday morning and they only bring in you know 200 apples and if you want to buy up all the apples that everybody in town owns it's going to cost you a lot of money because a lot of people don't want to sell you those apples and so you're basically going to be screwed right so that's like the farmland so if you want to get liquidity in a farmland there's just not going to be that much right and so you might go into the nearest town and the nearest town they have like a bunch of supermarkets and you go into all the supermarkets and you you buy up all the apples but like you can't really get a good wholesale price because the wholesalers just aren't really there in like that small town um but you can buy up more apples and you're gonna get a better you're gonna get a better price than you could buying it in like the tiny middle of nowhere town uh and then furthermore if you go into a bigger city then now okay you can actually go find some apple wholesalers you know they're they're the farmers who come in and sell their stuff there and so on and so forth if you go all the way to like the big big city then like you know you can find super mega department stores that can you can you can literally just like check out a thousand apples on the way out the door so i expect the same thing is going to be true in defy is that you know if you want to sell some eat for ustc right and you're on a farmland chart there might be like some little amm over there some like tiny pool or some some or even like a small private market maker who's sitting around on that chart and if you ping him he's got a little bit of inventory sitting around and he'll say yep i'm willing to i'm willing to admit this trade for this price right and maybe it's not a great price and so if you want to get a better price you go into the suburb chart and you know you maybe you don't go all the way to manhattan into the super expensive d5 shard because the the transaction costs are just going to be really significant so you go into the uh the suburb chart you go in there uh the cross chart transactions the same cost but once you're there you know the actual transaction cost is much lower uh and then you you trade there on like some tiny you know there's a little lena swap pool where there's a moderate size pool or there's a you know a bunch of private market makers there who will who will fill your order or if you really have a gigantic order then like [ __ ] you're not gonna be able to do that on a defy shard or sorry on a suburb shard you've got to go all the way into defense land if you want to sell like a million dollars worth of eth uh then okay fine go into the defy shard that's where all the big boys live that's where all the wholesalers live and that's where you're gonna be able to you know do a really massive order but then of course you're much less sensitive to the transaction costs so i suspect that's the way it's going to look okay let's let's continue this analogy it's just such a fascinating analogy and it's really painting a vision for what eth2 or sharded blockchain like eth2 could look like right so there is another player in the mix here we've talked about you know shards we've talked about d5 we've talked about layer two and uh we opened this entire episode with kind of the the question what's the big intellectual miss you've had in crypto right i i will confess one intellectual myth one thing i didn't realize about bitcoin was its uh scalability potential the way bitcoin really is scaling right now isn't so much through lightning or layer two it's scaling through crypto banks it's scaling through the binances and coin bases of the world uh almost like if you think of crypto banks as sort of side chains that's sort of bitcoin's primary scalability strategy these these sidechains the crypto banks essentially settle on top of bitcoin they do the big transactions on bitcoin how does a coin base a crypto bank like a binance how do they fit into this this shard world could they just set up shop you know in multiple places they could start settling in manhattan if they want but oh you know it's expensive to settle transactions in in this particular city in new york city so we're going to move to the farmlands and settle transactions there have you given any thought to that yeah so i suspect there will actually be one shard that is also sort of city-like manhattan-like chard that will be specifically for exchange settlement and specifically because of course many many many of the times when funds are moving from exchanges they're moving to other exchanges and so there's a natural uh tendency for these for exchanges to sort of coagulate and clump together because they all want to be sending funds to each other um whereas most of the time like if you're if you're if you have funds in d5 you're touching a lot of other defy apps you're sending money from compound to unit swap to this to that um but it's not very often that like you're moving funds from coinbase to compound and then combat to coinbase right that's not that's not a very high throughput connection and so i i think i i would expect for there to be sort of this like this manhattan in the chicago where manhattan is like the d5 shard in chicago is like the exchange shard um and and for the most part like if exchanges want to send you know if you if you want to get money uh from an exchange on to chard a chart b short c share d um i mean i i don't know exactly how an exchange might do it but i can imagine it wouldn't be surprising to me if the exchange were just say like look screw it let's just like consolidate our liquidity in uh let's consolidate liquidity in the exchange chart and then let's put a little bit of liquidity in each of the uh suburbs shards so that we can easily and then of course more in the defy shard so that if somebody wants a withdrawal to that shard we don't have to do a cross-shard transaction every single time we've got a little bit of sort of working capital to send money uh you know here and there uh at any given time with lower transaction fees when somebody is wanting to buy and sell right so it's it's sort of the same thing you know it's like the corresponding banking system uh where capital is sort of put in the most efficient way uh in different places to allow people to kind of rebalance capital wherever it's needed from different banks at different times um in the same way i expect that to be how exchanges manage their inventory in a world of you know sort of a sharded universe with with heterogeneity heterogeneous shards okay two other parties we could talk about in this world uh you know the first is assets right and maybe we don't spend much time on that because i think people can envision the way a tokenized bitcoin or tokenized gold or tokenized real estate would look in a sharded ethereum world simply uh some sort of token standard in erc20 that gets moved from shard to shard but let's talk about maybe the uh this second kind of player and and these are what i might call the other main chains right the the quote unquote eath killers of the world the polka dots the cosmos the veneers if you will how do they interact with this eth 2.0 world so the first thing i'll say is that i think the ethereum killer narrative is basically over and that nobody is going to kill ethereum it's sort of like it's sort of like i mentioned ethereum is the manhattan of crypto and the only real question is is there going to be a chicago of crypto and there may well be um but i think the idea that like that chicago is going to kill new york is just i think the ship has sailed um but what if it's china versus america you know ethereum is uh the us and you know some other chain is a different country exactly why i think like well i think what we're likely to see is i mean actually that that analogy is a little bit twisted because of course it seems like we're kind of entering into sort of cold war relations with china but sort of you know what we saw was this like globally connected supply chain right i mean it is the case today that the reason why we're not actually in a cold war with china is because of our enormous economic interests connecting us together i think it's very clear now that if another chain does rise to prominence sort of becomes the second city within crypto it will be purely because it is able to communicate and share resources and financial activity with what's happening in ethereum so all of the assets that have been issued on ethereum you know all the tether and the usdc and the dye and the bowel tokens and blah blah all this stuff right whoever it is whether it's you know near or avalanche or polka dot or cosmos or whatever they need to have some story for how those assets are going to come over if you actually want to have a viable financial system and and you know today i think the story for how those uh chains fit in is that if they can offer a credible alternative to this heterogeneous vision and allow there to be sort of these new cities formed that still connect back to the manhattan of crypto there still is a road back to ethereum um that allow you know assets to get tokenized and pulled across some bridge uh whether it be you know an interoperability bridge like polka dot or cosmos or you know in the case of a layer one a direct bridge to ethereum i think that's going to allow them to siphon off a lot of the economic activity such that again the the mid to low value stuff that doesn't really fit in a you know 200 way uh uh environment on ethereum which is just not economical for like someone like you or me to do like a 20 trade look that used to be possible now it's just it's just not economical anymore but if you if you pull it across to this newer city where you know the land is cheap and uh anybody can start their own thing and now suddenly you know entrepreneurship and the ability for small people to start small businesses that starts to open up again i think that's going to revitalize a lot of the uh that's the road to starting a second city so between sharding which is very similar to just making a bunch of alternative blockchains that have easier ways to communicate with each other and then also layer two which is in a way kind of like making another type of blockchain or a similar blockchain construction but with much more freedom in its architecture and its parameters why why what's the real ad advantage of spinning up a whole entire uh you know own native l1 blockchain like like an ethereum killer when you have the opportunity to just build an l2 on ethereum that uses very similar construction well i'd say the first thing is that those l2s right now so we have zk roll ups today um and we're getting we're waiting on optimistic roll up so they haven't really arrived yet um the answer is that like layer twos on ethereum today are just they're very constrained they're not um it's not very easy to build good layer twos on top of ethereum and of course you know i think everybody knows this at this point that ethereum just has a lot of technical baggage and so to the extent that you know uh you know theory 2.0 is so compelling because it allows ethereum to basically voice off any poor design choices that it made and to rebuild itself with it with a clearer more lucid vision of what a blockchain should look like today and i think today the clearest path to getting that is you know another layer one we already have their ones uh other than ethereum that have sort of more modern design choices are built on proof of stake they have finality these are all things that you really want in a financial system especially you know having a fast finality you know i talked earlier about uh one of the problems being laid excuse me being latency um latency is is addressed much much more compellingly in a world with proof of stake where you can actually get finality than in a proof of work type setting um but all these things in aggregate i think really tell you that uh there's there's it's it's a battle i don't think i don't think it's it's obviously for foregone conclusion that one of these is going to win over the other it really i think honestly the thing that matters most more than any theoretical argument more than any uh kind of uh technological argument is just a simple answer is look who is going to have the first solution ready that i can click a button send my eth here and then start trading on some other platform who's going to have that first right now no one has it jumping on kind of the analogy of like sort of an ethereum being a nation with all of these these these cities that sort of thing we we just had charlie noyes from paradigm i'm not sure if you know him hasid um okay so we just had charlie on the podcast that's episode 26 including the show notes this is episode 27. um and we got in a discussion about basically um the requirement for main chains to have a monetary premium their underlying asset must be a money was sort of charlie's conclusion in order to provide sufficient security such that it beats all of the other chains essentially so if i could kind of boil it down maybe i'm putting some words in charlie's mouth he says it very eloquently basically like if you're a main chain you you kind of have to be a money your reserve asset has to be a money in order to succeed and if your your asset that that's backing your chain is not a monetary asset right a store value of some kind doesn't have some sort of monetary premium then it's basically a side chain for some other chain that does what are your what's your take on that thesis that idea so i think that's a i i agree in part with that argument but i also disagree with that argument and i and i i disagree for two reasons um so one is that and i i know that uh this is very much going against the bankless party line but this is but i want to say please do i i don't believe that eat this money i think that today is a is still a speculative asset and it's very unclear how ethereum is going to is going to evolve in whether or not you know there's this there's this classic thesis that i think was first articulated most clearly by um uh john pfeffer in describing sort of as being like the oil of ethereum right like the sort of fundamental commodity that that drives uh ethereum operation um but the like it's it's clear today i think that the core properties of money store value medium exchange uh and unit of account uh they don't really describe anything encrypted today the only thing that is used as a true story value mean of account uh and an asset of exchange is stable points and and that's okay i don't think i don't think we need to fool ourselves about that i think what's going on on ethereum today is that people are very excited about ethereum and they sort of see ethereum almost as like this almost like the equity of whatever it is that ethereum is doing if you invest in eth somehow you get you capture some of the upside of whatever is going on in ethereum and that certainly has worked and i think the one time that ethereum has been a a true reserve asset for crypto and truly was the money of crypto was in 2017 when ethereum served as the reserve currency for icos uh that was the one time i think when ethereum was money or sorry that ether was money and i think since then it it has really kind of stopped being the case i don't know anybody who pays each other with eats i don't know anybody who denominates their uh their cost services whatever in eth uh everybody i know who looks at ethe is constantly looking at the usd price of and modulating what they're doing based on that and has before we move on here would you say the same is true of bitcoin yes absolutely same as your big one um they're both in the same boat uh and so to that to that extent uh the you know the question of like well the the the asset of a chain needs to need to have a monetary premium um i don't think it's true that ethereum has a monetary period because a monetary premium means it has a premium from being money so you're in a sense you know i think this is the kind of game that crypto investors like to play is they say like look if the room is worth ether is worth you know this you know tens of billions of dollars clearly that's not justified by transaction fees alone therefore monetary premium therefore eat this money and i think that's sort of setting out what you're presuming to prove uh there's presuming what you're setting out to prove in that look uh ether is clearly trading at a premium to what it should purely based on the transaction fees that are getting paid out in ethereum today uh what's causing that why is that happening and monetary premium could be one explanation for it but another one could be that people are people are speculating that other people are speculating they're you know people don't really know what ethereum's gonna be worth nobody has any idea how to value this thing 10 years from now if it ends up becoming this like financial substrate uh for a bunch of financial activity out in the world nobody has any [ __ ] idea what this thing is going to be worth or how to value it uh and i think that's it's to a lesser extent that's true for bitcoin because i think it's a much clearer model of what bitcoin can be it can be this sort of you know this this kind of uh this gold-like you know non-sovereign store value thing it's very clear now i think that the role that bitcoin can play and how it can slot into a financial ecosystem nobody has any clue where ethereum is going to fit into the future of finance and so i think so so for that reason i i'm arguing that uh it's really not obvious to me that if there is another that first of all the reason why ethereum is especially valuable is because it's quote-unquote money-like and if you assume that that's that's not true and it's sort of this we're not really sure why ethereum is so valuable today uh then if if another platform were to arise let's say you know smart contract chain x the smart contract chain x started gaining tons of traction and becoming very successful uh then we wouldn't also see a ton of appreciation at its token price and from everything that we see it sort of seems like we would like my assumption would be if something else started really really taking off and becoming very successful that we would also see a lot of appreciation in that token as we seem to have seen in eos and in tron and in tezos in a way even maybe disproportionate to how successful they've been because they have almost no real organic activity on any of those chains right now and so so long story short you know pulling all these threads together what i'm trying to say is that i think that argument makes a lot of sense if you assume that the reason why ether is valuable today is because it's money-like and therefore there's only going to be one money therefore eth is going to win and everything else is going to be a side chain and i've i've talked with charlie about this before and i think this is basically the thrust of his argument and i think it's it's a little bit too elegant to describe the messiness of crypto as it actually is today which is that we have no idea why this stuff is valuable uh we have no idea you know if there's another smart contract chain that becomes extraordinarily successful how is it going to get valued uh we don't really know i think trying to be too sort of uh philosophical or analytical is going to lead you to make really really big mistakes you know it's like why why is chain link worth you know whatever it is like 15 billion dollars fully diluted trying to be too analytical about that is going to lead you to making lots of mistakes um and the same thing is true with with a lot of stuff going on today in crypto uh and i think i would i would make the same argument about layer ones is that we don't really know what makes these letter ones valuable if the argument is that well one thing should be money and everything else should be fuel and therefore you know if there is a you know an avalanche or a near or a polka dot that's successful then it's its currency should just be valued as fuel and that's going to be really really cheap and not so not so valuable and therefore it's not gonna be able to drive enough economic security to secure itself and therefore blah blah blah i don't know to me you're multiplying like 20 probabilities together and uh there's sort of this you know to me you're just getting so much noise it's amplifying by by taking together all those propositions that i just don't think that we know that i don't think we know what makes these things valuable but i if i had to guess and i would guess that you guys would probably put your money the same way if some other chain started taking off it would start pumping and not because of the transaction fees that are getting paid on the platform hey guys when i asked haseeb this next question while we were recording i had some troubles with my microphone but i'm going to summarize the question here basically he just gave a critique of etha's money as with a more strict and rigid definition of the use of money and i agree that in the sense that we don't use ether to pay for our groceries that eath is not money in that sense but then i tried to reframe the ethos money statement as more of a commitment to the fact that ether is valuable like it's a it's a planting the flag and putting a foot down saying ether is valuable and we needed this to happen in the ethereum community because ether needs to be valuable for the ethereum blockchain to work i re-represented ether's money as a different definition and asked haseeb if just ether is value instead of eth is money resonated with him better so let's get into his answer yeah so that's a really good point and i look i obviously i'm a big youth bowl and i love the ethereum community i've basically i could not be more bullish and excited about what you guys are doing in spreading the message of the the power and the vibrancy of the ethos of the again community um and you know i i i think i think is undervalued even today that said um like i i i think this is you call this a personal failing of mine but i think i'm somebody who i'm particularly i'm particularly literal and that makes you very bad at politics and so i think you know the the ethos money thing is a is a very powerful political statement um but it's it's a powerful political statement in the same way that you know uh defund the police it's a very powerful political statement when you ask them like what do you really need to find the police like well it's not exactly it's sort of more complicated these like 12 different things and they're kind of like defining the police but it's really more subtle than that um and so i i personally don't like those those kinds of slogans that sort of have this like mod and bailey type mechanic to them um but i understand their utility and they are very important and look you know crypto is a crypto crypto's a [ __ ] war zone and you guys are fighting crusades against the bitcoiners and the and the whatever tron shillers and whatever and so i totally understand that you need ammunition and this is one of these pieces of ammunition um but at least for myself as an investor like uh i i just know that for myself it's very difficult for me to walk around saying eat this money uh and and still like really understand what i'm saying and really understand like because because i need to ask myself the question of like look 10 15 years from now or you know if another platform starts to succeed or another sort of contract chain starts to become like this sort of l2 that comes into its own what is that going to be and how does it interact with eth and what do i really think drives the value of these things and where do i think crypto is going if there's another winter and blah blah blah blah all these questions i think are super complex and very very difficult to uh to probe and so i like the way that you put it is that look i think it's gonna be you know our enterprise for the next decade it's like really understand what the [ __ ] is ether you know what actually is it and right now it's like evolving before our eyes it's changing in all these different ways people are valuing it and different you know eventually there's going to be a textbook written about ether and ethereum and contract chains and all this stuff and i what i really want to know like i think what i see my job as an investor is to try to get as fast as possible to whatever that person is going to write in that textbook of like ah here's what it was here's what it actually was here's how it actually worked and all those people along those ten years they just had no clue you know they were they didn't know the germ theory yet they thought it was like devils and you know curses and hexes and all the stupid stuff that they were running around not able to figure out what the real underlying mechanics were that made these things function the way that they do that's what i see my job as trying to figure out um and so look god bless you guys obviously i love you both uh but i can't get behind the ethan's money thing uh and it's probably more my fault than yours i actually for my part has don't really um like the way you articulate it is um is totally fine to me right so where i have more of the problem is when people look at bitcoin through a different lens than evaluating other crypto assets and not just ether but other main chain layer you know one crypto assets and give preferential a preferential thesis to uh bitcoin for example without looking at all of the ways also ether or some other asset of some other layer one blockchain um accrues value because i think the arguments that make sense for bitcoin could also potentially make sense for ether i know pfeiffer uh effort excuse me explores that a little bit in his paper but i i do think it's an unexplored area of at least bitcoin maximalism but i'm content to leave it there uh hasiba is uh you know fantastic articulation why don't we why don't we end with this question we're kind of zooming out all of the you know ways we've sort of um you know changed our minds intellectual misses that that we've had over the years i think people who have listened to bankless will understand like we're we're all very much trying to figure this out together like it's a it's it's like a collective uh journey and you have to adjust your thesis midstream but if you were to lay out some maybe high conviction bets that you'd make at the risk of having to adjust uh in the in the not too distant feature future what are some high conviction ideas that you have right now that you think would be important for us to know high conviction ideas that i have right now let's see here the first thing i mean we touched on this already but i think that uni swap is going to get unbundled and there's going to be more and more uh price competition and more and more complex forms of market making that are going to make their way to level one i think that's the first thing um the second big bet that i would make in this space is that i think so you know as an investor i spend a lot of my time of course in the ethereum world and i spent a lot of time uh kind of in the world of exchanges and other kinds of businesses and i think what we're seeing across the board both in both in d5 land and in non-defined land is increasing financialization of crypto right so we're starting to see options uh take off not not so much in cryptos that we're actually lead investors in open and options are still very very tiny in crypto land uh in sort of on chain defy land uh whereas in uh if you if you look at like you know options volumes on derebit and on paradigm and on some of these other options platforms they're really starting to grow rapidly and i think you're seeing things like you know structured products and all sorts of uh fancy uh financial primitives that are finding their way and starting to disseminate more and more through crypto and eventually i think what you see almost almost inevitably between centralized finance which i like to call c5 and d5 is convergence right is that over time d5 starts to basically converge with the things that people are buying and selling on c5 and so one of those things as well that i think is going to be a big um a big growth area in d5 is you know already you know we talked today about how a lot of the volumes that are growing in d5 today are in spot markets so you know unisop is basically almost all spot um so it's buying and selling the raw assets of buying uscc selling ethereum whatever but there's but there's not a lot of derivatives right now on chain uidx is really the only platform that's doing it today uh but we think there's gonna be a lot of growth here there's a huge um cohort of platforms that are coming live very soon that are going to offer basically bitmex style training experiences directly on chain that allow people to get more leverage and trade also arbitrary assets and that uh you know especially with bit max the recent news of bitmex enabling kyc for everybody i think it's also very timely that this stuff is going to start coming live so the big meta my in my mind to look out for is defy and c5 converging and offering the same set of products and evolving the same way so like you know getting perpetual swaps onto onto ethereum getting options and other kinds of financial instruments onto ethereum getting more complex marketing onto ethereum all these things will start to look look more and more similar to eventually the point at which you can start doing all the same things you wanted to do on a centralized exchange you can do it all from your ethereum one i think that's the future that's coming and that's what i'm excited about very cool haseeb it has been an absolute pleasure to have you in front of the the bankless nation thank you so much for your time thanks for having me this is a lot of fun i will leave uh listeners with with this is a tweet that has recently made it said uh ethereum 1.0 isn't big enough for what d phi is about to become i think that is important for the bankless nation to understand whether it takes the form of ethereum whether it takes the form of eth 1.0 or eth 2.0 bitcoin other chains that that develop the the idea around d5 and the idea behind bankless being self-sovereign over your own resources and money is the core thesis of crypto at least that's what the bankless nation believes some action items guys there are two articles you absolutely need to read from haseeb uh the first is published on bankless it is called defy in eth 2.0 cities suburbs and farms which get which gets into that analogy we will include an action list also read what explains the rise of automated market makers has he wrote that one as well gets into his thoughts on automated market makers lastly we are looking for four more five star reviews to get us 200 so i just looked at the podcast on apple itunes we've got a ton we've got like 94 and we just need excuse me we've got 96 and we just need four more five star reviews so get out there if you're excited about the bankless podcast you're excited about the movement get out there give us a five-star review and get us to 100 risks and disclaimers everyone eath is risky bitcoin is risky d5 is risky everything in crypto is is pretty risky right now you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot
