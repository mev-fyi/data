oh man i wish my identity and inventory followed me from app to app what can i do you should speedrun ethereum oh man my data is stored in this this data center and i don't have control of it they have control of it you should speed run ethereum i'm working at a shitty devops job and my source code is closed source and my boss won't let me open source it you should speed run ethereum how's that for a call to action is that right hey bankless nation today i'm having a conversation with a dear friend of mine austin griffith austin is a builder of builders in the ethereum space he's been one of the first people that i know that just got the smart contract bug as a developer and he's been building this very unique uh category of apps that are tools for builders so austin like i said austin's a builder's builder he enables builders to be builders and he's been helping out build out tooling and dev environments and just structures to help people wrap their heads around what it means to build in web web 3 especially when they come from a web 2 background and so his excitement and his optimism is infectious uh he speeds run he speed runs us through his history building out all these different things to where he's been led to today uh which is uh building a suite of tools that just help developers spin up smart contracts and get front ends from them instantly so they can think around and develop and iterate uh he's also been captivated by optimism's retroactive public goods funding spearheaded by vitalik and carl florsch so we actually spend a decent amount of time diving into optimism optimism's public retroactive good funding how it works how it's structured the tokens involved how it incentivizes speculation by early early investors who want to invest in a project that doesn't have funding yet because that you do have the promise of being paid for funds later perhaps if the thing actually works out anyways we go into much more details on the show so if you've been curious about what optimism's retroactive public goods funding actually is we actually go through it because i go from knowing a little bit about it to knowing a lot about it thanks to austin so we're gonna go ahead and get right into the conversation with austin griffith right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 internet with over 50 million monthly active users control your digital footprint with built-in privacy and ad blocking inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web 3 crypto browser web 3 is freedom from big tech and wall street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wallet the brave wall is different brave wall is built natively inside the brave browser no extension required which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets with the brave wallet you can buy store send and swap your crypto assets and you can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defy apps all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro it's time to switch to the brave wallet download brave brave dot com bank list and click the wallet icon to get started when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that's why you should be using matcha matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in ethereum and is also operational on polygon avalanche finance smart chain and other chains trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your default trades and they will go through automatically while you're away so when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bank list is proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy the uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswap grants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless hey austin how's it going what's up thanks for having me david how's it going there oh my god absolutely fantastic i've had you on the show a number of in a number of different times a number of different capacities and i think uh one thing that i like the most about you austin is you're one of these people in ethereum that has just this infectious energy like this in like this youthful optimism and energy and excitement i'm pretty old where does that get that youthful well you come off like you do right right i'm getting old i would say that like i have a personal excitement for the technology like before ethereum i was super excited about docker and infrastructure and code and how you could uh you know scale microservices for organizations right so it's like i'm just this excited about smart contracts because i think it's dope and i think it's uh like gonna change the world and give agency to intelligent people to build our ethos into our protocols i'm uh i just have this image of just like austin griffith like laying in bed in the morning and the alarm wakes up and he's like oh boy smart contracts let's go no no alarm no alarm it's a it's a two-year-old my diaper's dirty like that teaches you to be ready at 6 00 a.m every day and bed early the night before yeah but i also do get up and get excited about smart contracts okay so but you said that you were excited about like some web 2 stuff some web 2 infrastructure servers or like docker stuff is it so what is it really is it that just being able to code is code what really gets you excited or like where i'm sure you were excited about stuff before you were excited about smart contracts like scale like longevity of the thing you're building uh like who's using it and are they enjoying themselves are they like what are they using it for are you empowering them to do something that they've never been able to do before uh is it something that not even you could stop if you wanted to there's some neat characteristics to building decentralized applications that are particularly exciting can can you coordinate with a bunch of people you don't particularly trust to do something financially that you couldn't have done before maybe yeah i don't know i do i do care i i think uh what's particularly interesting about the way that you build is that you're always trying you're always focused on um like the values and the ethos that get embedded into the code and that's actually kind of what the whole impetus of this podcast is about uh and so you you seem to span just like the ones and the zeros but then also talking about like the disposition of your user and and also how you impact the disposition of your user how do you learn to think in those terms i think just building stuff and then like prioritizing them using it and having like you you can see people have a bad time and you almost like some people feel bad about that some people don't but when you when you are live watching your user use something and it's frustrating for them or it's exciting for them like that like rubs off on you right so just through through a method of just like trying the f around and find out like i'm i'm able to see how other i'm able to find out like i guess how folks are using it and where it's good and where it's bad and so i don't think it's like any kind of scientific process it's more just like f around and find out and pay attention i think i think the uh legacy of austin and what he's been building in the crypto space i think for context for listeners i think it will be helpful that there was a time in uh the industry where like our ux slash ui was just like completely missing we had engineers and we had you know technical people that like to code up blockchain and write solidity uh and they were making like mvps but no one was thinking about like the the front end ux how will a user actually engage with this how will normies actually engage with it i think austin was one of those one of the first people out there that was able to connect you know blockchain code magic stuff all the crazy cryptography to it's like all right guys like here's how we actually wrap this up and deliver it to our users who who else in it was is in that camp and like how did you kind of get started doing all that i feel like yeah i got to give credit to like alex vandezen avsa he uh he thought about a lot of this stuff i i he was just borrowing some stuff from scaffoldith and i was talking with him about how to get scaffold eath going and i sent him a video that i made that's talking about the punk wallet and how you know sign we shouldn't be worried about 12-word seed phrases for small amounts of funding and we should learn how to have like these signing wallets and as i'm like sending him the video i realized that like march 2018 or something he was giving a talk very very similar to this that i watched that like had a huge impact on me and how i'm so i was basically like giving him him his message back you know four years later but a lot of it came from him and a lot of the way he thought about uh thinks about you know smart contract wallets versus hardware wallets and how you should have like a session wall we shouldn't be sending private keys around we should generate a new private key over here and give it access with limits you know what i'm saying like setting setting it up so oh and then let's create another key over here that can like just do recovery and if you did lose your 12 word seed phrase it's not the end of the world because it's in a smart contract wallet and you have these other like uh accounts in place that can have like limited ability to recover funds or spend funds at some limit or something like that but things that like mainstream audiences absolutely have to have right you can't have a giant password and if you lose a password it's completely done and you're hose and that's basically how an ecdsa key pair works right now and so like getting to the ux where a mainstream user can use it leads us to something like smart contract wallets and and using these signing and it's like stuff that he was talking about four years ago but finally we're like starting to dance with mainstream audiences a little bit more that's crazy yeah um there's just so few i mean maybe i'm naive but there's just there seems to be so few people that are thinking deeply about the systems that we generate with like private keys and private key recovery and what that means for just like we can't have global adoption under the paradigm of you can lose your private keys um and like that there has to be like a universally accepted like ux solution to that but i feel like that's just one of many ux problems that people like you and people in your category are all tackling austin came for just again to get listeners up to speed with like who you are and what you've been up to can you just talk about your work history in ethereum solving various you like ux issues like various projects that you've worked on in various things that you've helped uh just solve ux for for developers or for users or whoever yeah i feel like ux you i'm only good at ux because i can like turn on my caveman brain and go through something and understand like caveman happy or caveman not right so i think like my you i'm i'm not particularly skilled at ux i think that my the skill that i finally brought to the ecosystem that has resonated is like tool building and teaching and and kind of onboarding and that comes with a lot of ux and empathy and a lot of those other things but i got into this space uh was deep down in docker was like oh crap smart contracts why how have i missed this like right around i don't know like summer of 2017 i started speed running ethereum learning everything i could watching youtubes uh i built like a like a i saw that like we needed like oracles were interesting so it was kind of like build something to learn and maybe it'll be something it was not something i thought it was going to be something cool i spent a lot of time like you know months in the dark building this thing that i think is going to be really cool and then i show up and show it off and no one cares right which is a lesson in itself about like you need to iterate in public and like try things out and have some kind of like idea about product market fit or who's going to use it or whatever anyways built that didn't work then i was like what can i do really good i'm going to build a game i'm going to build something that no one else can build i built galley ass and it's like this really cool world with erc721s and erc20s and there's crafting and you basically have a boat and it taught me about randomness because commit reveal is used for the the boats it taught me about like making a game on chain and how some of the weird things about like you you send a transaction to put your sales up and then the boat sales for a little while and then it stops so you like sail on the blockchain it's not like a typical game where you have to you know w-a-s-d move around it's more of a you make a transaction and your piece starts to move and that's kind of thinking in how we might do blockchain games no one cared about that but what it did create was i created a bunch of orchestration tools to make that happen and then i showed off the orchestration tools and those started to resonate with people so that was like oh this is my like i'm not i'm not a game builder i'm not a heady uh decentralized oracle builder i'm a tool builder and i'm a teacher so i'll just lean into i'm gonna build tools i'm gonna research things like what the heck is this meta transaction thing and how can it be used for better ux what the heck is what do you even call it when you put a private key in the browser and you're just clicking around and it feels like you're interfacing with an app some random person was like call it a burner wallet so we called it a burner wallet but it was like playing around with ux but it was mostly about teaching and tooling and getting developers going and that led to ethe.build and eth.build as like a sandbox but also like a curriculum that goes around it and then that led to scaffold eath which is like a template for building dapps quickly it's kind of like a starter kit for web3 and that's become kind of like a starter kit for starter kits and i've built an incentivization layer around people creating stuff with like if you create generic composable components that we're going to use and all these other things i'm going to stream eth to you and kind of like do this kind of like regenerative economics thing and that's kind of like where where i am now kind of i say it's in my like third phase i'm like the butterfly now and i'm flapping around and i'm sending eth to other developers sorry sorry for the long-winded that's that's austin's tour of duty and ethereum so far no that's fantastic and like it's it's also a little bit meta because like you start very like zoomed in with oracle's very specific use case so then you end up zoomed very very out in like this platform uh and then you get out one more layer of meta out of that as you turn into a platform for platforms uh but also there's this hilarious video that i think went viral then i think it was you demoing scaffold eath i think uh and you're probably just like 8th building yeah and east build is like um yeah yeah it's like a it's like a it felt like uh uh what was that old with microsoft windows like drawing uh yeah kid picks yeah i think yeah yeah kid picks yeah whereas like you had these little buttons on the side and you had tools and you could just like mario page yeah yeah right uh-huh and but like uh and so you could just like you know draw it was like a sandbox for like drawing stuff for kid-friendly and and eat build is like that but for building smart contracts uh and like various blockchain functions like hashing algorithms or like private public keys and so you could drag all these things and then you can make this smart contract talk to that smart contract just like microsoft paint but for oh yeah here you go oh this is fantastic here we go yeah all right so let's build something really there's a keypad yeah yeah so you you talk about how a key pair is this thing that's basically generated right a key pair is just 64 random characters and there's enough entropy in there that you can sit here and generate these key pairs for as long as you want and get new accounts and you could be hooked up to a blockchain let's make sure we're hooked up to the right blockchain i'll get the block number here there's the block number of ethereum right now but what if we were just like reading the balance of this dude and if it's ever greater than zero like stop everything and and and uh and you know sweep it to another account or something here we go we just built it it's gonna be zero forever ladies and gentlemen no matter how fast i do this no matter how long i do this as long as i get a good entropy in this private key there's always going to be a balance of zero and that's just one little thing you can show off with with each build uh down here i think i was doing something where i needed to deploy a gnosis safe on many different networks so i was like okay i'll take that call data and i'll plug it into a send i'll unlock my meta mask uh okay i can do that in a little bit and then that helps me like set up this transaction and then when i click this it like fired the transaction so then i just went to my meta mask and switched through the different networks and yellowed that call data to each network in a transaction so that that's that's ethel but check this out let's get in here and look at the uh byzantine general problem so there's like a whole drawer and a whole like you can go through this like series of videos and learn more about it but we get into the byzantine byzantine generals let me load it up though because it's so cool because it shows proof of work right we've got all these soldiers and they're jamming on hashes as fast as they can if we get in here and look at this see this dude and and what he's doing is he he has a general that has given him the orders that they want to attack at dawn and all of these soldiers are working on hashing the the fact that he wants to attack at dawn so they're all hashing on the general's orders and every once in a while uh arbitrarily long you know we're going for the arbitrary target of three zeros here every once in a while a hash shows up there we go we see a bunch of them right coming up from the lieutenants lieutenants getting general bob ready for war basically proving that he has an army by using proof of work so it kind of like goes through some of the concepts and teaches you i don't know kind of in a in a weird austin caveman way too so it's good it's good for visual learners for sure yeah yeah and for the podcast listeners that weren't able to listen to that basically it's just an array of like if-then statements and each uh each one of those if then statements is basically a function and austin's put every single like relevant cryptographic slash web 3 smart contract like primitive into this array then you can just make dependencies on it and it it like you said it's very very good for visually understanding kind of what's going on and helps like some unlock uh just some aha moments and helps people connect things visually but i'm um what i thought about uh when i saw that was that you're how you started building a game first and then you started building each build and what really kind of east build seems like it is is like kind of the underlying structure of like a game it's like a game without a skin on it there's just the underlying like systems and like you could in theory like layer up any skin around this thing and turn it into like some sort of like i don't know internet flash game or something um and also the other thing that comes to mind is like well since this is all like a drag and drop like open sandbox the ease of producing some sort of like game structure has the cost of producing one has like dropped to zero um austin who else uses this app and like what do you what are you hoping uh its usage kind of turns into so yeah it's kind of like tinkering by the time you get like you started you mentioned that like you could technically write smart contracts with this thing this is more like kind of wiring up boxes to like let's let's do a transaction let's get the output from that let's look that output up let's take that json and turn it into an object it's kind of lower level things it's not like higher level by the time you get to the point where you're like deploying smart contracts with the thing you're like wow this is clunky like there's there's another layer here and that's kind of moves on to scaffolding and what what that's this is more for just like tinkering around it's not as much for building like really heady large projects and more about just like testing your assumptions what happens if i try to make a transaction with no two address like what happens with that call data just like trying things out to see how they work and it was mainly built for me to be able to explain things like the best way to explain a private key is basically like show someone and generate those accounts and check the balance right i could explain it but it's like way easier to show it there so like eath build was more for me to show off they're teaching different concepts yeah exactly but it's also like a dashboard the quickest fastest dashboard to making a specific transaction i can wire that up real quick and i can share it with everybody on my twitter like in 10 minutes and then they can land there and they can hit the button and it'll be their metamask and they'll they're they'll be making the transaction so you can make quick dashboards with it but it gets pretty messy pretty quick okay so then how does it fold into um into uh scaffold.eth okay so scaffold eth is like a decentralized app building toolkit it's it's all the stuff you need to build a decentralized app in one repo and it's it's really hard to build your stack your stack has to be like pretty complicated if a new person were to just dive in and wanted to get straight to tinkering with solidity you could start with remix but as soon as you needed like a local stack and you were ready to build an app out of it you it would take you a long time to get that stack and i've seen people like over and over again create their own stack and it ends up like it's hard and there's a lot of little things you need scavoli kind of does all of that out of the box the key piece the key piece is this right here where i have my smart contract so i have my smart contract on the left and i'm able to make just like small changes to it and then a yarn deploy so i deploy that smart contract locally and it's going to give me like an editor over here we're going to see this change and so this allows a developer to tinker back and forth and try things and kind of like play with it and build on this so i'm going to say hello you'll notice like there's no like meta mask pop-ups happening here like scaffolding uses burner wallets uh at first so while you're on local host i can just sit here and say hello world and i can hit send and i can actually like make a transaction and send it in and kind of tinker with my smart contract add things to the solidity poke at them from the front end and so you get in this nice dev loop where you're kind of like learning as you're building but then at the end of it you have like a deployable app like it's not just like tinkering in remix you have like a full app supporting you and you can deploy it and i can give you like i could make an app that does something really interesting here like like we could charge you to set the purpose and have it on a price curve and i could deploy it in about 15 minutes and i could get you the url and then you would have that new smart contract with the token and the and the whatever weird thing we added to it and it would just be like tinkering here and getting it right and then doing a couple commands to to deploy it with scaffolding and you would have like a full-on website that's backing your smart contract so this is like my new place to tinker and it's a nice like starter kit for developers so what would be no this is great what would be like the minimum viable thing that you could build there like just to make it concrete for listeners yeah i mean like let's yeah like let's let's let's make something so if if if i'm sharing my screen uh you can see the solidity here and i have this set purpose function basically what we have built so far is like an attestation machine say uh preston whenever he puts out a new version of prism he wants to like sign the specific version hash on in a smart contract so everyone can see it he could do that with with what we have set up so far it's a it's kind of like a centralized like only only one person can set it but what we could do is we could require something let's do this let's set up price let's make it let's make it like money based right so i'm going to set up a you and 256 public price so i'm just going to set a price function of like it cost you uh 0.1.01 ether right to set the function so i'm going to make this function payable and then i'm going to require that someone pays the money so basically we just change that function from anybody can call this and it kind of just like is an attestation to anybody can call this but they have to pay some price basically whatever money they send in has to be greater than or equal to the price or we'll say not enough there we go not enough oh man but uh let's go ahead and deploy that and we can kind of iterate on it and we can test to see if it works so we're going to make sure that they have to pay some certain price and you'll notice that our front end is going to auto adapt here there's a new field here so now someone says hello world they need to pay .01 eath and we take it to whey here this is like a programmer's thing like i force you to learn whey while you're doing this which is kind of like weird and strange and what is this evm and why does it not have floating point math and some of those intricate things that you kind of trip on the gotchas hopefully they're like more obvious here but okay so fine we made a thing with the price let's add a price curve i think you i think it i think it failed hit that button again what i said it said you didn't have enough money oh yeah i don't have enough money so i gotta go to the faucet here let's let's get some money okay there we go now hello if only there we go now now we set it okay so what i want to do though so that's cool we basically change the function from being anyone can be there to now you have to pay a certain amount then i'm gonna do one other line of code and i'm gonna say that the price is after someone purchases one the price equals price times like 101 divided by a hundred basically like making it go up one percent each time so we just made a price curve right like with that little line of code so that i mean like this is a superpower of ethereum developers with a a small amount of knowledge can write single lines of code that create new financial mechanisms and so what i'm doing here is just like let's make that as easy as possible for you to get to the part where you're tinkering with those mechanisms and then learn your way kind of out of the onion and and so there we go like we've deployed now let's see if i do hello world it's going to cost me but look now our price went up right now i need to pay that much when i say hey right and if i if i try to say hey hey again at that price now it's gone up another percent this should fail and say something like not enough we can kind of test all the different conditions so so just by like adding a couple lines of code we've kind of like totally changed how this thing works and you you can like start to think about well how do we want people to use it what behaviors do we want them to have how can we program this thing so the financial incentives are lined up for those things to happen and you're off to the races i could so now i could i could yarn build and yarn deploy this thing and have a url where you could then get in here and pay let's let's just let's just work on that let me let me just do that while we're talking go go ahead though you go ahead so yeah it's really like so you're we're buying something or paying for something that keeps going up in price and so i don't know this could be some sort of uh ticket so what in in very very basic terms like it could be like an nft sale like a vending machine yeah it could be anything yeah a vending machine but like this unit goes up in price uh by one percent anytime somebody purchases something and then you could just probably slap in just like well it goes down in price every block by this amount and so you could slap in two mechanisms uh and like so i mean basically we're all talking about the power of smart contracts again um but like i think a lot of people kind of skip over the fact that like how primitive some of this stuff can get uh and like how what some of these like very basic building blocks look like this like that that little price function thing here is like something we added to like moonshot bots with a walkie like out the door let's put a price function on it and instead of raising 20 grand it raised like 2 million dollars for public goods because that price function went up and we were able to like people were willing to buy that you know we were able to price it correctly i guess is the right way to put it like price it in in a way that people were willing to pay for it and it also like moved a lot of capital and into capital into public goods and into that into the multi-sig so yeah small small small changes make big primitives make big changes in in terms of right what you can build and how people can use it the gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since i got into crypto i used gemiini to both

friction free so austin you're one of those colorado public goods people that's my category for you you uh danny ryan kevin owaki um it's a good group yeah can you uh can you connect some of the stuff that we've just been talking about with these primitives and and and public goods and public goods funding and kind of just like uh why are these two things relevant and connected to each other so i can uh i'll even and and carl uh flourish is not at all a colorado dude but he's kind of like a key a key actor here in terms of retroactive public good funding goods funding what would carl be like if he was like a colorado stoner i think he'd be a different he'd be a different dude yeah anyways so imagining i'm channeling my my colorado carl right now like retroactive public goods are kind of like the the hottest new thing for me right now like we're able to retroactively uh start rewarding folks that have provided value and that kind of creates an ecosystem of if i create value you know the phoenix will rise and i will probably get get retroactively funded for that so so talking about this mechanism of we just write a couple small pieces of code and it does this whole new thing we built uh oe40s i don't know if you've seen the 40s have you seen the 40s oh they're they're great let me so it's uh i gotta gotta share my screen here probably go go to here we go here we go let me let me share it again just because it's worth it uh so 40s are uh just a small so first of all like you're writing oe 40. me you're you're writing the svg in the smart contract so that's one weird thing that's happening here is the smart contract itself is drawing this this svg and i can even if i connect as me and that's not i mean like svg nfts have been around for oh i gotta get in here and do this thing here i don't know if i did it right it's so weird typing in your password when everyone is watching it out loud that worked i didn't sound it out that's right okay waiting on meta mask we're waiting on metamask okay so small changes of code so first of all like there's a lot of like weird code here because the smart contract is drawing the svg but this is pretty cool because i can do stuff like i can sip i can call sip on the 40 and the liquid is going to go down a little bit and and the sip is actually happening in the smart contract so the amount of liquid like how full this thing is is actually like a smart contract uh variable that you're keeping track of so none of this really applies to you can make small pieces of code and it changes everything and it's retroactive public goods but i promise we're going to get to that at the end of this 40. first first i just want to sip i just want to sip a 40 and talk about some of the mechanisms here we go so let me let me sip on this 40 real quick oh i need to have my wallet on optimism notice that nice little warning that like your wallet's not on optimism that comes out of the box with scaffolding so i'm going to pay about a dollar on optimism and i'm gonna call sip and if we look closely the liquid should go down and my buzz should go up so as i sip the liquid goes down and i earn a new erc20 token what is that it's called buzz i don't know we just decided that we were going to do that like every time you sip you get minted 420 buzz i don't know why it was just a random primitive we threw in there to see what would happen but there's an even cooler perimeter primitive here if i drink all of this 40 it's going to be empty and i can recycle the glass so this is a new primitive that we built into the smart contract you can you can basically uh turn in you can redeem your 40 your empty glass 40 for 1 420th there were only 420 minted one 420th of the eighth in the contract so the 40s contract holds some amount of eath from all these people minting and you can get basically your money back by recycling the glass and that's like that's an okay primitive but what this has created is anyone can yolo public goods funding to the 40 contract not the eight pack it's one of these here buzz this one right here the oe contract if carl decides that oe40s or if carl decides that recycling your oe 40s is a public good he could yolo funds from the optimism validator pool money stuff that i don't understand for public goods into this contract and it would incentivize folks to recycle their 40s and that's just another line of code that we added in that said okay we're going to add a redeem function and when you redeem you get 1 1 1 4 20th of the ether in the contract it's like three lines of code or two lines of code but it creates a whole new mechanism of if people yolo to the contract they're actually going to artificially raise the price floor of the nft and incentivize the folks that got in early or incentivize the folks that kind of helped contribute so i'm going to pass this to you what's your what's your ens can i pass you this oh my gosh or connects it to my argent wallet so it's like it's not actually very useful okay okay well i mean i mean smart contract wallets those are pretty cool all right well yeah but it's my ens name yeah do you you just need my my my uh meta mask yeah sure yeah yeah okay uh how do i pass this to you uh uh here these 40's this is like a half drank 40. it can't be worth that much but these 40s are worth like point two there we go uh let me go find my chat here we go uh oh no in riverside oh ooh yup i see it i got it here we go all right i'm gonna send you this 40. oh but i'm gonna wrap it first better wrap it you want it to stay cold right preferably yeah yeah so i'm i'm going to send you this half drank 40 but at least i wrapped it up that was that was nice all right there we go send do you have any optimism eth you have to have no need to sip on that yep well someday soon there you go i just sent you 40 number 419 uh a classic and you can sell it okay so yeah how does this connect to um to retroactive goods funding can we can we go through that explanation 40 yes the 40 is a retroactive public goods funding nft we want folks in the space to be deploying their own nfts and raising a small amount of funds to get to some milestone where the ecosystem recognizes them as a public good and you can yolo eth to their nft contract to fund the early funders that got into the contract basically with three lines of solidity if if you own this nft you can get your cut of eth out of the contract so so it's about getting folks in the space to deploy nfts with this mechanism so when we want to retroactively public goods fund them we can just yolo eth to their nft project does that make sense so there's kind of like three yeah well i want to yeah i want so so the actions that we that you did where you sipped the 40 what what what action is that oh that has nothing to do with no no no it has nothing to do with the buzz the sipping the buzz that's all for fun just saying like that like a sip is like one function we keep track of where the liquid is no i was just saying that gives you the the malleability and that's just fun playing around with crafting and okay that doesn't matter i thought that mapped on to the structure of no the key retroactive public goods funding is you give the nft or you sell the nft to early supporters and so people so so there's there's your core team there's your early supporters and then there's your retroactive public goods funders the the gods from above sort of and so if if a project wants to get to a milestone they deploy an nft and say we're going to go to this milestone and they raise a small amount of money from a small amount of early supporters and that's it they go do their thing then later on if they did their thing well they're recognized and it's like oh we gotta we gotta give props to those early supporters how do we do that it's really complicated no it's not because there's this mechanism in this nft that's like really perfect you just yolo funds there if if you did well we're gonna we're gonna yolo to your nft project if it has this public goods mechanism of letting people redeem their nft for a cut and it allows it allows other people to sort of if you go watch carl's talk he talks about how we want to have an nft that represents your project and you have early supporters that are in on it and as milestones are met we want to artificially raise the price floor of your nft and this this mechanism allows us to do this every time you hit a milestone we yolo five eth to your contract and the price floor goes up a little bit and so like that mechanism is hard to do if you think about well like well we have to create this price floor and we have to run bots on on open c that are like always bidding at the price we want no not at all you write like just a couple simple lines of code in the solidity that say you can redeem this for your cut of the eat that's here and that's it okay so the nft is just like how is it different than a like a splitter contract that just like divvies up incoming funds like what additional mecha because yeah can you explain the difference because it's more than that it is that but it's more than that right it would be cool so so this is another this is like another fork of this idea that i'd love to see is early people get in on the nft and then anyone can yolo split to all of those people that's another like cool mechanism this one is saying you can redeem your nft only once and at the time that you redeem it you get whatever cut you want and if if it's if you redeem it at the first milestone and we go two more milestones like there was there was money to be had there if you would have like held on to it i guess um okay okay so there's many nfts for a project and you as an individual could own one of them or something or is there one nft uh i think the goal here is is we need to think of this kind of like vc funding and we need to think of this as each project or even each project's big set of milestones could have its own nft and the people that really wanted to see that project get done could be early supporters and then the people who decide wow that project was very important can be yolo retroactive goods supporters so so each project having its own nft think of it like a token launch think of it like an ico right your your nft launch is in in effect like raising you a small amount and and hopefully getting you to that milestone and if you do well at that milestone you'll get retroactive public goods funding wait so i'm so confused if there if there's one single unit of an nft or if there's one like nft set like you know board okay okay so let's say yeah so let's say build guild v3 is about to come out right i would deploy i would deploy an nft for build guild v3 and i would give uh basically i'd give a bunch to all the people who have already supported the nft like not just one nft i give like 10 nfts i give like evan van ness like five nfts i give like martin from gnosis who's like yoloed 5k to the build guild a couple times i'd give him five or six of them right i'd give adam the guy who helped me build nifty inc i'd give him five or six right so i would give a a handful of the nfts just just so like you know like you could get paid at milestone two with a couple of those and then you could get paid again at milestone five with a couple of those thinking that like i want to give you some granularity with how you can like choose to to redeem those so i would give a grip of them to a grip of people that helped out early and then i put the rest of them up for sale saying if you want in on this like here's the price curve and you can buy some of these nfts too and help us raise the funds so like for free i would give a bunch to all the people that supported us then i would sell a bunch that helped me raise funds for the build guild's next milestones and then hopefully six months from now i can say we we raised these funds for this milestone using this nft project carl do you think that was a public good and he could be like yeah that was actually a public good i'm gonna yolo 10 eth to the contract and now all those folks that got those can like redeem them for some public goods funding does that mean why why does why yeah i think so i have more questions though why does it need to be an nft and not just an erc20 token yeah it did no there's nothing no difference there if it quacks like a duck already like then it's already what it already is so it's sort of like the cool thing about making them in nft is like there's more to it than this is this fungible asset there's like this cool 40 that you can sip on but uh yes you could also just have a token sale in 2022 if that's what you're into right yeah so like how that's kind of where i wanted to go next like how is this really all that different than just selling a token you're giving some tokens you're like pre-sale or you know advisors or like giving amounts of people that contributed and then you're just making the token available why don't like why aren't you putting it on uniswap because it already has that price that's what it would take right so so if you wanted to retroactively public goods fund an erc 20 token you would buy a grip of them and then put and then have half of them be like you you would you would be the liquidity provider at that point right if you wanted to you could also yolo into an erc20 i think that like the the 721 part of it is just like you can do so much more with these collectibles and it's a little more interesting model and the doing the yolo into the contract makes it more simple like basically what needs to happen here is we need to get everybody doing it if you had to convince everyone to do a token sale right now or you had to convince everyone to mint an nft right now i think you'd have an easier time convincing groups to min nfts but maybe not maybe i don't understand like i'm on the lower like builder landscape i don't know the the higher like i don't pop up from the weeds very often but i would say that you would have an easier time convincing danny ryan to release an nft to raise funds for protocol guild that would be trent then you could say deploy danny token like it's 20 22. no one wants danny token i mean like i want danny to my heart's danny ryan but like most tokens i don't want i don't want right okay yeah i take the point like the nfts just have much better optics in branding but i'm still trying to like figure out where the magic of retroactive public goods funding comes from because like what's the secret sauce that makes this all work because so far these primitives we already have so why are you getting excited about it where what's the new novel thing that retroactive public goods funding is bringing to the table if we're really just talking about a re-wrapped token sale in nfts that's a good question i think the the the novelty of even retroactively so like again this is like this is out of my pay grade this is carl and vitalik territory here but i think that there's this novel idea of retroactively funding people that is good like the overall ability to say this group did well how do we fund that group for doing well retroactively because it's a lot easier to say these guys did well rather than we think this group and this group will do well we switch it around and say who has done well already and let's yolo to them and let's make it a theme that the ecosystem understands that doing well equals getting getting and i think so to even like lean into what carl is really going for is there's how much value you're providing the ecosystem and how much value you're extracting from the ecosystem and he wants those things to line up and there's a lot of people here and there's a lot of people here and figuring out how to get those things to line up is like the the goal i think with with retroactive public goods funding and i think the key mechanism is you already know they did well so you can yolo to them instead of we think they will do well and and we yolo to them and then i'm down on the lower level saying how do you yolo to them and how do we convince them to deploy a token so we can yolo to them okay so it's about the order of operations of where the funding comes from and i think maybe it's following the model of like uh the ico mania versus defy summer where the ico mania was token first well then the promise to create the value but defy summer was well we already made the app so now here's the token and so it's the and the that inverse order of operations actually made things much more sustainable and was one of the reasons why defy summer works and so maybe this is tapping into that same energy where like if people are given assurances that they will get funding in the future if they do build something then they can build something without doing like an equity raise or a token sale or a private vc fund something something because they have the assurances that they can get paid later so it's more about it's the i think perhaps if that's what what's correct about this you know if carl flourish and patel gives us a thumb thumbs up then this isn't really an even an innovation at the smart contract level but it's an innovation just in like the social level social or the cultural level it's like a nucleus new social contract and and it's there's one little thing there is the the there's there's early funders that are funding you it's not that it's not even exactly the team saying we're doing something neat here and so we want to make sure like we're doing something neat so we'll eventually receive funding it's more like we want to receive funding now from some some early like riskier folks and those riskier folks are thinking they will get active they'll they'll get public goods so it's it's the social they'll get they'll be compensated for their risk yeah it's the social there's this kind of like middle group of people that are willing to gamble on the early uh uh project knowing that there's this social contract that good projects get retroactive funding so there even is like some speculators in the middle there that kind of make it work right and it is still like a vc model i i'm always pushing for like let's make it smaller milestones and smaller amounts and let's make these nfts interesting and useful and have utility but at the core of it there is like yeah we we have dug down to finding ourselves in ico as we've uncovered the the masks right well at the end of the day all of this energy is like the same like icos worked hands down like icos work or at least they did uh and something about them did and it's just about like taking apart any part of the icos that worked and putting it in a correct vehicle that is sustainable and good okay so if we if we could look at the top six icos and we took that amount of money and we divided it to the top 80 projects instead of the top six projects i would say that the ecosystem would be way more interesting right now i think that the ico craze concentrated a lot of capital in certain places and if we could have like distributed that better i think we'd see a lot like you you were complaining about arjun i think arjun's dope i i use argent all the time i wasn't complaining about it i was complaining competitors right like if there are four argent competitors and there are four gnosis competitors right now you know i don't think argent was even part of the early ico but i'm saying there are certain projects that we it would be valuable to all of us users if all of that capital wouldn't have gotten totally concentrated in gnosis it would have gotten concentrated on the the six people the six different groups that were thinking about multi-sigs right now and we had three decent multi-sticks right now instead of one decent multi-sick right now i think i think the other part of uh retroactive public goods funding that uh i want to talk about is well it also takes a commitment of funds right like people somebody has to actually donate funds and so at the end of the day don't it is dependent on like donations or some form of altruism but kind of like the bitcoin matching pool right like it actually requires somebody to actually put up my funny somewhere money somewhere and so like somebody actually has to yeah it doesn't actually this isn't like a fundamental primitive without without the external uh incentive turns out it's internal funny in our platform in our protocol we are programming in burns and money burns all the time with all sorts of different mechanisms one of those mechanisms here would be the optimism verifiers validators the optimism the something that's happening within optimism is generating like millions of dollars worth of fees and those fees oh yeah the the sequencer for the latest sequencer there we go it's not even a v word it's an s word that those sequencer fees are are getting collected and they like do they go to optimism no optimism is like no let's give these to public goods let's figure out how to like make this thing this whole thing kind of regenerative economics thing happened okay but that that is the donation though because optimism like that's the business model for layer twos uh and so their what optimism is doing is optimism is just taking like the profit and they the or the revenue of the layer two uh uh and then they are saying that they are redirecting it into retroactive public goods funding so i like base they they are giving up profit which is very much in alignment with optimism's ethos like their uh what's that what's the title of their their organization um public public benefits company public benefits corporation uh rather than like a for-profit company or for-profit corporation with like many of the other layer two competitors are and so where the other two layer two competitors are like hey this is our revenue um probably ultimately giving that to a token optimism is is putting it into retroactive public goods funding probably also to the token when it eventually comes but uh maybe optimism is taking retroactive public goods funding as a strategic bet that's strategic to yeah yeah to grow out the optimism layer two ecosystem in ways that like other ecosystems don't have this tool in the toolbar because they haven't invented it yet and so it's like it's basically optimism is creating like a pro programmatic way to fund development on their layer 2 using the revenue from the mev basically which is what the sequencer is getting out of the layer two uh and then they're injecting it into a pool of funds that will be redirected towards all these different projects and startups that are building on optimism that sounds like a holistic i think they're actually i think their strategy is ethereum aligned if the if you have ethereum a lot of optimism is ethereum austin right right right yep right it's oe we can see it it's not e it's [Laughter] right right so yes i think that they're very value aligned with ethereum and i think they're making a strategic bet on ethereum as a whole not it's not like we're going to make this mechanism and all these cool things are going to bloom specifically on optimism it's more like we're going to make this cool bet for ethereum all these things are going to bloom and we're going to be part of that in in optimism yeah but also just to drive this point home the optimism's going for uh evm equivalence which is like their main differentiator they're made like strategic differentiator as a layer two uh and so when optimism builds something for ethereum of value optimism itself also taps into that value that it created for ethereum more than any other layer two because of how uh far the optimism team has gone and attempting to make the optimistic roll up the the virtual machine that's on the optimistic roll up basically identical to the virtual machine that's on the ethereum l1 and so the bet is that the optimism optimistic optimisms flavors of optimistic roll-ups are just easier to mass-produce easier to replicate easier to have dev tooling for easier to deploy apps on and so whatever value they contribute back to the ethereum ecosystem they actually get back towards themselves too because they're the most aligned with the ethereum network and like that evm equivalence is everything for an evm maxie like myself who has all these tools that only work in evm equivalent environments when we when i was working on that smart contract earlier with those rules i can say yarn deploy dash dash network optimism and it's going to go there and it's going to cost me a few dollars and it's going to be quick and easy and i can deploy a website and you can go interface with it and it all works exactly the same for me so like for me on the other side like it almost has to be that's almost like table stakes it almost has to be evm equivalent or i can't do my stuff can you yeah can we dive into that a little bit more because i've always wanted to actually learn what uh evm equivalence looks like from the developers perspective uh so can you explain can you give us like the a b test as to like what scaffold.eath and each build and all that stuff would look like as you kind of just did under an evm equivalent paradigm on optimism which is what what you showed versus an evm compatible yeah no i don't even like i have an evm network locally and i deploy against that and make sure it works and then i just point those two satellites at optimism or covan or or any other evm equivalent network and i hit go and it all works exactly the same as opposed to like i think starkware has cairo it has its own language that you have to learn to be able to run on it and so that's just like a it's another thing that the developer has to learn to be able to like just put things on that network now like this the con of evm equivalents is they're probably doing some shifty stuff getting getting it to work correct in optimism there was even a thing where if you burned a contract it actually was creating the funds and going one way and keeping the funds in the address so there's one little glitch in how it was evm equivalent and someone was able to find that and they got like a two million dollar prize because of finding it but there was like any little difference in evm equivalents can then be ex you know you can extract a ton of value out of that so there's it needs to work exactly the same and i just need to be able to yolo the thing and it needs to do everything it needs to do i don't need to want to i don't want to learn a new language or get a new tool for this like i need to it needs to just be like it works on mainnet i just turn it at optimism and fire it there and it works there so that's why that evm equivalent is important yeah if you pointed it towards arbitrary how much more work would it get to make it all work on arbitrary i think it all works i think there was i was just on with daniel from arbitrary yesterday because of my punk wallet was sending so basically i didn't i didn't change anything i just pointed it at arbitrary and the sins were failing and i couldn't figure out why and i hollered at him and i was like hey i'm and and it turns out i was hard coding 21 000 uh gas which is what you would normally do on eth you would say you know i'm just sending each so i'm going to hard code 21 000. turns out that was like 450 000 on arbitrary because they've got to do some other stuff and stuff that's like way over my head but i i happen to be in my tool hard coding it the way i thought it was going to be instead of like querying the network and asking it for what gas i should use and it was throwing that error and so i was able to go to him and say what the hell is this and he's like oh you're gonna you can't do that like it there's a there's a couple different assumptions over here it's gonna work the same but you you can't like hardcode that at 21 000 you need to like let it choose its gas naturally so there's probably some things with gas limits that my tools might hiccup on but that those are small changes usually and then you're off to the races deploying and using it like you would okay and is that difference that hiccup it was that would that be a symptom of the difference between optimism's evm equivalents and arbitrary evm compatibility yeah i i would say yes i have no idea yeah yeah yeah i don't know that like intricate details of why it cost more gas on arbitrarium and why like how the gas structure works on optimism remember caveman breaks optimism's design philosophy has always been like reduce reduce reduce reduce like they want to reduce as much code as possible so i would imagine they get um gas feed benefits from that design philosophy um austin what do you what do you what do you do most more recently what have you been thinking about like what are you building on right now what are you hacking on or was it so like biggest biggest things right now for me are getting people to speed run ethereum so developer onboarding developer tooling like it's a it's a complicated thing to learn but it's not that complicated if you have the right materials and there's just a shitload of materials out there there's like 400 getting started with ethereum guides but i i would be willing to bet that retroactively we could look at folks who have gone through all the different methods and i'm telling you speedrun ethereum is one of the best so if you go to speedruneetherium.com if you're a web 2 developer you'll pick it up quickly it's like the quickest uh most straightforward onboarding i can create after like years of mentorship sessions and kind of figuring out what sticks and what doesn't so speedrun ethereum is like the first thing good onboarding it's like a bunch of challenges you have to actually write solidity like i'm not it's not copy paste you're not following like there's a nice tutorial to follow but there's going to be like all right now you got to write staking function go like so there's there's stuff that you have to write then from there comes like build guilt and i talked earlier about scaffold eath and how it's like a starter kit a bunch of people started forking scaffolding and some of these starter kits and making new starter kits with that and it was this really cool like cambrian explosion of daps where i was like oh yeah like all this neat stuff is coming out of this so i wanted to incentivize that and that's what the build guild is so i'm streaming to like 40 or 50 developers i'm streaming eth it's a very trust first stream they get in at any time and withdraw for what they're working on they can only withdraw so much over a period of time but it's a smart contract that i o load that you know streams eth to 50 developers so i'm selling some of my my own funds and i'm streaming them to developers to build like generic components and tools and kind of like the next phase of like what what is what does speedrun ethereum look like in six months let's have people like thinking about this and building challenges what what are people multi-cigs let's go let's look we really rode on the multi-sigs today so after you finish the first three challenges of speedrun ethereum i really recognized in a space that we need more forkable multi-sigs all of these dows are using one multi-sig and they're mad about it we need more multi-sigs like let a thousand multi-sigs blossom and to do that uh basically challenge four is this telegram group that you get upgraded to if you go through all of speedrun ethereum so to get in there you already have to know how to build a staking app but an nft app and a token vendor and once you're in there it's a telegram group with all of us talking through and building our own multi-sigs so it's just like a cohort of builders building multi-sigs and so there's like a starter kit that i started with but then like you know 20 or 30 people have gone through it already and made their own starter kits so they're it's getting better and better and so it's getting to the point where someone can drop in the channel grab a repo yarn deploy a multi-sig and that's easy but now it's more about like how do you like let's learn how call data works let's learn what a multi-sig actually is let's let's build in a ragequit mechanic to this multi-sig so like trying to kind of plant seeds in the right direction we need better multi-sigs let's make a multi-sig cohort and let's drive these builders in and let's make sure they have all the right tools to learn how to build that uh challenge four is like building a deck so you really need to learn how to build the decks like a simple simple decks where you keep the reserves you learn what the lp tokens are you learn how to write the price function and then like svg and fts and the thing to learn here is you need to build incentives in that pay you you as the builder need to take five percent of every nft that gets minted right here and we're going to mint it and i'm going to mint the first 10 because i believe in you but everybody else is going to mince them too and that's going to pay for you for six months to go build something so there's like all these kind of like combo moves going on around scaffolding building things building tools building things people will use building educational content and that's kind of like build guild v3 is sort of the social layer on top of all this stuff where it's like what kind of things are you building turn in your status like i'm streaming to you let's make a little social network let's let's let's like coordinate let's have round table meetings where we talk about what the ecosystem needs let's have bowtie fridays where we show off all the weird things we're building so kind of like a web 3 social network kind of thing happening around building and building generic components and trying to be a public good in the space svg nfts are hot i love them i could show you some cool ones [Laughter] awesome this is great and i think listeners will definitely understand uh why why i enjoy talking to you so much because uh how infectious your energy is uh so what's your what's your call to action for for listeners speed and ethereum for sure ghost speed now if you're not if you're not a builder that's probably different right then my call to action is tell all your builder friends to speed run ethereum when when when some like web 2 person is talking about oh man i wish my identity and inventory followed me from app to app what can i do you should speedrun ethereum [Laughter] oh man my data is stored in this this data center and i don't have control of it they have control of it you should speedrun ethereum i'm working at a shitty devops job and my source code is closed source and my boss won't let me open source it you should speed run ethereum how's that for a call to action is that right yeah that's perfect that's perfect we're gonna clip that we're gonna put that at the front of the show awesome thank you so much for coming on i appreciate it so man thanks for having me hey we hope you enjoyed
