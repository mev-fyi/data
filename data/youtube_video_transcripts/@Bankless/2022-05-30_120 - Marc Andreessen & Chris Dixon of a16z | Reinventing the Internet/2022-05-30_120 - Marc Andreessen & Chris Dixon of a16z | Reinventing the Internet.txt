there's the reality of what you have today there's all the critics who are arguing against the reality of what you have today in a lot of cases they're actually right but the fact that they're right is actually totally beside the point because what they're not understanding is the potential they're not understanding what this is going to turn into and they're in particular they're not going to understand what happens when like a lot of the world's smartest people devote themselves to solving all these problems and that's how you get that's how you ultimately get these amazing outcomes out the other side welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys we have a fantastic episode for you today this is an episode that's gonna break the internet or may or maybe fix the internet David one of those two things because we have two big brains on this podcast Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon Mark was here at the Genesis of the internet okay he was a builder in web one he turned into an investor in web 2 and web 3 and also Chris Dixon whom you know from previous bankless podcasts the master of web 3 mental models put them together and we get this fantastic episode a few things to look out for number one we talk about the original sin of the internet what exactly that is number two how web3 actually fixes the internet or maybe a better term reinvents the internet number three all the different ways crypto is like the early internet including the fight for freedom and of course Mark knows these things because he was there in the front row number four why the open version of the internet including crypto eventually wins and number five we end with this and this is a perfect way to end it Mark giving advice to his 22 year old self okay what a fantastic episode David uh any thoughts going into this one yeah we frequently used the line and we brought it up a number of times in the podcast of how crypto is speed running the history of money and finance and so uh history is known to rhyme of course and history never repeats but it Rhymes and we ask Mark about the parallels between the rise of the early internet the rise of web one and the rise of web 3 and how strong those parallels actually are all the same players exist all the same pattern patterns exist and so having this one particular person who is here for the fight of the open and free web one and is also here for the fight between uh the open and free web threes I think is a very unique perspective especially as he grew up from being a builder of the early internet to an investor in the web 3 internet he has a lot of lessons from history to teach us in an industry that is so well is mimicking the early path of its own predecessor guys there's so much more to talk about in fact David and I are about to uh to go talk about that that's contained in the debrief episode okay so if you are a bankless premium subscriber you get access to the debrief episode where

assembled we've got two of the biggest brains alive in technology investing Mark Andreas sin Chris Dixon allow me to introduce them to you for a moment although they need no introduction Mark Andreessen he is the Andreessen in Andresen Horowitz otherwise known as a16z in the crypto space he's also the founder of Netscape I believe he accomplished this feat at 22 when he built out the Mosaic browser and he is perhaps the only person in the world who navigated both the birth of the internet going from a web one Builder to internet investor to where we are today uh a16z of course is a massive investor in crypto in web3 Technologies we're going to talk about that including a 4.5 billion dollar fund their fourth fund that was just announced uh Mark how you doing I'm doing fantastic thanks uh thanks for having us uh yeah it's great to have you on Bank list we've been wanting to have this conversation for a while and of course we also have Chris Dixon who is a repeat bankless guest and one of the key people leading that new crypto fund that I was just talking about I've called him on Twitter anyway the Kendrick Lamar of mental models okay because this guy drops influential idea Kendrick Lamar but thank you you're very welcome everybody else had the Google mental model uh anyway he's certainly given bankless listeners a fantastic set of mental models through which to understand and explore this whole crazy thing we call crypto or web3 or whatever we're going to call it in this episode welcome back Chris how you doing good good thanks for having me all right uh Mark we got to set this up because we haven't heard from you yet we've we've heard from uh from Dixon on a few things already but um you were here for the birth of the original internet the thing that we now call Web 1.0 but wasn't so obvious you know it was just the first version of this thing um but there's this perception around I think it bleeds through crypto as well that there's a problem with the internet of today that it's somehow broken do you think the internet is broken today and if so where did we go wrong yeah so there was yeah I call this the original sin so there was an original sin of the internet um and it's actually sort of this it's this ironic this is ironic twist so I'll take you all the way back um once upon a time it was actually illegal uh to have money on the internet like it was it was it was quite literally illegal to do business online um or to transact online and this is prior to 1993 and the reason it was illegal is because at that time the US government was paying for the internet backbone and they had something called the AUP the acceptable use policy and it basically said that you it's a it's a research project it was a federally funded research program through the National Science Foundation and so you know taxpayer money so they quite plausibly at the time said look this is not for commercial use you can't like set up a story you can't do you know you know stock trading or anything you can't transact money and so and that you know that that began the sort of Internet ethos as as you know as a very kind of non-commercial you know thing and there were a lot of great aspects to the non-commercial ethos at the time there was you know this is kind of you know the rise of Open Source um you know the so-called free software movement and then the open source movement you know kind of went hand in hand with this and then just the general internet ethos of sharing and openness and open protocols and so forth kind of emerged out of that so so so there was a lot to like and in fact you know when I got when I got involved when I when I did my work which was originally also funded by the National Science Foundation you just assumed that everything was open source and then when we started Netscape the company you know that the overwhelming reaction we got out of the gate was well that's just it's impossible to imagine there's there's there can't be an internet startup there can't be an internet company that would ever make money because everybody knows there's no money on the internet you can't you can't do business online and so the the the the the the big reaction to an escape was just like well that's impossible like that won't work um and so you know and then at Netscape uh you know we kind of set out to you know basically turn the internet into a commercial medium like we wanted to make it real for for people in their normal daily lives um and a big part of that was to make it real for people in their economic lives um and you know and and that worked right ultimately the rise of the rise of e-commerce and so forth but but sort of the the sort of you know original sin was this sort of lack of money right um which is uh right the the big version of the internet is anybody can plug in anybody can like send email back and forth anybody can you know upload whatever data they want anybody can communicate with anybody else that's all great but you know there's no money and and by the way the fact that there was no money on the internet actually was because of a of a sort of a deeper underlying you know I would say flaw or again sort of sort of sin which which was basically zero trust right the internet was built as an untrusted Network and again you know and again like that that worked really well for what it was but there was just there was no trust there was no trust there was no money um as a consequence there being no trust and no money there's sort of none of the other aspects that you kind of expect from a modern market economy there was no concept of um incentive you know economic incentives were just simply absent and the the lack of economic incentives has caused all kinds of problems um you know including like the entire problem of spam which has been dogging the internet for you know 30 years is basically a consequence of not having correct economic incentives built in for who sends messages who receives messages um and then you know we we could spend hours talking about kind of all the all the ways in which the internet kind of you know in a lot of ways went sideways over the years because you just you couldn't have money um you know the fact the internet the sort of consumer internet economy got built on Advertising right which has all these kind of external you know kind of uh you know kind of questions issues now again it's a consequence like if you can't charge people directly for things on the internet then you know advertising is the only viable business model you know in in basically indirect payments um you know somebody paying behind the scenes so so this was just fundamental issue we spent actually a lot of time like we knew this at the time and we actually spent a lot of effort in 1993 94 95 96 trying to fix this then I could I could take take you through the sort of disaster stories of how we tried to fix it at the time but but none of the fixes took and you know in retrospect we just we didn't have the blockchain like we you know this was you know way prior to Satoshi this is way prior to the Bitcoin white paper in 2009 you know this is way prior to the conceptual breakthrough of the blockchain um you know as as sort of was first incarnated with Bitcoin um and so in retrospect like we now know we couldn't do it at the time because we didn't have the foundational technology needed to actually do this but you know but but now we have that technology and so now we have it we believe we now have a chance to kind of go back and fix those original problems I would add to that the um I mean Mark nescape created did created JavaScript created cookies right SSL too was that Nest cam okay so I mean the other the other thing I think the one I think about the history of the internet is I think it is sort of this is core Primitives which were which you need to have so if you need encryption you need ideally you have some system of identity you have some system of um money right and you were if you go back and look at it in the 90s you were racing Netscape and sort of there was a there was a fight going on so I think this is often the revision revisionist history around it there was a there were two visions of the internet there was a so-called information Super Highway which was Disney Comcast and a very centralized internet and Mark was on the other side which is sort of the the open decentralized internet and as I as I tell you you know better Mark you were racing against those that other side to add features and that's why you had to build JavaScript right you had to build SSL um and these other things so to be kind of a feature parody you know but but because it was moving so quickly you know you people didn't really have the time to set back step back and say hey let's rethink this advertising business model let's go build internet money right and even SSL right was extremely controversial and Mark can tell the story better than I can in fact it was illegal right uh 128-bit Netscape was classified as Munitions and you'd go in front of Congress just very similar to crypto today where they would say well who wants to use encryption obviously only criminals would be in terrorists and things would use it and of course mark would say well someday people will put their credit card on the internet and buy things you know buy kitchen appliances on websites and things like this and they would laugh at you and say who does that today and so why shouldn't we just ban it and so they actually literally did uh heavily regulate encryption and in fact there was a big battle to try to actually ban it all together because it was so obviously only for criminals right yeah that's right I mean look so encryption encryption right so the original crypto encryption um right being able to actually like have secrets like you know encryption has been used in like Warfare for you know hundreds of years right um all the way American Revolution they used ciphers and so forth and then um you know obviously the World War II was one in large part due to Breaking the enemy's encryption so like you know there was this there was this sort of Heritage of encryption and the sort of military intelligence spheres but encryption was never used in daily life like ordinary consumers didn't really have access to any encrypted anything basically all the way up through up through the early 90s and and actually we we negotiated we actually negotiated I believe the first contract I think we actually had the first kind of consumer-facing contract for encryption with the company at the time was known as RSA which had all of the rights for encryption at the time the encryption protocols um and so we we actually negotiated that um at the time and then we and then we we as a subsequently released the first consumer product that had encryption built in which was the nescape Navigator um and then you know as Chris says we we had to actually invent a protocol we had to invent a protocol called called SSL which was the first kind of it was which was the first encryption protocol that was used online and is is still used today and yeah so we had to do that all from scratch and then yeah we because encryption had this military Heritage there there was there was there were literally two regulatory regimes for for crypto we could actually for encryption uh we could actually ship strong encryption um inside the us we actually were allowed to do that which was good um although they kept trying to ban that um and then um but yeah it's for export um uh the Netscape Navigator was actually classified under the same Munitions regulation as Tomahawk cruise missiles at the time um right and so you could have a missile you could have like Sarah nerve gas or you could have like nescape Navigator um and and it was and it was it was equally it was sort of under the same regime and so we were not allowed to export the strong encryption version so we actually had you know at this point software still came in boxes right um and so they were literally two different boxes there was the strong encryption version for U.S citizens who got the special one and then you know there was International one and we put you know big warning label on the international one like you know this is weak encryption like this is the bad version um you know but then of course what happened was encryption was like you know it's just math right it's just math and numbers and bits and so people outside the US knew how to do it and so they started building competitive products and then we basically had this giant fight with Congress and with the intelligence agencies at the time and as Chris said yeah they they tried to ban encryption outright you know they still try every now and then it still comes popping back out again um where they you know different different governments try to try to ban encryption but they keep kind of swinging and missing on that one because it's hard to ban encryption because like if you ban encryption then everything is open for you know basically for attack and hijacking by terrorists and criminals and so that you have the other side of that problem um but you know look they did and then yeah they did all the same you know it's all the same dark warnings you know they'd come in and they do the briefings they'd give you the you know we're gonna we're gonna give you secret security clearance for the day and then they open the briefcase and out comes the parade of horribles of all the awful happening in the world right and it's like it's all going to be your fault right from here on out it's all going to be your fault like anytime anything bad happens right any time you know there's a bombing or anything it's going to be like on your head and we're going to pin it on you right and so you know they they tried all that stuff they tried all the stuff they're they're doing right now in Washington with with crypto and blockchain um and uh yeah I could go on linked about this but yeah we we flooded out we flooded out that and we're basically fighting it out again it points to this this fundamentally asymmetry as well which is with new technologies um that it takes a long time for the positive use cases to develop and especially with things like encryption and the early adopters will just naturally will be sometimes Bad actors but the good so you take on e-commerce right so encryption SSL encryption right in 1995 a senator saying it's mostly used by criminals that might have been correct in 1995 but you had this slope of adoption of legitimate uses of encryption which was a hockey stick which of course today we take for granted right but it would be very easy for an over zealous regulator in 1995 to have to have you know killed that um that growth at the beginning and of course you wouldn't even know 10 years later you've done that you know there's probably a ton of regulations that that have already done that anyway so I think we're sort of we can talk about that maybe later but I think we're a kind of a moment like that now with with you know our crypto web 3 where you know you have this chorus of of cynics who who you know sits only point to the bad things and and ignore any possibility of of good things well and I would say there's there's several and these are the counter arguments that we deploy that we deployed then and we deployed now so one is yeah the good uses use cases are going to emerge so this is going to this is going to have all kinds of positive excuse cases so that that's one the second is like look this is going to be a giant industry right this is going to be like a giant industry this is going to create jobs like this is going to create economic wealth like the job creation is itself is an actual national security thing like you actually if you're concerned about National Security you actually want your economy to do well and you want your economy to be the place where new things happen there's also another National Security argument which is if these things are going to exist you want them to happen in your country right it's a big argument we use at the time which is like look there is going to be commercial software on the market that's going to have strong encryption there are going to be hundreds of vendors outside the US who do this from all these other countries if we're not allowed to do it and then you the intelligence Community is not going to be able to get to those companies the way that you can just come like talk to us because we're American citizens and you know we're we're patriotic and so forth and so you you might not get everything you want but at least it's happening on your territory in your government you know under in your country as opposed to somewhere else and then there's just the the the the the the broad thing the really big thing which is what I keep coming back to which is like look like you know this a lot of the same people who are very worried about like bad use of crypto are also worried about like privacy right they're worried about like is are people is people's private information gonna be held secure is there's People's Health Information going to be held secure are people's you know is the national power grid going to be held secure is the banking system going to be held secure and it's the same you know evil cryptography that gets used by bad guys for coordinating terrorist attacks that gets used to secure the power grid and in all the hospitals right um and so you know it's it's a tool like an encryption is a tool it's going to get used in various ways on net overwhelmingly it's a it's a positive like you'd much rather live in a world that has high security you know than a world that has no security and then you know I think the exact same you know concept applies to frankly it applies to money right money money also gets used for lots of bad things right criminals and terrorists use money all day long and yet we don't say like we shouldn't have money because because they use it um because overwhelmingly like the the positive use cases Dominate and so that you know there there's adaptation that the world has to have as these Technologies become widely accepted but you know basically 20 years later you look back and you're like okay that was overwhelmingly good that that got adopted and then the world was actually able to adapt and that and that's basically what what I think is going to happen with crypto Mark I'm interested in gaining your perspective as to how obvious some of these things were all all the way back then because it the parallels between the fight for the freedom of web one versus the fight for the freedom of web 3 are so strong as you guys have Illustrated just now uh and I I see like me and Ryan and like a lot of this this decipherpunk ethos built into the web 3 world is truly fighting for the open and permissionless web3 in the same way that you were fighting for the open and permissionless web one of the world where we had two version two a fork in the road with two possible outcomes the centralized web with open surveillance or the decentralized web with permissionlessness and privacy and then we had the government regulation player kind of uh tinkering with with uh the incentives of everyone and having their own their own role to play and that that same exact pattern is following out now where we have open public permissionless blockchains versus centralized blockchains and we are trying to tilt the towards uh open public permissionless and private systems uh but and but I'm wondering your perspective on whether I'm being a a naive youth or not whether I kind of just hope and as assume that natural humans will always pick the open and permissionless system and crypto is just going to win ultimately hearts and minds of the people and just because it's what the people want and eventually web 3 will win no matter what uh am I being naive here or did do you actually is there a counterfactual universe where like uh the open and public permissionless web one did not win and we have a different future like how hard do we really have to fight for this thing yeah so the big bull case on the on the open systems and the internet Banner crypto now the big bull case the way I describe it is there's there's this guy Bill Joy who was one of the Legends in software who developed one of the main versions of Unix and co-founder of sun which is one of the central companies for the build out of the internet originally and he had this thing you know his son was Isis company that had developer platforms and did a lot of Open Source work and he had this thing he called Joy's law um uh after his name and Joy's law was um no matter how how many smart people work for your company um there are a lot more smart people who don't right um and so and you can apply that also by the way for countries no matter how many smart people are in your country there are a lot more smart people who are outside your country right it's the same thing and so the the advantage of an open system is that basically everybody can participate like you can go basically recruit and draft right and build a community and and you know basically every smart person in the world every smart person in every company every smart person in every country and they and they can come participate um the the economists use the term permissionless Innovation right which is like okay I want to build something new I want to build a new app I want to build a new site I want to build a new service and you know do I have to fly to the corporate headquarters of you know XYZ Corporation um you know and put on a suit and go into a room with 40 you know other people in suits and like give them a PowerPoint presentation and try to get their approval or which is permissioned innovation right right or I can just like build the thing right um and so and you know the internet was classic permissionless Innovation crypto is classic permissionless Innovation so so the the so the potential is to draft all the world smart people and then to collectively build something that's just like much bigger and better and you know more comprehensive and more Innovative than any individual company could could ever build on their own um you know kind of as Chris said though the problem with that is it's like okay it's like in the moment it's like okay everything I just described is like hypothetically possible like it's hypothetically what's going to happen right but it's not what you know XYZ government bureaucrat today wants to happen it's not what XYZ you know it's not what Jamie oh I'll pick I'll pick on the people who have picked on us so this is all me gonna I'll return a little fire I'm not gonna attack anybody but I'll return a little fire you know it's not what Jamie Diamond thinks should happen right it's not what Warren Buffett thinks should happen right it's not what certain you know government officials think should happen um and so you're you're kind of you're arguing this hypothetical against people who are like no I want to stop it now and as as Chris said like the the problem is the dog that didn't the dog that doesn't bark the problem is like if if it stopped it's all of the gains are in the out years right all of the things that were going to happen on their out years and when they don't happen like nobody ever knows that they were possible and so you're in this weird situation up front where you're kind of arguing in favor of a hypothetical future that has emerged yet My Hope right would be that like we've seen this movie before we've seen this happen over and over again we saw this happen to the internet we saw it happen to the PC we saw it happen to the iPhone like there have been lots of examples over time of how you have these systems that other people can build on top of and you get this much bigger and and kind of more powerful thing and so I always kind of you know I I was kind of I don't know I'm like they're getting married for the sixth time or something right it's like you know finally you know optimism you know is going to win over experience right um and you know finally people are going to like understand this and I just kind of find like no you know it's like whatever whatever bureaucrats are in charge of the status quo today they're still going to fight at the exact same way the last ones did you know we're going to make the exact same arguments um you know there's a generational comp quite honestly there's a generational component to it right um which is like you know kids you know kids coming up look at these new things as an opportunity for them to make their way in the world you know a lot of people when they get older not everybody but a lot of people when they get older they view this is like they want you know they have status quo bias they you know they don't want anything to change they have their existing power you know they run their existing companies their their own way and they don't want things to change and so there's a there's a generational momentum kind of aspect of it um there's a real movement aspect of it right there's a whole aspect of all this stuff that has very little to do with the technology just has to do with with with with movement characteristics like being able to have a lot of people who sign up sort of into an army and actually have you know kind of collective power and so I I think we're kind of doomed or whatever faded to kind of fight these things over and over again and I don't know I know what side I want to be on I would add to that that I think of the history of of computers as as sort of there's there's really two threads there's the open and kind of closed there's open cathedral in the bizarre if you've read that essay that was a famous essay around open source software um and so the cathedral is you know Microsoft later on Apple most of the big tech companies today are Cathedral bizarre was early PCS are interesting they had aspects of both I would argue the early 70s PCS were more bizarre and I affect Steve Jobs Homebrew Computer Club it was a bunch of you know that was effectively like a you know an nft Discord or something of the day right um and then I and then I think the big then Mark was involved in I think there was a this sort of un under understood uh history of of the internet where there was this kind of battle and the open side one um open source software is probably the most successful example of that kind of ethos playing out 99 of the software in the world now that we run is open source software um so I think they're sort of and I think so I think to me crypto has picked up that they sort of picked up the Baton there right I mean open source software continues but this is kind of the major important new kind of fight over openness I would say one thing David is a that the the open side has has Joy's law what Mark just described as an advantage the disadvantage in the open open side is you it's a two-step process you first recruit the developers and then you recruit then you build the apps right users don't didn't opt to have Linux in their data center right they opted to have a you know a system that didn't crash the developers went and built that system and a system that had robust libraries and ecosystems and everything else right and so and that that's where and that's very important for understand so like I example I use in a blog post a couple years ago was Wikipedia versus incarna so uh Microsoft had a uh encyclopedia a CD-ROM encyclopedia thing that had beautiful picture it was 1998 2001 actually 2001 I think was Wikipedia beautiful to the time you have a Carta beautiful pictures you go look up an elephant you see a picture of an elephant some you know esteemed person wrote a description of the elephant Wikipedia in the beginning is this you know chaotic show right uh you know it's people whatever putting whatever they want up um but but it's two steps right you first you recruit the contributors and once you get that that set of people that are excited in putting in good content if you look at the stats it's just hockey stick passed and the card I was shut down I think it was 2006 it was pointless right and so you get that once you hit that you get that incredible growth um but I think that's important to understand and I think that's why so much of what we've been doing in crypto in the last few years has been kind of developer focused and I think only now are we seeing kind of that second step really kind of mature um I think there's a great story mark one of my favorite Mark stories is uh um some of the this also affects your design choices so in in uh in in Mark's World in Netscape they chose to make all of the transport Protocols of you know HTTP of people that use that you guys chose to make it all text-based um as opposed to Binary right and if you go back in time I'll let you tell the story Mark but yeah yeah so protocols any so any expert protocol design anybody who anybody who had ever worked at a big company who understood how to design networks because there were networks there were computer networks for you know 40 years before the internet emerged they were just all proprietary and so you'd buy an IBM Mainframe and they would sell you an IBM Network um they had a technology at the time called token ring and it would connect all your IBM computers together uh you know you couldn't connect other computers to it you couldn't connect your Apple macintoshes or whatever to it but you could connect all your IBM computers together and so then they'd have all these protocol designers right who were like you know World experts at building Network Technology and the one thing that they all knew for sure was you you make you do you do protocols you do binary protocols and the reason you do binary protocols is because you need to you know networks are very slow at that point you need to optimize every single bit right and so you want to like optimally you want to pack as much data as possible in a few bits as possible because that's how you get performance so not not human readable not human readable so right the text is not human readable yeah yeah that's right so if you if you look at if you looked at the protocol data going over the wire right you just see a gibberish there's just a bunch a bunch of random random random numbers you know coming across and then you would need specialized software to try to decode that and repack that and this this was this whole kind of Arcane area of of network design and then the internet people starting you know starting originally with uh you know things like SMTP and so forth the the internet people started to do these text-based protocols and then HTTP was a text-based protocol and the idea of a text protocol was it's human readable right and so I can I can read it you know without having to look for things and then and then I can I can write it I can admit I can admit it right and so one of the things that made the web take off early on was that you could build a web server with uh four lines of Perl script at the time right because you could you could use all of the standard text parsing Technologies built into you know languages like Pearl and python which made it very easy to get to process and and to emit text and so you could basically have this little text processor that basically generated this this protocol and then you could create a web server to do whatever you want and you could do it very if there were at the time you know there people ran thousands and thousands of experiments of different kinds of web servers they could build and you could just kind of hack it together you could you could write a new web server in five minutes um and all of the experts right all of the protocol designers from the old world all were like you guys are out of your minds like this is so dumb like they you know this is so dumb like you guys are deliberately going backwards you are like just avoiding all the hard work of actually making this work by the way don't you see how slow this is like this is just like unacceptably cripplingly slow you've got all of these hands by the way they were in some sense right it was slow at the time you really had slow modems and so it's a really interesting design choice that you guys made Mark go ahead sorry yeah that's right so we decided to basically we decided to create a problem right because because the big problem was how do you get Broadband rolled out right so so so so part one of the problem was like how do you get anybody use the web and in that case you would have wanted to optimize performance for the for the for the networks you have then but the other question was like what could you do that would provoke people to actually roll out and buy Broadband right when that was going to be very expensive and and so we actually deliberately created the problem like we we actually made we we deliver deliberately we deliberately made the performance problem worse in the short term to actually motivate people to invest in Broadband right but wasn't it also so that by making a human radio able you are making it easier for developers you were easier developers who would then build great apps who would then compel you who would then provide a reason why you wanted to buy broadband and use those apps that's right so the user is right so the user should sit there and they'd be like wow all of a sudden the internet does all this amazing stuff and then oh my god wow is it slow yeah and then it's like then you call the phone company or the cable company and you're like well when are you rolling out when can I buy a cable modem and then all of a sudden the cable companies are like oh my God there's all this demand for cable modems and that's what rolled out that's what we're all at Broadband but right but but right the critiques in the moments of course I think this is where you were headed the critiques in the moment were like this sucks this is slow this is stupid like it's all the same thing there was another uh another analogy I always love pointing to is that that the New York Times um uh refer the New York Times reviewed the first laptop computer that shipped in the it's like 1981 or whatever 1982's and I think it's probably the compact or Osborne at the time it was the first laptop computer the first laptop computer in 1982 it weighed I think it was like 43 pounds and it was basically this giant suitcase um they called it and so you'd have like this 43 pound thing on your lap in the plane and you'd like unfold it um and you know if your legs didn't snap under the pressure it had like you know a four inch screen and like you know it's it's you know it's it's slow as hell and so it's just this was this and and so the review is hysterical in retrospect it's like you know laptop computers are the dumbest idea we've ever seen this is ridiculous nobody is ever going to buy one of these this is never going to work right and of course right what of course what what they don't anticipate is like okay all of those problems are all of the opportunities for all the entrepreneurs that are going to come along and miniaturize everything and you know create what we have today um and so again it's it's this it's this overall theme of like okay the the the the there's the reality of what you have today there's all the critics who are arguing against the reality of what you have today in a lot of cases they're actually right but the fact that they're right is actually totally beside the point because what they're not understanding is the potential they're not understanding what this is going to turn into and they're in particular they're not going to understand what happens when like a lot of the world's smartest people devote themselves to solving all these problems and that's how you get that that's how you ultimately get these amazing outcomes out the other side the mark the uh this entire conversation I do want to go back to the problem of the internet at some point as we tie out this thread but the similarities here between you know web one and what we're calling web three are just so juicy right I mean you talked about the ability to spin up a web server with four lines of Perl right now you know that was human readable but it seemed like such a bad idea at the time it just reminds me so much of like the ethereum white paper and solidity smart contracts and the ability to spin up a token with like just a few lines of code now everyone said that would be a terrible idea and you talked about um actually doing it this way created another problem which was how do we get broadband and I feel like that's very much what we've seen in the past five years since the birth of smart contracts at least uh in in our world which is very much like okay now we have Smart contracts we have tokens but we don't have bandwidth okay we don't have scalability we don't have enough block space we don't have fast enough transactions per second I'm wondering here here Mark before we get back to kind of the problem here but do you see these similarities like how how similar is web one to web3 do you just see them everywhere and you're like oh I've seen this exact same story before it's gonna play out in the exact same way tell us about the similarities but then maybe also tell us about some of the differences because each wave has got to have some differences even if it's a sort of a fractal of the last yeah so look yeah so this is the only the only time I've ever said this is like the internet is is this like I I've never if you go back through all my historical statements like what one could imagine that with my experience I could have said this like 48 times I would just like everything wait you've never said this you've never said yeah no I've never I've never made the comparison before that I can remember he never said that mobile or web 2 or any other thing well say it now or if you disagree tell tell us sorry I've never said it about any other kind of Technology ah I see I never said any I never said it about anything else between the original internet and then the emergence of crypto I never said about anything else because I just want people to know like I don't take the comparison lightly like I mean I mean the comparison I like in in the very in the very deep way um and so yeah no it is it is a very similar comparison I'll just highlight the you know maybe I'll put a point on my arguments from before but it's just like the most the most easiest way to think about it is when you get something like this that has a movement that has a sort of collective effect has a movement behind it and is attracting many of the world's smartest people to work on it basically the criticisms end up being the criticisms play out differently than the critics think so the the critics make this long list of all of the problems and you know you alluded to like you know there's a long list of all the problems with ethereum today or a long list of all the problems with Bitcoin or whatever um and then it's like you but you're getting these genius engineers and entrepreneurs right would flood into the into the into the space which is what's happening right now and what happens is they look at that list of problems there's a list of opportunities right they're like okay like that's the punch list like these are the things that I can do because if I fix these problems it's going to be really important it's going to really matter I'm going to be famous right I can build a real business like you know this is going to be how I'm going to make my mark in the world so I'm going to fix these problems and so you get I don't know it'd be like if you had a house project or something the house was going sideways and you get all these complaints and then like all of the world's best Architects and like you know Master Builders like showed up you know the next day to like fix your house like and you've got like all these incredible you know amazing you know whatever it's just like all of a sudden you've got the best house in the world right and and that this can actually happen in this kind of world this can actually happen so so this the the dissimilarity so the big dis the big dissimilarity or the thing that's not the same I think is it's this untrusted versus trusted thing right so the on the internet the answer almost always was to liberate right uh for the internet 1.0 2.0 the answer almost always was deliberate it was to create basically it's basically break down walls um have more people to be able to participate have more people be able to build apps right have more freedom you know that's why the internet had this incredible ethos of freedom of speech for a long time right that kind of it's changed a bit uh more recently but like you know for a very long time it was you know this is uh this is you know sort of inherently a free speech environment um so it's sort of this iconic you know well the the the classic essay as John Perry Barlow wrote he called this is like 25 years ago now I called it the Declaration of the independence of cyberspace right and it was basically it was and if you read it it's like a very poetic thing and it's like basically we're going to leave you and your grubby World behind right and it was again it was this kind of spirit of Liberation actually a lot of it actually came out of the 60s it was kind of part of the cultural revolution at the time and so you were you were you were kind of driving towards less you know less and less trust um you know less and less permission less and less Authority right over time and then but but like I said what were we missing we were missing the other side we were therefore missing trust we were missing you know Authority we were missing permission we were missing you know the ability to transact with people for untrusted relationships transact send money store money like and then have all the other economic Arrangements that that you know kind of that the world wants to have you know loans and contracts and insurance and all these all these other things like we just didn't have any of that and so so there is this other side to it which is at least the way I think about it is web3 is bringing trust to an untrusted Network um right but and look there was trust involved like we had people had to believe that encryption worked right and so you know there were trusted components to what we built um but the big thing here that strikes me is just like this is an opportunity to build the internet sort of Internet phase two you know or web3 is like an opportunity to basically build trust into this untrusted environment and have people come out the other side of this being like okay like for example we could actually imagine the entire entire global economy running on the blockchain like we like the entire thing like we can imagine 30 years from now or 50 years from now like the entire global economy Cuts over right and everything Cuts over and right and what would it mean for that to happen and how would people have to feel about that and that's a that that that's a very different kind of problem than the one that we had Mark Mark one thing I want to jump jump on here because this is uh something that that bankless um it believes a lot we we often say here when they adopt crypto protocols they adopt crypto values and it strikes me that one of the things that was done very well in web one was the preservation of neutrality yeah like um you know TCP HTTP could not differentiate and make a judgment call on what Free Speech was allowed and disallowed right and what seems to have been the case is with the Advent of of web 2 let's say we started to inject another layer into this kind of like a governance a decision-making type layer in into the process and at the base protocol Maybe you know everyone has the right to say whatever they want and that's great but now that's a few layers down we have this app layer that is now making governance type decisions so you have Twitter in a place where they have to decide should we ban this person or not should this speech be allowed or not and one thing that we see as part of the bank let's move in the web 3 movement is this getting the internet back to the basics of credibly neutral protocols on the base layer that can't make the decision hey you can't send this money to that specific address right no anyone can regardless of race gender you know socioeconomic status where they live in the world all they need is an internet connection and they're treated equally by these protocols as some of the restoration of the dream do you think that that how does that sound to your ears does that sound naive are we just like building the same thing and you know it's gonna all consolidate again and aggregate again and we're back to the same same boat or is this kind of a refresh in a course correction on the direction that the internet's taken in the last couple of decades yeah so the real illustration to your point is what happened with this issue called net neutrality right um and so you you correctly describe what the ethos of the internet was you know kind of up until basically around 2015. in fact you know Twitter originally described themselves as quote the Free Speech wing of the Free Speech party right was kind of this you know kind of this thing and again it was very consistent with the John Perry Barlow Declaration of Independence and cyberspace is very consistent with the open source ethos um so yeah I think you very accurately describe that um that movement that that that ethos culminated in what was known as The Net Neutrality movement and to this day if you type in hashtag net neutrality on on Twitter it's got the special emoji that pops up like this was like a you know this was a big deal a few years back lots of media coverage lots of lots of activism and if you remember like the big fear of the net neutrality activists right the big fear was basically without quote unquote net neutrality regulations big companies would be able to regulate speech uh big companies would be able to basically decide who could say what they could ban they could censor they could be platform whatever um if today you do a Church there's almost a one-to-one correlation between the people who were Pro net neutrality and the people who today are pro-censorship they they they did in almost every case they've done a 180 and and and Google Google's still honest enough Google has its own issues now they do their own censorship but like they're still honest enough where you can go back and you can find all the news articles in the net neutrality days and it's it's like shocking like how many of those people did like a complete 180 uh and are now very much activists for for uh for censorship um Davos is happening right now um but by the way I want you guys to know I'm skipping Davos um so that I can be on this podcast amazing Bank let's not Davos no that was that's not true at all that I just I just completely that is completely lied but um but um you know Davos is another it's already coming out it's just an it's an orgy of basically self-congratulatory demands for for more censorship and again it's like it's the exact opposite of what a lot of these people were saying even even three or four years ago and so yeah there very much has been an an ethos shift and all of the big internet companies all the big kind of proprietary Network stove pipe you know kind of wall Garden things that Chris talked about like all these companies they're under like intense pressure to sensor Indie platform and block and we can spend hours just talking about that yeah look I mean the fact that web3 is open you know like we've been discussing open protocols open networks permissionless like is is definitely an architectural drive back towards the original internet Vision back towards a vision we're consistent with what you might call Net Neutrality um I 100 agree with you that basically technology technology does bring its values along with it like there is a there is a there is a um you know there there is a real link there so so I think everything you said is true I I would give one cautionary note though and this is just based on a lot of scar tissue over the years which is you know look everybody's in favor of free speech up until some point right and so and you can take some very basic ones everybody's in favor right up to the point where you have child pornography right or everybody's in favor of it right up until you have terrorist recruitment right um but we have ways to solve that in web one Mark I mean it's not like web I mean it's this the frustrating part for me in this debate with web3 is well look I mean web I mean the world didn't end with web one we we just took things down at the at the website level like you don't take it it wasn't regulated the protocol levels regulate the Gateway same with email it was a more decentralized right I mean it was regulated by laws and then implemented by a decentralized group of web hosting providers and email hosting providers Etc um as opposed to being implemented and and decided by a you know one of five big companies yeah that's that's right well I mean look where we ended up is not where we started like it it I I totally agree with that and yeah look there there are practical things to do this is kind of where I was heading which is like look every new technology um uh has everybody seen the movie Public Enemies the the movie about John Dillinger the great Michael Mann uh movie about John Dillinger um Johnny Depp uh it's a great movie about John Dillinger a lot of other Bonnie and Clyde was another movie like this so when the car was invented like when the car was invented actually two things happened in the 1920s 1930s one is the automobile was invented like that was a big deal at the time and then two is um the Tommy Gun um uh automatic weapons automatic uh rifles were used for the first time in World War one and so the military had all these all these all these tommy guns and a lot and a lot of people got got trained up on these and a lot of these guns became available um you know kind of throughout the world and so there was this crime wave in the 20s and 30s John Dillinger and and all these people Bonnie and Clyde and basically it was the car plus the Tommy Gun and they went on this like you know basically you know National Rampage right you know stealing from all these Banks and like the banks at the time were like not prepared to deal with like professional thieves with cars um you know who had like machine guns um and so there was this like mass panic in the 20s and 30s about oh my God right the combination of you know the car plus the machine gun has basically like banks are all dead you can't you can't put money in Banks anymore like this is you're not gonna be able to protect money anymore like the world's coming to an end it was this it was this thing and of course what happened is like you know Banks adapted and police forces adapted and the FBI was formed and you know people figured out ways to do like time release Bank vaults where the manager of the bank can't even open the vault and so you can threaten them all you want and still you still can't steal the money and you know now they have you know controls on you know when you can do wire transfers which of course has now led to things you know demand demand for things like Bitcoin right and so the point is like there there are there are ways to adapt there are societal adaptations there are ways to deal with these things you know the the world finds a way like these things adapt but I just I just wanted a specific answer to your question um you know there there is going to be another side of this there are there is going to need to be attention paid to certain things that are like fall Anarchy is not a good idea either there are going to be attention paid to certain numbers of things and then and then and then the question ultimately is a question of judgment right uh it's a question of judgment on the part of leaders and then ultimately the part of the community which is like okay how do we draw these lines and then how can we use all of the experience of the past to be able to make a better set of decisions today um and I you know I'm quite optimistic about that but there will be some some high tension questions here also earlier we touched on the critiques of web3 and how you kind of Illustrated them well those are all just all the surface area for entrepreneurs to Sitar start tackling uh the way that we've talked about this on Bank lists is that uh when like the gaming ecosystem says hey get your nfts out of our game or the Arts uh industry says hey get your get your tokens out of our Arts really they're just saying uh pushing back on the industry and saying hey you guys haven't solved enough problems yet come back to us when you have but there's one conversation when we talked about um credible neutrality and governance over these applications that we all use that I think is differentiated from just the evolution of web one into web 3 and is actually unique to our industry where uh Twitter and Facebook and generally web 2 platforms are de-platforming people uh now we can have this into the hands of the community with tokens and governance tokens and the community can govern over these systems uh but a critique that I think is unique to web3 is that well as soon as we instantiate government governance and into Capital assets then that becomes the surface area for that becomes influenceable by capital and so uh Mark I'm wondering your thoughts on this particular critique of web 3 whether we truly have broken away from typical centralizing forces of capital and Power in the world and these things can actually be uniquely Community owned and Incredibly neutral yeah Chris why don't you take a swing at that I'll follow up yeah no it's a good I mean so it's an interesting question um you know I guess I mean sort of referring to kind of like bribery governance bribery attacks I guess um I mean like I would say I mean the way my mental model for software is it's it's it's it's as it's as flexible and sort of plastic and medium as something like you know writing fiction like it's you can you can express in in the form of tokens anything like literally anything any design somebody can think of you can write software to implement so you know I think this by no means are we done exploring that design space and it may just be that for example having the same token you know governance system and also provide economic rights to the system and be influenced by Capital maybe that's a bad design or maybe there's you know various safeguards that need to be put into place for voting thresholds um uh sort of bicameral systems I've seen I've seen a whole bunch of different designs you know recently in all those areas right so so I think I think it's again I think it kind of goes back to Mark's Point like to me this is just another really interesting problem for entrepreneurs to kind of go go figure out um and you know and I would imagine that enough smart people thinking about it in a really really rich design space that that is software right can can come up with some really interesting systems so yeah we have examples where it works by the way sorry about what I'm saying like I think like I would say like maker down as an example I think is a well-functioning Dao it's not perfect but I think it basically has worked for five years and done what it said it said what they plan to do and you know I think there are other cases like that in D5 and other areas so go ahead Mark yeah look the other thing David I think to your question so look you also get into like political philosophy here and political Theory and political history right so and this is kind of implicit in a lot of the assumptions around these things which is like okay you know is sort of the logic is like finally we're going to have a technology that's truly Democratic right and and finally we're going to have like finally to your point like finally it's going to be one man you know one person one vote or one bot one vote or like whatever you know um uh and it's gonna be you know and finally we're gonna have systems that aren't you know hijacked by Capital finally we're gonna have systems that don't have you know the hierarchy that don't have the power law distribution of of influence or authority or financial return or whatever and it's like okay you know look this is a chance to like try those things and experiment with those things you know look having said that there's a lot of political history on this question of like what democracy actually is and you know um uh Machiavelli who wrote about this at length basically said he said there's he's he said basically he said there's three forms of government rule by rule by the one rule by the few and rule by the many and then he said there's a good and bad version of each of those forms of government so there's basically six total forms of government ruled by the many if if the good version we call democracy the bad version we call Anarchy um or or by the way these days we call it populism uh right um and so like democracy is good when the mob goes your direction uh democracy is very very bad when you're on the other side of the mob um and if you just look at like the entire history of democratic politics going back now thousands of years you see very few actual full democracies but by the way we actually have one in California we have this whole direct democracy thing with this ballot proposition thing and it's it's just like a freaking disaster like the the every almost everybody in people in California agree on very little almost everybody agrees that direct direct democracy in the form of ballot propositions is just a horrible thing which we can talk about um you know the the florentines actually tried to direct democracy they actually put the the people in charge for about two years and I think the late 1400s it was such a catastrophic experiment they never they never repeated it um right because collapsed in Anarchy and so so basically what happens if you look at the history of kind of politics basically what happens is nobody actually does full democracy what they do is basically um you know sort of a democratic backstop with the selection of some kind of decision-making uh sort of capability that's actually going to be you know some somewhat rational um and some coherent you know in the American system of democracy that that's why we're in a representative democracy not a pure democracy you know that's why we have we have elected officials um you know historically uh most democracies have some kind of overlay like you know somebody's in charge open source software you know develop this on its own right open the the idea of like fully democratized open source didn't really work what you had instead was the emergence of the benevolent dictator right so the line is Torvalds right who would kind of help Shepherd the entire thing or you know for Bitcoin the Satoshi um you know or for ethereum vitalik who would kind of help help Shepherd the whole thing and so when you get into this what you kind of find is you actually tend to want kind of hybrid or mixed models off the other side and there's and then there's like a lot of questions and you know kind of opportunities to kind of design that different ways um I I just go through that to say I would not be disappointed if the ideal of full democracy doesn't happen here in the way that people might hope because I think that might be an unrealistic expectation but it might be possible and I think is possible and I think is happening to have a whole set of governance models that let different communities make different trade-offs um on how this actually unfolds um and I and I and I actually think we'll we'll learn a lot on how we can structure political systems um in this new world I would also add that um you know my understanding you guys may know better as to why for example vitalik is against Unchained governance for ethereum is kind of for similar reasons right so you effectively you effectively get the governance through the through the node operators right people the validators the wallets decide what to upgrade to I would argue that as I would argue that that even with pure on-chain systems that over time they end up being more hybrid systems because the nature of software is it gets integrated into lots of different places and if those places so you know as let's just imagine so uniswap today is fully on-chain governance let's imagine a world five year from now where uniswap is sort of embedded throughout the fabric of the internet at that point all of those various integration points will also effectively get a vote on like on on changes in Forks to the protocol um and so you know so I think I think actually I would argue uh on the internet as things get more adopted you actually add sort of more more and more I mean look at like Linux today look at python there's all these you know they can create the new version but there's you know forks and debates and you know as these things kind of get more and more embedded you actually add up add a lot more kind of friction points to the to the governance process it does strike me that what we're doing is something that David and I have talked about with Finance but it's also true of governance we are speed running all of Humanity's governance uh like governance debates experiments would have been bad and we're doing that in crypto and we're doing that right now so so we'll get all possible experiments in including the new ones uh and uh I want to go you're just making the point about uh uniswap and we're talking about the similarities uh with with web one I remember guys it was not too long ago three years ago when people said crypto was dead including Bitcoin ethereum is dead smart contracts would never work Defy is not a thing don't even talk about it that's by the way when we started the uh the bankless newsletter okay and shortly after we started the podcast now uniswap today okay Tuesday uh May 24th just hit over a trillion dollars in cumulative a trading volume him okay a trillion dollars and so this is another I another I guess uh piece of evidence that we can add to to the list of people being wrong about technology and being wrong about the power of the open permissionless internet because now here's Unity well I would add to that by the way you know I looked at all the Dex designs before uniswap um you know as you remember they were peer-to-peer and they had to do matching and you couldn't do them it was very hard to do them given the ethereum performance characteristics and I remember a lot of people saying basically you're never going to have successful decks until we have much more performed blockchains and then sure enough this goes to our earlier conversation the power of developers you know Hayden you know aided by vitalik's blog post comes along and you now have the peer-to-pooh model right yeah same thing happened with lending and compound and Ave um and I think so I think it speaks to a whole bunch of things including just when you create permissionless systems with eight billion people interesting things happen and smart people come up with things that that might be affected Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now Ave V3 is here av3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of D5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to Port their Ave position across all of the networks that Ave operates on like polygon Phantom Avalanche arbitrum

staking so if you don't have a ledger Hardware wallet go to ledger.com grab a ledger and take control over your crypto you know one thing that strikes me though we've gotten this far in the in the podcast right and we haven't actually talked about the um the definition or the solution that web3 brings I know we've done that in previous podcasts Chris but uh I want to link that in for the listeners maybe maybe this is their first podcast they're learning about crypto for the very first time so we've established kind of the problem what is the problem with the internet today right we've talked about this we forgot to put we didn't put money in the browser for lots of different reasons that that Mark said that's that's resulted in basically our eyeballs are getting sold so the business model of the internet is advertising we also have some new trust assumptions so everything is very very trusted we don't have the decentralization of the original internet protocols and this has caused uh a lot of trouble including you know censorship type issues so these are some of the core problems of the internet today but I think on the on the listener's Mind who's gotten maybe to this point in the podcast you guys talk about web 3 talking about how great it is you're talking about how it's like it's like web one and how like that fixed so many things what is web3 and how does it actually fix these problems maybe Chris you want to start with yeah so I think look so actually it was kind of kind of the framework for this recently so I the way I think about a sort of blockchain to the kind of core core core Tech here right so blockchains are I think of them as new kinds of computers that have new capabilities and specifically allow you to make software that continues to run it's designed I call it computers that can make commitments and then on top of that you have kind of two overlapping but slightly different movements like one we call crypto which is sort of this movement that involves money and D5 and then web3 is kind of my favorite sort of version of the movement which is a tilts a little bit more toward uh Reinventing internet services in a way that that in a way in which they're owned and operated by communities instead of owned and operated by companies um one way we like to phrase it is um the first year of the web roughly 1990 to 2005 democratized information so kind of the killer feature of web one was you go to Google and anyone in the world can go to Google type something and read about it right web 2 democratized publishing anyone in the world could go to Twitter to Facebook type something into a box and share it with the world right um and and by the way that was amazing and web 2 was I think generally a very net positive thing but it had one kind of drawback which was sort of all of the assets and control and money and everything else went to a small set of companies web 3 I think of democratizing ownership and specifically through tokens nfts and fungible tokens these are units of ownership and control governance and and economic rights um and to me like an example of a kind of a killer experience in web 3 was the uniswap airdrop right so you know swap created a token the token controls the protocol it's effectively by having a token you own you own part of the protocol and the day they created that token they gave I think it was 15 of the tokens to all the people that had used the protocol in the last couple of years so imagine if you know we saw that with Uber or Airbnb or some other kind of system where the people that really built the network ended up owning a big chunk of the network right the default Alton web3 as you as you know is at least half of the tokens end up you know being airdropped and given to community members based on various behaviors and this is this is a great thing for a number of reasons I think one I think it's just a just a better model so that people can can actually you know earn um you know have ownership over the things they build um I think it also solves a really important problem for entrepreneurs which is traditionally when you build networks which are most of the most valuable business on the internet internetworks the hardest part is this what we call the cold start problem it's the beginning it's the chicken and egg problem of getting over that kind of initial hump where it doesn't have enough kind of network effects and value and tokens are an incredibly powerful tool for incentivizing that early stage and kind of getting through that so I think if in the strong form if we're right we will see over the next 10 20 years a whole set of both existing kind of networks that we're used to you know social networks uh things like Twitter and Discord and a bunch of other things which in fact we funded a bunch of stuff like this recently and also brand new networks maybe it's a Marketplace for AI data or some other kind of thing I'm not thinking of right now and it'll be architected in a way that kind of has I think it's the best Best of Both Worlds the open democratize governance control and economics of web one but the advanced functionality of what to so I really think that fundamentally it's about democratizing ownership of the internet democratizing ownership so in the same way yeah web one democratizing information web 2 democratizing publishing web 3 democratizing ownership and Mark I want to throw this one to you because I know you talk about uh social structures and how it impacts Society these days and when we were talking about the original sin of the internet and how we didn't embed money in it it kind of broke the internet or it turned it into a down a path that created some social problems some some uh flaws in our social structures and as we were talking about uh governance and and political democracy and also how about uh uh crypto speed running the history of social organizations all of a sudden when we talk about the web one two to three going from from read to read write to read write own it's that own aspect that really makes it politically relevant and all of a sudden governance and social structures become really really relevant into the world of web3 so as somebody who's watched the birth and progress of web one two and now three are we on the cusp of seeing the full man of State manifestation the full expression of the actual true internet uh and so when we look back in history we won't we'll just see web one and two as just like these early stages trying to bootstrap web three uh and so what what happens next when we finally bake social structures and governance structures into into our internet platforms yeah so this has to do with the role of money so I'll focus on money for a moment and then we'll go to the deeper concept of trust so this goes to the role of money which is like a lot of intellectuals are very made very uncomfortable by money right well say a lot of people are made very uncomfortable by money but but intellectuals in particular are very uncomfortable but with money because like you know in the intellectuals view of the world like it should be ideas that win and money is sort of a corrupting influence and ideas and you know so forth and so on and there's there's a lot of that kind of in our in our politics and you know that you know a lot of people have had that view and you know maybe maybe there's aspects of that that are that are correct um you know there is another view which I think is let's say more correct and that view is that money is a tool right money is a way to do things money money basically like money at the deepest level like money is crystallized human effort right it's crystallized human productivity right I I you know when I was a kid I had lots of minimum wage jobs like I had a very tangible relationship with money you know and I worked really hard all day long washing dishes in a hot restaurant after 10 hours and then I got a certain amount of money out of that which was the crystallized result of all that work that I could then go you know use to buy things that made my life better um or I can save the money invest it and so forth and so on and so so there's this incredibly positive aspect to money which is it's a way to basically crystallize human effort to be able to actually incent people to do things to be able to actually measure the actual value of things to people right as expressed by you know price signals like it's sort of this this foundational thing like we we would say we would very much not want to live in a society without money um in fact we tried that and it was called the Soviet Union and it did not go well um you know it's actually really funny like Star Trek every new Star Trek series like it basically they try to basically like it's like oh yes you know our system is face communism like we've evolved Beyond money and I'm you know I'm sitting there just like oh God like you know more you know more more mass famine and death this sounds great um so like money money is a fundamental tool for building everything that we consider to be modern civilization like whether people like it or not like that you know that that that is the thing so I know let's go deeper into like what it means for trust so what there's a great book that goes through this called the the mystery of capital um by this really legendary guy it's really well regarded uh Economist um very deep thinker um uh Hernando de Soto and uh who's actually by the way I think I'm pretty sure he's Venezuelan by background which is kind of you know ironic Bittersweet given what's happening in Venezuela right now um but um he talks about the the you know which is going went for full socialism and now is is going into the the classic kind of kind of meltdown but anyway he talks to this book about mystery Capital he says basically if you go to the Deep foundations of what made the modern world possible he said that the big economic turning point was um clear title to land um it was the ability to actually own land and it was the ability to own land knowing that it wasn't going to get arbitrarily taken away from you um right because if you have clear title to land then you have a motivation to improve the land right and you have motivation to turn the land into a farm or to be able to build a house or to be able to build an office building or you know do whatever airport or whatever it is the things that that people do with land and basically what he said is that that was the turning point for what we consider to be modern civilization uh clear title of the land and then once you have ownership of land um it's it's the it's the core asset like it's the foundational asset and then once you have clear title to land you can borrow against the value of the land and what he basically shows is that basically everything else that happened in the economy that resulted in the consumer Cornucopia that we're all surrounded by today is a consequence basically of originally being able to borrow against land value it's borrowing against land value that made businesses possible Right right main investment in business made r d possible Right the whole idea of being able to you know employ Engineers to work on a project like it was only possible once you could actually you know basically unlock Capital by bargain against the value of land and so anyway I go through this to basically say there's there's a very deep thing here which is this concept of ownership like this concept of ownership this concept of title this concept of assets this combination this sense of like I can actually own something and it's real and if if I do nothing I will own it in perpetuity um and then you know at any point I'm in a market economy I can sell it I can realize the value you know that inspires people to start to think very you know kind of creatively about the kinds of things they might want to own or that they can borrow against it and they can start to uh you know start unlocking other value investing and things um and so I just think like and again this this is the Deep kind of interpretation of the original sin of the internet like there was no ownership like there there was just no ownership there was no ability to have a claim in anything like web 1.0 like it's actually you could own a domain name like that's the closest we got was that you could own a domain name right and by the way like some domain names are actually like very valuable and have turned into real assets and people have retired on the basis of domain names that they own and so that was like an earlier and by the way that was and I would also argue Mark that the domain owning the domain name was pretty much the linchpin of how we kept web one decentralized right because you could if you're if your hosting provider messed with you if your email provider mess with you you could switch right it was the ability to switch that one little it was actually a really interesting architectural fact of web one which is very it was sort of DNS was the original blockchain it was the one thing you could own and and we kept my view of it we kept overloading it and then it's a longer conversation but try it again with RSS in 2008 and it just it just it just wasn't it just in the end a domain name in my view is not a consumer product it's eight dollars a year it's you got to be a semi programmer and it just that was the moment at which web one kind of just started losing because DNS could only be overloaded so many times longer story but sorry go ahead yeah well so there's a counterfactual so people may remember Chris mentioned RSS all right RSS was basically an open protocol to do blogging which basically turned into social networking right so you know basically Twitter started out as a micro blog and so there was an open protocol for blogging called RSS and like there's a counterfactual universe there's a is that what they say in the Marvel there's a there's a there's a there's a Multiverse there's another Shard of the universe uh that we're not in in which RSS had basically Bitcoin right or where RSS had crypto where RSS had value um and then you had it you would have had an alternate World in which this entire world of social networking and user generated content would have gotten you know built out completely differently in an open model well and like a new identity namespace follow like you know that all that stuff right that's when Twitter and Facebook Etc stepped in and said hey we'll do that for you because there's no way to do it in the open internet right to store your how do you store your friend list in the open internet like without without a company back then right you didn't have a blockchain sorry right that's right that's right that's exactly right and so so yeah so basically like this is that this is the opportunity to do that like we finally have the technology to be able to do that we finally have the technology to be able to go deep to be able to establish trust to be able to establish money to be able to establish incentives and then to be able to establish prices and I I think and again I think there's a national intellectual instinct to basically say that you know if it's if it's capitalism it's bad and evil and I guess I would just really encourage people to read read the book The Mystery capital and to think hard about the fact that actually there's a lot of virtue and a lot of positive things that come out of being able to actually start to have real incentives and real prices and when we're right on the cusp of being able to reinvent the internet around those ideas one of the uh the uh most favorite podcasts that we've done on the bank list podcast in fact the only podcasts who have actually dethroned uh Chris's podcast was uh titled the crypto Renaissance and when Mark when you when you tell me that uh the for the way that we really unlocked the next era of humanity was via unlocking capital from Land by providing strong property rights strong assurances that you own the things that you own uh and then you're also taking me through a history of just having the internet allow for more expression right first you want a domain name then you can get your Twitter account and connect with your friends and express yourself that more that way and now we have the erc20 and ERC 721 tokens which are just the full spectrum of possibility of expressing human interests if you can code it you can put it into a token and so I'm wondering just what you see when we finally kind of work out the Kinks of this whole web 3 thing like are are we just on a cusp of like a uh an explosion of culture an explosion of selfish expression is that what you see coming out next oh yeah for sure look I mean for sure that's that's a huge thing here actually this is why we take nfts really seriously um and I know and I'm not the last thing I'm going to do is give advice on people buying or selling or whatever I don't mean to do any of that but like the reason we take nfts really seriously we take nfts really seriously all the way up to it including all of the art experiments that are happening on nfts um right which is basically right exactly right like it's it's a it's a way to connect culture um basically to the Internet it's a way to connect art to the Internet it's a way to actually have ownership of art if you look at the entire history of art if you look at the entire history of art it's always been a really big deal uh to be able to have ownership of art it's always been a really big deal to be able to fund art to be able to have provenance of art to have artists being able to make money making art right and you know to this day when you buy a piece of art like you you want to know who's owned it like the value of the art is very much tied to the provenance like is this actually from the original artist and do you actually have the chain that basically says no this is actually this was actually you know hanging in Andy Warhol studio in 1973 it's not just a you know it's not it's not a fake um and so yeah I mean look from an art and culture standpoint like we take that stuff incredibly seriously um you know look one view of this is that um you know that basically I I think that makes a strong form of this argument like the world has a fraction of the level of art that it should have right there's just a fraction of the amount of music that there should be there's a fraction of the number of books that there should be there's a fraction the amount of visual art that there should be um and India why is that it says well like funding art has always been actually a really tough problem uh right in fact you know traditionally traditionally artists play this role this incredible role in developing you know communities because like artists you know famously like artists are always starving right all The Cutting Edge artists are always Starving in the beginning and so they always move to like whatever is the cheapest neighborhood and then that begins the process of like neighborhood revitalization it's because like the artists have no money because nobody's willing to like stake the money up front for the artist to be able to do to do his or her thing and so you know quite literally to be able to have the ability for an artist to be able to go online and do this and to be able to you know access a a an entire Global Marketplace of potential collectors and and sponsors and patrons I mean you see you see this now right you know patreon you know has played oh you know patreons like a signal flare you know uh um um uh sub stack you know we're involved in sub stack and they're you know they're not say they're not yet in this world but like you know there's a there's an amazing surge of incredibly high quality writing happening on substack you know that literally was not happening before that like it's just been summoned into existence by the ability for people to actually to get paid doing it and so I yeah I'm I'm incredibly bullish here that we could have a level of of explosion of global creativity that we never even imagined was possible Mark I do want to uh just address the the criticism even more head-on than the question David asked uh earlier because um like thankless we we believe all of the things you're talking about about the potential of unlocking property rights for the internet Potential from yeah we're on board okay uh and we've been on board but there are some you know critics uh obviously you know one criticism there are a few there are a few and by the way if you are a web 3 critic come on Bank list we want to talk to you uh but one criticism actually came from a camp that was uh surprising to me and uh that was uh late last year from uh Jack Dorsey it was actually you know one of the original founders of of Twitter which is uh obviously an incredible product in the web 2 world uh and he said something to this effect you don't actually own web3 and by you he meant everyone who he's talking to the regular people the VCS and their LPS do it will never Escape their incentives it's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label know what you're getting into okay and I saw this tweet and I saw stories sort of echoed and I'm wondering what you make of this criticism uh Mark and then like also is this also kind of a current thing criticism I know you've used that that term uh sometimes I'm seeing a lot of these current thing criticisms in crypto whether it's you know ESG and Bitcoin mining or whether it's you know some of the criticism coming from uh politicians on the left or the right what do you make of this criticism and others like it yeah Chris do you want to start on the on the jackstone well just on the on the specifics of the web three thing like look I wish we were three I mean I had him but I mean we like the the norm and I think across our portfolio is sub five percent of the tokens that we own um and I think generally like the entire you know set of investors is definitely well below 20 um like if you and I think the trend is actually downward um and so and this is by Design I mean like you know uniswap 60 of the tokens went to the community I think the norm is 50 to 60 will go to the community another chunk to like developer grants and so it's a you know it's a minority uh significantly low like a lower minority position across the board both economically in terms of control um so I just don't think it's empirically true uh you know I hear it also the other kind of form of it is like the Moxie kind of thing that says look we have these new things re-centralizing like openc I think they fundamentally don't I think I think that where I would disagree with him is that you know open C sure open C is a centralized website but they have real competition from multiple sources because the nft they don't hold the nfts people go to openc and they think it's architected the way that Airbnb is architected and all the inventory is owned by the by the company that's not how blockchain technology works right those nfts are on the blockchain and therefore anyone else can pop up a competitor and so and that puts significant pressure on the take rates that these companies can take open seat takes two and a half percent that's unheard of in the web 2 world it's so low so I just think it's you know I just disagree on the on the facts on that claim I would also say you know with Jack Dorsey I think I think he shares a lot of our vision like the blue sky Twitter project my understanding was it was an it is an attempt to create a decentralized Twitter I think we just disagree on some of the details like I don't think the right way to build that is on top of Bitcoin in fact I think it's impossible to build and top Bitcoin and I feel pretty confident about that because we've we spent 2013 through 15 me and Mark and some some of the rest of us funding and trying to do that so look if he's if he's right God bless him and that if you can build Twitter on bitcoin like more power to them I don't think it's possible so I you know I think I think we actually I would argue really overlap a lot with Jack Dorsey and his values and just maybe have disagreements on some of the details yeah and then on the broader topics um so I look I I a lot of the a lot of the other critiques that you mentioned um a lot of them is basically it's a sign of this sector and these Technologies kind of getting wrapped up into larger social and political debates that are happening kind of across our society um you know I think that's overwhelmingly a testament to the importance of what's Happening Here Right like it's one thing there's this great book another great book I'll uh I'll recommend this book written 50 years ago by this guy Elton Morrison about the societal adoption of new technologies and he says societal adoption and new technologies always follows a three-step process as uh uh Step One is ignore uh people just like don't pay any attention to it because it's just you know obviously silly or trivial or people just don't even haven't even heard of it um step two is refute um in which you get a long list of basically substantive objections right it's like the the examples we went through around the internet early on or the the early luggable PCS you get all of these actual concrete objections to why the new thing can't work and then step three he says step three is name calling right step three is when people get mad right and and step three is when people get mad they start doing name calling and the reason they get mad and they start doing name calling is because they basically realize in their gut that the new thing actually is really important like it's actually a really big deal it's not going away it actually hasn't been ignored it can't be ignored it hasn't been refuted and can't be refuted uh ultimately because the problems are going to get fixed and then and then basically it's going to be a thing and when it's a thing like when a when a new technology comes into society and actually works it it represents a reordering of power and Status right and it and it you know it basically shifts who's in charge and it shifts who has Authority and who has influence and ultimately right who makes money and all the all these all these other things um and so people people get like really really upset and basically like I think that's the phase we're entering now um and and as part of that is you just basically get the technology all of a sudden gets wrapped up in these broader political and social debates where people are kind of already mad about the direction in which society's you know headed or they're already scared about the direction society's headed um and so they they they kind of pull all this stuff in um I guess I just say look it's you know it gets you get into politics I don't really want to get into partisan politics you know it gets into these political debates um you know and by the way there is opposition there are arguments against all this from both the left and the right so it's not like either side is is completely clean on this but I guess what I'd say is there what I'd encourage people to do is try to like pull the issues back apart a little bit and kind of look at it and kind of say okay how many of the critiques are just like flat out anti-capitalism right how many of the critiques are just flat out people don't like capitalism people don't like money they don't like you know anything about it they just inherently distrust and disbelieve anything involving money um you know like some people are just anti-capitalist and I I probably can't reach them um if again if you're if you're interested in this there are there have been outstanding books written uh Thomas Soules another great author to read a lot of his work on Milton Friedman um uh and others where they talk a lot about um uh bhagwati is another guy I'll send you guys links to uh talks a lot about this um there are um there are really really I think uh important reasons in which capitalism has been a fundamental Force for for positivity and progress and human flourishing on planet Earth for the last 500 years and I think that will continue and a lot of what we're talking about here is like a new turn on capitalism and so you know I think that that's one thread to pull on um you know look then there's just all these intersection points about you know censor ship and so forth and again here people need to decide what they think but you know Western culture Western Society civilization we have a you know like an 800 year Heritage now of freedom of speech and freedom of thought and freedom of expression and freedom of Association and I I happen to I happen to think those things are important I'm old-fashioned I think those things are actually quite important um I don't think anybody should be in charge of controlling what other people say I think that's a very bad idea um and so I think that these Technologies are very powerful at being able to you know put in place systems with much more freedom of speech freedom of expression um and so I you know look they're they're all legitimate social and political issues um I just think like if if you if you pull them apart dive deeply into them look at the history uh in my view there's there's a lot here to be very optimistic about I would just add also internally to crypto right there's there's there's multiple things going on too right there's sort of the speculative aspects that do exist in this world um and then there's sort of the Builder aspects and obviously I think all all of us here are kind of more interested in the building aspects but but at various times like two months ago maybe the speculative aspects got more prominent as prices went up and this and that shapes The Narrative around the space I think also I think the history of my view is the history of the space with Bitcoin and a lot of the early Bitcoin adopters being kind of libertarian has uh has created a narrative a mainstream media narrative that crypto kind of skews right and that as Mark said has I think has inserted crypto into this kind of national you know political kind of food fight that we have um I obviously I look I obviously think the technology is politically neutral um it can be used in a variety of different ways um I do think I think what you know one reason I'm fans of what you guys are doing with permissionless and bankless and just sort of this General kind of let's call it the the ethereum and related movements is I think it's going to as as as this movement becomes more prominent it's going to make it clear to people that um that this is sort of a politically you know important this is an important technology that cuts across uh partisan lines I kind of liken that to open source so you may you may know that the open source began very politically with Richard stallman and sort of this anti-copyright movement and then morphed into you know with Linux I think particularly into a really a pure Tech movement and I kind of think the same thing kind of is happening now in crypto and so that's sort of an important thing that we can do us in the community is sort of push forward and show people all the different use cases um today we announced an investment in flow carbon which is a system for putting Carbon offsets on on on the blockchains um you know which is an example I think of of a of a use case that that you know I think is counters a lot of the anti-environmental kind of arguments around crypto so this is one of many examples I think you'll see over the next couple years certainly and uh I think if bankless says anything it helps the crypto world win the hearts and minds of the people uh and that is really ultimately how we uh become immune from uh current thing attacks where for some reason people just decide that way they don't like us anymore um but but Mark taking lessons from from web one and the rise of the internet how did how did the internet supporters the free and open internet supporters win the hearts and minds of people and overall just uh how will if we can extend the trajectory of the internet from the lessons that you've learned over the last few decades uh how is this next decade for for the web 3 world want to play out well it's the the the the truth wins I mean look in the long run the truth wins um uh and so and and and look the truth I mean look what at least what I believe to be the truth like that that the internet was like a fundamentally good thing fundamentally good thing first you know not without its issues but like a fundamentally good thing for human civilization for Western Civilization is fundamentally a good idea for people to be able to communicate to be able to you know transact um you know that the the world is a much better place as a consequence um and so you know if that's the truth then people feel it they experience it in their daily lives and they know it and they understand it and they they buy into it and you know like you know democratically we live in a democratic system Democratic world and like if people want if this is how people want to live their lives and they get value from it then it is ultimately what they'll do and I think the same thing is true here I mean look like I said none of this this is a complicated thing it's not like there are never any issues it's also not like you know everything always works right it's also not like every project succeeds um it's also not that there aren't legitimate criticisms along the way or big debates to be had um but if the result of it are systems that people use in their daily lives that make themselves and their families better off um that that that that that is the core truth um and and then the the system I mean at least in the west um you know for a long time now like the system will adapt to that um and and and uh and these things will you know will will ultimately happen um and so anyway I don't know like you know it's like I don't know yeah you always have like a lot you know there's always arguments on all kinds of things and people always have all kinds of agendas and everything and then at the end of the day what you're left with is like okay what what is the actual truth of the thing um and I feel so one of the reasons I'm so excited about this is because I feel very confident in that like that I have total certainty on so Mark let me uh let me ask a you know another maybe maybe more direct more more personal in some ways questions so um you got to board the first wave of the web and you're like 22 years old you're starting this new internet thing you know what advice we have a we have a lot of uh gen Z listeners okay that think David and I are boomers okay because we're you know like Millennials all right uh but what's your advice to the 22 year old somebody's young just getting into the space super excited by what they're hearing about in crypto how do they ride this wave of the next decade or the next two decades or what you've done which is you've made it like a three four decade thing yeah well first of all I'm glad you clarified I I do think of Millennials as Boomers I do think it's from the other side I do I do think that I do think that they are conjoined uh uh you know us poor gen extras I don't know we're kind of getting squeezed out somehow um but uh let's just say I'm I'm I'm hoping that gen Z saves us because uh it's certainly not going to be either the the members of the Millennials um so no no I shouldn't say that some of my best friends are boomers I shouldn't say that um so uh I mean look there you know there's there's the broad there's the broad patterns of everything that we've talked about in terms of the you know the kinds of projects to be involved in and the kinds of things to shoot for you know look a lot of the advice you know for for younger people I think it's it's basically it's always the same advice it's it has to do with basically how to make your way in the world um and how to choose what to work on and then how to conduct yourself um and so look I my my advice I always get people is like look like look for a place where you can make a contribution uh actually well here's here's a maybe a thing people always talk about follow your passion I don't really believe and follow your passion because like if your passion is like basket weaving or whatever like you know great but like that's probably not you know gonna yeah like follow places where you can make a contribution like find the thing that you can really contribute to right another way to think about it is pursue less happiness pursue more satisfaction um it's something to think about right like happy happiness is like a an ice cream cone and a warm summer day the first one is great the 30th one is disgusting right like satisfaction is like deep and enduring satisfaction is like a battle hard fought like a project that took a very long time that you had to really put a lot of sweat into and then ultimately like you you saw it pan out you know months later and maybe it was actually painful the whole way but you're very you're very satisfied that you did it and you're very proud of it and you'll tell your grandkids about it and so look for the places where you can make a contribution look for the things that are satisfying um as compared to happy uh you know so basically go deep like you know go go for the things that matter um and then you know the other two things yeah I think you just always have to say is look it's it's all of this stuff ultimately it's about people um you know every business ultimately is a people business you know we see this adventure all the time you know we sit around all day long and argue about Technologies and Trends and markets and you know protocols and all this stuff and and it's all very interesting and it is you know it is important but like the the overwhelming thing is like the quality of the people um and then how well the people are able to form together as a team right almost everything great in the world is the result of teamwork and and so what makes a great team is it's like okay people who actually like share a lot in common who share a very you know at a very deep level a point of view about something that they want to do and that they're willing to actually come together as a team and supplement themselves to some extent as individuals into the team uh to build something bigger than they could build uh individually and so you know attach yourself to the right people you know think very hard about that um and then look you know I'll give you the ultimate unfashionable advice you know for young people is like you know hard work right like like that you know one of the huge advantages of being very young is like work-life balance is often not you know not a huge requirement like you know if you don't yet have a family you have a lot of freedom to kind of Define how you spend your time um and so there is no substitute for hard work um every great thing I've ever seen happen in the world has happened is the consequence of somebody who were like really like put poured their heart and soul into it um you know at a very intense level for a very long time um and you you have this window before you have a family you have this window where you can really dedicate yourself to something like that and I think that's very well worth taking advantage of amazing advice set to end this on hard work when applied with leverage will get you far and that leverage can be web three that's what we make the case for every every single every single episode in Bank list uh Chris last thing for you of course uh a16z just raised its fourth fund this may be the largest crypto fund that at least I've ever seen maybe the you know the biggest yet 4.5 billion dollars what are you gonna do with that money and what are you looking for yeah so we're going to do what we always do which is we're gonna invest uh Venture investing uh mostly early stage so we've earmarked a billion and a half for seed stage and then three billion for Venture um you know invest in great people Big Ideas over the long term you know we have a 10 plus year time Horizon on our investments um we're gonna you know really invest in also uh uh things for the community so we have a new research team we're building out which will help our portfolio company with with hard technical problems but also we hope to do a lot of things um uh for you know everything will be open source and and and hope to do contribute a lot to the kind of the general crypto Community we're doing a lot of the policy side um you know kind of the the Regulatory and policy kind of questions around here where we've hired a bunch of people there we're gonna invest more there um we're just now launching a podcast web3 with a16z we're going to invest a lot in content um into sort of evangelizing you know showing these positive use cases talking about the technology so we really want to the nice thing about the money is is we invest it but we also can use it to build out our team we have 72 people I believe now on our crypto team and we're going to continue to grow that and then that spans all sorts of different functions as I mentioned like research and content and policy and legal and Regulatory and recruiting and um I think look we could be entering it it seems like we're entering and maybe another winter um you know and that you know with Winter's campaign and and and some difficulties I also think it's a real opportunity to roll up our sleeves and solve the hard problems Mark was talking about earlier um I'm really excited I think we're at I think we I I believe we are so if you go back and look at every Computing movement in history there was always kind of this one magical period of a couple years when a whole bunch of really great stuff happened um you know in Mobile that was so snap Instagram Uber venmo all started between 2009 and 11. that 2009 11 window was sort of this golden period where there's huge influx of entrepreneurs and people that kind of figured out you know what some of the cool things you could do with mobile apps and you had the funding and you had all these kind of ingredients come together and I think my belief we'll see if I'm right I believe we are in that period now with web3 and this is going to be a magical next couple of years and so because of that we decided to go big raise our biggest fund and you know and we're I hire a bunch of people and just go all in biggest biggest race ever uh this is a16z saying what bear Market we don't even see it uh Mark Chris thank you so much
