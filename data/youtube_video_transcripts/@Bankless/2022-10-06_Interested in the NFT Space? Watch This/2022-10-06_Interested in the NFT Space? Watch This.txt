would you have to say for a 20 year old like me who wants to start his own nft project it's like making an app everybody wanted to make an app when I also would say to the 20 year old you know I work in my dad's liquor store for 14 years building it for my dad but I burned my stripes I learned operations and so one thing that a 20 year old should consider is especially right now where a lot of people are not hiring as much they can probably use good young aggressive Talent maybe go get a job at one of the top 100 projects and get paid to learn people are willing to go into massive debt for college to learn something fake but like that normative companies when they don't pay them as much as they ideologically think yet they're learning a ton I'd much rather if I'm a 20 year old Curious in the space get paid minimum wage to work for Doodles than to go into debt at Wisconsin
