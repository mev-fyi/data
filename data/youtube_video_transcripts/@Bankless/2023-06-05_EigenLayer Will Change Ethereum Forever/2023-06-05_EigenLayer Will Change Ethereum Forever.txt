if you can remove trust frictions then it massively enhances our ability to cooperate with each other just like the internet is the information Super Highway crypto could be our coordination Super Highway and once I got this it fit in with my own life philosophy I'm like okay now this is something that even if it doesn't go anywhere in three years five years you know this will go somewhere in 30 years because it's an upgrade and an upgrade to humans is what I was looking for welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless I think we've got another opportunity to front run the opportunity today this time with restaking this is a phenomenon I think David thinks restaking will change everything and so we have the father there's no going back there's no going back now we have the father of restaking sriram Cannon he's the the founder of eigenlayer the concept behind restaking is pretty simple you stake your eth and then you stake it again and it sounds crazy deceptively simple this is the first episode where we go down the restaking rabbit hole a few takeaways for you today we talk about what restaking is going to do to ethereum have we just opened Pandora's Box number two we talk about all the cool things that can be built on top of restaking number three we talk about vitalik's concerns of about restaking what happens when each stakers become polyamorous number four we talk about eigenlayer that is the protocol that sriram is building how it maximizes the surface area for non-zero-sum games and number five we talk about what happens if restaking is maximally successful how does crypto change how does the world change David why is this episode significant it's not often when a new innovation comes into the fold of the crypto economic world that goes as deep in the tech stack as eigenlayer does as restaking does and this is why this uh the discovery of restaking uh many people myself included has compared to the discovery of Mev once upon a time we discovered that you could extract some value by rbean trades on uniswap and then the snowball rolled and now we have a billion multi-billion dollar industry of Mev and different parties and now there's being like ethereum eips in order to to account for Mev people think that eigenlayer and restaking are similarly as big as that Discovery uh once you learn that you can restake your ether to one thing why not restake it to more things and this is where I'll pull in my my Skyrim mods metaphor uh if you I don't know if you've ever modded a game uh Ryan but you can you can download the base game the base Skyrim game and then you can go into these hobbyist enthusiasts list of Skyrim mods and you can start installing some mods to make your game better but then you can you can continue to do that and you can start to get really weird with the mods that you install when you're just talking about like weird mods that turn like guards into chickens and gives you foam swords like you're on the weird end of the spectrum of mods and that's fun inside of Skyrim that's fun it's fun inside of a game where like the consequences are your computer crashes it's different when we are talking about global economic networks that transact you know trillions dollars of value so there's a lot at stake here just like how there was a lot at stake with Mev there is a lot at stake with restaking and similarly how Mev also changed the nature of eth the asset I think restaking is also going to deeply change the nature of what ether is as an asset this is not sadly a topic that we were able to get into with three ROM so Ryan you're not gonna have to save that for the Deep oh my God yeah I really I've got some thoughts about how ether the asset is impacted by restaking and I know that this is a topic uh that I know Justin Drake and Dan grad and many others on the ethereum research team are also thinking deeply about uh and so I want to share all the thoughts in the Deep yeah I've got an inkling like this could be almost as big as ultrasound money as kind of the burn in terms of economic effects like I don't think you can actually understand ether the asset or ethereum the network without understanding restaking I would go that far but let's continue that discussion in the debrief the debrief of course is our episode that David and I record after the

protocol that lets to stake your eth across multiple networks at once people call this re-staking that may have been the buzzword you've heard before sriram is also the director of blockchain Labs at the University of Washington where he and others research crypto economics sriram welcome to bankless how are you doing very good thank you so much Ryan and David looking forward to talking to you both okay well we gotta start here I'm just gonna hit you with the big question everyone's wondering sriram did you just open up Pandora's box with this restaking thing it feels like that um and uh I think it's uh you know you all mentioned somewhere earlier that this is kind of like the Mev thing you know you discover one R bot doing something on the side and then suddenly you just realize all the consequences going Downstream of that I think this is something like that the idea that the security can be supplied flexibly that leads to so many consequences that are some predictable some are highly unpredictable yeah the metaphor that sriram is talking about is in an article I wrote on the bankless newsletter trying to explain uh reseaking to people which is and why so many people have uh been compelled to think and talk about this uh the to elaborate on the metaphor that sriram brought up like once upon a time uh we discovered this our bot on ethereum doing this weird thing with uniswap and then that turns out was like the tip of the iceberg of what we now call Mev which is a multi-billion dollar vertical inside of the crypto space that had it has extremely massive implications and so this is kind of we kind of feel the patterns once again uh emerging with restaking it's like oh restaking uh and then the ball goes and goes and goes and goes and goes uh and so uh this might be the the very beginning of a very long part of a new frontier in the world of crypto so as a content producer sriram uh thank you for opening that box because it gives us a lot of things to discuss and talk about I I heard some people from EF say the same thing as a researcher you know open up a whole new area so that we can all you know geek out about it well SRI Ram I think we want to get to uh restaking and actually Define that for folks because I I do think this will be maybe first in a series of content that that Dave and I put out on a bank list about restaking I think it's going to be that big as big as uh Mev was but but first I I think I'd actually um love to hear more about you SRI Ramos so it's actually from my perspective you seem to sort of burst onto the scene uh in crypto uh at least and but but I know you've been actually teaching this at the University of Washington for a while uh could you tell us about your crypto Journey so like how did you get into crypto how did you start researching this restaking thing what's kind of your day job what's your interest in the space give us some about like who are you sriram tell us uh thank you Ryan uh I uh my interest in peer-to-peer systems goes way back to my masters and PhD I did between 2006 and 11. uh where I worked on peer-to-peer Wireless Systems you know this was an ERA where we were thinking about how do you build Wireless in a place where there is not enough Wireless infrastructure no base stations no access points can you kind of have nodes just talk to each other form like ad hoc connections and multi-hop just send information from one to the other to the other until you get to your destination so that was my PhD thesis uh you know at that time and you know we Our Hope at that time was basically that we don't really need like a lot of infrastructure in in places where there may not be enough Wireless uh you know infra so however it turned out that uh you know uh even in places developing countries and other places there was a widespread uh infrastructure deployments and the only real people interested in what we were doing was you know DARPA and the US defense and so on so I moved out from working on like peer-to-peer Wireless to uh work on computational genomics you know I was a postdoctoral scientist at Berkeley Stanford you know started here the lab at the University of Washington all working on you know computational genomics trying to understand how you know information is encoded in the DNA and uh like around 2018 January uh my PhD advisor called me and he's like hey shiram you know there is this peer-to-peer systems like that we studied for many many years uh there's this thing called Bitcoin and the two problems we used to always think about from a theoretical Viewpoint is what is the maximal throughput of these systems spirit-to-based systems and what is the minimal latency right like you know whenever you see a wireless advertisement they're like oh one gbps and like 20 millisecond latency this is the kind of thing that you have to obsess about if you want to design those systems and he's like oh this system is the worst in throughput and the worst in latency but it has some other like amazing properties so can do you want to come research this and I'm like oh I have uh I have memories of doing this before and that didn't end up well so I don't want to do this I came to genomics because that's something that I think is really useful to all of us but it took me like three to six months of like thinking about the underpinnings of what this could be why actually I wanted to study peer-to-peer all of these things but really like the The Tipping Point for me was you know uh uh realizing how it fit with one of my uh core principles and this actually comes from you all Noah Harari from his book sapiens where he mentions that the evolutionary advantage of humans is that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers right like it's not that we are intelligent it's not that we're anything else it's the fact that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers and the so if this is the evolutionary advantage of humans anything that boosts this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers is a kind of like a civilizational upgrade and that's the context through which I started seeing crypto is you know if you can remove trust frictions then it massively enhances our ability to cooperate with each other and you know just like the internet is the information Super Highway crypto could be our coordination Super Highway and once I got this it fit in with my own life philosophy I'm like okay now this is something that even if it doesn't go anywhere in three years five years you know this will go somewhere in 30 years because it's an upgrade and an upgrade to humans is what I was looking for so I got it so that's that's the story but I've been mainly doing research at the University of Washington you know we came up with new consensus protocols scalability layers data availability game theory for some of these things this is the kind of thing like code infra is what professors are usually good at I used to work on everything on the infrastructure and protocols outside of new cryptography so that's the research at the University of Washington and how it led to eigenlayer is when when I was doing this you know the first instinct I had when we came up with new consensus protocols is like oh let's just take this and go show the Bitcoin guys how cool it is and then they'll just upgrade themselves [Music] and I realized like you know my own naivet in in thinking that and then like I started interacting with the ethereum guys and I'm like wow this is much more much more welcoming much more open to new ideas but I still felt that there is you know this is a massive protocol and nobody is going to upgrade or change their protocol like randomly in different directions it takes like you know several years of commitment to go in a certain direction and uh the thing that I was left wondering with was you know this phenomenon of at that time what we were calling Prof coins right professors had to come up with you know as they came up with new consensus protocols the only way that you know that could come into the industry was that you had to go build a whole new L1 and the only way to build a whole new L1 is to have a token of value securing it and this I thought was a complete Misfit to what professors are used to doing because you know they come up with new cool Technologies but not uh to build new ecosystems or create like a decentralization movement and that was kind of like at the base of my thinking is how do we repurpose existing networks to go to other things so that this you know latent energy which I was perceiving a lot is a lot of really good ideas exist in the academic sphere even as implementations but never make it into reality and so that is kind of the beginning of the journey that led to eigen there so was there like a aha moment was there a Eureka moment for you when did eigenlayer as a concept pop into your brain yeah um so for many years I've been having this question which is you know how do we repurpose existing cross networks and uh you know we had uh many different variants of ideas how do you uh do uh how do you use approval work trust to supply it to somebody else some other chains we wrote a bunch of papers on that uh but what happened was I had you know as a professor one of the main Milestones is to get tenure so I got my tenure here at the University of Washington Seattle and that meant like I can take a year or two leave and go explore whatever other things you know I want so I took a leave I said okay I'm gonna kind of figure this thing out which is how do you supply Trust flexibly and uh we called our project eigen even before we had a solution to the problem the eigen layer is basically eigen is your own layer so anybody should be able to come and build their own like you know ideas and Technologies into this common system so that was the vision we didn't have a solution to how to do it initially we had a different version of the ideas and so on took like over six months to evolve into its form but the main kind of like um Epiphany was basically that we were looking closely at merge mining the idea that you can supply the Bitcoin proof of work trust to anybody else by saying that the same hashes that you're doing in the Bitcoin proof of work or in ethereum work before the merge can be supplied to secure another network but there were major problems with this thing which is what made it not take off and the major problem was if you're mining Bitcoin and mine and other like you know altcoin right using the same proof of work energy if something if even if 100 of the miners uh mine this other coin if they go and attack this other altcoin they have no penalty at least if they attack Bitcoin they're going to lose the value of bitcoinish means they lose the value of the equipment that they have invested heavily in but if they go attack this altcoin nothing happens to anybody like their most of their value is in the Bitcoin so you know so merge mining had this like zero crypto economics associated with it so it is easy come easy go right like you're not putting anything you know no skin in the game so why would you think it was all carrot no stick exactly exactly and and Bitcoin is kind of like that too but the stick in Bitcoin is that oh you invested a lot in your mining equipment and then you know the mining equipment's value goes to zero if you go try to attack Bitcoin but that's not the case when you attack an altcoin which is like a you know even more one more level Aladdin on top of it so you get basically no incentive transfer and this and the the fact that one of the most important reasons we went to proof of stake is not even the energy and the issuance and all these things it is the ability to do negative incentives right and that is such a powerful uh thing that you know one of my underlying you know when when you think about how to cooperate flexibly in large numbers is one of the underlying important things is that there should be like a working system of karma like you know attribution of who did what and they should get the thing that they did you know you do good you should get good pack if you do bad you should get bad back you cannot socialize you know your your own like attacks whereas privatize your own gains and this is the kind of system that proof of work was because if you go and do an attack then everybody's all Bitcoin holders are affected right but your own bribes you'd gain or like whatever value you gained you gain separately whereas proof of stake had this very fine-grained Karma which is that if you go to an attack you will lose your eat not anybody else so I think having this fine-grained system of like posture negative incentives is super powerful in actually creating uh these kinds of systems and okay you know can we do instead of merch mining merge staking and that's what later became risk-taking it's interesting to see that the argument for uh proof of stake for eigenlayer for restaking is similar to uh it seems like a just a logical continuation of why proof of stake in the first place um a lot of the arguments that you're giving I remember vitalik saying like uh about just the uh Economic Security model between proof of work and proof of stake like what's more secure uh if you lie to the if you lie to the system that somebody comes takes all your money versus you lie to this system you just stop receiving new money like the one where you just have all of your money taken away from you is going to be much more secure because that incentive and also just like the idea of flexible security just makes sense in a touring complete proof of stake uh platform but I'm wondering if we can just try and do the extreme explain like I'm five maximally simple left left side of the bell curve explanation of restaking so if people people understand ethereum staking there's no way they can listen to bank lists and not understand what ethereum staking is so starting from the or what what is restaking in its most simplest form yeah uh restaking is the idea that the same stake that is used for securing the ethereum proof of stake Network can now be used to secure many other networks that's the simplest version so you so in staking what you do is you lock a bunch of stake and then you're saying I'm going to validate the ethereum blocks correctly as per the rules and the covenants let down on the protocol if I don't do it I'm going to lose my eth that's the Covenant that you're opting into when you're staking in ethereum if you restart you use the same stake uh in eigen layer like uh you take you take the same state now you not only add a covenant that you're going to validate ethereum blocks correctly but you add covenants that I'm validating David's new Oracle correctly or Ryan's new like uh chain correctly and if you don't obey these covenants you may lose your wreath just like you lose your read in the ethereum based layer and one way of visualizing this is you know you you all talk a lot about like uh blockchains as a nation states kind of analogy right and if you think of like ethereum as a nation state you have these stakers or the validators who are the uh you know Army for this kind of nation this Army secures against certain kinds of uh you know attacks which is you cannot do a double spend you cannot do an invalid block like these are the basic things that you get when you're basically validating the ethereum blockchain but to have a functioning uh you know uh system you not only need this uh ability to secure this kind of a land border which is block validity and double signing and stuff you also need all kinds of other things you need to make sure that your Bridges work correctly you need to make sure that your data storage protocol works correctly you need to make sure that some other like features all of them work correctly can we repurpose the same like valid asset or the Army to go secure all these other things and you know that's like protecting the naval border and like protecting the air surface right like so that's basically the expansion that we're doing is you know instead of restaking you can also think of this as programmable staking you know when you're staking you're basically opting into the specific covenants laid out in the ethereum protocol in programmable staking you're opting into any sets of positive and negative incentives other people right and out of your free will you can opt into that and say that hey I'm gonna go secure these five other things or 10 other things so with eigenlayer it simply says hey you've taken your ether and you have opted into slashing conditions on the beacon chain would you like to opt in to additional slashing conditions for other chains additional tape would you like to take additional risk to do other things for other chains and the reason why somebody might say yes to this question is because the things that if it's an oracle Network or another like Layer Two or data availability network is that well you get paid for that risk you get paid for the opportunity to validate other chains and so to everyone that brings me to my next question where does eigenlayer actually sit in the tech stack is it a smart contract in the application layer is it some like software that like you run as a sidecar along with your ethereum node like where where actually is eigenlayer yes uh you the way I think about eigenlayer is it you know just explaining functionally it is eigen Led as a series of smart contracts which interacts natively with sticking so that's the important thing so somehow you have to be able to stake in ethereum and then specify to the eigenlayer contracts that you have given this power to it right which is the power to slash and the power to incentivize you know the power to earn rewards and so I I can layer is functionally a system of smart contracts on ethereum and if you are a Staker and you want to opt in to eigen layer you have to go to the uh so there are two forms of restaking that we allow one is called native restaking which is normally when you're stake in ethereum you set your own like Hardware wallet as the withdrawal address so that when you withdraw your money goes into the ethereum execution layer address which is controlled by your Hardware wallet instead if you opt into eigen layer you add one intermediate step in the withdrawal flow you go and set to the ethereum [Music] um sticking you say that the withdrawal addresses in the eigenlayer contracts a specific region in the eigenlet contract Q control called an eigenpod and and in that eigen part you specify that the Pod owner is your Hardware wallet so essentially it's just adding one more step in your withdrawal flow so instead of directly going into your wallet it's going to go to a contract which is partly controlled by you and partly has the slashing power given to the eigen layer contracts and then you can now like potentially withdraw so then in the normal mode if you did everything right according to the eigenous system you'd be just able to trigger the withdrawal it goes to your pod you know where you control the money and then you can withdraw it back except if you have done a provable violation on according to the eigen layer contracts in one of the covenants that you opted into you might lose a portion of your read and only be able to withdraw the remainder of the eat because you got that portion slashed so in in and and when you're doing this you know this is the on-chain actions that a Staker is doing which is opting in into the system the off-chain action is because you're opting into this new David's uh storage protocol or Ryan's in your chain you have to download the node software for those other things and then run it and we provide an interface for making making it easy to do all of these things but you have to actually download it and run it in your off chain thing because you know that if you don't run this thing and like make claims and stuff firstly you're not going to get the rewards and you may be subject to the slashing conditions that you're opting into so eigen layer has two parts one is the on-chain part which is you know you have the smart contracts which is opting in and then you have the off chain part which is you have to download and run these other things so while logically this is how it works and technically this is how it works I think at an abstract layer it is almost like putting a hook into the root of thrust of ethereum you have staking which is at the kind of very base of ethereum on top of which you have the consensus layer Beacon chain and then you have the execution layer uh cap nodes and you have the particular ways in which blocks are produced but somehow it's able to kind of like go to the very very root which is the stake and then say flexibly transfer like attributes of the decent less trust that emerges from there to other services that may want to rent portions of this trust so for those who aren't familiar with ethereum's taking you set a withdrawal address to an ethereum address so that when you are done staking The Ether goes to that address and presumably you would set it to your address but SRI Ram what you're saying is that in this scenario you actually send it to the eigenlayer address and that eigenlayer address is like the enforcement layer part of eigenlayer where like if you need to be penalized that is where you would get penalized so like you actually don't get your ether back until you go through like the enforcement like the the the gateway to make sure that you've done all of your duties correctly for all these other networks and these other networks are you're also doing you're doing you've signed up to do some sort of certain role for these other networks be an oracle Network a layer two uh and they will go also to that contract and say hey this person did their duties we don't need to slash them you can let all of The Ether go out and back into their actual address or they will say hey actually they did do something bad they need to get slashed but that brings me to my next question does that mean that eigenlayer is really only suited for objective things where the the thing that you have signed up to be a resaker for can actually make a on-chain proof that this person or this entity did some a slashable offense that's my intuition is that correct uh that's partly correct uh the way we think about it is if you think about what is the root of decentralized trust another mental model which may be helpful for some of the listeners is you know eigen layer is you know first metal model is angular is restaking or a programmable staking protocol the second mental model is eigenlayer is a Marketplace for decentralized trust think about decentralized trust right you know when you think of what is a crypto solution and what is not a crypto solution you basically say that anything with a decentralized trust is a crypto solution anything without decentralized trust is not a crypto solution it's a very sharp boundary so decentralized trust is the raw material out of which all crypto products are manufactured and the decentralized Trust In ethereum is distilled in a specific way you take this like you know group of nodes and stake and stuff and there's a particular coordination consensus layer called The Beacon chain and then there's a particular execution layer called the evm and then on top of which there's a particular things like the gas limits and then it induces this thing called block space Oh you have 15 million block space 15 million gas every 12 seconds or whatever and that essentially ethereum itself is a Marketplace for decent less trust right but it's decentralized trust distilled into a specific product called block space so you have this notion of decentralized trust it goes through the consensus goes to the execution it goes through the gas limits and then creates an object called block space and the block space economy is clearly emerging in ethereum to be one of the preeminent economies in the crypto space precisely because the raw material of you know like I said every crypto solution Needs decentralized Trust and ethereum is a Marketplace for decentralized trust and but it's a Marketplace or decentralized trust distilled in a specific direction using a certain consensus protocol using a certain virtual machine a certain scalability layer and a certain gas limit leading to this economy of the block space but decent-less trust itself is much more can be supplied potentially in a much more raw Manner and that's what eigenlayer is eigenlayer is a Marketplace for raw decentralized Trust and what is raw decentralized trust like what is decentralized trust composed of decent less trust is composed of the economics of decent less trust which is oh I have some amount of money staked and if you know these services are some combination of these Services go wrong then those eats will be burnt or redistributed or whatever the covenants are so that's number one is the economics of it but number two even in ethereum this is by itself insufficient if it's only the amount of each stake that matters then we wouldn't have to worry about decentralization we would say let black rocks take 35 billion dollars and then we'd be fine like why do we worry about homesteakers why do we worry about you know solo node operators and all of this it's because the trust model of ethereum itself is not purely reliant on staking on money it relies on a combination of money and collusion resistance for why is this because money only lets you slash objective violations even on ethereum right like you if you double sign then it's an objective violation I know David signed block number 30 with hash X and block number 30 with hash Y and that's just not allowed so I'm gonna slash David like it's an objective on-chain verifiable algorithmic thing but what if like David and Ryan and everybody collude and then they are not allowing certain transactions to go on chain they're censoring a fraud proof they're censoring an oracle input like whatever things they've taken some off-chain drive and going and doing this stuff censorship is not on chain verifiable because how do we know inside the blockchain that David has excluded some events from the blockchain because you know there is no Locus there's no reference point for us to know that we need therefore block producers to be diverse right like because that's integrating different perspectives into block production because if there is many many independent agents who are actually doing it the probability that all of them can collude and form some invalid input or like sensor is going to be much lower and not only that like in in ethereum we also have this concept of social slashing and the concept of social slashing is is needed because safety is algorithmically slashable like safety violations if you violate safety like oh you know you sign two things or you sign an invalid block these are objectively verifiable but liveness or censorship while lifeless violations or censorship is not objectively verifiable but it's subjectively verifiable from from us outside it's obvious if a fraud proof has gone into ethereum and not been included for seven days this is why vitalik and others encourage that the fraud proof time period not be like one hour in practice likely one hour is good enough but just to make sure that in the most extreme event if censorship's happening for seven days it's human observable it's it's Noble for all of us you know people are gonna shout somebody's gonna tweet somebody's gonna write in the Reddit post and in the ethereum forums and so on so the uh the idea the way ethereum structured is safety is on chain observable and slashable so safety violations are enforced based purely on economics liveness is enforced by two different things one is decentralization which is integrating a variety of different perspectives so that different people have opportunities to engage in Block proposal but also from the outside we have a vantage point to see and say that like something bad happens and we can safely agree on that something bad happened which a censorship happened then there is an ability to Fork so these two things interlock together to create the ethereum security model which is the guarantees of the base layer that you have safety and you have liveness and so that's just like explaining the underlying modules of decentralized trust in ethereum itself so that now I can explain the same thing at eigen layer so now when you when somebody is wanting to build new Services they need to think of how do they take these raw elements of decentralized trust and then compose the services they want to compose this is a very sophisticated task right like you know we had vitalik and Justin rake and dunk rod and like very sophisticated actors actually come up with these protocols and we expect the same thing to be true at the eigenlayer level as well so what are the raw elements of decent less trust that eigen layer can supply on the one side we can supply economic trust why can we Supply economic trust because you're restaking right if you're restaking then you know essentially you can subject yourself to slashing and anything objectively verifiable can then be slashed through the eigenved system that's number one so you can supply that so what if you had a protocol that or aspects of the protocol like liveness like censorship that do not rely on economics alone they need a notion of decentralization you could come to eigen layer and just borrow the ethereum decentralization you could somehow say that I only want the home stakers of ethereum to participate I only want these group of nodes to participate and then say that I only want a decentralized program I don't care whether they bring 35 billion or only 350 million because it's not the economics that drives this particular aspect of trust I want as many distinct agents to participate as possible in my consensus protocol you know let me give a kind of like a very tangible example secret chatting I take a secret okay and I want to distribute the secret to many many nodes and there's a covenant in the secret which is that if something happens then reveal the secret right if that thing doesn't happen don't reveal the secret what I do is I take my data and then encode it into small portions and no one person has all the data I take these like you know 5000 home stakers in ethereum and split the secret and send it to all of them now the only way I can reconstruct the secret or you know more than a majority of them come together and reveal their portions then I can use an algorithm to stitch all those pieces together and then recover my secret so this is called Shamir secret sharing is a basic cryptography primitive and if you want to build something like this you know economics is not useful because it is not observable it is not objectively attributable whether David and Ryan and others like colluded together and reveal their portions of the secret because who knows maybe they met in a secret room in uh you know in the bankless office and reveal the secret whereas it's not observable so I'm only relying on collusion resistance you know if I bring 5000 homesteakers from around the world where are they going to meet and reveal the secret they may have to go through some you know it's not easy so by building this barrier you can actually bring aspects of decent restaurants so eigen there is a thing which allows slashing only for objectively attributable offenses but it allows the usage of decentralized trust for other things imagine I can have an oracle which allows people to bring in inputs but has no slashing you are taking an assumption when you're using the Oracle that a majority of the nodes are honest and if you take a very distributed group of nodes it's possible that your assumption is satisfied so just like the ethereum protocol designers had to have like a very first principles understanding of what is decentralized trust what are the aspects of decentralized trust how do we combine them to actually make something useful and productive builders on top of eigenlayer also need to have the same first principles understanding of what aspects of decentralized trust exist how do the how do you mix and match these two obtained services that have the properties that you want this opens up so many different channels I feel like we could we could go down SRI Ramen uh you know I'm I'm conscious of trying to take all the paths at once um so so we'll do our best to kind of navigate because you've opened up so many different topics of discussion here so we'll try to get to them all including the applications that this enables which feels like where you left that conversation but just so I'm understanding it so the idea is that eigenlayer is really sort of modularizing decentralized the decentralized trusts of ethereum so bankless listeners should know that like obviously we think and I think generally it's accepted ethereum is maybe the most decentralized Network out there if not then you know some people would say it's number two to bitcoin you know so anyways one of the most decentralized networks out there if not the most decentralized Network out there and what what eigenlayer is doing through restaking is modularizing the decentralized trust components so in the way the market could buy decentralized trust from ethereum is through block space sales that was the commodity that you could purchase you want you want ethereum to centralize trust here we've we've turned it into a block that you can purchase right and that was the export from ethereum what restaking and what eigenlayer is doing is essentially saying no that's not the only form of decentralized trust it's not the only commodity we can actually produce there's a layer down which is further which is this concept of decentralized trust and it could take a different form it doesn't have to be block space and it can take the form of economic trust and decentralization but essentially any chain or any application can tap into that supply of decentralized trust and create something different out of it not block space but maybe something different and that Concept in itself is very very very powerful I think and I think we're just scratching the surface of imagining what it could be useful for but sriram your council is like hey and if you're designing an app or does signing a chain to take this new primitive into account you have to really understand what you're doing right this is like Potter's clay and you have to like make sure it forms the use case very precisely one thing I want to um ask though is from a staker's perspective so many Bank list listeners hold ether the asset of course maybe they're staking it some portion of it um I want to be clear on kind of the risks that somebody takes on when they uh restake okay so first of all it seems like they have to have their eth staked in order to restake it right so we're we're saying that you can't do this with raw eth is that correct that's right okay so you can either do it with uh eat steak or you can do it with liquid sticking tokens like if you already have like arith or you know um let's say Lido stick tea you could deposit the steak eat you could also theoretically do it with you know just raw Eid you know but the assumption is if you're okay with the risks that come with restaking you should likely be okay with the native staking so the first layer of risk is fairly well understood by the market that is you stake your ether some risk associated with that a lot of that is critical risk if you stake it with a third party or staking pool then you accept another protocols layer of risk so that's risk layer one it seems like there is a risk Layer Two which might be eigen smart contract risk so you guys are putting some code out there and we all you know cross our fingers do security audits uh have you know High Lindy effect make sure the code is secure there's the chance that that is not secure that there's some element of risk associated with that and that would apply across all of eigenlayer anything that uses eigenlayer for restaking right so that's a second layer that's correct okay that is correct and then the third layer is the new slashing conditions and that can be application specific and uh folks can kind of opt into that what this what this uh I guess reminds me of Almost Is we use the kind of the nation state analogy a little bit earlier and I'm almost like bankless is called ether the internet bond for for quite a while like ether when staked is kind of a a bond it's almost like a treasury bill it's a t-bill that we create and if you look at um you know the one-year short-term Treasury Market in the U.S the yield right now of that is 5.3 percent right which is kind of interesting 5.3 percent ether the asset when staked is about in that range right when you include Mev and such we're between four and six percent so the invitation here is to take that almost like you would with t-bills and be able to use those t-bills to economically secure something else that is almost an analog here of course like t-bills are not really uh very fungible in the US and one might argue they could be or they should be I kind of feel like I'd rather have a t-bill than use dollars right because that Tebow is giving me the you know the five percent uh interest rate that maybe I should be entitled to but that is not fun a fungible unit but on ether it really is and so you can use your staked eth the protocol risk of ethereum and restake it and you take some other risk in exchange for uh some reward and we would imagine that reward would be obviously beyond the risk-free rate of staking eat don't be triggered bankless listener when I say risk-free rate okay I'm using that very precisely of course all crypto is risky you could lose what you put in with your head West you know this but the risk-free rate for ether is like if you want to return on ether there's no better place than actually staking ether there's no less risky place than staking ether so that becomes the risk-free rate and then anyone who wants to tap into the uh the trustless security of ethereum is going to have to pay some premium on top of that for so from a staker's perspective you could stake your eth at like four to six percent annualize you restake it in eigenlayer you take on some smart contract risk and then you opt into the applications or change you want to support and you can further increase your yield above the risk-free rate so there's more risk here but now I may be going from a four to six percent type yield to like a seven eight nine ten percent you really can't predict this because you're just the marketplace for this and the market will determine what the true yield is is this is this all correct that is absolutely correct um in terms of things like the smart contract risks on eigenlayer I I think you know definitely that is a significant aspect of how we think about um you know when we when we try to build systems we are trying to think of not only mechanisms on uh you know how to audit the contracts how to make sure that we have very minimal uh surface but still uh we also think of uh other things for example uh in eigen layer there is when before you withdraw your uh money out right there is a withdrawal lag of seven days and this is true for most taking and unstaking protocols it is not a short-term activity like a bridge where you're like oh you know why is my fund still day it's a long-term activity it's much slower in time scale and this lets us exert some amounts of other controls for example we have a ability to pass the contracts there is something called the community multi-sig which is composed of members not from the eigenlayer team and it can upgrade the contracts so having like a system of like checks and balances so that we can minimize but not eliminate the risks associated with the eigenal system these are steps that we have taken but absolutely correct that even if the eigen layer system has some amount of risk each service that you're opting into has also some additional risk because you have to trust their smart contracts and and such and we have put in meshes for some of those things as well for example uh one of the things that we do is there is a committee called the slashing veto committee which basically the role of the slashing veto committee is if you got illegitimately slashed because of a bug in the slashing contract then they can veto the slashing they cannot add new slashing they can only veto an existing slashing and what this does is also segregate because you know you have the veto committee which can veto slashing some set of and this veto committee will only accept some set of services right because they have to be able to understand the service in order to veto what is a legitimate and what is an illegitimate slashing so what this does is create a tiered system where there is a permission tier which is onboarded by this veto committee because you know they're going to vet the various conditions for example like the composition of trust that I mentioned you should only have objective release attributable flaws or false you shouldn't if you're using subjective things then use decentralized trust don't try to slash it like all of these kinds of things which are protocol specifications can be checked by this onboarding Committee in the permission tier which is protected by the slashing veto there's going to be another permission last year where if you build a protocol if you built a service and it is well ossified then you would say like who is this flashing committee I don't need them I'm veto committee I'm going to go to a tier which is not protected by this but you need to be able to convince the stakers who are now taking an excess risk right because they're not protected by the veto committee you you need to convince them and if a random like Degen protocol is built on top of this other service it's up to them to then go and convince the stakers that they have to go like do this crazy thing so by creating a system of checks and balances and you know internal social consensus inside the eigenrair system the slashing veto is an internal social consensus right it's a it's a system of like you know participants which can basically veto slashing they cannot add on slashing but they can veto slashing so things like this actually create a very uh uh nuanced system which has a lot of internal uh checks and balances but at the end of the day the high level picture is what Ryan laid out which is you have your eat you won't earn additional rewards for validation services so you use the ethereum based layers taking that is the absolute risk minimal uh thing that you can do on top of which you may say oh I like these protocols these are pretty risk minimal I'm going to opt into them I want to just say one important thing which is that if you look at the scope of what possible Revenue opportunities exist in eigen in ethereum or in in blockchains in broadly you know you have things like oh I can go and participate in decent life Finance I can go and participate in a landing Market I can go and participate in a kind of like a market making or whatever and then earn like a bunch of yield but all of these yield you know all of D5 yield is on you're underwriting some price risks that's what you're getting yield for you're underwriting a price risk like you are saying oh I'm I don't believe like e2usd is going to change that much or like this to that is not going to change that much and because if it does you're going to lose money I'm going to underwrite like some volatility risk that's what you're doing in a landing market like you're underwriting some set of like Financial risks price risks when you're like trying to gain yield in D5 but really and this is not unique to blockchains blockchains make them transparent right like I'm verifiable that some of these conditions and Covenants are held but that's the only reason you have a non-zero yield is your underwriting price list because if that's not the case then you don't get any yield what happens in eigen layer is that we have this realization is validation yield is the unique thing about blockchains so what does validation need validation yield is you hold a bunch of heat and then you put it down you lock it down in a contract and then you are providing a service right it's a service provider fee It's a combination of locking up some money and providing a service that's what's taking yield is and staking yield is non-zero because of an information asymmetry what is this information asymmetry as a Staker you know you're honest and if you understand the protocol and its risks which is important it's theoretically doable right if you understand the protocol on its risks you can basically be sure you won't lose your eat unless you're malicious right that is an external party like you know you look at me and you say oh Shriram maybe he's good maybe he's bad so you don't know that I'm I'm honest or not you're going to say oh but I see he's putting down his money and if he's not honest he's going to lose this amount of money so from your point of view you're saying I don't know if he's honest or not but if he's not honest he's going to lose this money so it's predicated on this information asymmetry between the service provider and the service receiver it's a very unique form of yield that is created inside the crypto economy and and and it can underwrite a lot of digital trust like Oh I'm a I'm I'm a server and I'm providing a certain service I'm a storage provider and I'm providing a service and I'm I'm a metaverse like you know system and I'm providing a certain service there's all kinds of these services that people want to provide and because it unlocks this new kind of economy which simply doesn't exist anywhere else there's no parallel to this so the the rate here is could be quite different from the rate that you would get on other instruments learning about crypto is hard until now

in the show notes introducing ethx from stator ethx is a liquid staking token designed to maximize rewards all while securing ethereum with stator you can run an ethereum node with just four eth an 85 lower Capital requirement versus the 32 eth required for solo stake with Staters four eth nodes you can get a 35 average higher yield since you charge fees to those who use your node to stake their eth by running a node with stator the ethx staking derivative token can get minted on your validators and can flow into the world of D5 which data is actively building Integrations and Partnerships into to increase the utility of eth X stator allows for both permissioned and permissionless nodes to join the network maximizing its potential scalability for ethics while preserving the values of

this Innovation can create but just I want to pause on the on the Staker piece guys staking is about to get real interesting like real interesting because imagine now you are a Staker and you have the opportunity to maybe juice your yields by some amount and there's thousands of different options in order to do that and I'll remind bankless listeners you know as usual right in a competitive Marketplace higher reward equals higher risk okay so you want to go uh sign up for you know the double digit apy you're probably taking commensurate risk associated with that if you don't know what you're getting into you better not go do that but imagine this kind of competitive Marketplace competing over that decentralized trust and as a Staker you're kind of at the center you're what all of the other chains actually want and and demand uh I think this is very fascinating and it's you could you can see why um we we are so fascinated by this topic is because there could be an entirely like rating agencies just based on rating the risk of different eigenlayer type of applications or chains and uh you know like entire like this is going to spawn so many different Industries and different companies that's why we're so excited about it we should probably get to uh some of the new things that can be built on eigenlayer David you want to take that yeah just to really reiterate this I think it's important to be able to put into people's brains like what these new networks actually could be like all right you can restate your ether uh we haven't answered the uh okay to what question uh so like stream uh to what would what are some examples of like networks that could come alive because of restaking because of eigenlayer like what can we make just make this like really concrete for listeners brains yeah um so if you look at the kind of broader crypto economy I think let's start with this high level observation that decent Life Trust underpins pretty much all crypto Solutions right and so you start with that and then you say okay what are the other Innovations people are doing which are currently potentially outside the ethereum ecosystem that we can now like supercharge with this 35 billion plus dollars of staking that exists in the theorem ecosystem number one new chains right like you look at oh I'm gonna start this new chain I know why why do you start a new chain you start a new chain because you have a new consensus protocol okay this new consensus protocol is going to achieve finality in like half a second okay that sounds very cool can we bring that to ethereum yes take it and then you opt in and now you're running a new consensus protocol and this new consensus protocol can get finality at like one second or half a second and if finality is broken on this new consensus protocol I'm going to be able to slash heat it's an objectively attributable offense of signing two blocks with the same block number that's a superpower one example like take any L1 is now part of this restaking economy okay but that's not all actually I think this idea that you you're going to build all these silos of many chains I think it's not a good model I want to you know draw uh the listeners into a old uh model that happen in the internet like imagine it's 1994 and you want to build your web application what would you do you would basically have to build your own server make sure the server is performant you'd have to build your own like identity stack and say okay you know how do you log in people you'd have to build your own payment stack so that when they come to your website they know what they're doing you have to build your own database Stacks so that you have like a history and stuff stored and then you would have to build like the thing that you really wanted to build so this is the internet uh web application development in like 94. but how does it look in 2023 you'd say oh AWS is the server of choice or whatever Azure or something right like so you choose one of the clouds then you say I'm going to choose like a SAS service like a you know oauth as an identity as a service or a payment as a service using stripe or PayPal or something else use like a DB as a service on top of it and then like tie all of these together and then hey I just do the one special thing and then create my application of choice so that that's what that's what you do today and what we envision is of course like you want to bring this same kind of like a development economy into blockchains the problem is your AWS cannot be the substrate right like the substrate needs to have decent less stress we already established that that's what D Market it's a blockchain solution from a non-blockchain solution now we have the decentralized trust substrate which is ethereum stakers putting down money and computational resources to supply that trust eigenlayer makes it more flexible now you can have Services built on top like just like the SAS software as a service was the corresponding economy in like the cloud era you build many SAS services and then any end application concatenates these SAS services to form the application of choice imagine like a composability layer imagine a bridging layer imagine an oracle layer imagine an identity layer imagine a settlement layer imagine a ordering layer like when you're building like already the modular economy has started to hint at what this looks like right you have a sequencing layer is separate you then have a bridging layer separate you then have a settlement layer separate but on a data availability layer separate but this is not all the components is what I'm trying to allude to just like you look at the SAS economy there is many many many SAS Services you know a typical web application uses 15 SAS services and concatenate stamp right and we would expect the same thing to happen in in crypto like why would we think otherwise and SAS is one of those categories where you can take one concept and then like dive deep and really kill it like secret sharing is a SAS service so in the crypto world right like secure multi-party computation is a SAS service trusted execution environments and doing a particular thing on top of it as a SAS service there's many many core Primitives that are missing in the crypto economy to actually build all the crazy things that we envision to build here and so to make it a little bit concrete so I just want to present a high level vision and then I can make it a bit concrete let's just look at the role of modular economy today on ethereum and and kind of Envision what are the missing components and how we can supplant them with eigenlet because some people get very confused when they look at eigen layer they're like oh is this gonna be competing with the layer 2 landscape no it's completely complementary to the layer 2 landscape why is that layer 2 is not is the architecture of Layer Two is the way to scale ethereum is the way to scale any decentralized blockchain why is it is because you offload computation you offload memory management into a separate system and then provide cryptographic proves that these have been done correctly to this decentralized network if you didn't do this if you just said oh I have like uh ethereum I'm going to restake and then run like thousands of chains now every validator needs to run like thousands of chains that doesn't make any sense like we are not we're gonna kill decentralized trust if we try to do that so what we need is these services that are highly scalable that can then be built on top of each other so that we keep the underlying notion of decentralized trust intact you know a Degen version of restaking that could have been built like even one year back would have been take a liquid sticking token just let you know stake the liquid staking token fork salana and then run on on ethereum Cross Network this would be like a very bad way of Designing restaking because it will kill the decent less Trust on which this system is built you just gave someone a great idea I think three wrong guarantee that happens I'm sure right and but the the thing is the way eigen layer is designed is it allows for modular aspects of trust somebody could build that but somebody can also build the more decentralized the more stable version we're launching everything together as opposed to saying that this is the only thing you can do with it because when that's the only thing you can do with it all the stakes starts drifting towards that because you know there's no yield to be decentralized you need to be centralized in order to make any yield and so we're trying to preserve the core values of ethereum while allowing this Marketplace and that's why I want to highlight like what we can do for the roll-up landscape using something like eigen layer so number one data availability right like the total data bandwidth of ethereum is somewhat constrained it's right now at 83 kilobytes per second uh and there is a road map in ethereum to expand this from 83 kilobytes per second to 1.3 megabytes per second using this method called dunk sharding it'll take two to three years to get there but can we you know in the free market everybody trying to build new interesting things can we take some of those best ideas and already try them out on eigenlayer and the first attempt is what we are doing ourselves a solution called eigen da it's the data availability layer it runs at 10 megabytes per second not even 1.3 it's basically just dunk shutting but built with because it's a more flexible more open system it doesn't have to interface with consensus and other things that cool down shutting has to you can actually like do a lot of interesting things at this layer and you know that's that's one thing that we're already building and we have a roadmap to get from 10 megabytes per second over time to even 10 gigabytes per second so you can scale this out 1000x so you know we envision the crypto economy to grow you know so big that you know megabytes per second is not going to be enough so that's one example roll ups all need data availability and can we provide a cheap and sustainable version of data availability where everybody doesn't have to download everything like nodes do very little work they use data availability sampling and other ideas to actually scale the system so that is eigen Da one example can we actually hang on eigen d8 just for a little bit just because it's it's super concrete and I just it's worth just unpacking this part of the story I think it's just a good good way to understand eigenlayer and the way the if we're using nation state metaphors which I guess we are so far in this episode um maybe like uh dang sharding or data availability inside of ethereum native data availability ethereum has data it doesn't have too much of it it's very very constrained on that because it's decentralized um and so maybe uh ethereum's data availability is like the United States Postal Service whereas eigenlayers uh data availability is like UPS like maybe it's more in the free market more is it more in the private Market um and and so it can compete on that threshold it can compete in that in that world and it also doesn't have to be strained by the low movement that happens at the nation state level like you've really got to wait for um for 4844 for dank shorting to actually come to mainnet maybe the private Market can move faster and it's good that the private market and the actual like enshrined protocol of ethereum like these compete with each other these are this is an open free free Marketplace so let's make sure that we have there is one like really cool um Vision that we have for eigenlayer is that it is a it is a place where many eips compete before it becomes and shine so same idea for layer tools right like we have you look at charting right which was basically like State enshrined like uh Roll-Ups right basically it's it's an execution charting is a particular version of Roll-Ups that has to be fixed and enshrined and like built by the core protocol team whereas you know layer tools where free market uh competition on top of like oh you know I'm building scroll You're Building ZK some there's so many varieties of zkevm so many varieties of optimistic rollups all of them compete on this free market and the best ideas are of course over a longer time scale going to be absorbed back into ethereum these protocols you know the free market protocols will continue to have an edge because you know they're not going to uh they're going to have newer newer features whereas the core protocol will also upgrade and this is the same roadmap that we see because you need to be battle tested a lot and there was no place for battle testing all these different ideas before they get enshrined if it was at the more deeper levels of the protocol stack and that's what eigenlayer furnishes exactly what you're saying which is that it allows for free market competition on say like what is the right version of like tongue starting or many people build these like these different versions and then somebody's like oh actually this is the right thing and maybe not the one eigen da is building but somebody else is building and that then goes and becomes part of ethereum itself over a three to five year time scale whereas on that layer people are still in a way and saying oh it's 10 gigabytes per second it's not enough we want to do 10 terabytes per second that's what the important thing about this too is that it is secured by the same ether uh stakers essentially it's the same kind of Economic Security that is securing that could potentially secure eigen eigen da as would secure dank sharding that's right so while the economic aspect of the trust so there were three aspects of Trust on the ethereum core layer one is the economic aspect of the trust the other is the uh decentralization aspect of the trust and the third is the social forking aspect of the trust right remember when some transactions not included you can Fork ethereum that third aspect of trust is missing in eigen layer even if 100 of stake is restaked right even if every Staker restricts and runs uh when Don charting is running if a block data is missing ethereum will Fork around it because I mean that's the protocol it's the protocol folks around like invalid States whereas on eigen layer if the same thing happens we have no ability to socially Fork ethereum so there is a difference the dividing line is the protocol concerns basically has social focusing which is like a nuclear option like you know going with the state analogy like the nuclear uh Power is only with the with the state it's not with the free market and so that's something I want to delineate but everything else the decentralization in fact it's possible to have more decentralization on eigenlayer than on ethereum why would I say that even if the valid data set is the same it's because you could say that I'm excluding these Wills like who have who control like the top you know I take the top 30 values and remove it and only the remaining ones all have power so to get to a majority so to get to a majority in ethereum I may need like 30 or 40 notes because they have a dominant amount of stake now I remove those 30 or 40 in my service then say I only have the remaining 9006 like all the solo stickers let's say all the solos tickets exactly and exactly exactly so you could build like really because it's modular you can isolate like a you know you have the laser-like ability to say I only want these things I don't want those other things or somebody might say I want I'm building a Solana on like ethereum I don't need these like slaggers from home like trying to opt in I only want Economic Security I just go with these like just coinbase and like big big liquids taking protocols good enough that's fine like that's the free market and that's what it needs to do and picking up on the um the whole like USPS you UPS metaphor um I want to bring in a third player here which is like Celestia um Celestia is a data availability solution that is outside of the fold it is a layer one blockchain that is meant to be a data availability solution kind of in the same way that eigenlayer d a is also a data availability solution but Celestia is secured by its own token so it's like the USPS of Canada I don't know what it's called in Canada but the point is like a different Canada Post it's Canada Post uh but and and that's the point of like that we're really trying to drive drive home here is that well with eigenlayer with restaking we can have the benefits that Celestia has that Canada Post has if Canada Post is meaningfully that much better than USPS we can bring that into the fold have it be secured by e-stakers uh and then also have that that data availability solution uh that is free market competitive but closer to home if you consider home to be ethereum uh how do you like that for a metaphors free realm that's that's really good um the one thing I want to say is like you know the Celestia guy is bad from ethereum and if there was something like this maybe several years back it's possible that even Celestia are built on top of this kind of a common layer um and and also I want to mention that there is a benefit for having your own token for services building on top of eigenlayer and why is that that's because that aspect of the token you can do social forking whereas you cannot do social focusing on it so you can have things like dual staking where you say that oh there is a kind of heat stakers or securing this but also my own token stakers are securing this but if this service goes wrong I can socially Fork these guys and so that imposes some kind of like an economic penalty but it's only can be enforced socially so there are all these aspects of trust like I think Ryan uh mentioned earlier like when you're constructing these protocols you have to think from first principles what is happening and try to build you know enough attributes in different layers just like ethereum has thought very deeply about these things so yeah that's a when you're building a protocol maybe you need your own token but it's an audition to like whatever trust is coming from ethereum because ethereum doesn't have social forking and you want to have social focusing on your token and data is considered stored or available only if both these different quorums agree that data is considered stored so you can mix and match aspects of trust not only services are modular trust itself is modular right like you're going to say I need decentralization trust for this I need economic trust for that I need social forking trust for this like all of these different things come together in order to make your particular I don't know if we're stretching the analogy too far here with with you know Canada in the US and Canada Post versus uh the United States Postal Service or something but what's interesting is Canada certainly would not want to let's begin on behalf of a Canadian citizen here that's me so uh Canada would certainly not want to leave its social forking over to the US right it would not want to like opt into the the US Congressional a rule of law that sort of thing right of course but Canada does benefit I would argue and I think if you ask any Canadian they would also agree uh from the US's military security it's kind of there's this sort of umbrella of a security that the United States of America kind of provides in Canada in various ways right yeah in various ways like opts into that you know NATO and other uh sort of alliances so it does tap into that military Network which is um very interesting and you don't know how all of this will will shake out um anyway observation I don't I don't see Canada Post being supplemented by uh United States but but they do use UPS which I don't know what that means and there's there's FedEx in Canada as well I don't know what that means in our analogy here well they're all uh United States domicile companies right and so can be spawned inside of the ethereum network and then also be data availability solutions for non-etherium chains so it can you can go cross-border sriram you brought up uh the idea of uh tokens inside of these resync networks and I want to bring up a Counterpoint that I to eigenlayer 2 restaking that um I think people will will want to hear asked and that is it so say sriram I want to go and and spin up my own chain or start my own Oracle Network or do something I want to go start a new network a main motivation for why I would want to do that would be like I get to issue a token and I don't really care about letting all the eth whales secure my network because they already have all their eth I would like to generate my own brand new wealth I want to distribute my new wealth to all my early adopters and all the e-stakers and the East Maxis can go f off because I'm going to go issue a new token and that that's always been actually the reason why we've enjoyed tokens because they are network bootstrapping mechanisms they really have solved the bootstrapping problem so why why would why would people want to start their own network with eigenlayer when they could just issue a token like you're taking away the cool thing about this whole industry which is issuing tokens so what would you say to this that I would say history proves otherwise you go back to 2013. okay and you could say why would in fact bitcoiners were saying why would all these applications come and live inside one common tent the ethereum and just be a tap on top of this ethereum network how would ethereum network itself be secured enough to hold so many applications it's an unstable equilibrium is what people said so to both the aspects combined here one is why would you want to be part of this kind of like a big tent thing number one and number two is how would this tent be big enough like how would there be enough stake and value in this uh to actually secure all these things and the answer is we saw both the things happen which is it pretty much all dabs were built on ethereum till ethereum was saturated right like in Block space you know the cryptokitties thing happened and then people are like oh maybe this block space is not infinite and it's going to get saturated at some point so maybe we need to build another L1 or go build on another L1 and it is because it's much much easier to bootstrap your network if you don't have to also do your security right it's the same reason why like no you know same thing happened in the cloud right like you go back in 2001 2002 you'll read articles and or 2005 to even 2010 you would read articles that say there's no way companies will migrate to the cloud except now like only the absolute like biggest ones even think of running their own like server infrastructure because it's a headache it's a super specialty to actually go run a cloud right it's not something you want to do it's going to add huge overheads it's exactly the same thing so you know first is daps have tokens right like we're not against tokens tabs have tokens and their tokens can be used for bootstrapping and in fact on eigen layer you can use your token for bootstrapping without having any fee right because initially on ethereum if you're building a dab initially all the users still have to pay the gas free of ethereum which is could be expensive and whereas if you're building something on top of eigen layer you would say I'm compensating stakers directly from my own tokens small fraction of my own token and because it's restate security it's shared security across so many systems the per system fee is much lower right so here's a very simple way of visualizing this let's say there are thousand applications Each of which can have like afford like one million dollar worth of security because of the fee they are paying if you aggregate all of them you get a one billion dollar security with the same fee basis and everybody is enjoying the one billion dollar chat security it's just much better and chat security is much better than disaggregated security we see this in the real world we see this inside blockchains so the cost of purchasing that security is much lower because it's shared it's not like I have to you know Canada could say you know it's big enough to say that I can have my own Army right but or they do but not to the same extent that us does and because they're sharing in or partaking in this through like a variety of like soft and hard agreements that's the same thing that will happen in this space is you don't need to bootstrap your own system so actually bootstrapping your system is one of the hardest things uh you know and we see this time and again right because what happens is when you try to bootstrap your own system using your own security you can only Supply services to things of value less than your your token value right imagine your token is a kind of like a new chain and it's worth like 100 million now you can really Supply security only worth 100 million through this token and that rest tricks your own like ability to gain adoption whereas if you come and use the restake security maybe you get 35 billion of security and maybe now you can offer services to everybody in the ecosystem and that grows your Market so that's number answer number one answer number two is if you look at the SAS economy on on the uh Cloud era you see this is one of the most productive for VCS and for entrepreneurs because you can take a Narrows slice and then kill it say I am the identity layer for X kind of like for social login it's a very very narrow thing like but there are so many things that rely on this narrow thing that it's worth it right like that's the same thing we admission would happen if somebody would come and build like a service like oh ordering sequencing transactions for all the layer tools is a narrow service but it's built on like ethereum ethereum's great security firstly as a roll-up that's much more compatible to say that oh yeah it's secured by ethereum you know it's the decentralized sequencing coming from ethereum stickers much more attractive for a role up to obtain otherwise they'll be like why do why should I touch your token like why should I not like use ethereum and so there are ways in which this market like you can enhance your market share by opting into the system you have your own token as a value capture mechanism where a fraction of the fees get routed to your token you can use your token even as a payment token you pay fees in only that token possibly you use your token as an incentive and bootstrapping mechanism you could also use your token as an additional staking mechanism so you can do all of these things but the benefit of sharing in uh having in a pool security layer is quite a lot so I think people will opt in so eigenlayer is not going to be a token killer per se but it could and it might very well kill use cases for tokens as they relate to Economic Security so if you are using a native token for decentralization economic security for those guarantees you should probably be a little bit worried about what eigen layer and restaking is doing but this doesn't kill the general purpose of tokens there are all sorts of other tokens in fact from a market perspective it might make tokens more efficient value accrual mechanisms because you can tap into them directly now that that's right except I add an asterisk on the token not being useful for staking there are two two uses of uh you know Economic Security two ways in which you get Economic Security one way is that you have objective attributable things like slashing so that gives you some amount of Economic Security the other kind of like economics that is at player in staking is a value alignment you know if you're holding a certain token and staking it and even if there's no slashing a majority of the stickers won't like go and try to do something bad in the system because that affects the value of their own token and so we do expect things like dual staking where each staking exists as a separate Quorum and your own tokens taking exists as a separate Quorum and then you aggregate information from both of these quorums and say that oh the heat korma said this and your Quorum has said this only if they're within some reasonable deviation that's a considered a valid input so there are ways in which you know your token can be used even for staking and security but only as a complement to this kind of general purpose slashable security which is much better derived from something like ethereum it's a much more much less volatile store value it is it doesn't fluctuate based on your own tokens like you know value proposition so even if your token goes down in value you still have the large amount of Economic Security intact rather than going through a debt spiral where your token goes down in value then your your chain is considered less secure people exit and then your token goes down even further and then it's just a kind of a spiral note we've seen these spirals in in this space you guys have covered a lot of it yes we have yeah um you you said the word alignment which uh I've been hanging out with a number of uh the ethereum researchers um uh and the topic of eigenlayer alignment or reseking alignment is like it's the the new brain candy for the ethereum research team I think even Justin Drake has talked about like yeah I'm into I'm into eigenlayer alignment in the same way that Ryan and David are into AI alignment uh similar problems existential so well one's existential for ethereum the other is existential for Humanity um and so like I'll I'll trick articulate this this way uh it's like well currently pre-eigenlayer pre-res-staking in our naive protected form before restaking came in penetrated our bubble um all of the ethereum stakers were this homogeneous group of people that had one network to to do their one job which was to secure your one network now with restaking we have what I've dubbed Network polyamory where like East takers can actually you know go flirt with other networks with their original stake but they can also stake for additional networks and now ethereum which used to have a very monogamous relationship uh with their with its own eatstakers now these e-sakers get to go have other relations with other networks and so no longer are the East takers committed to this one single ethereum Network which is one problem but then it also continues from there which is that well some set of ethereum seekers can go and sign up for Network a and then some set of ethereum seekers can sign up for network two and that can fracture and go forth and all of a sudden we used to have this nice pool of ethereum seekers which had one job which was Secure ethereum and now we have a fracturing of this pooled security to secure 20 different chains of dubious perhaps levels of of committed commitment to ethereum and and so this now threatens ethereum security is is the concern here because like what was once dedicated to ethereum can now go and just do this Degen yield farming thing and now it's like ethereum as a whole is less secure as a result of that what would you say to this it is approximately correct in that uh basically when you're sharing security you're giving up a portion of the security to these other layers but your own security also goes up as a consequence right because us is the security supplier for the rest of the world you are gaining fees from all these things that means U.S upgrades its own like security Battalion right that's the same thing that's happening to through restaking is the total amount staked right now let's say like Ryan pointed out it equilibrates to the market rate of like five percent five point five percent whatever and as and that that means like right now whatever 35 billion worth of ether staked right and if you want this to go to 100 billion worth of each state the core protocol itself may not have enough incentives to actually drive it to that that level but because you're getting staking and restaking yield together the staking yield plus restaking yield may be enough to stretch the security from like a 35 billion budget to 100 billion budget so there is I completely understand and acknowledge the concern also I think you know uh in the short to medium term there is a lot more information sharing between um firstly the eigen layer kind of like teams and the ethereum like protocol teams that is important but over the medium term maybe even the protocol information passing like how does something like eigenlayer or any restaking protocol communicate information with the staking protocol better like so that is that aspect of it a very simple technical version of it is called smart contract triggered withdrawals right now holds the validator key they can trigger the withdrawals but that is in the roadmap of ethereum Danny Ryan and others are putting together the idea of contract triggered withdrawals that are smart contract which has the withdrawal key can trigger the withdrawal instead of the validator has to trigger the withdrawal so that's an example of information sharing between like eigenlayer and ethereum then over the longer time scale there are more complex information chatting mechanisms like shared insurance and other things we're working on internally and sharing with ethereum folks but over the long long term I do hope that uh something like restaking or programmable staking becomes part of the ethereum protocol itself because it's such a powerful thing that actually like you know having it and and you know over time as we remove all kinds of subjectivity and Barrel test it it's possible that something like eigenlayer can become core part of the ethereum protocol sriva when you tell me that I can take my ethereum and I can restake it to get more yield my in the first place my brain goes is like okay how many times though uh like can I restate to all the chains uh in the article I wrote on Bank list I've been using this in a way to explain what uh restaking is I've been using the uh Skyrim mods as like this um metaphor where like if anyone's ever modded a game you start with like the biggest most common mod because it's the most useful and it's the least likely to crash your game but then you inevitably like okay what about the next mod and then the next mod and then you go down the long tail of mods at some point you're installing something completely ridiculous and then you try and open up your game and it crashes uh so like the the metaphor here is that like when all of these uh ethereum validators ethereum acres are given the option to sign up for additional slashing conditions because they get more yield they're going to sign up for all the slashing conditions that they can just like layer on all the mods like juice my yields up to 20 humans aren't good at this whole risk thing yeah I I think this is kind of should be considered the base case for a decent a decent portion of the ethereum stakers who are going to sign up for a lot of extra yield because we've seen that before uh so like what's the risk here is this a legitimate concern like why why is this a why is this not going to kill ethereum okay so you know I like the idea of the Skyrim mods I think what we want is if us if somebody installs a Skyrim mod and the mod crashes that's totally okay somebody installs a Skyrim mod and the server Burns that's not okay right like that's the principle that you want to hold here so how do you make the server not crash but the mod crash right like the mod crashing is like their karma like they did something bad like their their service not well built it should not have good protections but you know ethereum stakers should not get like their steak should not be burnt or something for that how do we do this is partly by holding to the core standards of what I explained which is have objectively attributable slashing conditions and when you have objectively attributable searching conditions which are well vetted and onboarded then what happens is you get so imagine somebody builds newer and newer consensus protocols so let's just take this as a special example right consensus protocols ethereum has a consensus protocol all other chains have their own consensus protocols and I would say the uh the uh project to figure out the best consensus protocol is nowhere near done like it's academically an ongoing exercise as well as you know industry Innovation is still not stopped so what do we do there the slashing conditions very simple what's the slashing condition if you sign two messages which are conflicting with each other right like two two blocks then you get slashed so the slashing contract can be the same contract across hundreds of consensus protocols so you have a very well vetted simple flashing protocol in fact you could also have in your node software something we call an anti-slasher what it does is I don't know I cannot trust these hundreds of different node software that I'm running but I have this thing but that whenever I'm signing a message I'll make sure I don't sign a conflicting message I'm basically forward simulating the slashing contract and making sure that I'll never trigger the slashing contract so this is called an anti-slasher module so you just double check this and now you go dgen into like hundreds of different consensus protocols nothing happens to you by the way this is the same thing that happens on ethereum right on ethereum when you're speaking you're really staking into all applications that are built on top of ethereum it's just that the only slashing condition that you have is the ethereum's slashing condition right so when people think about like oh you know new Services building on top is adding leverage that's already there in proof of stake right you stake what if tomorrow like you know at one trillion dollar stablecoin protocol Launches on ethereum it is going to increase leverage and that's that's default built in into the structure of proof of State it's just that it's going to generate generate enough fees over the longer term that because you're generating more fees more more things going to get staked because more things gonna get staked the total value of each itself grows all of these second order effects is what regularizes this economy the same thing happens also on eigen layer okay so the high level is how do you make sure that stakers are protected and like I said the two-tier system is what fear building that's our best attempt at saying that here's a great of like service which has gone through all this kind of wetting and we want to do our best in in guiding that and bring best of the community members into that and there's going to be a permissionless tier which we will say is don't use you know use at your own risk it's extraordinarily risky whatever and we will see basically what happens is risk stratification which is you know stakers are usually like load sticking right among all the family of like you know D5 regions and other stakers are one stable long-term yield you know so that's the kind of people who are participating in this economy or they want to support the ethereum ecosystem and want to contribute their own decentralization to it so we basically kind of expect that to be like a very high grade low risk uh tier but they'll also be like a free tier because if we don't enable it somebody will enable it and you know it's just there is an emergent economy there that you know the only thing that we can do is to educate and you know you two are at the top of that game uh I appreciate you saying that sriram we certainly try but um the only way we move forward is honestly with with conversations like this it's all we're doing is we're just airing our education and putting that out in podcast form um the other thing I do to get educated is I read posts by this guy named vitalik buterin uh it's pretty smart I don't know if you've heard of him um he wrote a fantastic post uh I think it was fantastic I'm still sort of trying to walk through the implication of what he was trying to say and what this means but it was a post entitled don't overload ethereum consensus uh I'll read a few things from it over the years did you make him write this I feel like was this you I feel I feel like it so uh vitalik says this in the post over the years there have been a number of ideas usually at the thought experiment uh stage to also use the ethereum validator set and perhaps even ethereum social consensus for other purposes one of those other purposes he mentions is restaking he also mentions eigenlayer and this is eigenlayer feels much more beyond the thought experiment stage okay this is going to main chain type of uh stage and he says the purpose of this post will be to explain in detail the argument why in my view a certain subset in italics certain subset of these techniques brings High systemic risk to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted a certain subset of techniques maybe like restaking that use the ethereum validator set ethereum social consensus for another purpose should be discouraged and resisted I'm curious uh what do you think vitalik was saying in this post what was your reading of this post yeah I uh I think the title uh do not overburden ethereum consensus my my read of the actual uh article is do not overburden ethereum's social consensus and essentially it is creating this layering principle what is the concerns of the state and what's the concerns of the free market right and ethereum had to go through this Growing Pains like very early in its life at the application layer the application layer you had things like the Dao hack and how does you know the social consensus of ethereum respond to this and one of the very important things that vitalik and others had to do is do this one-time thing where like okay you know we're going to revert this but only for this time it's not going to happen again and again and set a boundary and a shelling point that people don't assume that they can take excess risk and then externalize it back to the protocol the way I think about it is you know you guys talk a lot about this like you know Banks right Banks go and take risks and you know they may crash and if they crash and burn they're going to come to like the government and say Hey you know 2008 that's exactly what happened too big to fail too big to fail we also heard that in the crypto space if you remember we're gonna be too big to fail and yeah those words but the the thing is I think basically uh the uh I read the article as basically saying Hey Now That We're Going Beyond applications now that we're talking about the raw decentralized trust being supplied I want to make it clear or at least with italics wanting to make it clear what is what aspects of decent Life Trust may be usable and what is not your support and he's basically saying Social consensus is sacred don't touch it don't signal that oh you know if something happens in ABCD protocol like I'm I'm I have the backing of ethereum and he he doesn't single out restaking I think it's true for things like layer tools so you can't say oh I'm a big layer too if I fail then ethereum is going to Fork around my failure if you're a big like application like you know if you're a uniswap if you're a maker because you know this has already been said for the applications it doesn't have to be spelled out but it's the same principle if you're a big tap on top of ethereum for a big stable coin if there's a failure we're not going to Fork around you same thing for risk taking if you restake and you know if your risk taker said Son and gives these examples where like you know and we've we've internalized all this in internal discussions with both EF but also reading all of the things that ethereum researchers have written over the years the idea that you know you don't want to Fork so one of the issues that could happen you know when social focusing would be triggered is a lot of like honest parties lose their money in a in a way that they didn't anticipate and one way you you might not anticipate is if you slash nodes for failures of disagreeing with the majority in the normal mode you assume that the majority is right right and if you say that oh whenever you disagree with the majority I'm going to slash you let's say I built an Oracle and say that hey you know uh anybody that disagrees with the majority is going to lose their reach right and then now what could happen is a lot of stakers who opted in May basically say that a majority is malicious and now like a minority which is honest gets slashed relative to the majority and then everybody's like oh my God I trusted the majority and it's you know creating these problems now and you need to go for Keith right like so those are the kinds of examples where you don't want that to happen in the same way things like hacks smart contracts hacks that's why we built in things like the slashing veto which is a social consensus internal to the protocol rather than saying it's external to us and ethereum has to Fork around failures so that's that's how I read it is as marking the boundaries of the layer the ethereum core consensus the the social consensus is reserved for core protocol functions and like I mentioned the core protocol function for which we need social slashing is censorship other than that we don't need social flashing for anything everything is algorithmic maybe if there's a failure in get or like all the consensus layer clients or something like that there is a possibility but we should not be using this nuclear power for anything else that's vitalik's posters no bailouts no bailout that's the shortest summary possible I agree with that completely I think your answer to this is is the same it's like hey if if you loaded up all those mods and your computer crashed that's on you that does not go back to the server and that's the same thing that vitalik saying in his article I was like okay it's fine that your server crashed because that's the choice that you made but it's the buck stops at extending that back to the to the main Hub uh and that is and that is simply something that I think you SRI rum are saying like well it doesn't matter if they load up all the mods because uh and so long as vitala we follow through on vitalik's post and except that hey there's no bailouts if they if we accept that there's no bailouts you can load up all the mods that you want because all the consequences are on your machine or on your e stake I think I think your answer to these things are are the same just articulate in two different ways is that right I I think that's correct and uh you know uh we've been talking to the EF researchers or the last like one and a half years and this is the first thing donkrat told me like one and a half years back is don't overload social consensus you know do anything else once you set it it's gonna happen it's much rather that somebody who cares about this ecosystem do it then like somebody who doesn't but I think the other risk that uh is not necessarily mentioned in vitalik's article is things like over financialization of native restaking so things like you know you're going to draw a loan against the collateral that you're using so basically you you eigenet is not a D5 protocol right like we are we want to supply validation Services we are not supplying like defy services so what it means is you're not going to be able to take out a loan against your like collateral position or whatever kinds of things and it's because you know it's not going to be onboarded in the permissioned uh you know uh committee and people wrote things like oh how is street I'm going to meet it I'm not mediating this the slashing there's a slashing veto and the slashing veto kind of onboard services on who which set of services are low risk and it's very important that this happens it is possible to build Financial applications on top but with a layer of buffering so imagine you build like um a liquid sticking protocol so just take ethereum right like you know a liquid shaking protocol you take a liquid shaking token and then you go and do something in a landing Market or whatever any issue happening there doesn't affect the core you know staking protocol because it's buffered by the liquid staking so that could be liquid staking on top of something like eigen layer and then that buffer some of them so there are layers that are going to be built but what is built at what layer is very important and so in our layer we are building validation as a service that's the core thing and we have basic rules use only objective slashing use a slashing veto slashing videos power to onboard use uh you know if you're using anything which is not objectively very Fable just use decentralization don't use slashing don't assume that you're going to be bailed out by ethereum social consensus but if a majority of you if you trust a majority of the ethereum nodes to be honest and they are not for whatever reason you're on your own that's the trust model and that's how like eigenet is going to work yeah the the new bailouts point is I think a very valid one and yet I am also comforted by the fact that um there have been many candidates on ethereum for uh the too big to fail designation in the past I remember when maker Dao was one of those and die was I remember another one that you know uh said that anyone who controls usdc uh will be kind of the king maker of a future ethereum for you know another candidate for this is Lido another one is the various exchanges you know the the finances or the the coinbase is the Kraken now now it's restaking is kind of a candidate for you know Fork trip I'm strangely comforted that there are so many candidates for too big to fail in all separate categories that's a really good point because all of them have to agree to actually do anything they will agree which is which is also a contributing fact to this decentralization so sriram this has been uh you know an exciting journey and really unders like understanding what we staking is I think we've got to um you know tie this off with understanding where eigenlayer is as part of the deployment process so when you guys launching is there going to be a token I know like we've talked about using eth for security but we've also talked about use cases for like a token maybe somewhere else so tell us about launch date for mainnet and and token and then I've got one last question for you and then we'll close on that but what are the specifics when you guys go on mainnet okay so I'll if you think about the structure of our Marketplace it's three-sided we have stakers you know people with who are putting in the heat we have node operators who may be the same as the stickers may be different right you know you could be your own node operator or you could delegate to somebody else and then we have Services which is people building bridges oracles whatever other kinds of things on top of the system and we have three sides to the marketplace so we are basically going on a phased roadmap where we launch one side at a time we're starting with staking you just restake you cannot do anything with it but you understand what is going on with the ecosystem as now news take on boards into ethereum they have a one-time opportunity to set the withdrawal credentials when you stake is when you can set the withdrawal Powers so you know people who want to participate in the eigenveyor ecosystem may want to restake in the beginning so the the three phases are like turn on stakers then turn on delegation and node operators and then turn on like actually working services on the main net and so there is a same set of phases going on in the test net we're already on a public test net on gorley with just restaking so there'll be a corresponding thing on the main net then there is a delegation there'll be a delegation on the main net then there are Services services on the main net so that's our launch roadmap and we expect this to take like the first version is going to be between Q2 and Q3 and then every quarter after maybe the next phase gets on this year starting uh yeah okay the first phase is going to be between Q2 and Q3 of the CR um and then the every every face is like a quarter after you know something like that basically we expect this is the whole system to be functioning once all these three uh sites are onboarded so in terms of whether we have a token we don't have a token um the the design philosophy in eigenlayer is we start with something very specific performing a certain role this protocol think of eigen layer as a protocol it's designed with very similar aesthetic to ethereum in the sense of you know try to make the protocol neutral try to make um all the decisions pushed to the agents you know for example which liquids taking tokens do we allow we allow all request taking tokens it's up to the services to figure out which tokens they want to respect and so on so there's a lot of agency pushed out to their services rather than very specific decisions being made at the protocol level but as the protocol evolves and we understand the role for governance we may have to think about how to create a decentralized governance uh you know so we are committed to a progressive decentralization roadmap rather than to decentralization on day one so sriram as we wrap this up with kind of the last question I'm I want to bring this round round circle to where we started which was kind of your Arc and and how you really got interested in Krypton what you're here on Earth to to go do and uh something you said earlier was like upgrading Humanity uh maybe maybe that's the reason you got into computational genomics upgrading Humanity on kind of the genetic level and that would apply maybe to individuals and groups but then you discovered crypto and that was really an opportunity to upgrade Humanity on as a social technology on the social level to allow us to coordinate across uh large groups even better it's funny you mentioned the book sapiens I know Dave and I have mentioned it many times on the episode that was actually a very Salient book for me when I was getting into crypto and kind of understanding the the why the impact that this technology could actually have I want you to imagine five years from now where we have um restaking in eigenlayer restaking as a core primitive is now successful what does that do you to afford the goal of upgrading our social technology like I think people outside of crypto right now after 2022 different deserved Lisa like I understand their perspective or saying uh what is crypto doing for the world like because I saw a whole bunch of Ponzi schemes and I saw this guy named SBF making out with like 15 billion like what are you guys actually doing for the world and right now of course their bear case is nothing crypto's meme coins and scams and there's nothing lasting there which I think is bullish for Builders like us who see something more so take us five years in the future restaking is a core primitive we are able to export trust from our blockchain networks in different forms not just block space what does the world look like what have we accomplished what's on our crypto resume go for it um so let me start with the core principle like one of my like very fundamental principles is uh you know non-zero-sum games if you think about like a zero-sum game is where like one has to win for one to end the other has to lose right and a non-zero-sum game is where both of us can win there are really only two kinds of non-zero-sum games number one is cooperation like we coordinate together like you and um David and Ryan could have gone their own ways but coming together they produced this like really amazing podcast and in so coordination is one example of a non-zero-sum game the other non-zero-sum game is innovation Innovation is I take sand and I make silicon out of it I take air and I make Spectrum out of it right like all of these amazing things where you know it's nothing and then it becomes something like these are the two like fundamental things and it's the one of my like kind of Life metrics is maximize the surface area of non-zero-sum games right like the more non-zero-sum games we produce the more net output you know otherwise it's all like I lose a new man or you win an I lose or somebody else knows this it's not fun so how do we maximize the surface area of non-zero sum games is we have to maximize the ability to cooperate the ability to coordinate what are some examples I think again uh some of these things are best seen like when we take back like 2000 years right like how does society look like you know imagine you're living in your own tribe there are certain Virtues Of like a tribe which we're missing in the modern world for example you know I know my teacher like I build a one is to one relationship with my teacher and you know if my teacher is not doing well and you know I you know I don't take care of my teacher that's shame on me right and that's an example of a one is to one long-term relationship between a teacher and a student and that's broken in the modern world same thing with the farmer and like the consumer or you know all kinds of different relationships but the problem with those kinds of like tribal relationships is they're one is to one they're long term which is awesome but you can only form it within the small group of people that you trust right otherwise there's no long term there's no way to exchange goods and information and like you know learn from people who are outside you're a small group so what we've done in the world is to move from that to a very decent you know very multi uh a multitude of people contribute to our education a multitude of people contribute to our health the multitude of people work together in producing our supply chain and all of these things but what the way we've structured It Is by pricing out each each transaction into money that's what has basically made this trustless right like I go and learn some something from somebody from a piano teacher and I pay him like a hundred dollars an hour whatever so we price out each transaction but what that does is break the long-term alignment right to have long-term alignment we need two things we need long-term memory and long-term enforcement you need a system which remembers who your teacher was when you were in your fourth grade and who inspired you into going into this direction you need to be able to make a commitment to that teacher that hey if I do well I'm going to pay you X you know long-term income shares you need when you're going and dealing with the doctor you need to be able to engage in a way that essentially aligns your long-term Fates much more tightly than the medical system does today when you're engaging with the global supply chain you have to understand where like effects come from and go back so essentially think of this as broadening the system of karma like the ability to attribute and Karma itself is a system of memory and enforcement right like it's it's a theological philosophical concept that you know if you do good things good things will come back to you but you need a system to measure track all these things that you actually did and things like staking and slashing are like some simple examples but not the only thing that we want to produce okay so that's on the cooperation side the cooperation velocity can be increased massively when you have Global Systems of memory and Global Systems of enforcement on the other side if you think of what enhances Innovation Innovations enhanced when it becomes permissionless when I can build on top of your things without your permission because you don't need to know who I am I can just come up with some new things and build it and you don't need to trust me because we're all interacting with each other on top of this like trust engine which is the blockchain Innovations get decoupled from trust trust is under return by from the blockchain and Innovations decoupled and underwritten on a different layer that lets Innovations compose with each other so I see essentially crypto as turbocharging the two core reasons why we can have non-zero-sum games or in other economic terms why we have growth in this world and I think you know by working relentlessly towards the school you know we can do something really fun together that is a very comprehensive very cool answer and I like that 20-year Vision I think if we can introduce the world to how crypto is scaling non-zero-sum games cooperation scaling reciprocity might be another word for karma and scaling Innovation and permissionless Tech that certainly would be something would be quite transformational so sriram we're I guess maybe the first few steps of a Thousand Mile Journey but uh but here we are with this concept called restaking thank you so much for coming on Bank listen educating us about this today we appreciate you thank you so much Ryan and David this has been such an awesome uh opportunity and a privilege to talk to the bankless listeners today here we go bankless listeners some action items for you today we mentioned a few things to go read one is uh don't overload the consensus layer that's a post from vitalik we'll include that a link in the show notes of course I gotta include the the book link sapiens from eval Noah Harari is one of my favorite books it was mentioned so any excuse I can do to inject this in the show notes I'll take it gotta end with this risks and disclaimers of course none of this has been Financial advice crypto is risky we don't know what the the future eth yield will bear nor all the restaking protocols that you could ape into uh but be careful out there we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot [Music] thank you [Music]
