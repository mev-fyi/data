if inflation does come down quickly because of the banking crisis and the FED is able to Pivot and unemployment doesn't increase then that could be saved in time that is the needle that needs to be threaded that's exactly right if the FED pivot happens before a recession is actually starting if inflation comes down fast enough liquidity improves Etc it's extremely bullish for risk assets so the big question is can the economy survive without going into a recession by the time the FED pivots because the FED will eventually pivot the question is does the FED pivot too late
