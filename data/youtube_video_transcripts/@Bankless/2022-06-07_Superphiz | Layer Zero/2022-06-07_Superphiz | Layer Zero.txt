if you have an ether and you want it to be valuable then you have to act in ways that bring value to the network welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but is composed of people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today on layer 0 i'm talking with super fizz and super fizz is a community member of a number of different parts of the ethereum community the r eth finance subreddit the rocket pool community the eath staking community he's just fascinated by each staking and so i would call him an eat staking expert although he probably wouldn't like that expert title uh he's just a communi community member through and through and living and breathing and dying for decentralized protocols and superfiz uh is worried at this present moment he calls ethereum under attack and so what is ethereum under attack by this is the conversation of liquid staking derivatives which has been a very significant conversation in the ethereum space lately and how liquid staking derivatives things like it's like tokenized staked eath tokens like uh staked eats from lido r e from rocket pool we talk about the conversation of how liquid staking derivatives might come to centralize ethereum and what we can do about that uh and so this is a you guys are looking to learn more about that conversation this is a great place to get started we also talked about other things like um how superfizz got started with bitcoin even before getting into ethereum we got started with bitcoin and uh what how he felt that the bitcoin community let him down and the lessons that he has learned from that era of his life and how he has applied that forward to ethereum so i hope you guys enjoyed this fantastic interview with superfiz from rocketpool from eath finance from east acres right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your east with rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your east and use it in d5 at the same time you can get four percent on your east by sticking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16e to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pool to ease so your apy is boosted so if you're bullish east staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocketpool community in their discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so i'll see you there maker dow is the og d5 protocol the maker dao produces dye the industry's most battle tested and resilient stable coin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dye directly with maker the power to mint new money is in your hands the maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced dows in existence they've been here since the beginning they've seen it all and so you can mint die with the assurance that your collateral is safe soon maker will be present on all chains and l2s so minting dye can take place on oasis.app xerion zapper or any other d5 protocol that you use follow maker on twitter maker dow and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence [Music] ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave v3 is here ave v3 has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of d5 including isolation mode which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types and also efficiency mode which allows for a higher loan to value ratios and of course portals allowing users to port their ave position across all of the networks that ave operates on like polygon phantom avalanche arbitrary

governance.avey.com what's up superfists how's it going hey how are you david good really good man uh the r e finance and rocket pool communities are really stoked uh for to have you on here uh which makes me stoked yeah so i mean those are my people um i um that's where i lived i i've been i've been an r theory or an re finance guy for uh you know since day one and east trader before that and eth mining before that and ethereum before that so um you know i i really feel comfortable those communities and i'm really glad uh that they like me doesn't matter it does i mean it's important before we uh we were talking about the show before this but uh before we go any further are you sweating bro yeah so uh i make no secret like i i do this this regimen like i i have like um peak fizz performance because normally you know i'm a slug and so uh if i know i'm gonna do something like this um if it's like a launch call or if it's if it's an opportunity to speak uh then like maybe a couple hours before i'll take a nap and then i'll get up and go for a really hard run and then i will uh snag the forbidden coffee uh and it kind of lets me like be my favorite self so this is you're going to get my favorite self i hope so you're telling me that this is peak what peak performance looks like yeah i i i it's sad like this is all like you think i know right like uh like oh so my um i have a goal that i'm not gonna use foul language during a recording uh because i i've learned the value of family friendly media like um i really want this to be something that that anyone can play anywhere and feel comfortable playing with it so i'm i was gonna make a joke and say i'm not gonna say right i i definitely got in trouble for having a potty mouth on the weekly roll up so now i try and keep it contained but uh sometimes sometimes i let it out regardless all right so fizz i went to the eath finance uh subreddit where you basically live as far as i can tell uh and i told them that you're coming on bankless and so they should drop some questions so i got i got a bunch of questions from the from your friends and family over at eat finance and so i also have my own questions but i kind of want to start with theirs so this first one i think is also the the question i would have asked anyways coming from uh mazwanos what drives you to be so involved in ethereum's decentralization uh i i've been a part of field networks i i've been a part of other l ones that um allowed themselves to be captured or followed the wrong goals or drank their own kool-aid and sold out on their core principles and as someone who's been involved with ethereum for a long time i i i've gone to this place where i don't want that to happen to ethereum like i want ethereum to to survive and it's something that i'm willing to put energy into like it's that valuable to me um so whatever it takes like uh whatever i need to do to organize the community to empower people to educate people uh then i'm gonna do what i can to help ethereum be successful what l ones were you a part of before you became part of the ethereum community i i affectionately call it uh block stream coin um or grandpa um i i'm one of those people i don't i don't like to to give too much name credit to things that i'm not deeply involved with or aligned with um but you know there was another cryptocurrency i think it was founded in about 2008 or 2009 uh and uh is it proof of work it's all the rage proof of work change i think it still exists i'm not really sure i haven't heard much about it lately really slow block times but you know i know i know these types have you heard of this one i loved that network um but i realized first that the community was the community wasn't always sour the community became sour and the chain became captured by people who were not aligned with the decentralization ethos i mourn the loss of that project um it's funny a lot of people don't even know it's dead but i mourn the loss of it and i i like ethereum enough that i don't i don't want to stand by and let the same thing happen again were you on the subreddit during the early days of said particular chain where a lot of that like because like it went through a fork in the road where it could have stayed community aligned or it could have gotten captured by schmucks meme i actually have i have a uh a post that i absolutely love um it's from it's from the time that i left that kind of recounted there are like 16 events that led up to um i love you guys but i'm leaving um and you know i was i was a careful observer the same way that i'm involved with ethereum and there were just so many atrocities um such a sour community um you know it's not it went beyond moderating and it got into shaping an agenda shaping a narrative that i it's just so unhealthy apps would you say psyops absolutely um it could have been avoided um it it didn't have to that chain could be healthy and vibrant it could be a good partner chain for ethereum today but um right now it's it's essentially a shell of its former self and the only people who still uh who still hold it in high regard are the people who don't know the reality behind it uh is there is the is there a future of ethereum where ethereum becomes the chain that you shall not name uh and and how do we prevent that from happening uh you know i i feel like i have i have a close enough relationship with ethereum the god what is this like i'm dating ethereum now i'll never ethereum will never be the chain that i don't mention but i i do hope that it never becomes a cautionary tale um there's there's a reason i was excited to be on your show today and it's it's to draw attention to the fact that um or better or worse ethereum is under attack right now the beacon chain is under attack and it's it's a thing we don't want to talk about um people know me as a happy guy like they think oh fizz just wants to sing kumbaya all day long um but we're under attack and i'm not the kind of guy who is gonna say you know these are the attackers everybody get them i don't subscribe to that i think the attackers in this case are probably non-malicious i think that they are probably they they see themselves as responsible actors on the network um but the role of the community in these cases is is really to stand up for the network and say wait stop this this is not what's supposed to happen um and you know some of the things i want to talk about today are are the responsibility of the community of layer one i'm sorry player zero to stepping up um and fighting for the network if they believe it's something they want to be around in 20 years because i wanted to be around in 20 years i i think a way to put a name on the attacker is to call this attacker moloch like it seems like it's a it's a moloch attack right like it is it's it's a it's a failure of coordination and it's a failure of uh its attack on poor human incentives uh and for those that don't know the molok reference moloch is basically the god of human coordination failures we did there's some articles on bankless in a previous podcast uh but it's basically symbolized in the sense that like if everyone agrees to do this one thing and abide by this one shared standard you actually increase the incentive to defect from that and ultimately because that one person or one entity can defect it makes the whole thing break down um so it's super fast to say that like the for the newer listener or for the people that just haven't given dove as deep into the world of crypto or don't have the long history to say that the aforementioned chain who it's the it's the most obvious thing i'm just going to play into the game of not mentioning it but it's the most obvious chain for those that haven't gotten it yet uh to say that that chain is broken and then also to say ethereum is under attack is like really strong language uh so before we go into the details of just like how to save ethereum from a molock attack uh why why just use like why lean into just this whole like very bold statements of just like the og the og chain is dead ethereum is under attack like these are big words yeah you know i i'm not here on your show to to get views i'm not i'm not trying to sell a message um i am uh i'm a harbinger i'm i'm like i'm i'm the i'm sharing the message as i see it on the chain or actually as i see it in the community to be honest because i you know this is not a chain message this is a community message um in regard to block stream chain you know that's a personal choice uh that i i i take full credit for my attitudes toward that chain um it's it's a a chain relationship that i had that i separated from um but when it comes to ethereum uh it's not my message it's not um hey everybody superfiz is doing this thing um i i work hard to listen and represent the needs of the beacon chain if i don't know you know i call myself the beacon chain community health consultant i take that seriously um and so i am the guy like literally looking at the chain every day and saying what are we doing right and what's not working the job of of the developers of the researchers they're building they're building the tip of the spear and i'm sort of here in the background looking it over over and everything look looking at the community and saying how are we doing um and we've reached this point where um we have uh meandered into a crisis and if we if we don't take community action to correct the crisis then um i i sincerely believe that it i i don't think it's gonna be the end of the chain but if if if moloch crosses over 33 percent um i think that we will see uh i think we'll see some effects i think that um rational sellers will look at irrational participants we'll look at other chains i think that we'll have set a precedent that it's okay to try to monopolize the network um but yeah as you say it's it's a failure of coordination it's something that we can avoid it's something that um now is the right time for us to fight for what's right okay so let's go ahead and and make things explicit because i think people from the rocket pool and people from the uh our eath finance communities definitely know what you're talking about but i think many others might not uh what what's at stake here what what do we need to fix what's going wrong um so the essential issue is uh the beacon chain runs on validators um and validators represent a 32 ether deposit in a chain um and then a responsibility to uh validate the beacon chain um at regular intervals and so uh people mostly know staking as a form of making essentially passive income on the beacon chain um beacon chain being the next iteration of the proof of stake chain for ethereum it's what we're moving to um around august hopefully the beacon chain is future ethereum that's right and it it's it is uh essentially imminent at this point um and so on the speaking chain we have uh you know about 300 000 validators um and ideally these validators represent individuals um so maybe i run a validator in my home maybe you run in one in your home um you know our friends have them and we are decentralizing and supporting the network but what happens is um people people i guess i don't mean it's an unkind way people seek a herd mentality they look for an easier way to do things um they say you know i don't i don't i don't want to run the hard work on my own or i don't have 32 ether or it's too much work but here's an easier way to do it if i give my ether to these people even rockable if i give my money to rocky pool they'll stake on my behalf and um i don't have to worry as much but i'm still getting paid and that that mental transaction is sort of where things break down because i think as as ether holders if we value if we value our ether if we value the future of the network we have this this deep responsibility to be good stewards of our ether and so if we're just value extractive and we're like hey how much can i make from this then we're going to give our ether anywhere and it doesn't matter but if we take if we take the health of the network seriously we're going to look around and say what is the landscape of of validating how can i use my ether to defend support protect and enhance the network and so ideally when you're staking any ether if you're staking you know one tenth of an ether you're going to look at all the providers and you're going to say um you know i don't have 32 ether but i want a stake so there are these you know one two three providers um and you're gonna find if you do that that one of these providers right now has about 32.45 of the validators that's essentially a hundred thousand validators or a third of the network if they cross over one third of the network uh they then um have the ability as a governor to censor the network uh they can prevent finalization they can say um we're gonna hold the network hostage until you do what we want um from the flip side of that this entity i don't believe they're evil so i don't think that they're that they intend to do that i think that they see themselves as the benevolent um leader like we're shepherding the network we're trying to take care of everyone there are so many people who want to deposit and make returns on their ether we're just trying to help them do that um but the the flaw in that logic uh is that uh staking on the beacon chain isn't inherently about making money it's inherently about securing the chain um and if you put that financial uh goal ahead of the responsibility uh then you have this kind of mutilated or mutated incentive profile and so the the moloch attack here is coming from uh hey i'm going to let everyone else run their own nodes and i'm just going to delegate my eth to somebody else and so this is the classic moloch trap where well if everyone delegates their eath to someone else then then basically we all we burn the system down in the first place and so only a very few or a small percentage of people can safely delegate their eath to others to stake on the network and it needs to be significantly smaller than those that are actually staking their nodes and staking their eth and running their nodes at home and so that proportion of like independent node runners versus delegators needs to be strong in the independent node runner's sides uh and so part of the reason why you're saying you don't think they're evil is that like this could be anyone right like we could solve this problem on this particular staking as a service platform but then just like moloch that as we used on bankruptcy so many times before like you don't actually kill moloch you end up just pushing him elsewhere and so it couldn't turn into like a whack-a-mole problem where well if people continue to delegate their eth rather than run their nodes like you're just pushing moloch in a different direction so like we can hit every single staking as a service provider on the head and say well no like clamp down on this and then it just goes to another one then we do it again we actually haven't solved the problem which is why you reference layer 0 and why i think i see a we are layer zero piece of sheet of paper in your background if that's what i'm reading correctly yeah yeah uh i'm not sure if that camera angle can get it but yeah um a friend of mine is like hey i want to sponsor your layers here at work wait will you if you'll put this up um i'll i'll send sponsorship your way and i was like that's that's like a win win win win yeah let's uh let's do it um i i truly feel like layer one is not the base of the chain uh i i get this thing i get dms like fizz you're you're wasting your time uh none of this matters as a matter of fact when i first advertised myself as the beacon chain community health consultant um leaders in leaders in ethereum sort of discounted me they're like the community is cool but you guys are really just a bunch of people hanging around in a forum and i know differently i know that layer zero is a formidable army we we are we're the farmers who go about our daily work until our network is threatened and then we take up arms and we defend our network and so i can allow people to not understand the strength of layer zero until uh there's an attack and when there's an attack that's when you know i it's time to summon everyone and say hey guys um hey you know people who are using this service and you you didn't know that you were harming the network it's time to activate let's wake up let's uh let's take responsibility for our actions let's come together let's protect the network um and then when we're done we can move on to something else so is the it's very very important to indoctrinate like a culture of node running in every single decentralized chain and so is that the solution that you are looking for is you are just looking to change the culture around node running in ethereum or are there like other also other solutions for towards solving this whole like no one should ever cross 33.3 percent of steak supply one of my favorite things about being superfiz is is i don't have to know all the answers um i i get i get to look you or anyone in the eye and say i don't know and i'm okay with that because it's not my job to know the answers so um you know the way that i envision the network is um to be honest it's things like schools and hospitals and local community governments setting up validators and running nodes to support local infrastructure i see it as individuals running nodes at home i see um i you know i see for people who don't have 32 ether they're using you've heard this a thousand times trustless decentralized open source and permissionless providers like rocketpool not just rocketpool it's the first um but we need we need 10 rocket pools um and that gives you know people the opportunity who's you know like i only have 0.01 eth but i want to fight for our network how do i do this um and then you you participate in one of these um staking solutions that um promotes network decentralization so i've said this before but i see i see staking on the ethereum network as a thin layer of validators around the world and right now what we have are a few um a few very concentrated regions uh it's something we can work i i want to uh point out uh eathsunshine.com developed by annie ambu um it's it's a decentralization dashboard that sort of um it doesn't paint a pretty picture but it definitely lays out the work ahead of us so the the image that i'm kind of getting in my head is that like there's all these taking as a service providers uh and there's there's also many more working uh that have not been like uh they haven't been released yet so i'm like are in beta some are just kind of working behind the scenes then there are ones that are live and it kind of reminds me of like the whole curve force thing where the curve wars are like trying they're trying to bribe people to uh to join their side right to to join their their their governance weight or just like direct the curve emissions towards their pool right and so like the curve wars are trying to fight over the emissions of crv and then the staking as a service providers are trying to fight over their share of staking rewards uh and every every single uh staking as a service provider takes their fee right and so if they have more tvl more assets under management under their pool they get a larger fee structure and that's the bold case for um that's a bold case for every single syncing as a service provider and this this is uh keeping ethereum decentralized versus like uh competition right bitcoiners love to think bitcoiners love to say that uh bitcoin is always uh decentralized because even the biggest proof-of-work whiners will ultimately decay just because that's what proof-of-work hardware does uh and and you know i don't really buy into that but like you could you could kind of allude to the same thing going with ethereum security where just like the best proof of stakes uh security provider will win the one with the most up times the one with the one with the cheapest fees they will attract the most tvl and then they win because of sheer competition but what doesn't win is the ethereum chain the staking as a service provider wins but what loses is the whole staking as a service chair or the whole ethereum chain in the first place because if one of stake provider wins the race and in the same way where um uh cvx convex finance won the curve wars and now it's basically a convex finance wars if that happened in ethereum and just like staking as a service provider abc wins the east staking game ethereum as a whole entire ecosystem loses uh and now we don't really have a game to play anymore so that is where that metaphor breaks down fizz is this even possible how how do we prevent like is this an even a possible future to prevent yeah uh so you know what you said makes so much sense because if you think about the most efficient design to run ethereum validators it's putting them all in one place let's centralize them let's let's just make a database that's right yeah and and the funny thing is as as obviously incorrect as that seems um people tend toward it people tend toward that herd mentality uh so it's it's definitely possible for us to work through layer zero to coordinate to further decentralize um the network it's something that that we'll have to continue doing forever there i get so many comments from people who say fizz how long are we gonna have to do this forever it's it's it's never going to end we don't we don't develop a piece of software and upload it to github and suddenly the network is decentralized decentralization is is the role and responsibility of holders if you have an ether and you want it to be valuable then you have to act in ways that bring value to the network and so i think this will uh bring me to my second question from the east finance community uh and i'll lead into it with this uh bitcoiners like to say that don't trust verify or basically just remove all human governments governance and just replace with math for example everything that we can replace with math should be replaced with math and if you're telling me that like we're gonna have to fight this layer zero fight forever that sounds like an uphill battle like and the one of the reasons why this crypto world works is that we've actually been able to replace uphill battles of the old world and replace them with downhill battles of the new world uh and so uh lagris the bard his first question is how can we economically incentivize a 22 soft cap of any given state staking network what incentives can be marshaled to incentivize staking networks to voluntarily cap themselves what economic penalties can be applied to staking networks who grow too large any thoughts on these questions yeah i have a great thought uh logarith is six times smarter than i am so i can't wait to see what he comes up with like um you know david i i let myself not have all the answers i i'm not i'm not uh some shaman who's like um laying out the path forward for everyone i i'm a member of the community who recognizes that um we have an opportunity for growth and so i don't want people to look at me for the answers i don't want people i don't i don't want to be a leader i want to um be a part of a movement that makes ethereum stronger so when someone like logari asks a question um you know hey this what do i do i am literally gonna say i don't know logan what do we do um because there are so many people in the community who know hundreds of times more than i do i'm i'm a school psychologist like i'm a counselor i don't know i don't know crap about uh economic structures i know how communities work i know how to how to de-escalate conflict between middle schoolers really well but when you get into complex economic concepts or developer concepts then i'm very okay saying there are other people in the community who are more able to address those questions than i am it's funny because i responded that it wasn't a joke like i i'm okay being normal i can normalize who i am i don't have to have all the answers and so okay so you're really leaning into you are just like sounding the horn you're the paul revere who was saying the british are coming the british are coming but you're not necess you don't actually know like how to strategize an army here other than just i don't even want to be paul revere i i i'm doing a job that has to be done i'm doing something that um i wish someone else would do i i don't i don't want to do this i i want to um i want to trade nfts and lose money on them but when uh i got a question on that later actually when i see when i see a network that i value in trouble then i'm gonna give everything i have as you know as a counselor to to do what to save it um and it it i don't want to be paul revere i i want to just be a participant in a larger thing okay so let me play devil's advocate for a second um and so there's a in the 2021 we saw this uh growth of just like anti-eth maxies in the crypto world uh uh i'll name some names even though you don't have to like the solana communities the avalanche communities uh the formerly terra communities uh there was like there's a newsletter out there that uh is uh uh titled um or it's not in the title but it's like in the tagline as to why you subscribe it's titled no ethmaxis uh and so like this this growing cohort of just like no ethmaxis uh out there um uh and ironically the guy the guy who runs that newsletter got the idea from from me on our kobe podcast and i was like other people need to make other content for other ecosystems not bankrupt not come crying and bankless that's why we don't talk about you guys anyways i'm off on a sidetrack the point is is that like all of those like uh don't be east maxies don't be a bitcoin maxi like uh line i'm i'm willing to bet all of my eth that as soon as like that one particular community whatever that one community is like were to flip ethereum in market cap they would just become like the the new maxis right they would become the new avalanche maxies and so applying and just because like any underdog is like don't be a maximalist accept our chain uh and then as soon as they're the the upper dog as soon as they're on top they're they're they just turn into the new maxis right and so like it's really just a strategy of where you are in the dominance in a dominance stack right and so rocket pool being having lesser tvl than the alternative staking pools do you believe that the rocket pool community has it in them to if they were the ones that were at 32 percent of the stake and the rpg rpl token was like 10x the price and and they're all like super wealthy and happy do you think they would also be ready to sound the alarm and cut back against their own interests right like does the rocket pool community have the layer zero to protect ethereum uh in some ways i feel like it's a loaded question because you know i'm a member of the rocket bowl community and i've spent a lot of time um in my own way cultivating that community to hold what i consider to be the highest interest of ethereum and so i know that uh many leaders in the rocket pool community have committed to um to my my suggestion of 22 capping and then vitalik followed that with a 15 cap i also know stakewise has has voluntarily um offered to cap at 22 percent um i think it's easier when you're the underdog to say if we get that big yes uh because you know it's it's sort of it's a it's a feather in your cap it's a promotional um it's harder for that community who's already there to say uh okay we'll turn it off we'll we'll stop taking money sure um but rocket pool in my mind is aligned with the fundamental ethos of ethereum it is decentralized permissionless god i don't want to say those things over again because it sounds so packaged um but it's one of those things where i align with the community because they're doing uh ethereum the way that that i believe ethereum should be done um and if they if they reach that threshold um if if they didn't throttle then then i would walk away uh in the same way honestly that that i would have to to look for other not i i don't think another chain exists but i if ethereum was captured i would say god i i hope something else comes along i hope something else um you know is better can i can i circle back to this maxi conversation sure we've entered this this culture where we've sort of become an anti-maxi culture um and i you know i'm even hesitant to call myself an ethmaxy but but i am right now uh if something changes in ethereum then i may become a maxi for another chain but what i really like to see are people who have who have a a wallet balance that is that is really based on one chain if if you're a solana maxi or a al goran maxi cardano like believe something and and work to make that better and when you believe that that thing has failed look for something else but what what i don't have a lot of respect for are people who um maybe play the the top ten on coin gecko these people aren't committed to any technology they're just trying to make money they're not trying to improve any ecosystem they're not trying to uh to make things better for anyone they're just trying to extract value where they can so i'm really okay with um you know i don't really agree with with people who uh who buy in you know to some of the all layer ones but fine pick one make it better develop it grow it improve it compete um that that's it's just it's a pet peeve of mine that that i have to be ashamed to be an ethmaxy um and i'm not ethereum is is the future right now and i hope it stays that way and if it's not the future uh then i'm going to go somewhere else and support another project so forever ago i want you to check my thinking on this forever ago on bank lists not that long ago it was like six or seven months ago maybe less actually uh i wrote a pool about like an intro i wrote an article on bank list titled like uh something about like uh the the case for decentralized staking as a service providers uh it's basically all about rocket pool uh and the the framing that i i took was just like uh first we had uh first we had tokens on ethereum and then we had a need to uh swap tokens so we made ether delta and that got replaced by unit swap use much better and all of a sudden ethereum solved its own problem of like liquidity now not only do we we don't even actually technically need to depend on external uh centralized exchanges at this point for liquidity ether the ether liquidity actually can come from internal to the network so that's a really cool problem uh a really cool problem to solve it's just like yo we can actually have our own liquidity environment for ether of the asset that's really important for the security of the network we need ether to be liquid um and the pitch was also about well well rocketpool is just like an app layer thing on ethereum that can solve its own like centralization issues where instead of staking with coinbase you can just stick with rocketpool and it's an app layer solution to some of its own centralization problems and like in theory which will never actually be proven out in practice uh if rocket pool was somehow bug and exploit free like it could just like absorb a hundred percent of the stake and it could just be uh it could be the dominant staking as a service providers why why am i wrong here uh it's it's governance centralization it is that rocket pull exists as a layer on top of the staking network um and as much as you can say that they exert a tiny little bit of authority any authority at that governance layer is a risk um and i want to i want to talk about two reasons it's a risk the first reason is not likely but it is essentially rocket pull saying um hey guys we have found a way to make more money all we have to do is censor these transactions so in our installer we're just we're gonna you know update this file it's no big deal everyone run it um and because you know everyone who is subscribed to rocket pool um is you know they're incentivized to to maintain that relationship that governance relationship with rocketpool and so they're very likely to do those things without questioning um and so that's an unlikely risk but the fact that it exists leads to the second risk and the second risk is it's governance capture it is that um entities around the world who might be interested in using ethereum look at the network and they see this artificial governance layer that controls the beacon chain and they say i'm i'm not comfortable putting my business on that chain because of the potential for one governor to control the network and that's where the real risk risk is it's not that they'll actually ever do anything it's that third parties nation states corporations will will examine the chain and they'll say this is not a decentralized network this is a network run by two operators or i'm sorry let me call them entities two entities and at that point none of us know that like we may not even be aware of it but what happens is five eight ten years down the road the network is stagnant and we're trying to figure out what happened like why didn't we explode why didn't things grow why didn't we get adopted um because we've turned a blind eye to our own weaknesses and that's the thing that that i really want to encourage us to avoid were those two entities dave and darren is that who you're referring to okay i don't know um i i was thinking well i'm not gonna say what i was thinking but um i i just no coming okay uh okay i'm like i'm just gonna dig the hole deeper okay so yeah i upon asking that question then then like ethereum has done a very good job making sure it doesn't have token governance right it's not tezos where uh the actual asset is on chain governance there's explicit no governance baked into ether and so if rocketpool just takes uh all the supply even if it is maximally decentralized it's distributing all the nodes it still produces on-chain governance around it in a roundabout way via the rpl token so we don't like that so we definitely need multiples taking as a service providers to compete for for all of this but not have one dominate i was actually so i was talking to uh hazu a while ago about like why he supported the dominant current staking as a service provider and his answer was that like well the alternative is really just centralized exchanges uh and so even even a compromised alternative is a better than if there's like imagine if coinbase had like 34 of this 32 percent of the stake that the dom the current dominant player has and then also you added on the current amount like coinbase has then we're beyond 33 we're in somewhere probably in like the 40 or something and that's that gets really scary and that leans into right exactly what you're talking about we're like oh sweet it's this is called ethereum but it's actually coinbase chained we don't really want that uh and so having semi-decentralized taking as a service providers is a mitigation against that uh and so that was his rather like i'm sorry i don't want to cut you off rather than having one semi-decentralized decentralized provider really we're better off with a lot of providers um a lot of providers who who we can ensure are not colluding um so you know one provider one one entity will say if if we're not running all of the validators then coinbase will well do you know what the moment that coinbase gets to 32.45 of the network um or maybe it's uh you know someone someone in reddit was like what if you know microsoft is just going to take over the chain anyway well the moment microsoft crosses a threshold and i'm i'm in awe of the 15 threshold that uh vitalik suggested but the moment we get to that point that's when the community needs to say stop you're crossing a line that is where layer zero comes in so uh you know for this this one entity to say if we're not doing it someone else will that's fine let someone else do it because we'll deal with them as well we will approach them the same way that we've addressed you um and that that is how we enact governance as a community is social shaming at the layer zero level the most the strongest tool in the tool belt uh i don't want to call it shaming i i don't know i don't call i don't want to do shaming i'm not a shamer i'm not anti-anyone i am pro beacon chain so um my my goal for our community is is to rise to a high standard and promote the beacon chain i'm not here to shame anyone i'm not i appreciate the work of those entities who have developed staking solutions to allow people to participate in the network i'm not here to shame them i'm here to promote the health of the beacon chain you said that you were in awe about vitalik's 15 why is the 15 such a such a crazy number you know i think it's something we all believed in the beginning um i i love i don't know it was a devcon i believe where metallic is on stage saying you know you'll be able to validate on ethereum from a laptop um i was i was taken by that i i believed that i subscribed to it i still subscribed to it um and so that led me to believe that the beacon chain will be comprised of you know hundreds of thousands of people staking from their homes on laptops um when that didn't unfold kind of as we expected uh you know we're all asking ourselves the question what level of what level of centralization of entity governance is acceptable um and so you know i as fizz i chose 22 percent because it requires so 22 meaning one entity cannot prevent finalization it requires more than three entities to change finalization so that seemed like a safe number i uh floated it around um thought about it got some feedback on it and it felt right to me so the community level then is is 22 um everyone everyone was silent on that and you know i not everyone the ethereum researchers were silent on that and it leads me to think you know fizz are you on the right track are you are you doing are you following the right direction uh and then you know a few weeks after that um danny tweeted you know 33 is an attack and i'm like okay well maybe maybe my my gauge was a little off maybe somehow 22 is okay but 33 percent that's that's when we that's when we need to to draw the line um and i sort of even went beyond that and i realized that 33 is a developer kind of limit where the community will kick in at 22. and then vitalik with his 15 message because you know vitalik is here for decentralization he's serious he's not he's not looking for any of the other um centralized distributed networks that we could have created uh i i don't i love what uh anthony cesano says about not being a cult of personality i'm not a cult of personality for vitalik but i have a heck of a lot of respect for him um and i align with his dream for a truly decentralized ethereum network and when vitalik says um at 15 you should begin throttling your operation raising prices changing things to dissuade more deposits um i i realized you know this is the right way we're on the right track we the community is doing the right thing by encouraging um further decentralization 15 makes sense to me if like we're talking about thresholds here where like uh if two entities had 15 percent they still wouldn't get to the 33.3 required to prevent finalization uh and so it goes from just like just from one entity at 22 to two entities at 15 are required uh so from a threshold standpoint that that certainly makes sense uh and while it's not baked into the actual protocol itself in in producing and this isn't what vital metallic wasn't promoting that either he was saying he should it should be part of the community like status quo which would be part of the layer zero he was basically referring to that if you are running a staking as a service provider you should start price gouging he used the words price gouging uh which makes sense to me because like you get to balance um if you're super successful and if you have a monopoly you as a monopoly you get to raise prices like you get to start to price gouge and so this seems to naturally fit uh while we were talking about like one half of the equation earlier where there seems to be a convergence on one dominant winner and the seeking as a service business because the best service will win out there's the other side of that where just like well if you are the one that's winning you also get to increase your prices and you get to be the most lucrative and so in theory it'll make your token price go up a lot but it'll make your e's share supply go down a lot which is kind of like good that's pretty good yeah that's a good outcome i i was impressed you know um we use the tools we have available and the tool that i have available is community vitalik understands economics in a way that i will never understand it and to hear him suggest an economic solution to something that other people are suggesting should be a protocol solution it's really elegant we we have this uh kind of tiered approach and it gives entities an opportunity to um continue profiting to continue lucrative profit profiting to continue being highly engaged in the network um and to still be good network citizens like that's really what we want to be our good citizens of the beacon

and with like promoting decentralization is to ensure that uh our kids can also play that game uh and so you were talking about uh and also our kids kids and our kids kids kids and earlier you were talking about like um putting monetary incentives ahead of responsibility uh and if everyone puts monetary incentives ahead of responsibility then we remove the ability for our kids to play this game because because we put money in in front of responsibility what happens as a result is that well the network becomes corrupted and then it stops being the network that we all want it to be and then no longer can our kids play in this like fun times land which is jpegs and defy and staking which is ethereum uh and so like the the word like responsibility of like um has always like struck out as this like if you don't know what to do uh in the world uh you find something that you can be responsible for and then that gives you like the long term iterative game because like you're promoting uh the ability to make sure that that game is continued to be able to be played by yourself and then also by others yeah i i totally subscribe to that like i um i i work sometimes to diminish my my perspectives of responsibility on the chain because uh so many of so many people who would argue with me say you know it's about financial incentives stop talking about responsibility um i i don't subscribe to that i i have a responsibility to the chain to steward it to help it be healthy to steward the community um for me and i i hope for others this extends beyond financial incentives and into dreams for the future like i don't think of ethereum as a financial chain anymore i think of ethereum as the foundational layer for our shared future and i don't know what that shared future is going to look like yet i i think that decentralized society is going to be a big part of it but i'm so excited about the future of what ethereum can be that i'm done worrying about how much money i'm going to make and i'm more focused on how i can steward this growth into something that benefits humanity it's a better goal for all of us right you said i'm done thinking about how much money i can make but then you said what you said but in my mind i hear how much value can we create for others like i'm done getting mine other people can need still need to get theirs and we need to make sure that the maximum amount of value can be created for others to be shared you know i i don't want to be disingenuous i i rely on ethereum for for money i i want to be financially successful i i'm not i'm not above that but within that there's so much potential so much opportunity to um to give back you know what it leads to is uh is being a value extractor versus adding value and and my personal philosophy for anything that i engage with is to add more value than i extract i think if if every ethereum um and i'm not talking about you know people who think they're investing they're really just extracting value if every real etherean worked to add more value than they extract they would find that they would they would grow old happy because they would watch the fruition of ethereum it would become something that that's beyond their wildest dreams um and their financial needs would be met as well how do you see uh how do you do you think about like the similarities between what you do with uh being a a psychological counselor for kids in a middle school with what you do with beacon chain like can you parse out that those parallels yeah uh you know so much of it uh middle school is where i learned to build consensus um [Laughter] it's like it uh so consensus really is in my mind it is is first pulling and listening like what are the different interests here at the table um and and then it's kind of like distilling that to uh let's find one principle one principle we can all agree on and then instead of dumping that on the table you go to individuals and you say hey david i have this idea i just wanted to run it past you um and i see if you can get buy-in can i get by hey uh david you know i'm thinking about um uh you know let's let's host six merge calls is that something you're interested in do you want to do that hey do you want to do that great um so so you get that buy-in with individuals and then once you have that buy-in with individuals you go back to the group and you say hey everyone i've been thinking about this what do you guys think and so i pulled everyone i had individual conversations with with the majority of the people and then i put it out for public view and that to me that's the consensus building that i learned from honestly dealing with seventh graders who like to fight about everything like that that's how it works isn't that just politics i i don't i i would i could never imagine myself as a politician uh you know what no politics tend to be self-serving um and every politician that i'm aware of i don't trust many politicians they're all they're all thinking what's what's my piece of the pie in this what what where's my slice at um okay never mind is that just governance in that case yes because like politics is like this uh layer this gamified layer on top of governance where like we should be talking about just like instead of we use the word politics when we talk about what's happening on capitol hill when we should be using the word governance like politics is like the game of chess that people play around governance uh yeah so i've grown away from the idea of of governance and i i'm much i'm much more comfortable with the idea of consensus because governance governance is a game in in many ways and i'm not playing games i'm looking for um for ideas that people can gravitate toward um maybe you know that that if you took a a pure definition of governance it would probably be ideas that that people can gravitate toward but the word has been it's been through so so much that it now carries baggage and it's it's kind of a less pure word but consensus is still a reflection of ideas that people can gravitate toward so uh going back to some of the questions from the r e finance community uh and this one's about bankless just juxta another position oh wow great name uh she goes uh to hit uh david hoffman you david hoffman that's me uh between the eyes with love what should bankless be doing to better support decentralization are you asking me yeah yeah that was you know this is great like um you know we we we've we've had some rounds right um the thing that you can do to better support decentralization is encourage people to stake from home first if if they can stake from home have them steak from home um bankless you've developed david you guys have an awesome network i'm in awe of bankless congratulations you can use that network to train people and help people get staking in their home if they have 32 ether you can also support minority staking solutions obviously you know we've talked a lot about rocket pool um i i don't promote rocket pool because i'm pumping bags i promote rocket pool because it's currently the most healthy way to stake on the network if rocket pool reaches you know 15 percent um and that's based on vitalik's number then then i'm gonna definitely like steer toward another solution but um right now rocket pool is a solution where anyone with 16 ether can stake and then anybody with you know you can use uniswap or whatever um to to also stake the rocketpool i think bankless has bankless is the most powerful platform in ethereum you are the most powerful educator in ethereum that's that gives you a tremendous responsibility to um to kind of get this good message out like how to be a good network steward i think uh one of the reasons why we haven't totally leaned into that because we don't have any technical person uh on on bank list and so explaining the technical stuff kind of gets away from us and so especially when we are on boarding so many people we're like oh yeah you can stake your eath with this like seeking as a service provider uh and then all the bitcoiners are like that's just delegated proof of stake with extra steps uh but like which is also a little bit of the vibe that's going on here is just like it is delegated proof of stake if you choose the largest staking provider um uh and so like maybe there's like some tears to to talk about this and uh uh i do stake east on a node that's not at my home and so i don't do it with a delegated staking as a service provider but i've delegated it to someone uh he's a good man too i love that guy and so like maybe the tears go is like you you uh stake stake your eat at home with your own node with your own eth uh then you find or then if next best thing is find a friend uh stake it with them next best thing is find the most minorities taking as a service providers and then beyond that maybe is part start where you have to stop recommending anything um how would you agree with that that like degree of of help um yeah that's good eight i i see i see two two roles there and i i may this may be an oblique response to your question but um while you're you're well your base um bankless dow may not be technically savvy enough to support all of the users they are technically savvy enough to create content and a lot of times you can have one technical user create content that can be reused for thousands of non-technical users to benefit from it um and so i that is is one way um the next way is is really yeah just continuing that education of helping people understand the responsibility that comes with staking and so yeah um staking from home staking with a minority client resisting really just thinking through what does decentralization mean looking at resources like esunshine.com and saying um it's it's tough for me to look at you sunshine.com have you looked at it it shows we have something like 54 network health um i it uh i like to see success you know like uh but but by seeing our weakness by acknowledging our weakness it gives us a place to grow from and that's that's a platform we can share all right so it sounds like i need to put a bounty out for a technical explanation but also it's been a while since i've spun up a node and so uh maybe i should do a 2022 version of this uh and i'll turn that into a video um uh but then also if i could get some help from the banquet style that would be great because i know you got some technical giga brains in there um super vis are there any other like topics or conversation you want to get to before i want to get to some more fun personal conversations well uh you know i i i want to ask i wanted to give you the mantle of realizing that bankless is in a unique position to influence the future of ethereum and i think you know that um that's why it's so important that uh that you maximize the opportunity to to build this layer zero to decentralize ethereum um and i i think you get it like yeah i think we totally get it i think the the fight that we've been fighting over the last year is is less about like internal problems because i i i do think that ethereum has this like fantastic autoimmune system and so when there is an internal problem there hasn't been an internal problem that ethereum hasn't solved yet uh and so that's kind of why i haven't put too much thought and energy into this particular part of ethereum's history because like in the future hopefully in the future like a year from now two years from now this is just one of many problems that ethereum was faced with and then solved like ethereum is yet to be trumped by a problem uh and it comes from the layer zero it comes from like this autoimmune response that we have when as a community we actually do care about this stuff like we actually do care about promoting decentralization of all communities out there like it's one of the few communities that actually gets it right and i don't have to explain why we need decentralization uh and and to to illustrate to people that decentralization also really just means corruption resistance and we would like to have like uncorruptable systems and so like the fight that we've been fighting for the mostly through 2021 is like uh trying to resist against centralized chains because that would the the it wasn't really the the it's more centralized taking as a service providers that were the real threat to ethereum it was like narrative attacks from centralized uh centralized chains like you think it's bad if some like centralized service provider only has a handful of nodes well what about an entire chain and so a lot of people were talking about like oh well it's this chain that's like going to be the new thing and it's going to get this this chain is going to be the thing that kills ethereum and so like that's been our fight for like the last 18 months or so maybe a little bit less than that and frankly like it was absolutely exhausting uh yeah and just like going up against these communities while token while the token price is going up and up and up is just like you you you're just going you're going against it feels like an immovable object which is bankless about decentralization going against an unstoppable force which is like seoul avax terra price luna price going up into the moon right and like it it sucks for a really long time dude uh and like finally like we're actually able to like kind of cash in on some of that like uh credibility for actually like uh yeah promoting like not necessarily like trying to say like hey like this tara thing not necessarily sustainable you guys should be careful um uh and so like that that was our big fight it's like not necessarily internal ethereum stripes because like i said like ethereum has done a fantastic job like never really has like left a big problem go unsolved and so we've kind of especially when like our most of our communities it's not necessarily like why won't you talk about rocket pool it's like why aren't you talking about my centralized l1 uh and so like teaching about like decentralization from the external standpoint to get them into the ethereum community in the first place has kind of been like bankless fight for the last like year or so uh and so for like the rocket pool community that's out there is like why why aren't you guys caring about the health of the network it's like yo we care about the health of the industry like we're it's you guys it's you guys that care about the health of the network because we'll pass a baton on to you guys that's really honorable um i i couldn't have articulated your fight unless you described it to me and now that you've described it to me even though you know i catch a lot of bank list um i you know i i don't listen every day but i love the roll-ups and i love you know so much of your work um but i couldn't have articulated your battle like you just did and when you when you you know like this is the thing i've been working on for 18 months this is kind of where i'm at you're pretty successful it's pretty impressive um i i have the same kind of like you know i worked on client or consistency client diversity that it was a successful um a successful initiative you know the current initiative is the entity size debate like that for me i i hope it i hope it doesn't take a long time like it does get exhausting like being the person who's beating the drum about one thing that you know needs to get done um and then i would say the next initiative for uh layer zero is um the execution layer diversity and um you know it's interesting i i believe each researchers are ready to do execution layer diversity now but i don't believe we can successfully fight on all of those fronts at once and so um the sooner we get the entity size thing worked out the next monday i'm gonna say all right guys let's do uh execution layer diversity and it you know i i'm not sure how many people could articulate those initiatives that that i know the same way that i don't know how many people could articulate the initiatives that that you're working on but they're there like they're really real things right and as we go into the bear market like it does present us with an opportunity to reflect on like all right what are the next big problems that we have to tackle because more or less the crypto industry uh and every single chain and especially ethereum being the biggest chain with the most to lose has to like turn in face and like all right what's the next big problem what's the next big problem what's the next big big big problem and then ultimately it's going to be like that for like years and it has been like that for years ever since genesis uh slowly those problems get like longer in time and not not as big of a deal but like we're still not anywhere close to the end of this whole thing uh and so but as we're going into the bear market and like a lot of the energy has evaporated out of the alternative layer one space uh mainly because the tokens are down bad uh like it does actually give a moment to like look more internally rather than externally i think like looking externally is for bull markets looking internally is for bear markets yeah and so like i do think that this is a moment to like self turn turn and uh turn away from the external world and more and towards addressing the problems for the internal world so i do take the point that like now is definitely the time for like bankless to start beating the drum about decentralization in a different direction so i do definitely do take that point i i do so i have to acknowledge um i took a long position on ether because i'm so it's how press did it to me so maybe i should blame you um dude during that podcast i opened up my gemini app and i just like 2x my daily my daily buy price can i tell you um i was i was on a multi-day travel listening to hal press i stopped at a gas station turned on my mobile hotspot went to defy saver and leveraged long because and now i you know probably not smart fizz but it was just so compelling like i i like how do you how do you hear that and not just um want to risk your position but um oh what i was gonna say i took a an eth eth chain that we shall not name short position so uh not in dollar terms but like put ethan compound barrio the asset that shall not be named uh sold the asset for eth and then put more ether compounds so i'm like longing the ratio like capital efficient way to uh to trade the ratio uh and then but also not be exposed to like macro markets which is a nice thing to not be exposed to at the moment yeah my uh this is where again uh you know i i normalize being normal i'm not an i'm not great with economics so i i don't allow myself to attempt those uh those arbitrages but i'm i'm always impressed oh i just i just listen to other people and like well he's smart and bullish so i will follow that are you familiar with this uh the logari um he has a name for this because it's on his tokenomics explained um it's the logari double something um but it's it's so i want you to look it up and i'm sure you'll you know commenters will will point it out because it's it's really interesting but i'm like i could i could never pull that off like i i don't even know what buttons to click to make that happen but i don't know um you know you'll have to check that out though it's it's really impressive um one of the things i was trying to get to a minute ago and i got it i told my my own self no i did it i did it oh i i think that we're likely to view oh i i uh hell pressed it i blame hal for everything uh i think we're likely to view what we consider to be the the incoming bear market um as as an l1 cleansing i would i would kind of like to think of it as a big l1 cleansing and i there's going to be i call it the bear market wash cycle well you know there's going to be something new after this and i don't know what it's going to be um but we we always have after these uh uh manias you know we haven't we have an l1 mania we had an ico mania we had an nft mania there's going to be another mania and i'm just curious like after we move past l1's after we're proof of stake i'm excited to just see the next mania unfold it'll be fun yeah uh it always happens uh i remember going through the bear market of 2018 to 2020 thinking like oh everyone talks about how crypto goes in cycles uh and so like sweet there will just be another cycle and then i thought well if everyone's saying that there's another cycle isn't that like the crowded trade like is if that's the consensus bet i thought markets do the things that people don't expect them to do and everyone thinks that another cycle's coming uh so maybe it's another cycle's not coming and then another cycle totally came uh and now i'm on the like now that we're one more cycle beyond that i'm like oh uh you know there's how big is the crypto world like it's still only like one percent of like global population that are in like the crypto world and so like we could have like three more cycles for as far as i can tell uh and so like it could actually just keep on playing out consensus over consensus until like the cycles do actually disappear and it's just like up only but modestly for a very long time i i love the predictability of these cycles like even my wife who has zero interest in an ether she's like uh you know i've said you know hey we're going to tighten up a little bit because there's a bear coming and it could it's going to be a few years it's no big deal um and you know her response is well so it's going to go back up just tell me how long it's going to be and i'm like well that's the part i don't know but i love that well the press says yeah i god i hope that dude's right because i i've never been uh so he's anyway we could talk about how press um just such high signal uh with such common sense like uh again i listen to a lot of you know investors speak and it just doesn't resonate with me but so much of what he said especially with the concept of of trying to uh of supply trying to suppress the price rather than push it up i'm like damn that that really that's right right right uh you said you you mentioned your your wife uh did your wife feel like she shares you with ethereum no my wife feels like ethereum owns me and she gets to borrow me for she will say uh how much do i even listen for meals she's like you you come out for meals um so it is it's it's a balance that i really need to work on i think it's a balance like balancing a crypto in all of our lives is like something i think everyone resonates with so you're not alone in that fight brother it's hilarious because i'm always like but honey i'm working on this thing right now it's a big deal to me it's really important i'm you know um so it was just the clr uh grants round i'm like you know this grants round is going to be over in three days and then i'll be back and she's like do you hear yourself and i'm like i'll be back in three days she's like you said that two weeks ago and you said it three weeks before that and you're still gone and i'm like ah um so yeah it it it is maybe one of my one of my biggest weaknesses uh something i would love to get right yeah no i fight the same fight uh it's just like the ethereum is so rich there's so much there's so many interesting people to talk about to talk about so many interesting things with so no i'm pretty i'm pretty sure every single person i've had on this podcast is probably like oh yeah that sounds about right um the other the other person sorry yeah the other personal question i have is uh where did superfits come from uh um it's it's not all that exciting uh i have this buddy um so this guy called corey was sodapop fizz on aol instant messenger back in like 1995 um and then a buddy of mine bendorf um set up a server called uh fizz as a short because you know he was like hey i need a name uh and then i used that server very often and when i was fishing for you know i needed i there was i've cycled through thousands probably a hundred usernames uh and that was just the flavor of the day i didn't know that super fizz would like catch on um i it's it's so funny like i can still log into my old like um other community accounts and they're fun but super fizz is is my committed personality now do does the rocketpool slash eat finance community know your actual name uh you know it's not a secret but i because this is what i do like i am fizz more than i am my irl person the alternative yeah yeah um so in this weird way i have become more comfortable being fizz than hearing my real name spoken and i know that's odd um you know there was a transition period but i i'm more likely to respond to being called fizz than my my real name interesting have you ever accidentally like in real life introduce yourself hey i'm i'm super fizz no we don't real life um it's the correct answer yeah we we're uh we're very still very coveted careful uh even though uh you know it is what it is um so uh we i i haven't met a lot of new people in real life uh in a while so i'm really looking for we have a three-year-old who isn't vaccinated yet uh and so when he gets vaccinated i look forward to getting out in the world again yeah and i'll see you at devcon maybe tbd uh one last question did not go over well [Laughter] fair enough uh here's a here's a question which i've kind of rephrased from uh rich had g richard d um what's your favorite thing to do with thirteen thousand dollars the stoner can't stress and it's so funny like um you know i i i think of myself as an amalgam or maybe like um an archetype of an ethereum community member and i think that ethereum community members should play with a protocol like we should play and uh he's referencing uh stoner cats uh and there's a jonathan man song a day man song about um the stoner cats debacle where um you know i was just screwing around and i wanted a stoner cat so i went to metamask and just set the gas to some crazy number um and i i burned five five ga five each in gas uh on a failed transaction for a stoner cat which if you look not even was it like two weeks ago we had that uh that land sale uh yeah and people paid yeah yeah people paid like tens of each for gas for that and it was nothing but we just we weren't there yet it wasn't normal yet and you'd never did you end up getting refunded they uh give give money back they did uh and i actually um so there are two sides to that uh jonathan mann's song um i so i guess i ended up with that song and then etha count bought that song e-t-h-a-c-t bought that song for me for 5.8 to eat and he holds it now and then i got a refund from stoner cats but i i didn't feel comfortable like getting a double rebate so i donated that to hodlercon um which is you know the trip to hawaii as their seed money so i i again hodlercon the trip to hawaii i i'm so sad that i can't go to that i think it's going to be awesome uh you can't go vaccinations can't fly uh our sun can't fly and so uh you know we we stick together and um we'll have another trip in two years well you'll just have to recruit someone to carry around an ipad so you can come on come around on the ipad i know right it's um you know i think that that people don't know i don't always manifest this in my online interactions but my family is my priority and and i love that i've chosen that i'm always going to put my family above ethereum um and other ethereans they think they're first in my life and i love them like they're my family they're my online family but at the end of the day um my family is is my priority and i i love that i love my family relationship my family dynamic um and you guys are just my second well you're the most dad looking guest i've had on this show so it's very very wait is that a compliment i don't know what that was thanks i don't know if it's a compliment or it's on either it's like this is you look like a dad awesome super fizz any last uh topics you want to talk to touch on before we wrap this up i i love syncing up with you um i i love what you're doing with bankless uh i love you know i our community is so valuable um i don't it's not it's not the number it has nothing to do with the number but the ethereum community is so rich and vibrant and a lot of that is due to what bankless does um and so uh i love you guys for that so thanks for um thanks for your contributions oh thanks my man uh i like to say it's like uh all bankless is doing is reverberating ethereum values louder to the rest of the world uh so it's not like we invented anything new um i mean we invented the bankless brand and made some good podcasts and some good articles but basically it's just a tool for amplifying ethereum values uh and so at the end of the day it's all layer zero yeah do you know the neat thing is there's no other bankless you know like um every time someone says anytime someone's critical of bankless i'm like uh could you do that why don't you do that we need more of that why don't you do that i i will subscribe if you do that and they get quiet really quickly because the energy and skill that you put into this is so unparalleled um that you know
