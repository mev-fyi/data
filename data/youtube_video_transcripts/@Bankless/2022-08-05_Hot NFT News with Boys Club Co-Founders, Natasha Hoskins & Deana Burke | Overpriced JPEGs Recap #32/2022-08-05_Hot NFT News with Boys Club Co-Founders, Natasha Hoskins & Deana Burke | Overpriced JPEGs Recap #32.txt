who like have a day job and then basically full-time like d-gen and build your crypto business on the side maybe like tell folks a little bit about boys club just for anybody who doesn't know girlfriend okay great boys club is a social dow um we are building a whole world of things in web3 with um centering women and non-binary individuals voices and we have a media empire we have a dao with lots of different guilds going on and building products launching nfts doing all sorts of stuff um so that's what dina and i do by night and then we both have day jobs during the day so it's a lot of fun and it's it's pretty busy you may also know us from our parties so boys club throws pretty pretty epic parties epic parties that's pretty that's pretty core to it that's where we started um and and uh yeah that's sort of the funnest part of of what we do i work in crypto during the day as well so i'm dejen by night indeed by day so there's certain topics that are that are off limits to us because they will be skirting some topics some some recent hacks that may have occurred um yeah boys club events are are fantastic that's where i first met you both and and just such a like wonderful attention to detail from from your brand and from boys club like the drinks like the the cocktails that the party will have like really fun names and there's always like metallic like temporary tattoos to be applied to the body just like really really fun stuff so i'm a big fan of that sense um well the nft market i mean hey the the crypto market seems to continue to hold strong and uh and nfts in general down a little bit but uh but nothing crazy here to report uh blue chips still making big moves we'll we'll get right into the crypto punx tiffany's situation but is there anything in particular y'all have been tracking this week in the market i thought there was a lot of fun this week with i mean i'm not going to talk about the hacks but there was a lot of events um there wasn't just one isolated incident and it felt like a very it felt like a turbulent week to me um from us i guess a security perspective um and then that sort of that seeps into news and interesting ways i know we're gonna talk about that in a bit but um yeah it felt it felt pretty turbulent but that sort of juxtaposed with some of these news stories that we're gonna be talking about today like there's also a ton of optimism and i think a ton of movement um i i feel like i have this very extreme point of view on it where like when the this crash period like sort of first happened i was just like waiting for everything to go to zero and every week that things just like clearly don't go to zero i'm like blessing lisa bro i'm like things are okay i'm like okay apparently we're all just like still here and these these blue chip you know nfts are relatively holding their value and like i guess we're all kicking like we've just you know this is this is here to stay so i'm i'm excited i made this bet um but but certainly the hacks i think uh seep into people's minds there are some funny memes about like not that we want to make light of it but of like the phantom wallet hack i saw somebody being like you know running doing a joke video where he was like running over to like check his solana wallet and you know it's still there and it's like he's like twelve dollars of soul and it was like it was like every like phantom user right now oh no okay still there was like 12 20. like three years i was like that's kind of me like i have a phantom wallet but i don't have enough in there to to really be care be particularly perturbed yeah so again not trying to make light of people who really did totally feel the losses here but it's kind of funny um okay let's talk about this punks tiffany's collaboration do you want me to give the overview here natasha dina do one of you want to walk us through what what the announcement was you go for it i definitely have a we have a lot of hot takes but yeah you just you tell us the world of it okay so uh on july 31st i guess is when tiffany first made this announcement they're saying that the the future is here and it's called nf tiff and they said it was going to be 30 questionable name just going to start out i don't know i do not like i don't love the name but we keep going they're trying to be cute yeah i mean nf tiff what's your any any specifics on why you hate it or it's just like a it's just like so kitsch like what are we doing and like tiffany's like a premium brand you want to feel like you have like a premium experience when you're buying something from tiffany's and like to have a play a pun is not it for me yeah you've persuaded me i totally agree i hadn't really paid attention to that um but you are like again boards clubs branding is fantastic and uh you both are very good at branding so they should be yeah i i think they're actually thinking right like a little a little bit of like an elevated approach to sort of how the whole thing was packed i mean the the videos look great and stuff but um yeah i think the name nf tiff is the wrong one yeah cringy um well and then that same day they announced they're doing they clearly announced they're going to get into nfts in some capacity though it's worth mentioning that tiffany's has has been involved before they did a tom sox tom sacks rocket at one point so they had partnered with tom sachs to do his rocket piece so this is not their very first four right into this but they then announced okay we're taking nfts to the next level and that they're they're for crypto punk holders exclusively they're offering this option for you to get your punk on a pendant um and there's only gonna be 250 of these so it's like a first come first serve thing uh it's actually launching tomorrow we're recording this on thursday it'll launch this crypto punk tiffany collaboration will launch on friday so when this airs um 250 of them uh 30 eth and what was so interesting to me about this and then i want to get your thoughts on it was um it shortly after this yuga labs or crypto punks i should say but you know that's sort of you labs now put out the statement saying this is not like a formal partnership yeah so while hugo is not directly involved in the collaboration between tiffany and co it's a great example of the types of things punk holders will be able to do with the ip licensing agreement which we intend to release on on august 15th so when you labs purchased crypto punks back in february i guess or whatever it was march um they had said we're going to give the the rights to the crypto punk holders just like board holders have um and but they haven't actually rolled out what those that license is going to look like they're saying they're going to roll it out for us on august 15th and um it almost feels like this tiffany's announcement was like a forcing function for them to kind of speak out a little bit more on that i'm not sure but i found that interesting that this wasn't actually a a direct partnership it almost feels like something tiffany sort of did off on their own i don't know thoughts on the whole thing i mean i feel like it's a nice way to bring to life what it means to own your ip of your nft like where you can be like oh i don't have to get like crypto punks doesn't have to be directly involved for me to get this pendant or make this thing with my my nft my crypto punk so i feel like it's a nice demonstration of how that can look and i know people have done that with different stuff with board apes but um so for me i was like oh this is like really clicking in a way that um i think is good for like consumers and people in the space to understand what it means like how powerful it can be to own that ip um so that's cool i i don't know that i would buy one but you know experimentation is good i don't know do you know what do you think yeah i'm sort of like look it's not for me like i don't have a punk but also i wouldn't like that like that sort of truly like it doesn't speak to me on a pro like a product level like i don't think the jewelry with the punk and like having that around my like it's it's not for me but i do think it's smart and if you were wearing that pendant i would be like what has happened can you imagine something horribly wrong um but yeah so for for many reasons just like not for me but um not a not um a punk holder and so maybe great for them um but yeah i think like natasha's saying like i think it signals like some really interesting composability and i think that that's a smart play it's a good it's an interesting expression for how brands can play um i think that like in execution um i don't know i would have liked to see tiffany like it doesn't feel like the brand alignment between um punks and tiffany's and like demographics and audiences feels a little bit mismatched to me but maybe they were just going for like blue chip blue which is the best of the best um but yeah i think tiffany's probably is also like a lot of the newly minted millionaires in crypto true like maybe proposing to somebody in the next decade or something own a punk and uh let's start immersing them into our brand so i i think it's kind of an interesting play from that standpoint and probably not the stupidest one yeah i also think like tiffany's has has made a conservative concerted effort the last few years to try to rebrand something a little cooler like they did this whole thing with beyonce and jay-z and everybody was like what like that's sort of interesting and so i think that that's probably what they're trying to do but to me it's such a classic upper east side lady jewelry brand that it's it is fun like this combo is really funny um but i appreciate them trying to like um attract a new audience with something like this totally and they'll sell i'm sure they'll sell out and i'm sure they'll make a ton of money yeah so here's a question we were i was taking bets with some folks yesterday how quickly do you think they'll sell out i think in the day yeah so some people were saying it'll take a day like eight hours i was like i'm with you natasha i was like 20 minutes like there's only 250 of them yeah you know like supplies yeah if it was a you know 10 000 collection i would be much more skeptical but it's like you know 250 i definitely think you'll get bites on that i sort of love 250. that makes me like it more like how limited yeah and how expensive it is i'm i'm about a premium product like that but um so and it's good for them like yeah to sell out immediately is going to be positive for this yeah and again positive positive news i just want to give a quick shout out to balanciaga or prada if they're listening just come to boys club we'll we'll help you out we'll do this for you we'll do a deal with you main characters and daddy holders i get like the little fanny pack valencia fanny pack that says boys can you imagine i would die yeah so i love the i love the play generally to your point about the the the feel and and the brand of tiffany's i'll be curious to see and i don't think they've released anything about this about like almost what the i guess it's not really a mint experience but they have the mint pass oh see i don't know i don't know all the details but it's all happening tomorrow because i feel like there's something very deep in tiffany's brand that's about like the unboxing and the tiffany box and it's blue and like and if they did something cool or if they like clearly really made a play around that component of this that would feel like a really interesting way to like incorporate kind of the tiffany brand to it i don't know if they if they they're thinking along those lines but i think it could be funny or it could be interesting and then the funny thing i was going to say again in like funny tweet land that i've seen somebody was like you know you're like who you know your significant other brings you a tiffany's box and it's a crypto punk or like you know like you open it up and inside is a crystal funk all the women out there who are about to be like very disappointed um okay i have one more hot take that i i want to give on this topic i actually really like this i have to say i think it's great cool move on both their parts i think it's an interesting play for tiffany's to to your point natasha kind of modernize i think the pendants look kind of cool like i i kind of i think i'm totally with you the 200 you have a five feels right i don't have a punk okay i was like you should buy one i will not be buying one um i probably wouldn't that also would not be where i'd want to spend 30 but i think it's cool and i think it's interesting for for punks because i think and this will get me to my hot take punks are trying to be the fine art like luxury brand of nft so yeah their holder base is like you know like this crypto bro you know maybe ultra nerdy a lot of them um but but they're also they are kind of like the original fine art piece of this world and i think with noah davies being on board as a brand ambassador like that all makes sense so i think this cloud makes sense where i start to get skeptical is actually in giving punk's holders rights over the product and i think if you're a premium brand why'd that say for you doing that so much money at the the gucci acorn story maybe we could talk about that because i think there's a there's a tie-in um but i think like so do you want me to tease it or do you want it no geek do you care do it all right gucci announced that they're accepting a point that's basically it so you can buy your gucci bag with acorn and i think the two stories like it's an interesting trend that like the amount of money that those premium luxury brands invest in their brand it's staggering right to create the like the the aura around what gucci is the amount of money is just like beyond that they would put that on the line for board ape um is is wild to me and i think that like it's similar with the the punk story because it's like punks like okay so there was i don't know if you guys saw it forever 21 um board ape uh line did you guys see this no i missed this okay no good so uh a couple weeks ago there's a street that came out that was like um there was like shirts uh board apes holders had licensed the brand to forever 21 and i think i want to say like aeropostale like there was like old navy a couple others and so there was these shirts online where it said like board ape whatever yacht club like the independent holder the independent holder yeah and so for me it's sort of similar where it's like man you give everyone the power like board ape also has done a lot to like create this brand and that they're willing for it to be like the dilution that could come when anyone can sell to whomever like that can happen really quick and can take the whole thing down like like it just needs to go in like the wrong place like a couple times and you're like oh that's like there's just i guess what my point is like the protection around the brand like whether it's gucci or whether it's board ape like there's a lot of thoughtfulness that goes into it and a lot of in money and like resources that are invested in that and so when you let it loose um i just think it's a it's a huge risk i obviously see like the upside of it and like in this web 3 world like everything's decentralized and we all own but like for these brand first projects like it's really tricky something that we think a lot about it at boys club as well yeah well also like you're diluting the brand across for all holders for all like as a holder i'm like oh like that's representative of the value like the value that i have and what's in my wallet it's gonna be fluctuate depending on how the collective community is the decisions that they're making around their own independent ip and and maybe that's the argument for why they'll stay protected because these individual holders have an incentive to like uphold the brand as well but like it just takes one nihilist or one person with a radically different view of of what the brand should be like you know i was joking about this with somebody but i'm like like it's that one crypto punks toilet deal and the one crypto punk that's now like starring in a porno for this like to really feel weird and to really like start to hurt this premium feel and and i i i i like the cco thing i like the rights to holders thing i think there are brands for which that's a real fit i i just happen to think that with crypto punks and and what this tiffany's thing is is indicative of is what they're what feels like their brand is and i i it just feels like giving rights to holders is a little bit antithetical to that in my opinion and it would be better served by having like a really protective sort of visionary making partnerships with with brands like like tiffany's and having white glove service for the holders so like noah's there to service all three thousand five thousand whatever holders of crypto punks at any point they can come talk to noah give their input whatever so they can be very involved in the brand's future without one renegade punk holder being able to kind of go and and do some things that are really quote-unquote off-brand i think that um the counterpoint to that like playing devil's advocate they would say like oh like i saw this when i was looking at the forever 21 thing um people were like oh well it's for all those people are now walking around with board billboards on like all like all of those shirts are distributing the brand board ape makes sense to me boarding this whole thing is renegade middle finger if board apes on a toilet it doesn't hurt boarding a branch their whole thing is like a bathroom you know pixel board where you can draw your penises like that's the thing is to me it should be a case-by-case basis like i'm very supportive of these things for certain brands and i think board ape it that model totally works there i just don't think that means the model works everywhere yeah and um i mean you should probably end up eating these words but were you surprised by the crypto punks ip announcement or were you expecting that because of board apes well it happened so fast it happened during um because they announced it when they first purchased punks and me bits and it was during south by southwest so like there was a lot going on and it feels like they announced the purchase and they they pretty quickly followed it up with the the rights so like i didn't have time to kind of process all of that i don't think at the time though i had as strong of an opinion you know it's amazing how time passes in this space like even whatever five months it's been since then i feel like i've developed more opinions about the space and and just observing it more so i think at the time i was probably a little bit more like oh you could go either way with this i could make the ar you know what i mean and i feel a little bit stronger about it now because i feel a little bit just more clear on um what i think about how these things should go uh again i'll probably be wrong and punks will they'll be a toilet punk and the price will skyrocket by like when elon musk will buy it and the pikes will pump by like you know 100 because nothing makes sense in this world but personally this is my thought um i want to talk about music world two really really interesting things i want to highlight and one that we maybe dive into a little bit more so the first is muse is releasing an nft album um essentially they're releasing an nft that will the artwork is gonna be like a sleeve of a vinyl record for example it's gonna be like the album cover art but this nft will also unlock their whole album so you can download a flac file right like a high audio value file of the album so there's nfd there's gonna be a thousand of them i think the nfc will get you this album we'll talk more about that but the thing i want to highlight here that's really interesting about this is the governing body for like the uk charts recently made a change in which um nft albums like this will actually the sales will count towards the charts so these thousand albums that will get sold will count towards um muse's chart ranking um that feels like a big deal to me we'll talk about more but i'll add the second music announcement and we can talk about them maybe together mtv has announced a metaverse performance category as part of the mtv awards i guess and so there's going to now be a category where you can win for your metaverse performance both of these strike me at similar like sort of incentivizing a web3 behavior in a really big way in the mainstream would love to get your thoughts on it yeah they feel both feel significant to like signaling from the mainstream about wanting to maybe it's like feeling it out and wanting to see what the response is or maybe it's actually like moves in the direction of making this more part of the music industry as a whole and not just like a niche part of music um the mtv mtv one is interesting to me i would have loved i saw some of the people that they had like i think it was like ariana grande and bts and like those were the people who were who were like on the list of nominees i guess is the word i'm looking for and i'm like cool i would have loved to have some like some undiscovered in the mainstream like like music and ft people who are actually like this is what they do like if you're gonna have a category like this like do a little bit of you know leg work and bring some of those people in even as nominees is my take i so i think they were just doing it for i think was a hype cycle because i looked at some of the comments on twitter around what's going on in this mtv thing and they basically just started a battle royale between bts fans and black pink fans like it was basically just like how do we pit these two kpop crazy fandoms against one another like and this is and so you like i was looking on twitter and i was like okay it's really this is like that's what it is that's what this is about i mean maybe not that's what this is about that's what it's turned into and so like i can see um i i'm sure mtv is clawing for relevancy wherever they can find it and like the this is brutal this is a way like i mean i'm just yeah the shots were fired but i stand by that it's true about it so but i do think it's i think it's an interesting signal i think it's an interesting step whether they're doing it for hype or not like it still is a bitty bit pretty big moment in i think in the music like nft metaverse landscape to have some validation there so like i'll take it i think it's great and i'll take it but like sort of poking like looking under the hood of it it's like okay this might have been for like uh for some other reasons yeah yeah when i i said it was the mtv it's the vmas i don't know i think i got the award wrong that this is for is this something that we sense is like an in perpetuity now thing because to me then while this may have the the immediate result of this is like the skeuomorphic thing where it's like we're not gonna take a metaverse native like artists we're just gonna like be like i don't know these people performed digitally at one point like let's give it to them but in the long term i think what it'll ultimately turn into is like genuine it will encourage genuine innovation and excitement around i think so too like virtual world performances if it does stick around which i think is is the plan um the other thing i want to say i did an interview today with uh hermann narula it'll come out probably next week um who is the founder of improbable which is the the the tech company powering the other side metaverse and like holy hell this dude is so impressive and what he's building is so cool and the way he thinks about the metaverse is really cool like his whole emphasis is not on gaming like he's like we already have three day game like 3d characters running around in games and like being able to talk to other people like that's actually not a new thing and yeah okay you know cool if we can make it interoperable he had some funny lines about like taking your like you know grand theft auto gun and like bringing that to harry potter world and how we're a long ways away from that for like very good reasons you know like he's like the school can't handle that or whatever he was joking about it but um but he was like it should be more about extending real world experiences in really interesting ways like we had these other worlds all the time like he was sports is like another world in many ways like we care about what happens on these sports fields like it doesn't really matter this isn't like real life in any sort of like life or death way but we care about it and so that's why their technology has really been centered around how can i bring 4 500 people together in a virtual experience and make it feel really real and and you can hear that person from across the other side world shouting something and they did a concert last year with alexa i think as a korean pop star and and it was like apparently a really cool experience the fans could go like jump up on alexa and alexa could like you know throw them off in the virtual world but they could actually be talking to each other and like how do we just extend these exciting like sports and like celebrity experiences that create like a shared culture and like bring us together on that um so it got me thinking about the metaverse in sort of a new way and i think it's part of why this mtv metaphor metaverse performance category gets me excited is because i i see some really interesting progress happening on that side where yeah um you know he just kind of opened my eyes to like oh this is gonna be kind of sick um and when vr gets all that much better i think it'll just expand the whole experience okay i want to go deeper on this this muse album release in the news here and i i think you guys recently had cooper turley on the pod and are uh newly red pulled into music nft world so i would really like to hear your take on it because i'm still wrapping my head around it if i'm being totally honest great great so so i'll just say i'll give a little more details on the muse album release they are launching to a platform called serenade um which is a polygon based platform and serenade is is claiming and i i will say like myself and and people i work with reached out kind of extensively to serenade to try and get on a call with them before we did this podcast and uh we kind of got the run around so serenade i want to talk to you i want to understand this better so i'm giving proper information to the people but as it is i just have to work off of what came out in press releases but essentially they've they're claiming they've pioneered this like digital pressing concept um which is a way to like create this nft music file in a way that's highly compatible with the way that uk charts already like count album sales and and so they they very much geared this digital pressing product towards this announcement around okay now these nfts can count as album sales um and and so i think that concept is very interesting but i don't understand it on a technologically deep enough level to to feel like i really understand if this is something interesting and new or if it's not at all you know and if it's basically just they're trying to pr package this is something really cool um but but nevertheless i think this is an exciting kind of revelation just that it it'll take us back to the era of like you bought a cd because you wanted to show off your cd again a little bit as a collectible or like taylor swift was still selling cds until like 2015 because her fans were so rabid they were like we want to support her to the max and she's telling us to buy her cd at target so i'm going to target at midnight to buy her cd even though i really don't need to anymore because we all listen on spotify and i you know a resurgence of that is um i think very cool and very fun but give me your like thoughts on this and then and then kind of why you're excited now about music nfts um well i mean something that cooper had said that has really stuck with me is that basically like having owning a music nft for an artist that you really like or like an artist that you discovered like in high school there was always that thing where and like in college and stuff like that where someone would get big like this is a terrible example but like the lumineers you know there was always that dude who was like well i was listening to them when nobody would like you know like that guy or i'm sure i did it with like i don't know image and heap or some something you know and um and like you didn't have something to prove that that was true that like you did listen to them before they were big or i would have loved a track record of like oh i did i actually wasn't that early like i thought i was so on the cutting edge and like actually i was not um and like music nfts for many reasons are amazing but one of the things that stuck with me was like you have that representation in your wallet if you if you purchase one of an artist music nft to prove that you've supported them from the beginning that you've been with them from the start um and have that like level of fandom with with an artist so that was something that has like stuck with me and um and like there's so much opportunity for the artist in in what's possible now with like um with this technology but from the consumer i was like oh that's sort of interesting and something that yeah yeah i thought a lot about so so i actually loved our conversation with cooper and he yeah just clearly is so passionate about it and like really knows the stuff inside and out and so that was just like fun on its own but one thing i sort of woke up the next day thinking about was that so this use case around sort of collecting and collectors um is is really sort of where the conversation is centered in music nfts where you're sort of you're buying the asset and that's like a sort of badge of honor in many ways where like and using the proxy of like records or cds or whatever it was um i woke up the next morning being like man i don't know if the total addressable market for the use case or for the behavior of collectors and collecting music is as big as like i'm just like a listener i just like listen i'm not a collector but i'm a listener and i think i'd fall under that category i'm not a collector but i'm i'm a listener and i wonder like how yeah i'm just like wondering about the tam of music and if she's with the use case of collecting i think it's totally legitimate but like that's like the one thing i sort of can't unlock is that is the buyer side of it yep i have a thought on this and and i will say this is actually sort of i'm about to argue for the addressable market here but with a caveat but i've also been the person on the other side of this debate like i could argue both sides of it is i guess what i'm saying uh but when i think about you know i in high school with was the opposite of that person i was like and i've never been like on the cutting edge of music but in high school at least privately like a significant part of my self-identity was that like i basically exclusively listened to like crap classic rock like 60s 70s like rock bands you know and that was like my private like rebellion against my peers who were like listening to whatever they thought was cool and i'm like oh like i'm so misunderstood like but like better because i listen to like classic rock right like and i think i would have been interested in socially signaling that had there been a way to socially signal that you know other than you know whatever talking about it i guess but you know and and so to me it's a question of will human will there be a way to show off your wallet like we all show off our social media profiles right super commonplace and normalized in the behavior of like every day yeah and um you know one metric of that and i'd be curious your thoughts on this like do you think we'll have a point where dating apps it's like here's a link to my instagram and then here's a link to my like wallet you know and it'll include all the receipts from the coffee shop that i go every morning and you know like it'll be just give you this really interesting picture of like basically where i spend my money which will probably have terrible ramifications for society mental health but it also is kind of interesting as a but great for music potential future oh geez yeah i mean i could legacy that i could totally see i could see that definitely someone is building right now that um application where where there's just like this seamless display of everything that we're owning digitally right like it's not it's not and the person who figures out how to do that cross category whether it's music or fashion or whatever is gonna win maybe that's instagram yeah um but i think that that's definitely happening that's definitely what people are thinking of um yeah i think i think regardless i think this new story is again it's a really interesting industry signal that i feel like is really promising now i saw in the in the muse press release that they're going to press a thousand copies that will make no impact on the charts on there even best cases here's a question here's what i wanted to ask their team and that i have no clarity on secondary sales right like if you secondary sell this does that then go towards charts and then that that's interesting that's interesting um but yes of course but i don't know and i can't i can't find it in the in the literature and they're uh giving me the run around in terms of talking to me so um so we'll see i'm totally with you this in this in this particular case it doesn't mean anything but again looking ahead in the next couple of years it's definitely an uh just an additional incentive for artists to put out nfts without putting and the music industry will love it because there's no overhead cost on the printing so like if that if this works the margins are great yeah you can guarantee that man that's gonna get that's gonna get used yep metamask is the leading web3 wallet to get you access to everything you need in web3 if you're just getting started

as we sort of talk here about the metaverse i want to talk about other moves happening in metaverse world i want to talk about treeverse uh but but maybe where i'll start is there was this vitalik tweet recently i think it was like maybe a sub tweet like he was tweeting under something and he basically he was talking about meta as in the company and he was like my critique is deeper than metaverse wikipedia will beat metaverse encyclopedia britannica meaning he's talking about decentralized metaverses like basically decentralized metaverse will beat a centralized metaverse it's that we don't really know the definition of the metaverse yet it's far too early to know what people actually want so anything facebook creates now will misfire so i'm no i'm no facebook i'm not like a facebook bull here but i actually don't know if i agree with this critique and i wanted to know if you guys had any initial reactions to this fatalic tweet who i love to the ends of the earth so i'm not criticizing him either i think he's it's tough go ahead i i think what he's saying is like the first like if you're too early the first person's gonna mess it up because you're gonna design it wrong and you don't understand what user needs are and like that's ultimately like what he's what he's sort of alluding to right like that i think i could see that right like i can i can i can definitely see that but i do think that there is like a and i'm not a facebook maxi but i do think that there's obviously like an incredible network effect that can come from a product that's launched out of that company um that would maybe force all of our hands to like take their version of the metaverse um as as gospel so like i think that there's there's definitely like i i get it but i don't know it may be underestimating the like the power of that reach of facebook and instagram and all the related channels and properties i i think my feeling on it is like i i don't think the the facebook metaverse is going to win and and i feel stronger on that having talked to herman narula but but i'm also in my own bubble right of like decentralized maxis in a way that like the rest of the world very much is not but but the the part of this tweet that i think i resonates for me is i do in general think that these decentralized metaverses that are really many ways co-creating the metaverse with their users there's like a really obvious reason to argue for that and to support that i think probably fundamentally that's what vitalik is getting at so like that's lovely on the other hand i think back to the the quote that may or may not be real but of ford's saying if i'd asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses and i think there's a very real dynamic of like people on the cutting edge building things that people don't know they want yet and that being the thing and that's what we're doing in web3 like so many of the builders in web 3 are building things that the rest of the world is not telling us they want in fact they're yelling quite loudly that they hate us but what we kind of know over time they'll become adopters so i just felt like that it's not necessarily true that just because we don't know what users want yet you can't build something that's really successful i mean i think my take was like from when i think about meta they are built they have built their entire world off advertisers like that's their that's the king of meta and what i love like what i see in web 3 and what i think what we all think the opportunity is is that like profitability and ownership like user ownership can work hand in hand and like if those things can work hand in hand like how powerful is the future going to be like if incentives are aligned and everybody's winning because these things are living together and and your best interest as an owner in this thing is that it's as profitable and as successful as it can be i think that's the bet that we all collectively are making on web 3 being the future but that is still very much being designed for and like not actually real yet like there's some use cases of that but like it's not real across the board and my feeling is if we win at that meta will probably not win because advertisers will lose in that scenario and if we don't win at that then meadow will definitely win because they're designing for like the world that we're already living in but with some different like names to it basically so it's a really good point i'm one i'm i'm like i don't know that that's what this tweet is about but as i was thinking about like what do i actually think about meta's approach i'm like oh if they win we probably all lose like in the way the vision of always definitely so i think that's a that's a really good point to kind of center it on the advertiser model and i actually talked about that with herman today a little bit and he was pretty bullish on the idea that like we wouldn't need advertisers in the same way which we shouldn't right fundamentally you can sell nfts now like right like that's at the center of the metaverse you're not required to bring on advertisers as your funding sources actually have a hot take on this at all in the same way so we're like we're sort of in voice club we're designing what like our next nft moment is and we're thinking about like decentralized media we're thinking about what web 3 native media is and how it's defined and i think to your point where it's like we don't need advertisers we can buy nfts yes totally true and i think that that's there's we've obviously in this past bull run have seen a ton of power in that and just in the power and rise of digital assets generally i do think that expecting putting the burden of like paying for access paying for content paying for experiences online putting that burden on the consumer to pay for um i think i think is i think we're overestimating what people will be willing to pay for in an in an enviro in a web 2 environment like when for the last five ten years we've all had the entire internet that at the tip of our fingers basically for free and so i think like when we start gating things we're going to learn really quickly like that that that friction um will mean less less people involved and like less spotify verse yeah and so i like like as and as we're planning sort of our next nft thing like that's coming up for us because it's like we're thinking about sort of content and getting content and it's like man is there like is gating content or gaining an experience or gaining an access to something like by making consumers pay for it whereas previously advertisers would have foot the bill is that like innovation i don't know i think it i think it's i think that's a great point and it's going to be a blend right like you know when i was younger i had less disposable income and i couldn't pay for paywalls good news content and i got the free stuff that was fine and now i probably pay for like 10 sub stackers right because i really value what they're having to say and i'm in a fortunate enough position to be able to pay the five bucks or eight dollars a month or whatever to to get their content specifically and so i think the key is really is the optionality and i think you're right like we absolutely need to have a world where there's like awesome free content that's then therefore subsidized by advertisers um but i also think the advertiser like only model which has sort of been the model for so long also wasn't working well um and so there is an innovation there and and um that's like wonderful but i think natasha you were saying that the thing you were kind of centering on the uh on if you know if it's day centers on the advertisers that's when we're screwed and i think one reason i'm i'm optimistic for the metaverse is like the network effects that currently exist in these social media platforms like make it very hard to change user behavior like i love what lens protocol is doing and the and the the goal for decentralized social media and in theory you should see flocks of people leaving traditional social media for that so for for web3 social media because they can get more value out of it but that value is going to have to be a lot to really get people to change consumer behavior from what they're currently doing whereas the metaverse is a new open landscape that if out the gate they're presented with two choices one which clearly accrues more value to them and one which clearly accrues more value to the platform it feels logical that they'll they'll go with the one that accrues more value to them and that it'll win simply because consumers are going to be given that choice out the gate which they were not given in social media land yeah we were not given a choice in the beginning like whether we wanted to do twitter or something like open protocol where like we could own our tweets you know that was never uh presented so i'm optimistic that these options are gonna present themselves in relative parallel in the metaverse and um consumers will have a real choice there can i ask you what the metaverse is like how are we defining this is it just like where we're having it because do i need a view like do i need a vr head am i like i'm just curious like no here here are the two definitions that i have come across that i think are the most interesting so like you know the loosest definition is just like when you're spending time in the digital world and it's like we've all been in the metaverse the last time you know and yeah like sure yeah or the amount of time we spend on social media or in zoom rooms right like is arguably the metaverse and whatever we're in the metaverse right now yeah exactly or you know in games that that's the metaverse the the two things that i think were really interesting one was a uh janine i forgot her last name she is the ceo of every realm which is a matter of investment company that is spun off of from other company that you would remember you would know the name of but i can't remember the name of it right now so that's going great um and she was like it's it's the essentially interactivity like when i go on free people's website to shop if my best friend is also on free people's website shop i don't know that and that really the metaverse is is when it stops being this sort of like one-way street of like me bumping into just like a wall and when i know that my friends are there and i can maybe even interact with them while i shop online um and and that was like a really cool definition in my opinion of like when we hit there it's obviously not like the definition and then the the other one was yeah the other one was this was this hermann nerula one which is when we which is not like a hard and fast destination to get to but like extending human experiences into when like it's commonplace to go to a metaverse concert and you and all your friends can gather there and it's like it's not about the gaming it's about the extending human experiences into the digital world so that that one's a little bit vaguer he maybe would push back and have some stronger definition if you pushed him point blank but both of those felt like interesting definitions to me or interesting ways to think about it i mean if the metaverse were you shopping with your friends online it would save dina and i so much time so many so many hours of sending it so many hours back and forth like just the challenge of time wasted yeah that would be michael polo's trying on new things let's start just a lot of different platforms metaverse maxis that's we've now with one phrase with one phrase boys club is going all in on the metaverse exactly um okay well uh i guess speaking of the metaverse i wanted to talk about this project triverse that's been on my radar for a long long time but i've never really talked about it um and it of course not financial advice i don't own a damn thing in this project i say this all the time people who listen to the show must be so confused by my job they're like all you do is talk about projects that you don't own like i know but you know i don't have conflicts of interest so this is the beautiful thing um so treeverse is a project have you guys followed it at all do you know much about this top level also we're not gamers so you're really on your own here like no nor am i which again anybody who listens to this show will know because i say it all the time and i just like apologize profusely that anybody is uh having to put up with me talk about this stuff but i'm i'm trying to learn because it's obviously so central to this space and so much like the market decisions are like you know demand is basically driven by 21 year old gamers so i'm like you know that they've got the best shot at making the most money in this space up to this point um so loopy fi this is a loopy five project and when i some people that i respect are in this project which is why i've been interested in it it's over a year old i think at this point like i feel like loopy started tweeting about this last year um and more recently he released um like a trailer of the the world and and so that's why i'm bringing it up now is there's sort of been like a latest development in it but from what i understand you so he starts tweeting about this last year and it's initially just like a pixelated tree is where it starts and people know that there's going to be like a game associated with it he follows that up with these founder plot plots of land um from there you get these avatars and at every stage it feels like he's almost like upped the ante in terms of what this game is going to be and how he's thinking about it so it's really evolved into this like full mmorpg do you know what that stands for ladies massively multiplayer online role play game nice role play yeah okay that's the rpg piece of this um and so and and um like it's got sort of an anime vibe it feels like from the latest like visuals that i was able to see so it feels like it's tapping into like a number of zeitgeists here and again no incredible take here but but loopify was like i think people are going to really start to appreciate what we're building he tweeted out recently so i'm just trying to put more of a spotlight on this for folks who are into gaming i think lubify he's not docs which i'm usually i'm skeptical of so like i always want to caveat things with that but like has been in the space for a long time been working on this project alone for a long time so like i'm like that's there's a commitment to this project that feels very genuine much of his team is docs like their pictures are on the website and things so it's like you know not like the whole team um and um i forgot what the end of that sentence was gonna be well something that i is as sort of tying in between this so i saw this twitter thread on on this tree land what's it called traverse tree verse okay um and sort of interesting time back to what you were saying about like the metaverse and the interview that you had today about like performances and so i was like reading this and i remember like fortnite i'm not a gamer i know we've already said that but i'm caveating again um fortnite like does like concerts like like in yes their game travels like travis scott and like the marshmallow what's the marshmallow guys anyway those guys those djs and it's sort of interesting tying back to what you were saying around like that that type of experience those are sort of like markers of this thing becoming more and more real or more and more important to people is like pulling in stuff from the real world and artists from the real world and putting them into this game and this world and then like also so much of what i think i've when i've heard people talk about gaming it's like the lore of the game is so important that's what the end of my sentence is going to be oh there it is it was this emphasis on story building finish your thought but oh but so finish anyway it's just like interesting how like that that how much like that is so important to people who are really into games because and then which feels sort of counterintuitive to then travis scott coming and like performing in that world because i'm like what but like you know and i was like i don't really don't get this like this isn't for me at all like this type of world but then i think of like game of thrones and you know when we everybody was in game of thrones we talked about this but like remember when like sansa stark like goes i haven't watched it so don't spoil anything what no that's not you've got to be able to do it i know i don't have to be able to do it but like you're paying you're not wrong i just it's okay like that great point either to spoil it anyway there's like this one like daughter who is goes to this world and she is training or something can't really remember the storyline but she's trying on different people's faces and becoming them and like becomes like a sorcerer's i think or something or like comes becomes like a a fighter and all this stuff and like i think that's what like people feel like games do for them like they get to become whoever it is that this game yeah and that's why the story of it is so important because they have to be like really sold into the idea and feel like they know the character that they are and so i guess that's why it's important but that feels really counterintuitive intuitive to like trap stock scott coming in because i'm like those worlds are that not the same because you're saying it's kind of blowing up the story well yeah i think there's ways to to blend them but let me take these in two parts so on the storybuilding piece that was gonna be the end of that sentence something along the lines of just that that is my sense of what part of the the strong case here for for triverse is the emphasis on lore and the emphasis on the story building that they're doing um to to i wanted to make a a maybe partly separate point about travis scott because again you can tell this herman conversation i had earlier today really structured fully juiced reiterating i can't wait to listen yeah i know i'm hoping that's the result of this i'm hoping people aren't like oh i've now heard every point it has to make because carly just reiterated them all so i'm going to skip that episode because she talked about it too much hopefully this gets you just more enthusiastic to hear him say it because he's even better at saying it than i am but you know his point was i guess for the travis scott uh fortnight concert they had i mean they had like millions of people i think who tuned into that but they were in rooms of a hundred people because they couldn't actually service having thousands of people there at once because that's very technically challenging and complicated and that's what's so it's one of the big differentiators for improbable and what they're building is trying to create these experiences so you genuinely feel like you're in a stadium with thousands of other people like you would be for the concert as opposed to like it's me 100 people you know so you're sharing that experience with everyone so um anyway that's just there was something i found fascinating um any any thoughts you have dina on uh loopy fi i mean which i believe i'm pronouncing correctly or um the only yeah the only take that i have was like it feels like they're i was i was reading their like rollout um timeline and uh and all the things that they've shipped and they've shipped a lot and i feel like that's like what all these other nft games like are trying to do and they're actually executing so i know nothing about games i know nothing about them but like i see a lot i i like casually encounter a lot of like this is the next like gaming nft thing and like people go crazy for it and buy a bunch of stuff and then it doesn't go anywhere um so i think the only thing i'd say is that like it's really nice to see a lot of shipping consistently happen over a long period of time um and yeah that's i love i'd just love to see that generally for the industry because i feel like it that's an important counter to a lot of the skepticism that like regular consumers bring into how they're thinking about the nft space is like it's just vaporware drugs but like they're shipping it's amazing yep yep absolutely and i agree that's why i think loopify not being docs and i'm like okay but yeah you have a really interesting track record here like yeah be aware of it but like the track record is is not what you usually see in a row like like a year dedicated to building this and shipping a lot and making real improvements is not like your typical behavior um okay final two topics uh solana ethe nft is now on magic eden i had one particular thing i wanted to call out about this and then maybe we just wrap with some just fun takes on the really abysmal press coverage of crypto not as in the coverage is bad it is but like it's actually bad journalism yeah yeah is the coverage yes um so uh real quick here i don't know how much crossed y'all's radar about this magic eden announcement they will now be accepting eth nfts on their platform as well um but i'll get your quick taste and then and then share mine i mean we're just living in a multi-chain world is how i love a multi-chain world oh i don't know i'm going to put i'm going to fight this i'm going to fight this i'm going to tell you why i'm going to fight this so regular listeners of this podcast again are this is another thing they're probably sick of hearing me talk about i i don't know i think that one of god and lord knows the the everything we saw this week backs us up one of the riskiest like points of failure in a system is a bridge is is when you're trying to bridge between these these chains and so for me what ethereum has going for it is tremendous network effects and security what it doesn't have going for it is scalability but i'm quite bullish on what's happening in the layer 2 ecosystem and and sharding and the kind of advancements that are going to be made on the technical side that i think ethereum can very much overcome the scale the scalability problem so the question is like either which comes first or maybe they all come and it's fine but like eth solving their problem with scale or really secure bridges being built that allow for like crossing chains really easily and i'm not sure i'm persuaded that like the the bridging tech is going to be solved before the eth scaling tech is and then once you have enough network effect somewhere like what why would you launch a project somewhere else yeah i have to recuse myself from this conversation because my day job but uh yeah i think the yeah lots of lots of hot takes in there but yeah i i need to be a little bit careful i just think for the world that we're living in in the world that i'm living in or in boys club where we're just trying to get more people interested and excited about what's happening here and seeing what the opportunity for them is in it like it's really hard to like get have these siloed chains where things are happening and interesting projects are happening like and it just makes it really difficult for people to engage and so it's it's there's like security risk and it's not maybe it's not as sexy but like something about i'm just constantly thinking about the ease for consumers and the ease for mass adoption for people to really be able to um like understand this ecosystem better and so the more that like that can happen and it's easier for people like it's exciting to me but you're totally right that like it presents a bunch a bunch of issues because if a ton of people get in and excited about it and it's like not a secure environment then the the risk of that is even higher than not being able to understand or get into it yep what i thought was interesting about this magic eden announcement in there and this was coming from nft statistics punk nine zero five nine he he's been tweeting about this a bunch but he tweeted this specifically um that they called out in their announcement that there'd be no frozen stolen assets and this is an issue that i had really not been tracking very fully and i i talked to uh punk 9059 earlier today we should say he he has been announced as the new like head of research for proof so that's a cool announcement in the world of of nft land um but he really kind of opened my eyes about this which is this problem of open sea freezing assets that have been flagged as stolen but they get frozen by the time some innocent buyer has bought them and now this innocent buyer has invested in some cases like a lot of personal funding or something into an asset that they're now not allowed to resell and they did nothing wrong yeah and is it really even solving the problem no it's it's not at all solving the problem so yeah apparently open c's like line on this so they've said very very little is that they're legally required to do this um i haven't talked to anybody at openc i actually will probably try and reach out to them and because i'd be curious but this all just kind of crossed my cross my desk metaphorically speaking earlier today but but nft statistics saying like i've talked to lawyers about this and like i have not gotten a good explanation as to why this would be legally required at all you now have magic eating coming out saying they're not gonna do it so it seems odd that it's like a legal mandate um and this is you know there are people who are really kind of suffering under this and and half the time the the thief who sells it is the one who flags it is stolen anyway and like you know it's it's strange so um i don't know if you guys have any takes on this but that was something that jumped out to me about the the magic unit announcement i mean i i think just generally like competition in any marketplace landscape is healthy so i think great it's good to see like other players rise and get traction and experiment and pull in different currencies or whatever it is because i think that yeah like um market dominance it never feels healthy for any industry so i think that's i'm bullish generally on the trajectory love it i'm 100 with you there okay fun stuff a couple bad crypto takes i mean wall street journal did a whole article about d5 and basically used celsius as the poster child and you're like literally just sitting there your heart's just like dying you're like how how you're the wall street journal literally like how do you how to take this bad mm-hmm they're no good really it's really crazy to me that the narrative hasn't shifted to like just this like the the transparency piece alone that defy gives um that that hasn't like become a thread through to interrogate traffic and like and that sort of leveraged from the media to be like let's use this like sort of emerging thing that now is possible with this other technology and like use that as sort of a uh like a mirror like a lens to look at what's happening in traffic is like some like just assign that to a writer like let's just like get that story like starting to go because that's the narrative that like is really interesting and that we should like yeah all be really curious about um and i just like i i can't understand why that's not the dominant story um and why it's this it's so baffling like like taking a tradify company that just happens to deal in crypto assets as opposed to equities and then being like see this is why this new system they're proposing doesn't work it's like no this is exactly why the old system yeah so bad the other one uh was bloomberg was like indiscriminately calling out various celebrities and like but i say indiscriminately because it's like like people in greece witherspoon who i think have been really savvy about how they've entered the space she's not launched her own nft or coin or anything like she and her team have really learned they like were supportive of the world of women and like you know you had bloomberg like calling her out for that and i'm like it's not like the world of women like stole from investors or it was like right it dropped 30 in value it's like okay like you're gonna bash it's the second inning of a nine-inning game and you're like dancing on a grave like that's like a weird flex well also it's like this art like many of these things are like investments that people have made and like yes this article we would never write an article where you had these images with like their traditional investments and how they're doing like it's an insane thing to be doing and like i don't understand how this got greenlit as a story that anybody cares about like it's it's insane i'm sure but think about how many people care about celebrities and also care about seeing celebrities fall and then hate crypto and it's like like the difference would be most of these people aren't like necessarily pumping up their stock portfolio or like you know like that was the thing like i get it these celebrities were actively vocally using their platforms to talk about these either projects or coins or crypto in general and blah blah blah so like but again just the lack of journalistic integrity yeah to like like this like pre-written narrative because you're like people hate crypto like let's bash this without actually providing information or any sort of caveats or like distinguishing between maybe people who really did kind of enter it sleazily and just for money and pumped bags that were bad versus people who like really authentically entered it and are doing a lot of good like just completely indiscriminate across the board i we so we got like boys club got caught up in like a little sort of there was a minute there where everyone was trying to write a story about like women's crypto or web3 projects and like and they were not generous and they were not not all i mean not everyone but like there was definitely a take that was happening that was around sort of women in web 3 and being sort of this predatory like thing and it is that is what it is i'm not really commenting on that at all but one thing that i that did consistently came come up and came up actually in an article about boys club was sort of making references to to mlm um to that sort of like multi-level marketing steaming yeah and what really irritated me about that being used in the context of boys club was we have never charged to anyone a single cent to be a part of voice lab like not even a single cent and that it's just like people the the the media and these journalists like sort of have the story that they're looking to write and they're just looking for evidence of it and like it just so happens to be that the sort of narrative is around this take right now um yeah facts be damned you've never charged anybody to join yeah and it's just like it just feels really um i don't know like and then at the same time like we know for a fact that like they're all of these holding companies that like own these outlets are all like wait what's our web 3 what's our crypto play like what's our web 3 play and like they're all doing that and it's just like it's so weird to me oh you i love that take so much so i've been like people can tune out of this podcast by this point if they're about be bored with my like slightly adjacent to web3 take but um but i'm gonna say this anyways i've been like very interested in how do you create like the daily show with jon stewart model for um to talk about like tech and business and web 3 and john stewart being sort of different to me than any of the other voices that have kind of emerged in late night or anything else and the way he kind of pointed out hypocrisy so well do you know what i'm saying this to you did i give you a specific example did i give you the did i give you the link specific okay this is but this is like perfect what dina just said um and i'll try and make this quick because we are running a little over time but but essentially the first episode of the daily show with jon stewart that i ever watched uh took was in like 2009 and they were trying to figure out what to do with like the 911 site you know they haven't actually done anything where the twin towers were and there was some group that was trying to fund a mosque there and the right was like you can't put a mosque they were calling it like the terror mosque and you can't put it where the 911 site was and fox news was doing a whole thing about the terror mosque and like follow the money and the money leads you to um to this big bad saudi guy who's funding this freedom foundation and whatever lo and behold that you know bad saudi guy is this is ali bentalal who is business owners or is his business partners with rupert murdoch and part owner of news corp at fox news and so john of course does this whole like incredible thing of like are they evil or are they stupid like they do they literally not know that the bad guy they're talking about co-owner of like their company or are they just like evil and they're like intentionally like eliminating that information from the discourse or whatever but like i almost feel like we need to do that for this of like does the writer not know that their own company is like you know talking to a world of women because i'm not saying this actually i'm not saying bloomberg women i have no idea but you get like like or are they just trying to you know like is there an evilness to just trying to like get clicks independent of truth and depend on anything else yeah oh i want to do this now because that's such a funny ridiculous you got to do it i would tune in i'd tune in okay deeply considering this well that's our show this is the best so thank you guys for coming on so much for having us
