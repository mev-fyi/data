the sky is starting to clear like we the all the trash has already floated up to the surface and we've already started to like start doing a lot of that cleaning I've been feeling pretty good Bagel Station it is the second week of July I hope you are enjoying your Friday morning because it's time for the weekly roll up I said it this time not you David but how you doing man on the second week of July crypto still being kind of crazy we're getting some liquidations we're getting some bankruptcies some consolidation on the market how are you feeling about things you know pretty pretty good I'd say uh successful support oilia testnet merge two of three test Nets ready to go is Gourley next uh and like meanwhile the block 5 story has I think concluded that story is over we're gonna recap the conclusion of that story uh Voyager goes bust but we already knew that uh the final death of three Euros Capital we kind of already knew that too and also read it in Facebook doing nft things and no one really noticed it and so like Ryan like we're also like a little bit great we're actually more than a little bit green right now uh again positive news on the merge no more contagion uh I feel pretty good I think things are getting cleaned up I think yeah yeah the skies are in our stuff together the sky is starting to clear like we the all the trash has already floated up to the surface and we've already started to like start doing a lot of that cleaning I've been feeling pretty good how are you feeling yeah you know what I I think that the contagion might be over at least this first pass and this unless we get another big leg down right um so I'm always to say that but we've had a lot of crypto Banks go under and that's been the story and we're going to continue talking about it this week as well as everything that is else that is going on in crypto including uh macro stuff if as always if you guys enjoy these weekly Roll-Ups and Bank lists in general make sure you like And subscribe all right on the podcast that means making sure you're subscribed on YouTube it's hitting that click subscribe button and also giving us comments throwing comments uh our way and five star reviews we always appreciate that David have we told them to get their morning coffee yet uh yeah yeah your morning coffee morning coffee second cup yeah so you can probably already drink your first couple minutes gives me a two cup roll up let's talk about Juno though David this is a crypto bank that we actually do like and we do recommend because it is an easy way to bridge onto Layer Two what is Juno doing for us oh my gosh so much the coolest thing about Juno it's a normal checking account it's a bank uh you know fun fact I actually do have a bank account that's and how I pay rent so we all need our checking accounts it's the place that you know the money goes before you buy ether or Bitcoin uh but with Juno you can get from your checking account to a layer two on ethereum directly goes checking account to Layer Two like immediately in seconds so that's kind of crazy uh free withdrawals uh and so you don't have to deal with like layer one gas fees you don't have to deal with like the Bridge wait times uh so that's already crazy it's optimism arbitrum uh I think uh what else is there I think and then the DK roll up coming in soon yep yep DK sync and Star Ware uh and then you can also trade crypto with zero fees uh we like zero fees uh we like crypto assets and then if you so choose you can get six percent on your usdc and three percent on your Bitcoin and ether what I also love is they'll convert your paycheck you can get your direct deposits into this and they'll convert your paycheck into crypto and then you can like immediately withdraw that to Layer Two and some people are saying well you guys are bankless well we still also live in the real I still have a Wells Fargo account sadly haven't been able to get rid of that but I do also have a Juno account because that is a D5 friendly crypto bank doesn't mean you have to keep all of your funds on Juno right you keep the minimum necessary in the banking system uh but these fast withdrawals to Layer Two and all of this crypto native and D5 native support is super useful so um go ahead and get your Juno account there's a link in the show notes also if you go to bankless.cc slash capital J for Juno you will be able to uh get that link and earn ten dollars when you deposit David let's talk about markets man what are the markets doing we actually have uh sunshine it's a green week a little bit of sunshine yeah so Bitcoin started the week at twenty thousand dollars we are currently at twenty thousand seven hundred and thirty dollars about three point five percent in the green Ryan 3.5 above 20K is a good day all right how about youth price uh that's up even more yeah are you ready for this one Ron uh ether started the week at one thousand thirty dollars we are currently at twelve hundred fifteen dollars that is eighteen percent that is eighteen percent green that's a big that's a big green week what is this are people bullish suddenly uh no I I didn't know that that was allowed in this market well let's look at the ratio because that's also bullish that must have gone up with the numbers you just quoted me yep up eight percent we are currently at point zero five eight where we were down to 0.05453 earlier this week you still believe this is a reliable bull market bear Market indicator so it's a little bit bullish on the week I mean it's a lagging indicator not a leading indicator but I mean it's been it's been up since June uh the bottom was like June 10th or June 12th or something so like it's been slowly grinding up ever since June 12th which was like when this contagion started so like I guess a month of contagion in the rear view mirror which is bullish important to note though in these bear markets there's always these fake outs right so what'll happen this happened in 2018 how many times did it happen where like we'd go first steep drop and then we'd recover and everyone's like oh there's a ray of hope there's the sunshine like maybe we're out of it and then boom we get hit by another major drop that happened a lot and uh you know I have no idea what the hell I was doing when in 2018. I was like yeah you're you're you're the Elder Millennial here yeah well man I uh I remember and I thought a few times I was like okay this this has got to be it this has got to be the end we're still on a road to recovery although I will say that the feeling is a little bit different this time David I feel like a lot of people are have already capitulated to the fact that we are dead in a bear market and we might be in a bear market for years right at this point in time and that to me is a good signal because we didn't see that in the first mega drops of 2018 people were still in denial and they spent more of this phase in in denial in that like oh maybe the bear Market maybe the bull Market's not over maybe we'll just recover and things will shoot back up maybe this is another big dip but what is the cryptocurrency chart telling us from a Global Perspective how much value in crypto right now yeah total crypto market cap up from 934 billion to 976 billion so that's going up too yeah um the sentiment though from a macro perspective doesn't feel so great in economic update there's a tweet could you read this one out David yeah 58 of Americans now living paycheck to paycheck consumer confidence lowest since 1950 stock market having its worst year since 1970 mortgage demand the lowest since 2001 credit card debt up 20 in one month and then they followed this tweet this uh these metrics up with the recession is just getting started this is where I always go back and forth like okay these are all like lagging indicators right these are telling us of well you know the zeitgeists all the times everyone feels bad because the stock market's down no one's buying homes everyone feels priced out of homes not only are homes still pretty highly priced but the mortgage edges are really really high and you can see this choice these the economic conditions showing up in impacting consumers because they're having to load up on credit card debt and credit card debt up 20 in one month uh and so but these are all as a result of the last like three months and I don't think they are indicative of the future three months um but they could be yeah this is uh I think it's a good marker of sentiment and I do think some of these data points are probably like um selected right so you know for instance this stock market having its worst year since 1970 well you know at the beginning of January stock market was like close to like all-time highs right so there's some data sampling here that is definitely skewing towards um the bearish side but definitely this r word I'm seeing that everywhere now the recession recession recession is just getting started and I feel like sentiment from an economic perspective has shifted towards everyone's now expecting a recession even though that hasn't formally hit yet um but what's the US dollar doing because I mean US dollar is still strong it's looking good in fact it is pumping yeah yeah for the first time ever I think there's parity between the Euro and the dollar at the moment not the first time ever but first time in in like as far as I can remember uh yeah so the headline here Euro tumbles to a 20-year low putting parity with a dollar in sight uh the Dixie the dxy which is a chart that we don't have up but uh it's the basket basically measures dollar strength versus a basket of other currencies is continuing to increase uh and this I think this is um relevant to the dollar milkshake theory if people are familiar with that we had bro Brett Johnson on the podcast forever ago to talk about what the dollar milkshake theory is basically it's a general theory that in economic hardship conditions there's a flight to Dollars which is what you would expect in a downturn people just flight to flight of dollars but also because there's so much debt pent up in the system that when it comes time to pay the debts it basically there's a squeeze on the dollar supply because everyone's trying to get their hands on dollars to pay back their debts and so in Bear markets as we've seen in crypto everyone when time when numbers go down people have to pay back their debts this is why there's a discount on staked eth because people sell steak teeth for ether because they need that liquidity people are just selling assets for dollars because they need liquidity and therefore the dollar is really really strong right now sadly this is also an indication of a future recession because as dollar strength goes up corporate profits go down like real rates go down et cetera et cetera and so it's it's it's it slows growth high dollar value slows growth and that triggers a recession in addition to all the other things that trigger recessions the basic idea is the dollar drinks every other Fiat currency's milkshake that's why it's called the dollar milkshake Theory and we're seeing the Euro at its lowest level since 20 uh since 2002 and yen is down even worse to its lowest level since 2001 which is pretty crazy another sign of recession it feels like is oil so remember we were very concerned about oil I mean economists were very concerned about the price of oil shooting up for all sorts of different reasons of course you know war in Ukraine other reasons as well now oil has just tumbled as much as 10 percent I don't know about you David but around me gas prices were just down on the week down like 40 cents a gallon or something like that 40 45 cents a gallon and uh it's it's incredible how fast that is happening but of course oil Demand Being down is another sign of recession it could be a sign of waning inflation too we don't know because inflation itself is is also a lagging indicator what are your thoughts on this yeah so this is this is a mixed uh data signal right uh oil prices are down because people are buying less oil because people are buying Less in general because of you know the quote unquote recession that we are currently in you know still debated whether in a recession or not um so dollar like demand for oil is down uh but that's good because we need prices to go down because oil price goes down means food prices go down which means inflation comes down which is literally the only way out of this recession is if we get inflation to come down so like mixed signal here uh and it's kind of the signal that you want to see we want to see oil prices come down as a result of killing demand uh and so like you know it kind of sucks that like we're having to quell inflation by having a recession but that's kind of the bargain that we made when we printed a bunch of stimi checks two years ago this is definitely the bargain that um Jerome Powell and the Central Bank explicitly wants to make if you want more info on that go tune into our Jim Bianco episode that we did a couple weeks ago where he's basically like the the FED has one big stick and it has to beat inflation over the head with it and that stick is called recession that stick is called making everyone feel bad so that they don't spend as much money and decreasing demand that's the stick that we're getting beaten over the head with so this is expected as you'd say a few interesting crypto numbers in the midst of all of this is David did you know that usdc circles usdc is now on track to topple tether USD T I thought this would happen a couple of years ago right right because just circle is a regulatory like from a um assurances perspective it's a it's a more transparent uh dollar stable coin than tether um looks like it's happening now I actually think it makes sense that tether took such a long time to Dethrone hasn't been dethroned yet but like the regulatory gray area that tether lives in actually is one of the reasons why it's got adopted by so many people outside of the United States um but as soon as like the United States takes a leadership position uh which is being helped by a circle like eventually the regulatory once the regulatory uh arm comes in and like we all start to have regulatory fears people go from tether to us you see so I mean the writing's been on the wall for a while eventually crypto was going to become big enough where regulatory reasons are concerned so you would naturally see that flow out of tether and into usdc which is what happened by the way like tether has seen a decrease in total Supply but uscc's market cap has grown by 8.27 percent since May highest level ever hit of total USD Supply 55.9 billion was hit on July 2nd in contrast UST suffered a 19 drop in total market cap and is currently at 66.14 billion so usdc at basically 56 billion and yua and tether at 66 billion so not far away you know what all the crypto bowls that I know even if they're exiting some of their you know positions their core crypto holding positions unless they need the money to go pay bills they're not exiting to Fiat to like dollars in a bank account they're exiting to something like usdte or usdc or die right to these stable coins so it's always interesting to me in these in these even these bear Market Cycles you do tend to see stablecoin grow stable coins appreciate in terms of a total market cap because that's where people are parking their money isn't ustc like if you own by uscc and put it in your ethereum wallet which is if by the way ethereum is called a an account based Ledger system as opposed to bitcoin's utxo unspent transaction output system anyways when you buy uscc and put it in your ethereum wallet your ethereum account aren't you just using it isn't that like a proxy for a bank account yeah because like it's totally uscc is one crypto rails yeah is it uscc is one massive bank account and then all USC account owners on ethereum Are One microbank account totally so it's another proxy for it it is it's on better rails right so like I could send you as much as I want at any point in time there's no like banking hours I don't have to go like show up with my ID to my bank in order to wire you funds I can send it to any eth address so it's like it's still like usdc and stable coins are still a crypto super power guys this is still a use case the world hasn't woken up to it's so much better than trying to wire money in the stupid traditional banking system right I had to send a 10 000 our wire to this Angel investment this week and no one knows where it went it's just lost I have to go call my bank they have to go call their bank and they're like all right like who where'd this money go did you see like do you know of any mistake that was made like I have no clue I have no I have to go find that out but it's just like how do we just lose money it's like it's like where'd it go it was like I can there's no tracking I can see I can send a 10 000 usdc transfer on ethereum I can watch it penned in real time and it's wherever it's going the fact that it just like disappears and they was like oh we lost it like this is ridiculous it's funny it's like to be honest David even ignoring all the hassle which is a massive Hassle and just show up in a bank present your ID do the wire thing the cost five days it takes to get something internationally ignore all of that okay just like I am now more nervous to transfer a wire from one place to another than I am to send a uh crypto transaction I it used to be reverse to me that's another like minor flipping I used to be terrified to send crypto like double check let me send like the test transaction let me check this ten times thousand one dollar then I'll send ten dollars and now I still obviously check everything and make sure like user experience has gotten a little bit better and like the fact that I can see it instantly right I mean if you're wiring money who knows where it's going yeah that is way more risky in my mind that's been interesting uh you know flip that's happened in the last uh you know two or three years for me personally okay 200k eats staked that's a big milestone too another crypto number we are looking at uh and then also ens is still on a tear what's happening with ens they just released their June stats that is a bright spot in the nft market yeah so ens June numbers 122 000 new.eth registrations uh 3.3 million dollars in protocol Revenue all going to the Dow uh that's 2500 eth in Revenue uh twenty five thousand new eth accounts with at least one new ens name so that's 25 000 ethereum wallets with the new ens name and Ryan that's that was just June we're one week into July and you can see that tiny little bar chart down in the bottom right corner uh so far seven days into July we are basically where all of June was so the last seven days you know we still have three more weeks so the June the July numbers finish we're basically on par the first week of July is basically on par with all of June David painting this game oh I know yes a lot of my there have been a lot of my like crypto friends that I've been trying to they they I tried to get them into defy summer I tried to get them into nfts they did get into nfts and then got burned sorry about that uh but then of their own accord without of their own accord without me like kicking them in the butt they're all else playing the ens game and so like yeah they have like they've registered a ton of ens names they're they're sitting on a lot of them yeah they're playing it and so be people have found like a new market to play in like nft games look this has an analog right it's domain names are valuable dot coms are valuable.nets are valuable they work like and you could just see this obviously they're going to be valuable in crypto and for various things and you know anyway dowels nfts every single uh piece of property will want to have its own uh name that is the the bulk case for all of this I don't play in this in the speculation though David I just you know we collect a few things here and there we got bank list.e I got you know my uh my initials a few other things but I'm not playing these games yeah you saw david.eath got bought for 32 eth oh my god really yeah recently yeah this last week yeah goes for I think do you think it's worth more less than three I think Dave I think David's got to be worth more there's more Davids yeah there's better days good take Ryan good take all right guys we got so much more to cover the the contagion that has spread maybe this is the last week that we'll have to talk about that but another C5 Bank going bust this is the conclusion of Voyager and uh we'll talk about that also blockfi gets their bailout some good news there and crypto banks are consolidating we're going to talk about the big Winners and what that means we will get back to all of these things but first we want to tell you about these fantastic sponsors to help provide some tools to help you go bankless rocket pool is your friendly decentralized ethereum staking protocol you can stake your eats with rocket pool and get R eth in return allowing you to stake your eth and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by taking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a note rocketpool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16eath to get started why would you do this you get an extra 15 staking Commission on the pool to eat so your apy is boosted so if your bullish is staking you can increase your apy and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocketpool network which currently has over a thousand independent validators it's yield farming but with ethereum nodes you can get started at rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pole community in their Discord you can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat so I'll see you there maker Dow is the OG D5 protocol the first D5 protocol to ever exist even before we called it D5 maker Dow produces die the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity instead you can spin up a maker Vault and use your collateral to Mint to die directly with maker the power to Mint new money is in your hands and there's something new in the maker Dow ecosystem every time a new

the health of our environment can live side by side soon maker will be present on all chains in layer twos bringing the biggest and best D5 credit facility to everywhere there is D5 so follow maker on Twitter at makerdau and learn from the oldest and most resilient down existence alright guys we are back uh talking about the first big item this week that you need to know about which is Voyager a crypto Bank a C5 Lending Service and borrowing service went bust we've been talking about that they had exposures to three arrows Capital here's how this resolved you know though David I feel like all of these uh new centralized C5 lending services are kind of coming out of the woodwork a little bit like ones that I didn't really know much about right and I don't know about you but I didn't know much about Voyager did you know anything about Voyager all crypto Banks yeah right it's like I uh you know I know the block fives and the nexos and you know Celsius and such I was not covered like following Voyager I was just taking a scan at their website look award-winning crypto app 100 digital assets look how nice this looks looks like a nice fintech platform I get my debit card looks nice safe and secure I can go take a look at the products here behind this um and don't forget to click on the token tab Brian there's a token tab I mean let's talk about the products get started in under three minutes look at these annualized rewards here all very nice they do have a token token right uh the Voyager token meet the Voyager token boost your crypto yield with the Voyager token all right crypto Banks like there where do I buy stake it of course because why not uh you go to the about section and take a look at the team oh look these guys look competent look at those suits they all Wear Ties Ryan they all weigh times biggest red flag okay um this gentleman who's the CEO is a brokerage and Market structure veteran who founded Lightspeed Financial previously he worked as the CEO at E-Trade professional trading oh my God this is great this looks like a fintech platform meets crypto it's got the link button button yeah they they must keep my money secure it must be safe to deposit and earn like eight nine percent uh interest wow yeah look at this man eight percent on deep coin eight percent on April dear God nine percent on usdc look these tears I mean it all looks very standard wow all looks very very like fantastic nice and Shrink wrapped and by the way Voyager is a publicly traded company okay I forgot about this is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange so you've got that uh air of legitimacy too but why don't you take us through what happened with voyager yeah so uh like on the theme in the last few weeks we have to go back a few a few weeks because these things happen over you know longer than seven days on June 14th Voyager release is a digital an update on their asset and risk management policies which I'm going to pull out a few quotes to read from uh as a public company Voyager operates with a consistently high level of transparency providing regular quarterly financial statements detailing the company's financial position and financial statements to closer surrounding risk management practices and counter party exposure forager differentiates itself through a straightforward low risk approach to lending and asset management by working with a select group of reputable counterparties reputable counterparties which low risk low risk which are all vetted through extensive due diligence by its risk committees Voyager holds a strong position in the crypto industry not only were we among the first who go public and provide full balance sheet transparency our leadership also has deep Financial expertise across the sector and has led companies through multiple Market Cycles says Steve elrich elrich chief executive officer officer and co-founder of Voyager the company is well capitalized and in a good position to weather this Market cycle and protect customer assets this sounds great David and this sounds so good what could go wrong uh it's voyager's goal to continue to build secure products and services as well as build trust and leadership in the cryptocurrency industry okay reminder that was June 14th that was about three weeks ago June 22nd let's go forward in June 22nd the news breaks Voyager digital stock plunges after disclosing over 60 660 million dollars of exposure in a uncollateralized loan to a three arrows Capital an unsecured loan and so this balance included 350 million of dollars of usdc and 15 250 BTC loaned to three arrows Capital so that news got released on June 22nd that's pretty unique too that uncollateralized loan piece of it right like block fly ran into trouble but their loans were completely collateralized to three hours Capital yeah okay so July 6th and here's the news of this week uh Voyager uh goes bankrupt and so they have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy uh and so again a few quotes I'm going to pull out crypto lender and broker Voyager digital has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy estimating that it has more than a hundred thousand creditors that's retail the single largest created creditor is Alameda research with unsecured loans of 75 million dollars Voyager digital is a publicly traded company listed on Toronto Stock Exchange the company has also is issued vgx token allowing users to earn bursted rewards High referral bonuses and better pricing on trades on June 22nd the company announced that its exposure to 3o's Capital it listed the assets that I just mentioned mentioned a second ago and on July 2nd Singapore based throughout Capital filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy which allows the company to Shield U.S assets and block creditors like Voyager digital from relief filing lawsuits and so on a July 6th press release Voyager announces that his commenced a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy to provide maximum values for stakeholders under this plan which is subject to change and requires Court approval customers with their crypto account so if you have if you're a retail investor investor if you're a retail depositor into Voyager customers with their crypto in their account will receive an exchange of a combination of the crypto in their account as much as they can get back from Voyager proceeds from the three arrows Capital recovery which could be zero common shares in a newly reorganized company and more Voyager tokens so common shares in a newly reorganized company in order to pay back the debts that Voyager owes their retail customer they're basically like giving them equity for a new company it's like a future ious like sorry we don't have any money to give you but we can print equity and give that to you instead uh and so the current state of uh of Voyager is that they have about 110 million dollars of cash and crypto assets on hand remember they gave three hours Capital 660 million dollars and they said that they will provide liquidity to support day-to-day operations so that they're going to pay their employees and then moving on to the last quote that I'll read Voyager has approximately 1.3 billion of crypto assets on this platform plus claims against three errors capital for more than 650 million um so like you they're not completely like they have assets uh they have like I would say like 50 to two-thirds solvency but they're missing like a big chunk missing a big chunk so the big picture story here is crypto Market goes down and then press release to reassure everyone in Voyager look we have our risk processes covered we're solvent everything's fine we're responsible company hey look we're publicly traded depositors don't worry about it and of course if you're a crypto Bank in this situation you kind of have to say these things to project confidence so that you don't get a bank run all right under behind the scenes they had a number of uncollateralized loans to like Alameda group also three areas Capital these loans were not low risk at all particularly the the one to three hours Capital that went completely bust and now if you are a depositor into Voyager so retail investor you were looking at the website earlier David with those attractive returns and look at the Sleek interface and you got the mobile um you know the mobile experience and it's an easy one button click to deposit well what do you get as a result you ain't getting your money back what you're getting instead is whatever crypto assets are maybe remaining some percentage of a hundred percent that you deposited the proceeds from some sort of three areas Capital recovery three hours Capital owes them 650 million will they get any of that back who knows maybe uh suzu's yacht is for sale maybe you get a portion from that I don't know uh common shares in a newly reorganized company whatever that's worth and Voyager tokens that's what you get it do you remember I don't know if you remember back in like was it like 2016 I'm going back in my past year there was a bit cynics which had a major hack um it was a bitfenix and um they like lost funds as a result so they lost deposit depositors money and they did something similar where they where they kind of spinned out spun out a token and gave that to some of their depositors it's funny last cycle some crypto Banks went bust because they actually got hacked lost funds this goes all the way back to Mount gox this cycle what's happening is some of these crypto banks these centralized lending providers were completely irresponsible with their clients funds and lost it that way but it's it's kind of funny how it's you know playing out in a similar way that there you get tokens you knew Equity it actually worked out for um some of the bitfinex depositors in that over time their tokens were actually worth worth more but bitfinex did pay their customers back they made their customers whole it took a number of years but they got there yes this could have a happyish ending I suppose really depends on what Voyager and the management team does from here and if they're able to unbury themselves and and add more value to this Equity not a good place to be if you're a depositor though absolutely not and of course because this is Contagion we're bleeding right over into the story of three arrows Capital Furious Capital has formally filed bankruptcy so this story is slowly coming to a close although it will definitely take a while to play out because there's going to be a fight in court ethereal's Capital has petitioned the British Virgin Isles Court to uh for bankruptcy and the reason why that you would want to do this is well because you have to first off but also they say that without the relief requested herein this is in their their filing creditors May pursue a value-destructive race to the courthouse to exercise rights in a manner that would enhance their own position vis-a-vis other similarly situated creditors basically through Rose Capital owes a bunch of money to a bunch of people and all of these people all these entities are racing to seize three rows Capital assets the fastest so that they could get their money back before other people get the room like there's like you know 10 billion dollars owed and there's like one billion dollars of assets left and who everyone's trying to get that one billion dollars of assets left and so because of this race it would create Capital destruction it would force liquidation at unfavorable rates et cetera et cetera and so this they are filing for bankruptcy to preserve as much Capital as possible knowing full well that's ultimately going to get liquidated but they will just want to liquidate it for the most amount of value possible so that they can make their creditors as whole as possible but the point I want to make is that this is a lesson that when markets break things revert back to lawyers and courts this is what we saw in 2008 there is still to this day Ryan Fallout from 2008 going through Court proceedings because of the mess the absolute spaghetti mess of the credit default swap era of of like of the 2008 and so this is exactly what's happening to throughout his capital total and when when when markets break ultimately we have to have lawyers say like okay these people are out this and these people are all that and so this is an example of when when things we don't want to have happen you know I I want to put one asterisk on that which is like that's true in traditional finance and centralized like markets that does not have to be true in defy right number one D5 held up better number two the code is the Liquidator and the settlement engine the code in the ethereum world in the defy world the code is actually the law and so you wouldn't see that if you're liquidating a maker uh you know collateral loan for first of all that should happen in an orderly way second of all it'll all be settled on chain completely transparently we don't have to go to the court system that's where things get very expensive and inefficient it's going back to the court system and having lawyers in nation states try to arbitrate all of this stuff and that is exactly what we're trying to avoid with defy which again we'll say has held up very well through this liquidation cycle I think Leighton Cusack has a take on that later that we'll get to um but one other question I have in my mind David is look these are all three hours capitals nft Holdings and look at all the art blocks that they purchased um Auto glyphs sporty Yachts crummy signals like what's going to happen to these things and you know what this is a crypto punks do you know what hang on for for the listeners out there we're looking at a pie chart it's uh and so all of Trio's capitals nft Holdings through their Starry Night fund I'm pretty sure we got 40.7 percent of their nft Holdings or crypto punks ow my bags it's gonna be liquidated brother our art blocks curated is 33.5 of their Holdings uh they got some pegs which I don't know what that is uh mutant ape yacht clubs they got a few Auto glyphs um some other things [Music] so many crypto punks all this stuff looks good on the way up it doesn't look so good on the way down I'm reminded by this to me this was like peak nft season do you remember this tweet from suzu right they spent so much money are we looking at um an art blocks nft is that what this is that is a ringer yeah you know peak nft season this was a tweet from suzu from August 27th almost a year ago the thesis we like the goose it's because this random generated nft art looks like a goose and I like it too but now pie chart David is being liquidated I know that I like it for like 10 million dollars or whatever was was paid for this thing at the time so um that's what's happening with three hours capital a few other contagions hang on hang on hang on I'm gonna go find out how much that goose was sold for you know where I found out where uh metaversal thanks William uh hey Ryan uh you want to know how much that goose was sold for I'm super curious can I guess though sure I I'm gonna guess I said 10 million just now I'm gonna guess actually 15 million's moving around the Boost that up uh 5.66 million 1800 ether that's a deal so what's it worth now I don't think very much I'm gonna go with like under under half a million dollars okay so if bought for 5.5 million 5.6 under half a million dollars do you know um one thing if it's pers if it's Susie's personal funds but now that you know kind of the history of three hours capital and this is like some retail money went into this right yes if you deposited your money into a video you it's p you helped Trio's Capital by the goose did you know you were doing that they borrowed your money and bought nfts with it and now those nfts are down bad things got silly man things got very silly um but some consolidation is happening in the crypto banking system at least the uh the strong crypto Banks the ones that have survived the finances of the world we talked to CZ last Friday he said he's looking at buying things sandback been freed from FTX we'll talk about what he's doing with the blockfi deal but also nexo which is a centralized lending and borrowing platform a C5 crypto bank has come out of this stronger and is now in the process of potentially acquiring crypto lender Vault this is another one I haven't heard of I haven't heard evolved but it looks like uh all crypto Banks they're coming out of the Woodworks so we're seeing this consolidation I think um nexo is going to come out of this stronger I think FDX is going to come out of this stronger binance is going to come out of this stronger anyone who wasn't irresponsible during the bear Market if you weren't irresponsible or during the bull market if you weren't irresponsible during the bull market if you have some cash on reserve if you didn't go margin long if you didn't bet Everything 100 of your net worth you're going to come out of this stronger as well and that is the lesson that we learn every single bull market don't wait if I had my money in nexo I'd be like oh thanks guys that'd be good thing thank you I guess it's a crap shoot though if you don't you don't know until don't know like you don't know until after it's too late and so like it's like it's like all right like you want to get your yield you're going to use a C5 lender you got Celsius you got nexo you got I don't know name some other ones for me you got all these ones like it's just like place your bets well voice no Voyager was a crypto exchange they weren't even a lender oh they were like they were they did that too yeah you're right so it was like you know place your bets which one of these is responsible and which one's not because the marketing all sounds the same the website the risk management the executives that they hire oh wear suits and ties and look very official so you have no idea yeah until something like this happens that's pretty rough it's a pretty rough existence um what happened in the block five story though we keep on reporting on this contagion every single week because again as soon as things goes to court it takes a long time to play out but at least one part of this story we are going to formally wrap up probably which is the blockify side of these things FTX and block 5 have reached a deal for up to but not at 240 million dollars so they are acquiring block five all of block five right like all of it for 200 up to 240 million dollars which also gives block fight a 400 million dollars revolving credit facility basically a loan to allow for liquidity for their users and so um uh this this uh this 240 million dollar valuation depends on startups on the unblockwise performance triggers so they need to like hit certain milestones and if they don't hit certain Milestones then that valuation goes down what these details are undisclosed but there's rumors that the lowest end of these of this thing is a 25 million dollar valuation and so here's a a statement out of or a quote from this blockworks article although Prince Zach Prince the CEO of block five did not disclose the lower end of the acquisition CNBC reported that the deal was pegged at 25 million dollars Prince denied cnbc's reporting which he dubbed unfounded which I mean it's part kind of par for the course for these like C5 banks that say like trying to preserve like uh and maybe it is maybe it's not we don't know but you know FDX is getting a great deal on this right they they are in the driver's seat they set the terms of the negotiation like Darth Vader's style coming in here and being like hey this is what we're going to do for you do you know what's great about this though David is in this blockify situation because there's gradients of how irresponsible or even responsible that C5 lenders actually were right so you have nexo which is still left standing they probably did an okay job as evidence we don't know all the details but as evidenced by the fact that they're still standing in their building FDX did a fine job managing risk Finance did a fine man job managing risk it seems uh Celsius on the other side did a terrible job managing risk the only one worse that we've seen so far is probably Voyager which was just handing out unsecured loans well okay through it was Capital with the worst yeah yeah of course yeah on the other side of things but they weren't they were like not accepting deposits directly from retail even though they were behind us no they were they were accepted by deposits from retail aggregators yeah retailers aggregators gay save money to three horse Capital again we said this in the last roll up three years Capital was the contagion yeah like that seven percent that you saw in Voyager with Trio's Capital that like whatever percent you saw in Celsius three hours well except Celsius was doing some other things they were like they were in staking assets they were like betting in these weird speculative D5 things they were doing they were off the you know doing I guess it was both capital and sales yes but blocked by okay they were kind of in the middle they did some things that were irresponsible I'm sure that they regret doing but in this case depositors funds are going to be safe FDX has bailed them out it's looking good if you have your funds in Block fi you should be able to get all of your money back they never had to pause anything so there's kind of gradients right we see like really bad case scenarios we see decent risk management coming out of this stronger than the other side and we see situations like block five which are kind of in the middle um they uh definitely failed but not completely this is the last maybe I hope this won't be the last time we hear about Celsius but what happened this week with Celsius David yeah so Celsius famously has this maker Dow Vault they have a bunch of wbtc inside them they pulled out a bunch of dye uh as the as of very recently they have fully paid off their entire debt so they no longer have debt in their uh in their vault is that a good so well it sounds like a good thing basically like my interpretation is they are waving the white flag and saying like we have had enough like we are out we are liquidating at whatever so they're selling all this we're selling and so halprest says it does indeed look like Celsius is prepared to sell about 500 million dollars worth of BTC that was uh tweeted out it was a couple hours ago from the time of recording and so like it's basically like a change of pace where Celsius previously was like aggro Leverage yield farming now they are being hyper conservative at like sub-optimal prices and so because of because of this like change in demeanor my opinion is that they and other people are saying like well they're kind of going to close up shop and this is what they're doing this that's just speculation but the idea is well the the change of like we're going we were going to try and have this business of Leverage yield farming but now we're just going to pay back all that possible and just like liquidate whatever assets we have it's like to me uh their way of just waving the white flag and so this is uh this is a tweet from like crypto sells uh uh that's Cel squeezing on vault repayment is comical when considering that this is likely a move in preparation for bankruptcy filing I think um cell is the Celsius token right correct and so they're talking about price action here it all begs the question of what in the world is the cell loyalty coin actually Worth right what is the Voyager loyalty coin that depositors are getting what is that worth in this world the truth is nobody actually knows it's not Equity whatever that whatever it is it's not Equity anyways that is all of the contagion one once again we'll probably be more things to talk about next week but at least some of these stories are coming to a close uh coming up next in the show we're going to burn through these because we took a really time a long time on the market section and contagion section like like I would imagine we would um but nfts on Facebook crazy that that's not like the biggest news of the week um Reddit also deploying nfts on polygon also crazy news uh there's crypto phone Wars to talk about there's people getting into the hardware game and also merge updates like actually big news uh but you know contagious if it bleeds it leads Ryan if it bleeds it leads so we're going to get to all of that news right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible Arboretum is an ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy and nfts some of the coolest new nft collections have chosen arbitrum as their home while D5 protocols continue to

download Ledger live if you have a ledger already you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the merge we have successfully merged sepulia the second of three test Nets has finally completed that has gone that went through a couple days ago and it was successful there were a few hiccups here and there but they were un not related to the merge and so the general consensus is that this is good news and we're not going whatever the hiccups were they were unrelated to actual merge progress uh so here here's terence.eath who I believe works at Prismatic yeah I'm pretty sure that's true and he says merge transition itself was a success 25 to 30 of the validators went online shortly after the merge the offline validators were due to wrong con configurations since then the the offline parties have updated their configurations and validators are up so like there are no client bugs and the hiccups will not delay the merge and so cool good news we are at 95 participation rate so that's like a 95 success rate which is pretty damn good uh the numbers that you don't want to see are 66 or below I'd say like anything above like 92 and a half percent ish feels pretty damn good 95 is pretty good 95 pretty good uh David what's the next one remind us so we've got these are dress rehearsals right we've got uh two down is it one one left one left the gorily test that the last test net and this is the one where like oh this one makes it real uh and so the state of the aftermath of the gorley test net whether it's positive or negative will become extremely indicative of the of the actual merge if it's a bad result then like we might kick the test the merge back one or two months if it's a good result like yo like late August early September uh we say it stop late August September I didn't say dates I said late August early September date range my friend uh anyways uh Wendy Gourley merch happens uh TBD on the actual date it has to be a date decided uh the date will probably be decided uh when's the next awkward deaths call a week from today uh we are live close we are live streaming this with the East stakers group oh we are yeah do not know that oh yeah when is that well Ryan in about seven days the all career death call will determine when the quarterly test net is they should listen to these Roll-Ups more closely yeah if it's not decided then it'll be decided at a later all quarter steps call but when the gorley test net does merge we will be live streaming it with the with the e-stakers group and a bunch of other people maybe we'll invite halpress on because good timing then um and that that's when we get to see let's definitely have help press back yeah let's do that I want to see if he's buying in yet yeah what's happening if he's still uh I got dinners not too long ago I got a bunch of alpha I haven't told you yet all right I want to hear that too after the show yeah we'll leave to a debrief David on the premium podcast feed guys uh let's let's talk about some news that went by the way we're totally gonna do that help for us Alpha League on them no we'll open that up to everyone um Facebook is testing ethereum and polygon nfts on its profile Facebook this is the company now called meta but Facebook is the platform with 2 billion users worldwide they're getting into nfts and no one noticed this week right what's happening here well so I mean we already reported on the Instagram integration of nfts and it's more like more or less the same thing but for Facebook uh so users will have a digital collectible tab on their Facebook profiles where they can showcase their nfts and users will be able to connect their wallets to their Facebook profiles and they'll be able to turn their nfts into Facebook posts which can be reacted to liked on commented on it's basically just like kind of basic NFC integration into Facebook um so like that's awesome it's like Facebook you can buy an nft for your mom right yeah but the thing is like this is like who's left on Facebook is like our crazy aunts and parents and stuff uh what's last time I just logged into Facebook oh uh forever ago Dude uh actually I have heavy Instagram though yeah I'm pretty heavy on Instagram um don't follow me please don't follow me I deny every single request not you but listeners now you've got me curious yeah no you can follow me I'll get a bunch of Instagram follow requests and I delete every single one so don't try it nfts on Facebook though that's a big deal man yeah uh I mean is it though because like are now all of our aunts are going to reach out to us and be like son can you help me set up my crypto wallet so I can share these nfts dude why are you making fun of that I'm so happy to help all of my uh aunts and uncles and everyone who wants to good luck I will help you good luck good luck with that let me know how that goes um don't follow David on Instagram don't follow don't follow me on Instagram crypto phone Wars or did you see that this week oh by the way we forgot to look at this these are what the nfts for those looking on Facebook this is what they're going to look like in Facebook see they're just normal pictures but they just have like the digital collectible hexagon check mark yes the only thing hey these aren't just jpegs okay this is property rights verified jpegs you know what it's cooking up uh heating up though is the crypto phone Wars okay Solana just released a uh Flagship Android phone okay I think they bought this company it's called um Sega the thesis here from Anatoly one the founder of Solana almost 7 billion people use smartphones around the world and more than 100 million people hold digital crypto assets both of these will continue to grow so Solana should own its own in-house phone company in order to deploy this um so far David sales not looking too good you'd actually see this on chain um sales pre-sales have been about 2.5 000 K pre-orders which kind of begs the question of like does a blockchain really need to have its own phone I know and it totally has a history of like Qualcomm he's very close to this so maybe he feels differently but I gotta tell you this would feel really weird if the ethereum foundation was like and now we have a phone we bought some like Android uh you know startup company it feels very strange if you I'm not going to say it I'm going to say it it feels a little EOS David too remember that they were off buying like voice voice yeah and you know social networks and all these things because they didn't know what else to do with their capital and they had so much of it um maybe there's a justification for this maybe I'm wrong I gotta be honest though I don't really get it it seems like a massive distraction to a blockchain network so the answer here is what is the unique properties of the hardware of the Solana phone versus a normal phone like because that's the only reason why you would get into the hardware game the hardware game yeah Solana if ethereum blockchains these things are software so you want software in your phone what is the different like we can have a secure Enclave to have like verifiably like basically a built-in Hardware wallet in your phone which is like separated and compartmentalized from the rest of the phone that's the only like Hardware thing I can really think of that would be like different for that would enable like a blockchain phone other than that it's only software it's blockchain phones have been tried no they've never done well they've never done well they've never done now this is a different strategy it's interesting it's the same week that's why we call it the wars because there's these size to this so polygon is taking a different approach to the the mobile phone Wars here's what he says Mass adoption of web3 will happen on mobile polygon is prepared for it our strategy is not to make our own devices interesting contrast instead we will integrate with existing manufacturers today we are proud to announce our first major integration this is the HTC Desire which is going to be a metaverse phone with ethereum M and polygon support so the difference in strategy here is they are not getting into the hardware game they're not acquiring anything they're partnering with existing uh phone manufacturers and phone Builders and to me this makes a bit more sense uh but I guess we'll have to see these strategies play out and you know it could be proven wrong one Ryan one does not just make a phone it's just not just not what you do yeah it's a Boromir meme let's not just make a phone yeah that's exactly right like that's hard that's an extremely saturated Market you're going up against like HTC you're going up against Apple like you don't you don't have a competitive Advantage just because you also have a blockchain ecosystem that blockchain ecosystem does nothing for you so it makes sense to like what do polygon should do what polygon does best which is build software and they should partner with somebody that does Hardware really really good like HTC so a few more details uh HTC pre-loaded it's 4.6 inch phone with applications from its metaverse arm viviverse offering users what is called a rich metaverse experience without a VR headset with viviverse apps and VV wallets built into phone users can create virtual avatars manage crypto assets including non-fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies on ethereum and polygon the company said in a press release that seems to make much more common sense to me hey uh bankless Nation are David and I missing something tell us I mean it's a good idea I am not a hardware expert I have built a computer before I know something look YouTube commenters were will tell us wrong David even if we're right we'll still say we're wrong the elf is always in the YouTube comments isn't it but talk about this this is uh you know a quick thing but I think we're talking about immutable with a Fiat off-ramp what's this right okay so immutable tweets out major update each off ramp is now available to any developer building on an immutable x-power platform developers can enable their users to sell layer to Ether and have their proceeds deposited directly into their bank account uh okay so you know how we talked about uh Juno going from your checking account straight to a layer two this is the opposite so you if you have ether on immutable you can go from immutable to your bank account why would you want this well imagine you're somebody who does not care about crypto but you do have this crypto game that you really want to play I can't imagine that I can't get in that headspace sir but go on and you keep on playing this crypto game and you've acquire a bunch of assets and you're like oh these assets that I've acquired are like I can get like 200 into my bank account now you can with the separate fingers go from the gaming assets that you just acquired sell them on some Marketplace which immutable already has built that's already done turn that into Layer Two ether and then send that money straight into your bank account so that is a user acquisition strategy it's an integration strategy it's an onboarding strategy and it's also a trojan horse Ryan for a bankless life because first you come in you make buy you play a bunch of games make a bunch of assets sell a bunch of put your money back in the bank account and then you're like well wait a second but what about all that D5 stuff and then all of a sudden you're a bankless person uh this this um crypto thing becomes really real when people start earning money in it right so like you're earning these uh crazy expensive gaming items and then you can convert that to go pay your your rent pay your mortgage buy something that's when all of this becomes real if Facebook wasn't enough Reddit 400 000 over 400 thousand monthly active users is launching an nft Marketplace on polygon they're using polygon for that pretty big deal to me they're starting very small David though they're starting with one nft Community a small set of avatars but I don't know if you've ever seen this in Reddit there's the ability to create your own avatar and so they are going to right now this is not fully nft enabled but it's going to be such that you can select a a collectible that is an nft and set that as your avatars they're going to be selling these nfts as well and they're going to be uh partnering with artists a 50 50 Revenue split on transaction sales so anytime a piece of art is sold on openc then the artist gets 50 of the transaction sales on that so kind of a unique new model that Reddit is now experimenting and I'm curious to see where this goes that is kind of the NFC adoption that we're really looking for rather than like NFC artists going straight to the blockchain straight to some like you know front end they're just going to more uh you know obfuscated platforms uh abstracted platforms like Reddit and just like ultimately things settle down back to the blockchain but so much of the blockchain is hidden the way it should be anyways in the first place like if you think the future of nfts are people like going to openc and buying nfts that's not the future of nfts it's like aggregators like Reddit who use poly polygon and like nft minting in the back end and then just display the thing on the front end uh yeah you can buy these things with the credit cards like 25 in a credit card done I don't even know you're on a blockchain 100 so that is just user acquisition right then and there uh talk to me about more nft stuff in the mood Borough in the moon Birds world is Moon Birds mooning again is that a thing yeah so apparently the moon bird floor went up uh and so somebody asked why and somebody responded with a a picture of a trademark a trademark filing system so there's a lot of text here so I I read what what they were filing a trademark for it's called Maroon bird Ravens it's basically an online nft Marketplace the issuance of possible of currency so like maybe like a moon bird erc20 airdrop uh there's also online Art Gallery services that are part of this like spec for their trademark they want to create a virtual environment in the name of an online community for registered users to collaborate share and comment on digital media and also with social networking services so moonbirds filed a patent called moonbird Ravens that does all of these things so basically they're making a metaverse so incoming Moon Birds token and moon bird metaverse cool there you go Kevin Rose has been busy we'll have to bring them back and see what he's up to also do you remember that axi story The Bridge hack what happened there some details broke about what actually happened it's kind of a crazy story yeah so no one really knew how the uh Bridge got exploited we just knew that it did get exploited uh apparently we found out and so one of the axi people that was in charge of like running the the bridge nodes uh applied for a job that involved him downloading a PDF and so that PDF had you know corrupted code in it in that corrode and so this guy was specifically targeted by the Lazarus Group by the way the Lazarus group is that North Korean hacking group so like this this uh this axi engineer was targeted by North Korea from applying to an external job right explain to an external job and this job application like had him Download a pdf and that PDF had corrupted code in it weird code magic that uh that was able to expose the private keys to the validator and allowed for North Korea to drain the axi infinity Bridge right I knew that a docx file could have bad like malicious code in it I did not know that a PDF could have malicious code in it that is news to me what file format is safe are there any safety files safe David jpegs all your nfts and jpegs are still safe 100 gifts are safe beyond that I can't tell you stop using the internet sir that's what you have to do I it's serious though I mean this is a 540 million dollar hack and um an individual being targeted in this way is um it's pretty sophisticated attack it still kind of boggles my mind I mean people in crypto have to be very careful right and anyways speaking of being careful and how crypto people need to do more of that uh uprise again a crypto Banks or crypto investment fund I don't even know but some entity called uprise Lost 99 of clients funds you know did you know what it was for Ryan by shorting Luna during the price crash and so what did they do they went uh they shorted Luna at thirty dollars with 100x leverage and then Luna hit 32 dollars before going to zero and they got liquidated this is the lesson in fractals uh where like if you take 100x leverage your time frame goes from long to extremely short and so it doesn't matter if you are in a like a 99.99 downtrend if you take 100x leverage you're taking a micro slice of that price chart and that thing could go up like a ridiculous amount so like what was Luna at the height it was something like I don't know like 250 if it goes from 250 dollars down to thirty dollars that's like down like 85 90 if it goes up three dollars that's up 10 and if you take 100x leverage you get liquidated at that level that is ridiculous imagine losing your entire business by shorting Luna with a 100x leverage so dumb it's so dumb it's it's embarrassingly stupid this is um uh uprise took custody crypto assets from customers and traded them in cryptocurrency Futures market and this is what they were doing with it they they say that they have an AI enabled trading technology that's supposed to mean yeah AI enablement with leverage crypto trading wow and you're gonna go short Luna in this type of a market it's just you know some of the mistakes that were made made by so-called professionals this cycle are completely embarrassing like I it's hard for me to wrap my head around it honestly it's been the most surprising thing about this damn downturn is how dumb the so-called professionals have been not all of them but enough of them where you're like what like is this your first time in crypto do you know nothing you're not a professional you're just taking leverage I guess I mean maybe it's just the excess of greed that like because some of these are smart people I actually don't I fundamentally don't understand how these mistakes were made unless you use some explanation of like you know kind of greed and ego it's uh it's it's gonna be something we're we'll study in the weeks to come in the months to come gotta touch this quickly too um recently last week the EU finalized as a new crypto legislation I'm going to read you some key points from a thread put together from uh the policy leader at Ledger which of course Ledger the hardware wallet there based in France so they've been tracking this thing closely and the tldr of this legislation is called Micah it doubles down on the failed notion of leading in regulation this is Steph who's saying this from uh Ledger rather than prioritizing Innovation but it could have been worse so it fails in a lot of ways it doesn't prioritize Innovation it prioritizes regulation but also David it could have been worse okay here are some of the things that were good and some of the things that were bad on nfts it was good they were fully out of scope of this round of Regulation so that's a good thing so is D5 another good thing but Parliament failed to ban proof-of-work blockchains and assets directly while they while they didn't ban it directly they snuck in a potential back door to ban it later so within two years the commission must report on mandatory minimum sustainability standards for consensus mechanisms so leaving the door open to completely ban proof of where work which is not awesome also stable coin regulation was particularly heavy-handed and requires a physical presence in the EU not completely clear what that means but I wonder if if this means in some way if you are issuing a stable coin in the EU you actually have to be jurisdictionally located in the EU so there's some complications around that so all in all a big step it's not done yet there's going to be a second level of legislation some review causes some more agency reports and I know those crypto companies that are based in in Europe will continue fighting for this so not great could have been worse though I guess that's what we should expect from legislators and Regulators at this stage in the game also going to be one of those things that we continually report on going into the future uh something actually really cool pivoting here uh really cool release out of the layer two Aztec Network asset connect finally got launched on mainnet for those that don't know Aztec connect it's kind of like a private VPN for your layer one D5 stuff so you go to the asset connect Layer Two you put your money there and then via that layer too that layer two will interact and engage with layer 1 D5 apps on your behalf in like this privacy wrapper uh so it's like when you're on the Aztec layer 2 you get to go do stuff in D5 but you still exist on the layer 2 and it's private and they use complicated cryptography magic stuff to make that happen uh basically what it what gets to happen is that you get to do confidential defy staking Vault entry lending and swaps all private you get significant gas cost reductions because there's this beautiful symbiosis between privacy and scalability and you also get to have a private treasury management so like Dows get to manage their treasuries without like disclosing what they're doing you could also do like private nft purchases and private trading and all that stuff and so that's pretty cool that is a release you can go and play around with that and Aztec has not released a token so maybe you would want to go play around with that do you remember last Market cycle we're talking about privacy tokens and zcash and Monero and all of these things right is this essentially embedding that as an app into ethereum so I've always said like privacy is an app not an asset I don't understand privacy tokens I I do understand privacy apps that makes much more sense this is really cool and I think it's really bullish for privacy and and hopefully um this uh you know this continues to pick up steam David we got some bankers that are leaving their Banks and going into crypto uh what What's this and do you think this is going to be a trend yeah a quick headline three execs leave JP Morgan this week to join crypto firms so the brain drain out of tradfi and into defy uh continues so Bankers going bankless what we love to see if you are a banker and you want a job in crypto and come on over to the bankless jobs board all right and get a job in crypto even if you're not a banker even if uh you have no Financial skills there's lots of things that are required you can go take a look at the bankless job boards I'm going to read a few out for you right now the first is from steak fish a smart contract software engineer a back-end full stack software engineer as well blockchain marketer from steak fish it's not technical stake fish front-end software engineer devops engineer steak fish trying to hire everybody right now a lion style uh Dow wants a CTO a software engineer a senior software we're an engineer and an executive assistant non-technical water space wants a solidity

go let's go back over let's go let's go back up senior mobile engineer iOS uniswap Labs oh that is some Alpha that's an alpha swap what do you what do you bringing what are you up to guys of course you can find all of this David and I will remind you every single roll up but you can find out for yourself on bankless.palette.com jobs make sure you add your email address so you get these uh to you in your inbox every day David we got some hot stuff next including questions from the nation as usual some hot takes make sure you like And subscribe if you are enjoying this roll up we will be right back but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible the layer 2 era is upon us ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer 2 Bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life a cross is the fastest cheapest and most secure cross train bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across his bridges are powered by uma's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across V2 has just launched their new version focuses on higher Capital efficiency layer 2 to layer 2 transfers and a brand new chain with polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees you can be a part of a cross's story by joining their Discord and using a cross for all of your layer 2 transferring needs so go to across.to to quickly and securely Bridge your assets between ethereum optimism polygon arbitrum or Boba networks the brave browser is the user first browser for the web 3 internet with over 60 million monthly active users and inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet the secure multi-train crypto wallet built right into the browser web3 is freedom from Big Tech and Wall Street more control and better privacy but there's a weak point in web 3 your crypto wall and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed but the brave wallet is different no extensions are required which gives Brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets Brave wall is your secure passport for the possibilities of web free and supports multiple chains including ethereum and Solana you can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp and of course you can store send and swap your crypto assets manage your main FTS and connect to other wallets and defy apps so whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned Pro it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet Download Brave at brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started alright guys we are back time for the questions from the nation of course we tweet this out every week you can ask your question by replying to the Tweet follow at banklesshq uh hi David and Ryan this is from claudia.ed I would like to ask about a post merge situation if I understand it correctly those who stake on the merge should take apart at transaction fees of transaction fees but which part of the fees will it be base fee or tips David you got the answer for this one yeah so basically the all transaction fees when you pay on ethereum are split into two parts the base fee and the tip the base fee uh fluctuates with a percentage of these things fluctuates but there seems to be an equilibrium about 90 to 10 base fee to tip so 90 of that transaction fee goes to the base fee 10 goes to the tip the base fee is burnt that is the eip1559 burn uh so the majority of ether is burnt that is like the the stock buyback that's the ultrasound in ultrasound money so everyone gets that if you hold e if you hold if you hold eth you gain exposure to that burn only if you stake eath do you get that extra 10 tips uh and you can you you can see it in the name it is a tip that is paid to stakers to prioritize their transaction over other transactions so like the base fee is is where where transactions used to be before eip1559 it used to be only tips and we just called that the gas fee now the gas fees are both the base fee burn and now the tip and so the tip has been reduced down to 10 and that goes directly to validators and the more you tip the fat the higher in the queue that you get and so all validators get that 10 tip um and just a reminder for other staking Revenue sources so one is definitely that tip portion that's a transaction fee portion another is of course block rewards that a Staker receives and a third source of Revenue is maximum extractable value Mev which you also receive as a Staker and a validator so three Revenue sources there um David here's another question from discovercrypto.eath I know how valuable ltus are to the eth ecosystem once complete data sharp sharding happens on ethereum way down the line and transactions are fast and cheap on L1 what use will we have for things like optimism and arbitrum David what you got okay so the asker Discover crypto.e thank you for the question the way that you're phrasing this is that and transactions are fast and cheap on the layer one they're going to be with data sharding they're going to be faster and cheaper but they will not necessarily be super fast and super cheap so like it doesn't really matter what the state of transactions are on the layer one that layer twos will always be orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than whatever the layer one is think of like layer twos as like an exponent of scale and so like if the the layer one is X then the the layer twos are like to the power of two or to the power of three and so even if we do like a 2X a 3X of the layer one throughput like it doesn't matter because that 2x turns into 2x squared with layer twos I don't know if it were following the math analogy but I think it makes sense to me it doesn't matter how fast we can get transactions and how cheap we can get transactions on the layer one layer twos will always be an exponentially increased order of magnitude faster and cheaper than whatever the layer one is and also like Larry while the layer one will get faster and will have more Total Space I don't think it'll necessarily get cheaper and so it'll we will always need layer twos to have if we ever want zero fee transactions it's going to be on layer twos and layer threes uh and then layer one is can it be kind of expensive probably all the time well it will have more total data it'll probably be pretty expensive and it'll probably be prohibitably expensive for most people yeah so to double down on that and be super explicit transaction fees on layer one and probably never going down yeah that's probably that's not part of ethereum's scalability strategy it is scaling on Layer Two and this is why we've encouraged people to start investigating these layer twos like arbitrum optimism immutable and others because that's going to be your crypto home that's where you go bankless is on these layer twos migrate leave from layer one we put out a couple of episodes about this the great layer 2 migration that you can check if you uh want to learn a bit more about this but I don't think transaction fees are going to go down long term on mainnet so we should all be migrating to layer twos uh David let's let's do some hot takes of the week here's a first one from Leighton what's he saying here Leighton Cusack the guy that created all the poolies let me know and love he says the only lenders Celsius has paid back Ave makerdale compound any continues smart contracts have a higher liquidation preference than any paper agreement D5 protects you from Celsius what he's saying here is that the agreements the the parameters for your loans in defy are steeper they're steeper if they're Ave if they're maker down if they're compound and this is the cost of decentralization you pay higher liquidation penalties you have to post higher collateral bonds and so what he's saying is this the automation of defy and the smart contract nature of defy requires higher level of security therefore higher level of retail protections Ryan yeah about this is remember you said markets go bad it's all arbitrated in court systems right well not the case with D5 as we made the point earlier right so um Celsius can't get out of these collateralized loans right in maker and compound in Ave they just can't because it's written in code and all of their collateral will be um will be completely dissolved and so they have to pay them back and so it puts if you're in D5 puts you at the top of the stack in terms of liquidation preferences and that's a great place to be I think once again I can't say enough David that one of the big outcomes of this whole crypto meltdown that we've seen recently is just like seeing how well D5 performed right right especially relative to um C5 like it held up strong and I think that is incredibly bullish and people will realize that on the other side of this bear Market that hey at the end of the day it was the smart contracts that um you know saved us and the centralized lending providers did not and look at how well they held up for all of the the risk in the smart contract risk and all of these other things um they were the ones that actually Preserve served retail Capital investor Capital during the crypto meltdown so that's a that's a bullish thing David what's this take from vitalik I I had to screenshot this tweet because it was actually deleted by Rudy Giuliani uh so rude this is a vitalika's uh retweeting a Rudy Giuliani tweet uh and vitalik says claim the crypto space is weird and dumb and we should go back to mainstream institutions which are ruled by adults and then reality and this is where he was retreating the really trading on any tweet Rudy Gionee Rudy Giuliani tweets great products at reasonable Pro reasonable prices use code Rudy for additional savings and we are looking at a picture of new new sandals but we have some like CR like like bad terrible Croc knockoff looking sandals regular price 79.98 actual price 49.98 at mypillow.com promo code Rudy with Like a Star Spangled Banner like fireworks Fourth of July savings Rudy Giuliani is tweeting out a discount code to some knockoff looking sandals this is insane yes David these are the the adults ruling our political system right now uh and uh yeah I guess I guess I'm fine with all the crypto weirdness in this context okay here's a tweet from Vance Spencer we we don't need any new narratives we are like point one percent of the way through the current narratives we do need the grifters and low effort projects to capitulate once a wave of those announcements hit we are close anyway how old are you son I like the way this ends I don't know why it ends that way but here's this point once a wave of those announcements hit we are close David have you just seen a wave of those announcements that's why it's kind of feeling like we're close and then Vance's other point is like hey let's get the whole like um self Sovereign money thing use case down like there's still a lot to do on that let's get the whole bankless D5 money system down let's get it nfts in the metaverse to be true property rights for things that matter and people will use in their everyday life like we have enough narratives in crypto to blow this thing up to like 100 billion dollars a hundred trillion dollars in total addressable Market size and so like we're just a fraction of the way there right I think it's a great Point remember how we were talking about at the beginning of the episode how like I lost this like wire transfer and like this the ux UI of uh uscc transfers on ethereum it's just like orders of magnitude like that's the whole one percent of the way when we stop doing wire transfers then we can actually get somewhere like the whole Paradigm of instant and permissionless liquidity in uniswap still underappreciated like the Boomer defy and this is why I think he ended it on like how old are you son Boomer D5 like D5 1.0 like that stuff is still crazy to most of the world like that stuff is still brand new paradigms and so van Spencer is like yo guys like I know crypto moves really fast recycle from narrative to narrative to narrative but remember like the first narratives are also still really good this might be why he's bullish on some of the D5 Blue Chips as he told us uh last time David some advice for what to do during a bear Market from NATO do you want to read these out yeah he says top three things to do during a bear Market one meet people that stick around to learn about the technology to gain conviction three build something you're passionate about man I could have written this tweet this is a great thing this is a great tweet that's why we included it in the roll-up uh absolutely great advice from Nader there all right David what are you bullish about this week man I'm pretty bullish on ethcc which is happening in two weeks so a week from a week from tomorrow we flying out to France uh ECC I can't believe it's been one year as in it's only been one year but ECC was like the first conference I went to when conferences in 2021 conference season really started uh and so it's also the last for a while right yeah yeah it is the last for a while and so it was the first post covid conference it was the conference I got my first covet at uh and um but like now everyone now covet's largely over everyone's going back uh it's like Stony is going to be there there's going to be a rave maker Dow is going to throw their difinity so many like so many good talks a lot of the things that were talked about at ECC last year became kind of like the the cultural meta that was discussed in the next year nfts were big also non-financial use cases of the blockchain were a very big thing vitalik spawned that off you know what that turned into Ryan uh Soul bound nfts uh and so like you know like six months eight months later that turned into a big big like part of the the meme the cultural meme at the time uh so I'm just gonna go here and see what what are people focused on next uh and so I remember it's a pretty smart group too super smart IQ conference right yeah should I intimidate people though uh I mean so tickets are already sold out I'm pretty sure but so many people are going anyways uh for all the peripheral events and this is pretty common for ECC so like if you're around or just want to go to Paris you can go to ECC uh try and bum a ticket off of someone but uh if you can't just go to all the peripheral events because that's what that's what I'll be doing there's like a ton of peripheral parties but also like actual like side conferences and side talks uh so I'm going to be doing some sort of like content there whether it's like in-person interviews or just writing about it IDK um but yeah I'm bullish on ECC great conference looking forward to going back that's awesome man it's their fifth these are conference oh geez HTC by the way stands for ethereum Community Conference oh cool yeah I feel like I knew that and then I forgot it and right thanks for dragging my memory it's awesome man all right Ryan what are you bullish on uh I'm not gonna say mine because you made fun of it okay David I'm gonna say a different one uh mine originally was uh I'm bullish about the future guys and I had this thing where like optimism is you know um so important in how Builders build for optimism I was inspired by Josh Rosenthal when we were going over this David laughed out loud when he heard I was bullish on the future so I'm not gonna say that but I will tell you I am bullish on nfts David oh yeah like tell me what's going on the future of nfts I'll say that the stuff that's going on with like Reddit and polygon is the um it's incredible how quickly the um narrative and sentiment has shifted on nfts now everyone's like I guess the popular nerd not everyone not not people who are deep in crypto like nfts were a scam they're only jpegs we're like back to that again and we just swung so far to the other engine uh into the pendulum you know a lot of nfts will fail many will go down 99 percent in value but there will be a new generation of these nft property rights these ERC 721s and we'll have a Resurgence the next um bull market and look for these signs when you see like the social media companies of the world continuing to build continuing to add into these things you can see it start to happen so the foundation being laid so I'm bullish on nfts I'm also bullish in the future yeah I bet you are the problem with being bullish on nfts is that like it's hard to you can be bullish on nfts as a sector but it's hard to like inject that into like I'm bullish on this one particular nft you know what that makes me bullish online but block space because you always people rotate through nfts all the time but there's only one block space well they're all Layer Two block spaces but it all collapses down to ethereum block space Chris is the commodity of the crypto age of the next couple of decades for sure you know what's a good proxy for Block space Ryan I do it's that you can it's that yeah David I like your plant by the way that's it first of all they can't see it but I'll bring it in here here we go yeah what is it does it have a name it's interesting it's a dracina naganera here it is what's special about this plant uh it's easy to keep alive when I go travel away it looks great it's got some purple Hues it's got some green really impressed I'm looking forward to seeing your uh Menagerie grow behind you who's slowly turns into a oh this is this is this is not the plant Corner this is strictly the studio Corner okay so since we're uh well a few plants but mainly Studio since we're on the topics of things that we're bullish on uh I think I don't know if I've told you this I told you I was going to do it I don't know I've told you I've done it but I bought ten thousand dollars worth of studio equipment yesterday Ryan oh my god wow so we're doing this huh oh yeah we're doing it I think the studio is happening it's official and look guys we're doing this during the bear Market that's how much we believe it's how much we believe uh David you want to get to the meme of the week meme of the week let's do it okay this is a picture out of Kobe and it's one of these ones that progresses and it starts with q1 2021 and this is Jerome Powell saying quantitative quantitative easing won't cause inflation and then we go into Q2 2021 and okay now we're you know some inflation but it's transitory now we're at Q3 2021 okay High inflation but we're peaking Q4 2021 okay inflation might not be transitory but job market wage growth very strong and then q1 1 2022 need to hike aggressively to curb inflation but no worries economy very strong in soft planning possible Q2 2022 we are here by the way Q2 of 2022 negative growth in q1 but no recession risk Q3 2022 so this is now predicting the Future Okay recession coming but you won't lose your home Q4 2022 okay you might lose your home but you won't starve to death q1 2023 you may die but you'll go to heaven this is an explicit part of the agenda for the podcast that we're about to go record with Lynn Alden uh oh God in 10 minutes or in one hour and 10 minutes let me check our schedule 10 minutes man we gotta we gotta oh 10 minutes okay in 10 minutes we are literally gonna go asking Alden about this question that podcast is coming out um this coming Monday or yes Monday and now we're actually so we're not in Q2 David you know we transferred July is Q3 so we're at this phase where it's okay recession coming but you will not lose your home and then the next phase is okay maybe we'll lose your own but you won't starve to death and then you actually die that's the question we have for Lynn Alden are we all gonna die are we going to be okay is macro gonna be fine bearish or bullish well like does this guy have any idea what he's doing are the central banks driving us completely off a cliff uh anyway stay tuned for the macro content for bankless as always gotta end with none of this has been Financial advice you might die you keep my tie you you definitely lose what you put in you get dysentery on the journey but we're right there with you and of course crypto is not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot if we all die we all die together
