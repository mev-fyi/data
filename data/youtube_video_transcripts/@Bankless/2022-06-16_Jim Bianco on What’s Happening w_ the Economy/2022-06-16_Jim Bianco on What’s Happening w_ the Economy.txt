so jim when we zoom out and we look at everything holistically what the hell is happening well first of all real quick warren buffett has a great line for that when the tide goes out we're going to find out who's swimming naked and what happened is the tide went out we found out we're in a nudist colony because there's a lot of naked people out there right now there's three letters that we would like to use when explaining the economy dgt demographics globalization and technology for the last 30 or 40 years inflation has been down inflation has been low and we say it's because of demographics aging globalization and then we went on to say and therefore inflation will be a non-issue forever well post covid inflation is becoming a problem we structured the entire economy on the assumption that we were never going to see inflation like we saw in the 1970s again inflation breeds more volatility if that is the case then we're going to see lower asset prices we're going to see much more volatile asset prices
