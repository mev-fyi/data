all right welcome everyone to episode 13 unlucky but also lucky episode of state of the nation really excited to be here david how are you doing today man pretty good pretty good it uh you know there was a lot of fun times happening in the in the d5 world and so you know those we had to like scale back how much fun we were having and that seems like what happened in the last yeah i loved your tweet about that i hope we get into that about the uh the nightclub so all right we're gonna we're gonna get there guys so uh just for folks who are with us for the first time or for it's your handful of first times here here's what we do we talk about what's happening in the bankless nation so that's d5 that's crypto and we relate it to the big picture themes that we speak about on the bankwoods podcast and talk about on the bankless newsletter and we hope to drop some insights and action items and most shows we have a special guest as well and this is no exception so we brought on anthony sassiano to talk a little bit about everything that is happening in the defy space so that's sushi we're going to cover we're going to cover uh git coin grants we're going to cover some other things as well i'm really excited to have anthony on this comes out every tuesday so you can watch it live some of you are watching this live on the bankless youtube channel tuesdays at 10 a.m eastern time you can also catch it on our podcast stream the very next day on wednesday so that's where we release it on youtube and also on the podcast just a couple of announcements david uh that podcast episode that we just did with stani from avi like what did you think about that man i've like that was like fire for me i mean stani is a legit crypto native he's the type of dude that's not going to exit scam his sushi right [Laughter] no that's what do you think about that i think as like a case study for how founders in this world are different that episode will stand the test of time uh i i think that there's gonna be a lot of people that are interested in building something over the next two years three years five years in ethereum and i think they're going to listen to that episode to kind of like get a gist for uh what vance said in in his podcast like are you about that life and as danny as a guy who is about that life and that life being building a crypto economic protocol uh is it he's just an exemplar model for it so fantastic episode absolutely so that came out uh yesterday that came out on monday so make sure you get caught up on that episode as well it's a long one people criticize their episodes because they're getting a little bit longer data they're only getting longer i don't know can't stop won't stop it's good content right i mean i enjoy them all right well as long as we're enjoying it david that's good that's all we need all right we're also doing an ama on thursday with matt finestone from loop rings so if you're curious about uh later too and gas these loop ring is a fantastic solution for that so we're going to ask him all about how ethereum scales i hope that's an opportunity for the bankless community to come in with their questions and ask matt anything we've also got the the regular program going on the bankless newsletter awesome tactic coming out today on how to get yield but in a in a safer way so make sure you're tuned in to bankless.substance dot com for the newsletter david um before we get into the main show i'm gonna ask you the question we ask at every state of the nation and that's this what is the state of the nation this week my friend the state of the nation is sobering uh in any mania or any like just tulip tulip fascination any any peak there's this attitude that like the old laws don't apply we're in this new paradigm and that's like a top signal right like and so this this yield farming craze the the liquidity mining the the whole like we found a new way to bootstrap a community it's gonna be great and this is just gonna be the thing that carries us off into success like that's what we thought about without the icos too right and so this whole sushi drama was a very sobering reality check where we now realize that no like human nature still applies like we didn't just recreate the fundamental laws of the universe we are still grounded by the laws of economics so we're we're sobering up so a wise a wise man on twitter said something about like it's like a nightclub when the lights flash on and like everyone's like sweaty and gross and you look around you're like oh my god what just happened what were we doing yeah two a.m in the nightclub people were sloppy people were gross yeah and then the lights turned on there's just sweat everywhere and like oh you still have to get home somehow oh yeah i'm getting that i'm getting that visual all right awesome so that's what we're going to talk about so state of the nation is uh sobering this week and before we get anthony on before we dive into everything that's been going on with sushi and what that actually means let's talk about our sponsors so the first i want to tell you about is unstoppable domains your eth address like we've talked about many times on the show is a bank account it's a bankless bank account a bank account essentially for internet natives but one big problem is it doesn't have a human human readable name so if i try to send david some eth to his ethereum address i have to plug in something like 0x e3ba blah blah blah we need domain names that are human readable that we can plug in and wrap our eth addresses in how about a dot crypto domain name you can get that at unstoppabledomains.com they allow you to search for your blockchain domain name and easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs they also allow you to manage existing domains so if you have a dot eth ens domain you can plug that into the unstoppable domains.com manager and actually manage what address it routes to it gives you some pretty cool options for also paying for the dot eth domain so websites have.com they have.org they have the domain name stuff figured out already the crypto space needs to figure that out too and unstoppable domains is helping go pick up a domain name for your bankless bank account at unstoppable unstoppabledomains.com and register a domain now all right so for those of you guys that went through the 2017 bull market it was characterized by like you waking up well at least for me i rolled off off my bed pulled out my phone and refreshed refreshed my block folio well now lately i am going to zapper and the reason why i like zapper is because zapper actually looks at my wallets on ethereum right so blockfolio doesn't block foliar just like record reports what you input it into it so if you ever make a trade on uniswap you got to pull out your block folio and make it make it make an edit zapper doesn't do that because zapper uses actual real data from your actual input inputted ethereum wallets to give you a portfolio report of where all your money is so not just the assets that you hold in your wallet but also the liquidity that you've provided to uniswap to balancer they even update it for the latest yield farm any sort of debt that you have any sort of interest that you're accruing it's got it all it's got it all because it goes right for the data and so really fantastic team at zapper and you can also make transactions through the zapper portal it's not just a place to view your portfolio but you can actually interact with defy at the zapper.fi website they also have a fantastic tax plug-in right so if you are just trying to get your taxes done you can press the tax button and it generates a tax report so you can pay your taxes so really a one-stop shop for everything that was messy in the last bull run i'm really excited about this bull run largely because zapper is going to make this watching this bull run go a lot easier so check them out at zapper.fi and you can plug in your ethereum wallets and get that portfolio report so check them out all right so david let's bring on our special guest this is anthony anthony it is so awesome to have you on man are you there we're um we're talking about sobriety in today's state of the nation so we found the most ethereal sober guest we could we know you are you're always sober my friend always have some good insights how's it going anthony hey guys thanks for having me on so yes i think i'm with you it's it's been very sobering over the past few days right um we went from the high of four hundred and eighty dollars on each to the uh to a low of like three hundred and ten dollars or something uh we kind of like erased all the gains we had made over like a month's time and yeah it wasn't it wasn't fun um but in hindsight seeing all these crazy gains these you know ten thousand percent apy on these kind of food ponzies or food games or like all these stuff happening you kind of you look and you're like i should have seen that as a top yeah yeah the only thing was missing where it was like the uber guy asking about like um you know where he could farm yams or something like that that was the only top signal is okay but like does this mean uh bull market canceled anthony like you wrote something really good in the daily quay this morning about that what do you think no i i actually think we're still on track i think we're we're fine i don't think this is going to lead to another kind of two-year bear market or anything like that um i think that it's just a way to reset the the market right people were getting over leveraged people getting too greedy they were throwing money at as i said random things like food coins and things like that um so i think we needed this we needed a reset we needed a kind of mini deleveraging event uh yeah yes we probably followed the the kind of stock market as well in some way but yeah i don't think this is going to put us into another crypto bear market that's just not what i'm saying okay well let's talk about some of the greed and some of the deleveraging here um maybe maybe we could just start with sushi because that's kind of our main uh i guess our main course for for today's state of the nation um anthony i think it would be super helpful because all this stuff happens quickly you know some people are like they were on vacation last week or you know they just haven't haven't been looking at defy every day but like sushi is what i don't know it's like a week and a half old not even so if people miss that can you talk about like what sushi is and kind of get us up to speed on some of the main events that have gone on and why this is relevant and worth talking about now yeah yeah i mean first of all i think i'm still recovering from a bit of food poisoning from some bad sushi over the weekend but yeah you're right is that a metaphor is that real definitely a metaphor man um but yeah so basically i used to said it ryan it's about a week and a half old uh basically what it is is it's kind of like a clone of uni swap but with a with a token uh that claims to be community governed um so this kind of trend of community government platforms has exploded since the yfi launch uh the native token of the urn protocol um and you know everyone's trying to jump on this train and say okay we're like a fair launch protocol you can come here you can farm our token and the community will govern everything um so obviously sushi swap uh took advantage of this they managed to get over one billion dollars worth of um tbl in their in their protocol uh the funny thing is though is that the tbr was actually just uni swap liquidity provider tokens so their their value locked was still in uni swap but what they were going to do and what they are still doing is what i like to call a vampire attack on uni swap where they're going to basically take the liquidity um and enforce migrate everyone who's staking their uni swap lp tokens on sushi swap and and kind of change it to the sushi swap exchange um which is very sneaky we haven't seen this done before and not at this scale either um but i think as well it's worth mentioning that it's it's funny that uh we saw this play out over the first few days but there was a guy called chef gnome an anonymous person who set this up and everything and everyone was like oh you know this this is great this is awesome like this is something that can actually challenge uni swap uh you know and it was really weird because it's like hey this person is completely anonymous like had no rep before this like why are we trusting them right and of course they decided to quote unquote exit scam on the weekend um so you know the the farming that was going on what ended up happening is like 10 of the the sushi tokens that were being farmed went to a dev fund which was solely controlled by this chef know me person um and then over the weekend they decided well i think i've built up enough capital here i'm just going to sell the sushi on the market which which equated to about 15 million dollars worth of eth uh and then yeah since then they've transferred control of the protocol over to sbf um or sam bankman fried from uh ftx the founder of ftx and alameda research and he hasn't tweeted you know since that happened like two or three days now or he or she i don't know who it is um i mean p if you believe the chef sorry the chef hasn't tweeted since transferring this ownership over so you know i've been tweeting about it and alluding to it there's so much like quote unquote psyops going on here like i don't know if this was a grand plan between all these different parties but there's just so much so many coincidences that happen and so many things that happen in succession it kind of feels like this is an attack on uni swap right an attack on ethereum and d5 and it could be a very successful one as well because we've never seen a a a vampire attack on on uniswap um as i explained so i mean it still has over a billion dollars of value lock the migration is going ahead in i think less than 40 hours where literally everyone will be forced to migrate if they're still staking their liquidity provider tokens so you have a choice obviously you can remove the tokens but uh you know why would they if they're still farming sushi sorry if they're still farming sushi and on top of that sam from ftx said that he's going to actually pay millions in sushi to people who stick through with the migration so this is yeah this is this is crazy like this is the craziest thing i've seen in d5 probably ever i i think the biggest indicator that this was going to happen was the combination of like the 10 dev fund with the anonymous founder right and i don't want to harp on anonymous founders because this this whole industry was born on anonymous founders right like satoshi was anonymous for a reason and in this spirit of what yield farming is is trying to get a protocol out into the community having a non having an anonymous founder is really helpful in that regard because then it can just be transferred to the community but then that 10 debt fund came in and i feel like i mean me included i just overlooked it it's like yeah you know a debt fund like in ethereum we want to fund our devs and so that's aligned with the ethereum native too or the ethereum like ethos as well but like it just becomes really delicate and precarious like there's this narrative around like we can just yield farm our way through vcs and we don't need vcs anymore but then we ultimately like are gambling with like the the altruism of these individuals or whether they are in it in it for the right reasons or not uh and and that's kind of where like it all comes down to like human nature like i don't i don't know the personal wealth of this sushi individual prior to farming sushi i'm assuming he had a decent amount because he farmed a decent amount of sushi but like he made 15 million dollars in seven days like good luck not convincing someone to like dump right like 15 million dollars is hard to argue with yeah and it's funny though because like i i agree with you i don't have anything against like anonymous founders or stuff like that but the fact that the 10 dev fund had no vesting at all um and you know it was an anonymous founder that came out of nowhere and we basically had to trust that they wouldn't sell and i pretty much called it from like day one i said this dev fund kills this project for me like not just that but i mean the dev fund the the attack on uni swap as well it's like you know i it always looked like a direct attack and then even the irony of it too was that the chef was on twitter calling out hayden adams the founder of uni swap saying that you know he had everything he had vc money he had a nice salary and the chef had nothing well now the chef has actually made more money from uni swap basically than hayden has made in and hayden created the damn thing so it's it's just i mean it's gross and i really think that we need to kind of as you said it's a sobering event right we really need to reflect on this and reflect on how fast we are to trust people in this industry right so i want to share this i want to share this now famous tweet that's that scott scott shared and it was a statement that the chef made in uh discord right you guys see that this is the tweet i think it's loading again but um basically chef says um i'm a good guy right i'm i'm not going to oh having the tweet uh he he's basically i'm not gonna dump on you i'm a good guy right right like basically saying um no vesting commitment for me but i'm not dumping i'm a good guy trust me this was on august 28th at the very beginning of the sushi saga right and yeah and we just tried we just trusted it and and i i think like anthony makes up it makes a good point because like it was and it's a quote-unquote attack on uniswap like this wasn't a yield farm like other yield farms were right like it wasn't yams it wasn't wifey it didn't create something it forked something and it also forked something that was already like basically community owned at its core right like there's no like sure there's vc ownership over over uniswap but there's no vc tax on uniswap users right and so it was a very opportunistic like yield farm that just used the labor of the uniswap team which weren't taking a cut or fee of any sort and then forking in a token to generate this yield farm and then adding a dev fund right so it actually is is way worse than whatever vc components have added to units i want to ask david so you said um you said you made the same we just trusted it um i personally didn't just trust it like i i was like so there was i feel like there was a division of the um the defy community before um the chef turned out to exit scam everyone and then there was a further division of the community kind of after but i felt like before the division of the community i'm gonna maybe just like try to break it down into a few different component parts but you guys add kind of parse your like this is just the pulse in the community there were those that thought it was a direct attack on uniswap and thought that that was bad right including hayden adams he's like look guys we we've spent you know the last two years building this thing and here comes this 10 day old twitter account he's forking you guys are just falling all over yourselves thinking that this is the greatest thing ever right so there's people there was a group that was super speculative didn't like the experiment from day one i personally was not in that group okay but i understood the point i understood the perspective there was another group that was like okay well this could be and i think you used the phrase david before this could be like a schroeder's cat thing right like this could totally be and probably is given the incentive play of the ten percent dev fund a an exit scam in process right or the chef could turn out to be altruistic and like be like okay i made a faulty design decision with this 10 and i'm allocating the 10 percent not to me but to this group of governors yeah and and restore the credible neutrality that and you know and i thought well maybe there's a 10 15 20 chance of that happening the 80 chance that it wouldn't but okay the experiment is is fine the experiment is okay right because we want to have experiments and um you know that's how uniswap sharpens its sword and gets better that was probably the camp i was in where i was like super skeptical but also respected the experiment and then there was another camp a third camp that was just like oh my god like we're worshiping uh chef nami this is the second coming this is everything that unit swap should have been there's no chance he would scam us he is a good guy he's saying he's a good guy and we believe he's a good guy farm farm farm farm farm farm farm like and that that's a group in d5 i did not identify with at all and i was kind of annoyed about because it's just like guys we talk about why are you here in crypto why are you here in d5 to build trustless systems and the very first thing you're doing is you're trusting a 10 day old twitter account and all the psyops as anthony mentioned that could could be going into that like we have no idea you know who's behind who's actually behind this project you're so ready to give them trust that's not what this space is about be ultra speculative like be skeptical put on your bitcoiner hat again right like verify so that that was a group i did not identify with at all and ended up being kind of frustrated with i don't know what do you guys think like do you think those were the groups and like which which group did you most identify with that those are definitely the groups and i definitely fall into the second group um was extremely skeptical of it from day one uh i didn't actually know about the ten percent dev fun until like the second day or something and that's when my skepticism went like really like high i was like okay there's a dev fund there's no vesting you know i've been in this space since early 2017. i know what that looks like with the ico saga right you're just gonna you're just gonna get like people i mean why wouldn't you right why wouldn't you dump if you made 15 million dollars in a week off off a fork right like come on i mean and you know i was thinking about it from a legal perspective what how can someone actually go after this person like for one we don't know who it is right two they didn't actually do anything except a few comments about saying they weren't going to dump right but there was you know they didn't take any money from anyone uh right it was just it was coming out of the the um the funds that were being distributed via the the smart contracts so i don't know what legal leg you would have to stand on going after this person so they probably thought well why wouldn't i do this 50 million dollars like what right yeah um no skin yeah exactly exactly and it's just it's it's it's insane and it was insane to me the most insane thing is that third camp that group of people that i mean i can respect the profit maximalists right the ones who just farm these things don't care about any of the technology whatever i just want to make money yeah you can do you right i made money off sushi swap as well like i'm not innocent here from a kind of farming perspective but for people to say things like i should kill you news because you knew something's bc owned and you know it should do this it should do that um was was gross to me and i'm i'm all for healthy competition and and pushing innovation forward and you know not turning something like units off into a quote-unquote monopoly but i i just think that you know these these things that uh are basically attacked should be called out and should be you know there should be a light shown on it especially when there's a central party benefiting from it to the tune of millions of dollars off of someone else's work like and that's just going to happen because that's the space marine it's open source everything's out there i mean most things are open source some things are actually you know proprietary and if you kind of fork it there could be legal risks there but for the most part it's open source right we saw i mean tron is literally built off of ethereum right the original ethereum jplant was forked to create tron we can't stop it but we can call it out and we can be honest with ourselves about it yeah i wrote about this in the market monday piece a little uh snippet of what you just mentioned anthony where like the sushi guy didn't actually do break anything like the protocol wasn't exploited there wasn't a bug like it it debatably wasn't an exit scam and so like the the real crime was that like the sushi founder defected from the community right like he created this incentivization and this narrative that we're going to like do this community-owned unit swap and you're going to get rewarded for yield farming same playbook as all the other farms and then you're also going to get rewarding for supplying liquidity to the token same playbook as all the other farms and then once there was a ton of liquidity the guy dumped because he created the liquidity to dump on them right and so it was a massive defection from the community because like and like i i think it's also worth having a conversation maybe not maybe today is not the right spot but like bitcoin was the original yield farm right like bitcoin mining was the biggest community growth operation ever and it and it it discovered yield farming before we named it yield farming right and the whole i did the reason why bitcoin is so successful is that created a community that like signals their uh their lack of defection their cooperation with everyone else and that's why you see bitcoiners taking screenshots of their cash app purchases and like signaling it on twitter it's like yo just bought like 500 000 sats never selling and then that's their deal that's their like in that's their in group like uh signal and and that was what all yield that is what all yield farms aspire to become right and like and it's really fragile in the early days in the first like seven days it's the most fragile times of any community ever so like imagine if like bitcoin went to i don't know what the market cap of sushi was but like if bitcoin went to like a billion and a half dollars or whatever in the first like 10 days and then satoshi was like just press the sell button like that universe doesn't exist because it couldn't have been but that's basically what happened and bitcoin probably wouldn't have worked out if satoshi had done that right and so every single farm that ever comes up ever is about a game of trying to gather enough community stewards and community stakeholders to all agree to the social contract of not defecting right and that's what the sushi swap founder that was his sin like he didn't break any laws he didn't commit any fraud he sinned by defection he defected from this community and like it's also a good point like he could have not done that and it would put his life would be largely the same if not better because that was a cool community like again it was schrodinger's cat of a of a farm like it could have been like one of the coolest things ever and he decided to go for it for 15 million dollars in each and that's why i kind of like think this is i guess i say the word a lot now these days but like a psyops angle here where things just played out in such a weird kind of like timeline like that i just can't help but think that there was like this this kind of loose plan from the beginning right and maybe they had this plan and it got it way ahead of what they thought it would right maybe they didn't think oh we're gonna get over a billion dollars of tbl in our protocol within a week like they probably didn't right that's that's actually unheard of for um for projects until the farming stuff came along right so maybe they had this loose plan where they're like okay this is how we attack unisoft this is how we get liquidity so anthony can we go into detail on that because i think that psyops angle is super interesting and ethereum defy community like we have to be wise right like we have to be like serpents about this we have to like be like bitcoiners who are you know ready for some to screw them over at every single opportunity that that doesn't mean be completely closed-minded but we cannot be naive because i think the aftermath of this is even more interesting like the events that in the information that that kind of came out um after the the club lights went on and everyone looked sweaty and gross as david said right so um not a huge not a huge surprise to many of us that the anonymous founder with zero skin in the game decided to take 15 million and leave the community high and dry no reputational risk not a huge surprise but what was somewhat interesting is the way it played out after that so anthony can you talk about like kind of some of the events right so um just recap us so sushi chef nami takes takes uh his her money leaves right um and then it seemed like this this other figure uh spf gets involved um from ftx exchange and he kind of like becomes the hero of sushi and there's that whole angle and then there's some evidence possibly that the identity of the the sushi chef is actually somebody who's maybe closely associated with sam like tell us about this craziness because that to me lends credence to this whole notion this whole possibility again it's all possibilities probabilities that this whole sushi thing could have been a an attack a psyops attack against against d5 nina swapping ethereum from the very beginning so tell us those events and like that angle of things yeah yeah so i think i just want to kind of like before i jump into it i do want to uh say that i think a lot of people uh when they hear these things and they hear these theories they think they're just conspiracies right because they're they're so so hard to believe sometimes or they don't believe that someone can be this kind of like scheming right and they don't believe that someone could do this but if you spend enough time in the community and you watch things very closely and you pay attention to people's motivations and what actually drives them to do certain things then you can spot these things pretty easily so with the sushi swap thing my grand theory is that this was uh all pretty much planned as i said but it got out of control and and you know it got way bigger than what what they thought it would be so i guess basically with the chef being anonymous he could do whatever we want so during the week he built up this this really um fierce community because that's the first thing you'd want to do right you'd want to build up this army of people to defend your protocol against anything so they went out onto twitter straight away and they started attacking uni swap right and maybe not attacking directly but started saying things like you know this is going to beat you swap because one they're part of a new community and two they're getting money from it too like they're incentivized to get their sushi price the sushi price to go up right for this thing to continue so that's the first thing i would do if i was trying to to take down kind of like unisop you need the community so once you have the community behind you you know the rewards are good enough because people are hearing about sushi the price is good so the apy goes up more tvl gets locked up right then the theory of this thing could kill uni swap starts to really take off and you start to really see this traction play out so you know that succeeded obviously and they got a lot of tbl um and lent credits to those theories uh from from people and then you know it continued on but then at some point and for some reason chef nomi decided he would just dump his sushi right after building up this community he thought the best course of action was to dump and maybe they wanted the money right but i don't believe it's as simple as that i and this is go this is going maybe a little bit deeper into the rabbit hole here here but i do think that this was done on purpose right what you do is you kill the protocol right or you kill the community or you put a wedge in the community you defect as david said you you make the community think that all hope is lost right the price dumps price goes to like a dollar or something from from a high of like ten dollars it was at like four dollars i think before this happened but it goes without and then the next day the white knight comes in right sam comes in sam comes in and says i'll help sushi right sam sam sorry sam bankron fried from from ftx uh the ceo of ftx is which is a pretty large crypto exchange um if i was to say like what i compare it to is probably binance in terms of like how fast they move through things and what they want to do um sam also works closely with uh solana he's building a decentralized exchange on there called serum so it's kind of like what cz tried to do with binance with like the binance chain and everything but sam's playing it a bit differently i think sam has identified the fact that the ethereum community can be naive and can and he wants to go after that right and he wants to take defy okay and sam was like involved and they were the biggest farmer of it because they have a lot of money and they get really involved with d5 so he's probably the largest sushi holder as well um uh and yeah he yeah he mean he's most incentivized to see this thing continue too right so there's that angle as well but the way i viewed it was just like he just saw this maybe it wasn't a grand plan but he saw this opportunity where he was like okay i can come in and be the wife right now so what ended up happening was someone anonymously on discord so this is another thing someone on the discord anonymously said um and he actually had the name like sbf right on the discord it wasn't it was a fake sbf but he had that and he said give me control of the protocol or something like that and then everyone's like oh this is a fake spf but then people are like well why don't you just like tweet about it or something and then i think sam tweeted about it and he's just like here's my address if you want to pass kind of the ownership to me and then chef gnome was like okay here you go and he he basically passed the ownership of the protocol to spf he i think he open source like the front and put it on github or whatever that was like one of his last tweets um and then he vanished basically he's like kaiser jose right she's gone um and then sam now has control of the protocol he's setting up like a multi-seek thing where people can there's gonna be a bunch of signers on there um and he's doing the migration as well so that vampire attack i talked about and now everyone's like oh well sam saved sushi swap this is still good the community is still fine this is our new white knight and chef nominee gets away as i said scot-free he gets away with this money who knows who he is who knows you know whatever he is and i think i i need to basically explain the theories around who he is as well um i know i'm going on long here but this is this story is crazy so basically um once this happened obviously people are going to try and identify this person right like who is this person can we identify them can we actually hold them accountable so they basically went out there and discovered a bunch of different uh things and a bunch of different evidence about the the cto of band protocol being linked to uh chef nomi uh there was things like the um the domain name for band protocol and uh sorry the domain for band protocol and sushi swap was on the same hosting provider and they were the only two crypto related things on there um so that was like one piece of evidence there was evidence that uh the the band protocol ctr liked like hearthstone and built things for hearthstone and chef known as a hearthstone character um which was i think more circumstantial than than hard evidence but there was a bunch of other evidence as well then someone came out and said that sam and the cto of band protocol actually went to school together like uh like college together or whatever um i haven't checked this all myself ftx was one of the first exchanges to list sushi is that correct yes but that could also be because they were the biggest farmers of it too right so they were also one of the biggest farmers of it too right but that's the thing there's all these things happening and this is why i kind of like go in my mind i'm just like it's just it's just too many coincidences to be you know uh to be not like a like this kind of plan and maybe it wasn't a plan from the start maybe sam saw the opportunity and was just like damning  the chef know me person was like okay how about we do this right um you know and there's a there's another wrinkle in this too right so uh sam comes in white knight i'm gonna take over multisig i'm gonna take over the protocol and restore it to its former glory right price gets a bump a little bit but also submits a proposal to um migrate some of the sushi protocol or maybe the entire sushi protocol to this new uh ethereum killer i guess this new decentralized exchange quotes air quotes as as you mentioned called serum right which he is primarily backing and building is that another angle of this like yeah i mean he's trying to see liquidity for his serum exchange that was proposed during like the week as well um but yeah it's just another thing right there was they were so heavily involved with sushi swap from the very beginning right that it's just it's there's too many too many things linking um them all together right there's too many coincidences i just yeah i mean and from what i know of the people involved right and things going on like this does not surprise me at all that they would act in this way for their motivations right um based on what i believe their motivations to be uh especially if you're building a competitor dex right or a decentralized exchange to an ethereum decentralized exchange which he is right sam is um and serum is being advertised as basically like this grandiose thing it can scale you know there's cheap fees whatever right and then of course they're ignoring the the fact that it's pretty much centralized right it's the binance chain of 2020 basically yeah exactly exactly so it's just there's so many things linking it together that i think that at this point like calling it a conspiracy theory is just like not doing it any justice and yeah yeah okay so we talked about the division in the d5 ethereum community pre right uh sushi uh chef know me exit scam right but how about post it seems to me and i haven't dug into this but my sense is like now a larger number of d5 they're like ah i see what's going on right this is you know this was possibly a plan from the beginning this is a total ripoff this is not the protocol we thought it was you know others in the in in the camp who kind of knew it all all along are saying basically yeah we told you so but there are some in d5 who are kind of celebrating sarah and sam uh coming in and saving uh sushi and like and then hitching themselves to that train is that kind of what you're seeing are these still these two camps yeah i mean i i i'm actually really happy that after this happened a lot of the people in the ethereum community that maybe were either on the fence or supporting sushi swap kind of backtracked on their support and and kind of like discovered what had happened but yeah there seems to be a vocal kind of community that uh you know uh that like this new serum thing that that's being built they like the fact that it's going to migrate to other chains they they call it like they basically say oh you know if ethereum maximalists don't like this then they're just like you know did they they're being like bitcoin maximalists and stuff like that um are you sir are you an ethereum maximalist sir i mean oh god i've had i've talked about this so many times before because people always ask me this but i mean i'm i'm i'm i guess i'm inferior maximalist to the point that everything's happening on ethereum and it aligns most with the values that i have right and what i want to see kind of happen in in the world in the in this space in particular something like and not just not to pick on any of the other kind of chains but something like solana does not appeal to what i want to see um something like eos does not appeal to what i want to see the other chains don't appeal to it plus they have like little to no adoption so it's just boring right like i'm a fun maximalist let's do cool maximalist you know um so but at the same time i do think that a lot of these competitors have to attack ethereum right they have to come at us from all angles because if they don't they're not going to get any adoption right um you know d5 is the biggest uh thing that you can do with a blockchain in my mind like the finance or decentralized finance whatever is the is the biggest tam total addressable market the other stuff like you know nfts and doubts and stuff like are cool but they still fall into the d5 umbrella in my eyes so you know if you want defy on your chain what better way to do it than to vampire attack the biggest decentralized exchange on ethereum and for the community at the same time right to help you do it it's genius okay so you we we just gave some very skeptical criticisms of this new uh this new sushi which is the same sushi but now under new management and like so we're still skeptical of this however we're still back into the world of like schrodinger's farm right like it still could be the sushi that everyone wanted it to be like that is still in the cards right and amin solemani put out a really good uh thread and like i mean soleimani is he's an interesting guy and the reason why he's interesting is he's an etherean he he believes in ethereum he he likes ethereum like his company's built on ethereum but he often thinks like a bitcoiner right like he thinks very adversarially which is a quality that most aetherians don't tend to have and so uh he put out the thread great thread definitely worth reading and i think i think the best tweet uh best two tweets is talking about how um like yield farming is a zero-sum casino yeah there we go and the the farmers that are farming the tokens and selling them aren't necessarily like part of the community right it's the community are the people that and he equated this to like a party right in the same way that i i consider equated like yield farming to like this club that we're all at two in the morning and then the lights turn on the the real community are the people that are there the next morning after the party is over and they help clean up the mess right and so like now we're in this like back into this world where like we don't know if sushi is going to be a thing or not but it's up to the community to make it so right it's if there's enough of the community left to help clean up the mess and then rebuild for the next party i think then sushi is alive and well and i'm bullish if there's not enough of those community members then i'm bearish but it's really it's it's in the community's hands at this point because and that's what farms should be from day one and that was the red flag about this farm was that it wasn't that uh but i i think there's there's definitely plenty of universes out there where sushi fulfills its original vision yeah i i think that you know that that house party analogy is is also like like you could add this to it it's almost like the dude who threw the house party also went through everyone's wallets you know while the court the coats were in the upstairs room and stole their money collected everything and took their money collected their car keys and like just left right and he was he was like the biggest party animal too and he was responsible for like three quarters of the mess and now he's not in his house it wasn't his house and now you're asking the community to go clean up after his mess right and that tough so tough it's a tough ask that's why i totally like i totally agree with what you're saying like is it possible yeah but did the probability just dropped from like a ten percent to like a point zero one percent yeah like maybe right because that's a that's a hard way to start your community if you like just you know kind of screw them over and what is it possible those numbers but i do agree in the the drop in probability yeah yeah and at some at at some point right that like this is this is where you can bet you can make your bets right so at some point the price of sushi either drops to so low that you're like you know what the pro i think it's this probability whereas maybe i'm more bearish on sushi i think it's this probability you could choose to bet on it by purchasing it right that's the that's the fun part about this uh this uh mini game that we're in i guess i i yeah i mean i have to give credit to the the players of the game they seem to have played this very nicely um you know sam uh is an interesting character uh i have you know i've known about him for a while and i followed his movements in the community because he came he's kind of newer to the community i think ftx only started in 2019 and he started being public over the last few months so i've been paying attention to like just the stuff that they're doing they're doing um and this kind of like fits in with from kind of what i've seen uh he's a very smart guy like extremely smart and you know if i had to characterize him i'd say that he's like a very smart version of cz i always thought cz was like always missed the mark right he missed the mark with finance chain or he didn't understand it he didn't he didn't do any of these kind of like things within ethereum with default he didn't try to ally with the community he was always outside of the community whereas sam's a bit like much smarter about it and he's allying with the ethereum community while doing these things like um to basically draw liquidity from defy onto his own platform so you know i mean that's not a conspiracy that's just what's happening right he has a platform that competes with ethereum he wants liquidity like that's that's a fact right it's not something that you have to go crazy making up uh stories in your head about yeah so i think also what you're saying is like we probably haven't seen the last of spf certainly right now i think it's gonna be a presence and these sorts of attacks these sorts of attacks like so somebody uh one time compared like um ethereum to some of the hogwarts houses right and like ethereums are a bit more like hufflepuffs right they're just like oh yeah everyone's well intentioned you know sounds good when uh that kind of mindset is very acceptable susceptible to slytherin type attack right that's why by the way david that's why i love amine because like i mean is like i think like slytherin right and i'll sometimes i'll use my powers for good right yeah exactly exactly we need people like that in the community to call it out because a lot of people you know can't call it out due to different circumstances right it depends you know people there's a lot of different things going on in the industry where everyone's connected right and you have professional connections i mean seems to not like maybe not not not care but maybe he just was like i'm just going to tell it like it is right yeah he doesn't give up that's his deal yeah yeah and i i really really respect that like as you said david he's an interesting character but um i really respect the fact that he he calls out things calls a spade a spade basically what do you guys think of solana like so what is what's what's a solana i know i know it's like the newest ethereum killer yeah do you have anyone have a take on it what's your take anthony it's like eos 2.0 in my eyes it has the similar architecture from what i've seen in terms of um you know delegated staking and things like that it's got kind of the same players involved it's it's doing the the same thing where it's claiming it's saying he's backing it yeah like infinitely scalable like low cost right we're gonna do all these amazing stuff and they're never talking about the trade-offs of course and the trade-off is basically that the big beefy validators kind of have to live in a data center somewhere it can't be run on consumer hardware so an average person can't run it is that sort of the main training pc funded yeah i mean most of the tokens uh are held by yeah vcs and you know they are the ones who do the validating and things like that and and have most of the stake in the validation so yeah you're right and that's why it reminds me of eos right because eos has to run on on beefy hardware too right um and that basically turned into a cartel because it's just you know uh uh it centralizes right because of um of scale uh but yeah i mean if you can't run the kind of like software on your own kind of pc then i just don't see the point i mean it's kind of like why not just use a database right why do you need to use this beefy thing that is pretty much like just decentralized as a database like a normal i guess like a normal database on like aws right it's like a bunch of companies getting together to run the the the the software and like signing things with like keys but they can be compelled to do things right like you know if if they wanted it it doesn't have to be a malicious thing either it can be just a government saying well you need to remove this off solana it's like what we know you can because you can you can basically get all these people in a room and do it right so and like no one can stop you and yeah i mean there's so many different risks here uh and different things that people just gloss over when discussing these things that uh it just reminds me of eos like if anyone wasn't like something it does it feels so much like we've seen this we've seen this story already play out even down to david as you said the same vc's like pumping it at the future kyle simani and anything that multi-coin capital touches really they really just want to try and eat ethereum's lunch and it's just not going well for them you know in the in the 2017 was it 2017 or was it 2018 when eos launched 2017. well 2018 whatever they did the token was out in 2017. yeah they did that year-long token sale where you could trade it at the same time as the target i remember at the time like um they were definitely putting out some like pieces that were just like ethereum is dead this is the future ethereum can't scale see cryptokitties now eos right and not i tell i and i remember reading long reports listening to podcasts and like being like what am i missing is there something here that i'm not seeing maybe i'm the idiot maybe i'm the fool but like fast forward six months later nine months later a year later those same vc's had dumped all of their eos like and were and were openly telling people that it would never work right and just incredibly yeah kyle from multi-coin has openly said that like they made a mistake on eos that's like a public thing that they talk about but i wonder if that was a mistake i don't know i haven't seen multiple they probably made a lot of i mean that mistake right that's the that's the thing about the about a lot of this stuff is that you can be very very wrong but you can still make a lot of money being wrong right um it's because of the fact that these things are traded like like crypto we know we all know how crypto's traded um i feel i also feel open to these things as layer 2s too that's why i don't want to like you know crap all over uh solana or serum like if it's a layer two i don't care as much right i mean i uh and by that i mean like um you know uh coinbase listing eve pairs and doing things with eath right that's completely centralized right but that acts as a side chain to ethereum and if gas fees are too high you can do things in coinbase you can onboard fiat if solana is going to be that kind of a companion to eth then you know it's it's more symbiotic uh it's not it's not taking away from the the whole kind of bankless idea of everyone has self-sovereign money but if it's trying to replace if you're trying to replace ethereum with a banker coin i mean like why not i'm fine with the swift system and fiat right at least like i mean that's more distributed than what something like salon is so i guess i i i find it hard to articulate because i don't so much have a problem with these things as like side chains or layer twos what i have a problem is like with the idea that they're going to come in and replace the credible settlement layer of some neutrality of something like ethereum um yeah i don't want to see that yeah i mean that's that's what i probably it's it's really the the gaslighting and the misleading marketing right where it's basically as you said ryan like what am i missing right it's basically putting this idea in people's heads that they must be missing something right they have people telling them that that solana or any other other thing is like centralized you know it doesn't work um you know it's not going to beat ethereum and then you have the companies building these things saying that we're going to kill ethereum right we're scalable where decentralized so who do you believe especially as a newcomer you're just getting hit from all sides by people that have obviously vested interest in different things and as a newcomer you're seeing these gas prices and you're like oh okay they have a point right yeah yeah exactly so it's it's it's it's it's unfortunate what these what these like i guess quote-unquote competitors will do but it makes sense right if you're if you're a competitor you're gonna bend the truth right you're gonna mislead people and and try to try to get market share but um yeah i mean not to say that some in the ethereum community don't do the same thing right don't exaggerate things like we all exaggerate but i i do think i agree with you as well about these things being like a side chain to ethereum that's probably inevitably inevitably going to happen anyway um but we'll have to see yeah i don't think they're going to kill ethereum that's for sure yeah all right well do you have some time to stick around we're going to talk about a few other topics so you have to run that's probably late where you are i yeah i think i have to run it's 1am here oh my god then get some sleep my friend no no it's fine thank you i'll stay up for the state of the nation for sure anytime well we appreciate it well dave and i are going to cover a couple of other topics but it's been great to have you thanks so much for shedding some light on on what's going on in this space yeah yeah thank you for having me uh and good luck with uh with the rest of the podcast thank you guys all right thank you appreciate it thanks anthony bye oh that was good david we should talk about our sponsors um do you want to start with ample fourth yeah ample fourth father of modern rebasing uh so if you guys have heard about this new rebasing mechanism it came from ample forth ample fourth is this very interesting monetary experiment right so it wants to be a base money on ethereum that functions or operates differently than typical base monies that you would be expected to and the whole purpose of this is to generate like new and novel and uncorrelated like economic outputs than from the typical assets you see on ethereum because they're all as we all seen in the last like you know uh five days of price appreciation they're all pretty correlated right so ample fourth is an attempt to be an uncorrelated m0 money on ethereum and the way that it's different the way that it's unique is like it's very similar to bitcoin in the sense that it's got a non-dilutive supply but in the way that it's extremely the opposite or the inverse of bitcoin is that instead of having an inelastic supply like bitcoin has where therefore if any demand to bitcoin consumes that supply price goes up that's how bitcoin works ample forth is the opposite where ample fourth tokens track 2019 over time so one amplifier token is supposed to track one dollar and uh nine tenths of a penny and if the price goes over that for ample fourth a rebase happens and that mints new ample force to bring the price down and so you will find the amount of ample fourth in your wallet going up and down over time automatically in order to track 2019 right and so it's just swapping those two things and and generating new economic behaviors as a result they have a yield farming liquidity mining mechanism which you which they call the geyser you can find out more about ample forth at ampleforth.org which is also where you can find the geyser where you can deposit ether and ampliforce tokens to unit swap to get a little bit extra ample fourth token so check them out awesome also want to tell you about monolith super excited about everything that monolith is doing these days it's a way to go fully bankless but in the real world where you can actually spend your crypto on real things so monolith is a visa card but it's more than that it's an entire defy account so it wraps your ethereum address in a visa card a bankless visa card but it also closes the loop from fiat to d5 so now you can onboard fiat to die on monolith with zero fees you can then convert that die to adi which is obvi's version of dai which is an interest bearing savings account again no fees and then you can take the interest that you generate and actually spend it in the real world go buy a coffee go buy some starbucks this is really the closest thing to the holy grail of bankless crypto visa cards that i've seen and what you need to do is go download the app at monolith.xyz to get started this is primarily for our european listeners because it works in europe but they are coming to north america soon and we will be the first to tell you when they do what they'll do after you order your visa card is ship you a beautiful packaged monolith visa card we love seeing people unpackage their visa cards on twitter you can tweet about it uh once again check out monolith in the app store and get started going bank list in the real world david we've covered a lot today um here we go it it almost seems like we were we were taught like it was just uh it brought me down a little bit right um like sobriety is good but also um i don't know we we should talk about maybe something that's a little lighter some of the the good side the the uh i guess the um the cloud the uh you know of of all of these things that are going on um and i i think that's probably that probably brings up git coin we could talk about how um some of these yield farming protocols are actually starting to set aside percentages for uh funding of public goods that seems to be like a good outcome that's come out of all of this is what i'm trying to say right and as we are sobering up from like this yield farming mania like it we need to also remind ourselves that like there is something real here right like this didn't just come out of thin air like yield farming is a real thing like i expect yield farming to to continue uh it's just like now it's good to remind ourselves that what bad things can happen i'm glad that that happened relatively early so that it didn't ha because if it happened later it's going to be way bigger but there are good things that are happening here and one of the biggest signals that i think we all missed with um with the sushi guy was that he was super mean to hayden right like on twitter he was a mean guy like he was aggressive and he attacked hayden who hayden is generally assumed to be a nice guy and so some alpha signal there is that like the guy was mean like that don't don't trust mean people like trust nicely don't be a dick don't be a dick yeah and don't put don't invest your money in protocols where the founder is a dick right and so he's going to rip you off the same way right exactly and so like there's there's on the other side of things there are some protocols yam wifey and now also based which are contributing a portion of their treasury to get coin right and and one of the fascinating things about all these farms is that a lot of them have treasuries right like the whole point of yams is that it uses rebasing to generate a treasury the whole point the whole point of urine and wifey is that it collects fees from the urine protocol to contribute to a treasury and same thing with with based and so this treasury is fantastic because that gives reason for governance right it gives purpose for governance but then also we can signal like with these farms that you can signal your commitment to the space by allocating funds to get coin and so there was a fun little like happenstance of events where yeah like kevin this tweet that you're sharing on the screen and by the way podcast listeners if you're watching this on youtube there's plenty of visuals to look at as we talk about these things so kevin owaki back in the last week of august proposed submit a proposal to the yam governance that one percent of the inflows into the treasury goes to get coin right goes to funding public goods and there's a lot of good that has come out of get coin right the bankless nation being one of them right the good things come out of git coin and initially like this the proposal kind of was 50 50. it was kind of neck and neck and then it started to lose and i think at the worst it was like 63 percent to uh what's the other half and david this is yam holders actually voting right on whether they want one percent right of the treasury to go to get coin for public goods or not right and you're saying at one point the the vote was losing right yeah it started 50 50 then it started to lose and then uh andre from yearn comes in with the dunk and goes yo turns out yams don't want this but urine definitely wants this so i'm submitting your proposal to do one percent of the urine uh system which makes a lot more money than the yam system by the way oh are you serious so i didn't i totally missed that yearn was into this too yeah yeah yeah so andre submitted a proposal to direct uh one percent of funds to to get coin right and that one percent of urine funds of urine of urine treasury uh flow right but that's a lot i mean that could potentially be a lot bigger than yam treasury yeah yeah by by a significant degree right and so when when andre publicly signaled his commitment to uh his belief that urine should commit to allocating one percent of funds the vote on yam started to sway right and so it started to go back into back to 50 50. and then i wrote this very quick article called don't be stupid dedicate some of your treasury to get coin uh and i i tried to just put the nail on the coffin and after after these two things happened uh there there was just the the yam vote was completely in favor right so can i ask you why is it stupid why is it stupid not to do this right so like in the same way that chef nomi would have never done this this is like a very strong signal of your alignment with ethereum right and and so it's it turns all of the git coin media people which is are people like you and me ryan and it it tells it signals to them that you should be a shill for yam and yearn because it allocates funds to ethereum so which is why we're talking about it right now right so like good on yam and yearn they did a good job by allocating funds to getcoin to help grow the ecosystem and therefore they get publicity and and and organic free shilling from all the people that support so it's a win-win it's a good press for the protocol but also public goods get funded and ethereum being a protocol without any sort of issuance that goes to maintenance of the protocol is a chief primary public good right right yeah okay so all of this goes to git coin um but for folks who haven't used git coin how does git coin work how does git coin distribute it and what like is is this like a non-profit that just kind of distributes the funds based on need or how does that work yes yeah so get coin is this very interesting platform which funds things that otherwise likely wouldn't have gotten funding right and this all came out of italics uh and glenn weil from the radical markets uh group their their belief uh their uh experiment around quadratic funding right and so it's a way to vote with your dollars right and so uh with git coin uh you as a single individual could donate 100 to a project and then that project would receive some amount of matching right like so they another like that there would be another 100 uh matched uh by by the bitcoin treasury right which is where this money is going to but then instead if a hundred individuals donated one dollar so the same amount total same amount aggregate a hundred dollars but the fact that a hundred individuals donated rather than one means that that uh those funds will be matched even more like significantly more like three or four times more and so more of the git coin treasury will be allocated towards the projects that received more grassroots funding right right so like not only is your dollar a vote but also just the fact that you donated is also a vote and you're signaling that you believe that this protocol or this effort should be funded right and the fact that like one percent of the urine protocol is allocating funds to the get coin treasury and then one percent of yams and now two percent of based which is which is why this is turning into like a snowball there's a lot of money flowing into the git coin protocol a lot of money a lot super exciting and the quadratic voting that means basically rather than rich people getting to decide where all the funds go the people do because if you give one dollar it could be if you get a number of other people individuals to give one dollar then your your um one dollar could amplify right could be fifty dollars could be a hundred dollars right so people decide rather than rich that's what the it's weighted for the favor of the people right okay and and now with this growing treasury that perhaps it probably won't the bitcoin round seven is happening in a week right yeah so next state of the nation we're getting kevin owaki on to talk about this and also public goods and why public goods are awesome um cool and but like it probably won't matter for that bitcoin because it just happened and then the treasury hasn't like accumulated that much but i bet by the time like the the next bitcoin round happens after that there's going to be significant capital inflows and we're going to and this is important for get coin because git coin needs that sustainability right it needs that churn it needs constant flows of cash and bitcoin rounds one through six was basically all funded by like consensus and the ef right and like that is a finite amount of funds like consensus isn't really making money and not and yet they're not making money and they're also a for-profit now vc invested company right so can we can we rest assured that that those funds are going to come moving forward no yeah and the ef runs out of funds eventually as well and they don't have that much right yeah they've never had that much right but but protocol everyone is everyone in the bankless nation that i've talked to are bullish on protocols and so protocols can allocate money to get coin then get coin can perpetuate into the future forever and fund really important things that that can like come out of the the graduating class of bitcoin round seven graduating class of get coin round eight like like i said bank list was part of that like eth is part of that uh d5 dad's a part of that cami russo like a lot of important stuff and that's just the media stuff which i'm biased to but there's plenty of tech stuff as well well yeah i mean unit swap was birthed from eight years it wasn't a bitcoin grant but it was uh it was an ef grant of the same fashion so it's like zapper right we like it's a show sponsor now and it just got them started uh tornado cache tons of fantastic stuff stuff and also eip fifteen five nine yeah like by the way i mean that is that's a public good that's not going to get done unless it's supported and funded adequately so this you know you know why this is super exciting now that you're talking about it like in this way is that it gives a um a sustained source of funding that doesn't require um protocol issuance which is so key because the way other protocols are solving this like a tezos or a polka dot is basically they're saying yeah a portion of our issuance is going to go to this fund and then who's going to vote where the like that so issuance is you know minting of new um coins basically and how is this fund going to be administered well it's going to be administered by essentially token shareholders what does this sound a lot like it sounds a lot like a corporation right basically where you know you have some sort of funding process and the individuals who own shares get to vote on where those funds are spent um in my opinion a corporation in shareholder governance is not the right structure for a credibly neutral monetary system why because if if if you know facebook governs your monetary policy then mark zuckerberg and friends can change it at a whim they can decide who to fund i want to fund some of my cronies so i love the fact that um we're able to do some of this public spending without having to resort to some sort of ethereum issuance where like because that just gets messy um it's very difficult to govern and i think it it removes the credible neutrality of the platform makes it much more like a a crony like you know shareholder type system rather than like a like a market it's very hard to um do fun distribution in a way that's credibly neutral i guess as far as issuance goes absolutely and one of the the big things that i'm bullish on is so the urine urine protocol just uh decide elected to pay nine individuals like salary wages to work for urine right so the urine protocol created nine jobs right and urine is only like a month and a half old right and that's kind of like the bullish case for protocols it's like and and like what the original vision of a dow is is code at the center in humans at the periphery and now yearn has nine instantiated people at the periphery working for it right and this is what git coin does git coin like i came the reason why i have a job in crypto is because of bitcoin like it what as when i had my bitcoin grant up like david hoffman independent content producer like i made a decent amount of money to the point where i could like dedicate more of my time writing which turned out it turned out into this job at bankless right and so and i'm bullish on the more money that gets into git coin the more jobs ethereum can create right and the more jobs crypto creates it's bet and especially ethereum just the the faster the bankless world arrives right like and so bullish on job creation therefore bullish on git coin like bitcoin is like the the the product the protocol for like seed funding right or or not even seed funding but less than that like whatever it's lower than seed funding like micro funding like getting getting the proof of concept out the door rewarding you for your your work telling you signaling to you that your work is valuable and that you should continue and then you can bootstrap your way into like doing a job in crypto so for the bank in this world that wants to get into working think about something think about value you can provide and then apply for a bitcoin grant because now there's a bunch of money in it well the clause is the quadratic freelancer right somebody who could just live on kind of grants but what they're actually living on so then you mentioned the daos right so urine and yam even uh even uh based these are all daos and essentially if we were to bring it to a nation state analogy these are like companies building on top of say the us right so this is like the s p 500 but now what these companies are doing they're not taxed by the protocol based on their income or revenue as a nation state might provide some kind of tax uh structure system corporate tax system but they're opt-in donating to fund the ethereum nation to fund the public good so one percent and two percent another one percent i mean i can easily see these treasuries growing like over 100 million this cycle like 500 million possibly right and one to two percent of that starts to add up to being a lot so now we have like this opt-in tax system but even more beautifully what we have is a and hopefully kevin shares more with us next week i want to steal that thunder but we have this uh fair distribution mechanism right um and i like i do really love quadratic voting i think the outcomes of it as long as you can um there have been some flaws and some problems metallic doesn't write up every single like grant sometimes there's there's civil attacks these sorts of things but on the whole it's a pretty reasonable fair distribution of the funds like it's way better than um it's a small community so it hasn't scaled but it's way better than something like the government bureaucrats deciding who gets funded and what the people get to vote and largely the projects that have kind of risen up and gotten the higher donations have been the ones where i'm like yeah these guys are doing uh the most for the the community at this point in time it like it feels very fair so it's like full cycle now we've got our tax now we've got our way to distribute uh this funds and we've got kind of the the ethereum nation the flywheel effect growing and it's just going to grow from here very exciting stuff very exciting yeah i do want to keep on talking about this but also i do want to leave a lot yeah when we get kevin and kevin on here next week so stay tuned for that if you are watching this on youtube or on twitch uh kevin milwaukee gonna come in and just really lay down the hammer on why public goods are so important and and i think one final note on this ryan like the reason why i think that you like this mechanism and whatever in comparison to whatever mechanism preluded it which is the government model and part of the bankless nation thesis or the thesis about human development and progress at large is like you know humans are messy right humans and decisions and governance is messy and the human species has been able to scale by turning over governance to the hands of protocols right like the bible was a protocol and then the constitution was a protocol and now ethereum is literally a protocol right and quadratic funding is a protocol so we no longer have to have subjective decisions as to like allocating funds because the protocol does it for us and the reason why quadratic funding is so spectacular is because if you are a market maximalist if you like markets get coin grant funding is market-based funding like there's a reason why eip1559 got i don't know like 150 000 in like 72 hours a lot of people really want a lot of people really want that to pump their  bags as we've been doing when we talk about one five five five nine so it just makes a ton of sense right um it makes a ton of sense yeah absolutely all right david uh we're going a little long um do you want to talk about the last thing squad wealth or do you want to save that for another time let's save that for another time we'll leave a little little teaser on there but uh sure the tl dr is bankless nation's a squad and we're all going to uh grow our squad together it's going to be fantastic you know what i'll do is i'll just put the article uh in the show notes so folks can read it we'll talk about this at another time it's kind of a a trend the most transformational article i've i've probably read maybe in the last six months or so i don't know it's super good i want to read it a few more times before i get my thoughts out on it but we'll do that in the future yeah david kevin's going to have some opinions on that if i if i know kevin well so maybe maybe ah very good we'll save it for next time perfect okay guys so that's your reading material um i think that is it for uh state of the nation today we talked about uh sobriety we talked about sushi we talked about uh get coin giving and the lighter side of all of these things um we're going to have kevin on next week as well so don't miss that uh thanks so much for joining us guys everything we talked about all of the assets we talk about none of its financial advice so whether it's ether bitcoin or yams or sushi uh you know tread carefully in these things there are risks if you deposit funds in d5 protocols you could lose everything but this is about the journey this is about the constant learning that we're doing together as a bankless nation it's not for everyone but thanks for joining us this has been state of the nation episode 13. i'm just going to pause for a second because of that truncation issue all right
