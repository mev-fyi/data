[Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity i'm ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david we're also here to help people become more bullish more bullish on eth that's what this episode's about tell us about it yeah because the world is not bullish enough on ether the asset this is the bold case for ethereum episode number two the first we did roughly six months ago with eric connor dc and anthony cesano two of those panelists got invited back because they were extra bullish on ether one of those panelists is now an ethereum alumni i will graciously call him and has graduated from the world of content production and is now doing his own thing and so in in his shoes we have brought on cyrus yunessi who is a former risk at maker dao and now kind of doing his own thing and has really unique and interesting perspectives that i really enjoyed his contributions into the three panelists that we had today on this show yeah and the reason we're doing this again is because like we like to bring on people who have been right before and look the ethol panel called this in december 2020 right heath price was hanging in the 600s and they said the message was basically the world is not bullish enough eth and here's why here's the case for why wow so much has changed over the next six months including all-time highs above 4k i think prices proving eric connor wrong to be fair eric connor was absolutely invited he is uh you know just busy with other things and eric we'd love to have you on again of course to talk about this but yeah so like the eighth bulls were right uh and um you know it even overshot i think their wildest estimates at least in the in the six month uh frame and so we're having them back on to talk about it and you know the story here i think david is like they don't feel like the story of ether um is completed at all in fact at one point one of the panelists said i still think less than 10 000 people know what is about to happen to eat the asset with these with these scarcity supply shocks that are coming online um so this is the case again six months later we review the progress the narratives that have changed um the actual dates that are feel much more locked in for catalyzing events like eip 1559 layer two which seems like it's finally here we even talk about the advent of dowels so a really great panel and a panel i think that will make you more bullish eth of course like these are permabulls too right so if you're thinking about short-term time horizons like we don't know if price is going up down sideways to be honest but if you're thinking about fundamental case for why you should be bullish eth this is a great episode to tune into yeah and episode number two of the bull case for ethereum implies that there's an episode number three and an episode number four and so i think the plan is to always update bankless podcast listeners in the world at large as to what's going on with one of the coolest cryptoeconomic network that's out there in my opinion which is ethereum and its native asset ether the asset so without further ado i think we should go ahead and get right into it the panel itself but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible bankless is proud to be supported by unit swap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uni-swap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dow no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on ethereum and just recently released ave version 2 which has a ton of cool new features that makes using ave even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here you can see me getting a 200 usdc loan against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens and eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently one of ave's v2 features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave ave does all of this for you all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them check out the power of ave at ave dot com that's aave.com bankless nation we are super excited to have round two of our ethereum bulls last time we did this was december 17th 2020 six months ago almost to the day we have the same set of bulls one new entrant one has dropped off we've got anthony susana didn't make it one didn't make it of the daily guay investor uh eth bull dc investor you know him as well he is an advisor consultant also an ethereum bull and we've got cyrus yunessi new to the show former maker risk management advisor on the maker dow team scalar capital also fixed income trader this is your ethereum bull podcast we're going to talk about the bull case i think i've said bull like four times now but this is the bull case for ether six months later uh guys it is awesome to have you on the show welcome to bank list thanks ryan david glad to be back thanks guys for having us this is awesome i'm very excited to to get into this six months after the first one guys yeah this is great and and cyrus okay so like uh i think folks know anthony from the first episode obviously and lots of um you know ethereum based content that you produce on the daily also dc um cyrus tell us a bit about yourself it's funny i looked at your linkedin profile and you know somebody has made it when they have a uh crypto punks image as their linkedin profile your title here is nft uh dealer cyrus what are you what are you up to these days what are you doing i mean since maker like what what have you been doing in the crypto space and where have your travels led you uh sure uh i mean brief background uh i was a head of risk at the maker foundation for a couple years from 2019 to 2020. um since then um just kind of working on various personal projects doing a lot of uh trading and yield farming but before d5 i was just kind of doing uh trading roles at a few different trading shops long time each fans for a few years now um super excited about what this community has been up to and what they're building and all that and just the community is a very uh you know it's a pleasure to be part of it awesome man well it's great to have you and uh you replaced eric connor david what's the story with eric connor why couldn't he make it this time yeah the the we want to have these episodes on a recurring basis the bull case for ethereum because as we know ethereum is only six years old so things update and things update really fast and so we want to do these episodes on a reoccurring basis to make sure that we can stay up to date with always the changing bulk case for ethereum so now we are on episode number two and the rule for the bold case for ethereum episodes is that only ethereum bulls can come and wait wait eric is still an ethereum what are you talking about the least bullish person gets bumped from the ethereum bowl case podcast so eric and his uh his price targets of the last episode of 2 500 well we hit that number uh and now now we need somebody even more bullish than eric so we're bringing on cyrus to uh to fill his shoes and also offer a unique perspective in of itself as well this is all funny of course too because eric um is proving to be um rather correct in that 2500 price prediction talk about that too much okay we won't talk about too much about that but uh well done eric i'm sure i'm sure you're listening to this podcast um and uh yeah smiling looking down yeah absolutely all right guys well let's talk about this so as i said earlier it's been six months since our first bookcase for ether episode and i feel like a ton has happened in the last uh six months but i want to start here with maybe price predictions because we're going to start here but we're also going to end here if i'm recalling correctly dc you put out some price predictions at the end of last episode do you remember what those were sir i do and um it was a broad range and i said 4 000 to 20 000. and um lo and behold we came really quick we exceeded that 4 000 number by a little bit so i i think i was actually technically the most right um perhaps given my broad range and um yeah so that was my prediction anthony uh you made a price prediction as well do you recall what yours was uh yeah 10k 10k all day every day um same prediction i've been making since 2019 but unfortunately we haven't gotten to that yet but i'm not ruling it out uh for i guess like if you want to call this a bull cycle i'm not ruling that out i think we're just recharging here but um yeah 10k was is my time short term short to medium term all right we're going to ask you that at the at the end of the episode too if that's changed or what and then um cyrus is going to ask you the question but in in your place eric connor of course said 2500 we use calling the top at 2500 for this bull run and i think one of the questions we have is whether we are paused for a recharge or whether like the kind of the bull run is over as it stands or like what's happening in the market but let's start by talking about the things we we couldn't have talked about six months ago so let's start here what is new and exciting in your mind that has happened in the last six months since we previously did this episode let's start with udc what's going on in eth what's making you bullish so a bunch of things but i think in those six months it's incredible to think how much has happened in those six months and for anyone who's watching this episode i'd encourage you to go back and watch the original episode from six months ago to see how how i think this group was spot on a lot of things so first and foremost i think ether has started to go a lot more mainstream i guess during that time when we recorded that podcast back in december the ratio the ebtc ratio wasn't doing particularly well a lot of people didn't have a lot of confidence and i think since then ether has really proven itself and ethereum has proven itself i think ethereum has gone through a really exciting period um you could call it a manic period of adoption that ranged not just from people using the chain for a lot of d5 applications but also for things like nfts absolutely exploded and i mean that was just a minor talking point during our last episode but when we hit january february time frame along with d5 nft is just absolutely blew up and what you saw with that was a lot of new participants coming into the market who perhaps had never participated in crypto before weren't interested in crypto before were now interested in something like nfts i mean nfts got so big that even saturday night live did a skit on on nfts which i'm sure a lot of the listeners of this podcast may be familiar with but beyond that just talking about ethereum and ether you had a lot of discussion that i think was really starting at the institutional level among even youtubers who are focused on personal finance and other topics started to talk about ethereum alongside bitcoin so i think a lot of what we talked about during that last podcast was ethereum is going to start to enter the zeitgeist and go mainstream and i think that's that's what's kind of happened over the last six months and i'll even add on to that uh a lot of people were skeptical and sometimes so are skeptical as ether as an asset or ether as a money yet they were specifically compelled by ether as a money because of nfts right it's like oh nfts are being issued on ethereum ether is the thing that i need to use to to play around in nft games now i can understand ether as a store of value and currency because all of my nfts are trading against ether and so nfts did a very good job onboarding a lot of people to ethereum just as a generalized use case but it also did a very good job of illustrating the concept and idea of ether as money and i thought that was a particularly compelling aspect about the last six months you know nfts made each money you know art is priced in eth i remember that being a meme yeah and i think that that pricing still persists and there's still an open question on how much nfts will be priced in the east versus u.s dollars or something like that but i think to to pull on your point a little bit further a lot of these new people like bitcoin has traditionally been the gateway crypto for a lot of new participants and now what we're seeing is through nfts and things like nfts people are just going to go straight into ethereum and go straight into the ecosystem and start buying eth to participate in that and i think that was a really interesting development anthony same question to you what's happened in the last six months that we wouldn't have been able to predict on the last bowl case for ethereum pod well i i basically kind of like mirror everything that that dc said i think that really it is is the fact that eth kind of entered that zeitgeist and we went from being a kind of a niche asset within the traditional finance space to to being more of a mainstream one here and it's it's funny because when we did the last one the last kind of um bull podcast at the price was what like 600 or something like that i think it was just starting its bull run right but we had waited for it to get over that like those those couple of humps that we had built up over the years um and then we went at 600 like everyone was feeling like super confident that the bull run for eighth was was back on and we were going to new highs you know it's been very turbulent since then but we we went to 4 400 which is an incredible run and we're still at like 2400 today so still an incredible run but i think uh that was due to a lot of that kind of like adoption as well like we all we i i think we all kind of like saw it happening with defy initially and then you know with nfts i think that's what caught a lot of people off guard as well i i really do think that people are still underestimating how many new people came into the ethereum ecosystem through nfts and specifically used ether's money as you were just saying because that like everyone that had that used ethereum had to use eighth not only to buy the nfts but also for gas at the end of the day and gas prices weren't cheap right like it's only recently the gas prices have gone down for the last six months actually i guess five months prior um not maybe not the last month gas prices were consistently over 100 way and people were willing to pay this because of the fact that what they were doing on the network was valuable to them because the the market was hot and they were able to kind of make money doing this so i think that played such a huge role in eats kind of adoption there and eats price rise because all these new people coming in saw eighth as like the reserve asset of you know nft kind of mania and they were like well i got to get some eighth right i got to buy some eight to kind of get exposure to this um and also on on top of that with d5 as well you know just the fact that people have to buy ease to pay gas fees i think is just such a great kind of like marketing vehicle really at the end of the day because if they don't have to use ease to pay fees then they're not really going to get exposure to to ethos like the first thing that they get exposure to whereas in bitcoin if you're you know getting into bitcoin you buy btc whereas with ethereum you can actually get into ethereum without buying eth but the common denominator across all the use cases is that you need it for those for those fees so i really do think that that works as a really nice social coherence tool um the fact that all the fees are in eth um and you know there's some concerns that with layer twos and other scalability solutions that's gonna be kind of taking a back seat but i don't i don't think so i think that um as time goes on like ether as a feed token should be abstracted away generally but we have one five five nine to make up for that where um and we're gonna talk about that a bit later where the value gets captured in another way rather than in kind of like the social layer way so yeah i guess like i don't really have too much to add on to what dc said about uh you know what what's happened in the last six months in terms of like eighth because it really is just that more mainstream adoption at the end of the day and i think it happened much faster than even you know we thought specifically with nfts yeah absolutely i mean i i i do think that the ethol panel like man uh you guys nailed it in december right price at 6.50 then and you know not three four months later we're at all-time highs on on eth um so we're hoping to maybe repeat the success here and get some uh really bullish uh exciting predictions out of you but how about you cyrus so i know you've been a long time ether bull not just an ethereum bull but an eth the asset bull including when it was tough to be a bull 2018 2019 2020 but the last six months at least to me and people have been in this space for a while have felt really different for eth the asset and for ethereum what's been different cyrus so i i think i did my i think i did a youthful podcast back in 2018 and i remember back then i was talking about all of the cool things that were going to be coming into ethereum and now i feel like we've reached that golden age where um products have delivered teams have shipped all these kind of exciting things that we've been patiently waiting for are here we're starting to uh use ethereum more than just kind of speculate at the base layer um you know dexes have have come a long way in terms of functionality in terms of liquidity and ux uh we're seeing lending protocols are hitting their stride um ave and compound have seen tremendous success and um you know some of these have moved to layer two such as polygon and you know you're the user growth has been incredible if you just think about that like you know just a year ago we were still like struggling to teach people how to use metamask and how to get comfortable with wallets and now now you just see a large user base that are just kind of becoming very comfortable with the ethereum ecosystem and the tooling around it and then i think critically like all that all those users and all that tvl has led to uh institutions have finally uh taken note or you know they're just unable to ignore it any longer right there's this kind of just giant elephant in there in the room where all of these users are just kind of seamlessly using ethereum for an endless number of use cases um and they're you know they're enjoying it and it's almost like that that spongebob meme where uh institutions are like looking through the great and they're kind of like bitter about all the fun that the ethereum users are having and um you know it it almost feels a little bit of like a narrative capitulation they they can no longer say that you know these are just purely speculative use cases or that no one's using it like you know it's just amazing that everything kind of came together uh all at the same time and that's just you know that was all in the last six months so uh dc cyrus is talking about narrative and i have felt a palpable narrative change with respect to ethereum but also eth the asset let's talk about some like new narratives on the horizon um this ultrasound money narrative right uh institutions taking eth as a non-sovereign store of value seriously people like mark cuban coming out and saying yeah bitcoin's okay but like i'm bullish eth and ethereum because of defy this whole green energy debate as well like there there has been a massive shift in narrative where it felt like the last uh two years or so um prior to 2021 everything was kind of against uh ethereum from a narrative perspective um the last six months have felt like a completely different world can you talk about the narrative shift that that you felt or seen yeah and i think as you said ryan it was really something that had started a couple of years ago where we really started to think about eth more ether is this important financial asset and that's been a big that's been a big mission of mine as well to help educate people about that because i think the reality is ether has these unique money like or or valuable asset like properties that a lot of people haven't really understood i think that defy helped to open the door for people to understand that and um listeners may remember during the last um bold case for ethereum episode where i talked about how the value of an asset is emergent in the sense of it doesn't really matter what people said it was designed to be it's really about how people use it and we've seen that even with bitcoin which was at least stated in the white paper as peer-to-peer digital cash well the network can't scale to support that use case but it kind of had this value as digital gold and that is really what it's being used as today i think similarly ether while it is gas for the network um used to send transactions just like bitcoin is on the bitcoin network has this inherent economic or financial value to it and when i said that defy exposed that what i really mean to say is it really illustrated how ether can be used as a collateral asset and we've seen that ever since the days of maker really um you know as collateral for die but i think through d5 summer we saw that explode across the board into a lot of different use cases and how ether is like the default lp pairing on uniswap and how a tremendous amount of ether has now been locked into d5 i think the current number of eth and d fire around 10 of the supply or it might be a little bit less than that but also add on you know i think it's like 4 million that are staked right now which is also a collateral use of the asset so people are waking up to this idea of ether as this valuable asset and this ultrasound money meme i think has been interesting and controversial in a lot of ways and i will say i think the controversy is good because it gets people to think about ethernet than they might be used to whereas for the past few years the narrative has been ether as gas now we're really thinking about is this money and with eip1559 which i know we're going to talk about later that supply is going to start to potentially deflate as the network is used more and as that supply deflates ether becomes more scarce so i think we're on i think we're actually on the precipice of really jumping the gap into the whole world viewing ether as the world's best kind of natively programmable asset and you know i talked about during the last episode we have we don't really understand how to use that kind of asset yet but but i feel like it's a unique value proposition of ether and ethereum and this narrative and this opportunity is really for ethereum to kind of seize cyrus i think you have a really unique perspective here from your background with a risk at maker dow because you know managing risk at maker dow you really have to get down to the the absolute truth of the nature and structure of these markets right when when maker dao started off a single collateral die you need to understand the liquidity of ether and its available um the available amount of supply and liquidity of ether on the various markets to make sure that risk of the maker dial protocol would actually work which gives you a very interesting perspective as to the nature of ether the asset as a as an asset right where's the liquidity is it on dexes like what what about ave what about compound and i think when you actually started off this conversation about the changing narrative of ether because of its use cases in all these applications how have you seen these applications engaged differently with ether the asset specifically in the in the last six months as it relates to borrowing and lending as it relates to dexes uh and and what can you tell us about the changing market structure of ether and how that's kind of fed into the narrative that surrounded ether as well um well i think you nailed it with the uh liquidity aspect so uh 10 or whatever of all eth locked in smart contracts has kind of uh greatly bolstered the liquidity of kind of everything in the space right every new every new project um you know when they launch their token they build liquidity against heath as an asset pair i think for a while there in you know in the last couple years there were times where people were wondering if uh stable coins would be kind of the native unit of account across the space and should everything be priced in usdc and ethan is just kind of another asset among many these days everything is kind of focuses and revolves around eth uh users investors everyone are just kind of getting really comfortable with using eth as their kind of just base asset in the ecosystem um you know myself personally just kind of interacting a little bit less with stable coins as i kind of like move around between various apps that's just um kind of a change i've noticed in my own trading activity um yeah i i think we're just kind of seeing the the proliferation of eth as kind of the the liquidity anchor of all these different d5 protocols um you know it's not like a huge change from before we've always seen that to some extent but it's just solidifying right it's just the the market for the the liquidity of eth is just exploding indexes uh you can buy huge size you can sell huge size you know as an exercise for anyone listening like go into uh go into the new uniswep v3 uh ui and just kind of like plug in some dummy numbers and and it's it's kind of amazing that you can sell like 100 million or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of eat and and just check out the slippage numbers for yourself uh similarly on the buy side um and i think i think institutions take take note of this type of stuff i mean elon famously said he uh sold a bunch of bitcoin just to kind of test the liquidity of the market um maybe he has to test that otc because the quotes are you know maybe it's to execute a trade for for whatever reason but you know on the ethereum you can just kind of plug into a dex aggregator and just see right now on the spot how much liquidity can you get out of ethan it's pretty hefty i think it's a lot more than you know a couple years ago when i was doing risk at maker so we've got liquidity changes as well for ethiosis acting more as a reserve asset for the space in d5 and anthony i want to throw this question to you too because you uh keep a pulse i think on the narratives maybe better than anybody in this space um sort of like a like a twitter meme lord as it were um you're digesting all of this information do you feel that the narrative has shifted on ether and ethereum over the last six months is it palpable and in what ways has it shifted i mean 100 percent like it has dramatically changed it is as as like someone who's been around since 2017 and experienced all variety of narratives around ether as an asset um even you know over the last six months it's changed so dramatically more dramatically than i i suspected it would and faster than i thought it would change um you know i guess like during d5 summer i think i i pointed defy summer as the point where pretty much like the skeptics and the centrists in both the bitcoin and ethereum communities um basically came over to eat as an asset and realized the potential of it i i created d5 summer to that um and then we did the i think in the podcast was in december which was like a couple months after defy summer or something like that um but since then we've seen yeah i mean it's funny because it's reflexive right the price goes up and then people pay more attention to it because the price is going up and then they you know try to find reasons why the price is going up and then they they see the value in it and then they announce that they see the value in it like mark cuban for example and the price goes up because they announced the value in it and you get this kind of reflexive action that happens um but that is the narrative shift at the end of the day that is more and more people that are not like in the weeds like we are realizing the value of this asset and really making us feel like we're not crazy to think that you know everything that we've built as a community every use case every kind of i guess mechanism that we're building into eth to to kind of like get a crew value to it and to kind of increase this monetary properties like one five five nine and staking that is all coming together and you know for people who weren't around during the bear market uh these things were a thing like uh staking has been a thing for a long time one five five nine was the thing in 2019 but if you had told like any of us like mega eat balls that we would get to the point where we are today in terms of like eighth uh eaves narrative we would have called you crazy because it was just so so different like people even people were using eth as a gas token as an insult they basically said oh you know you only need to pay fees on the network it's it's nothing special well now the ethereum community has flipped that on its head and basically with 1559 we basically say well yes you need to pay fees on the network and that's actually going to drive value directly to eighth and i think um we were talking about the ultrasound money mean before that's where that's culminating as well where people are really kind of thinking to themselves well you know if bitcoin is cap supply that's cool and everything but like what if we could make it deflationary and not just like artificially what if it weren't deflationary based on network activity based on actual utility and usage and people doing things that are valuable to them so i guess generally the the the narrative has changed greatly there but the way i've always thought about ether as an asset is it's like kind of a two-pronged approach where we get the best of of bitcoin we get the best of ethereum and we kind of merge those together because the way i see btc being valued really it's it's based on a lot of faith right it's based on a lot of people of faith that people are going to value this because they want to inflation do an inflation hedge are they going to believe that it's digital gold all this sort of stuff um but where but there's no no real utility to to bitcoin unless you bring it over to ethereum ironically whereas with ethereum the utility of eth is the main value driver but then we also have the other aspects to it where people want to buy it as a store of value or as an inflation hedge or whatever um but the utility comes first and i've always had the thesis for as long as i can remember that ethereum's utility as a network um as long as that value gets sufficiently fed into eth um that will be its main value driver and i think we've seen that with one five five nine um you know everyone's talking about that like that is i think that is a huge reason why people don't want to sell their eat right now um and kept stacking it but also the the staking um kind of memes as well like the triple harvening meme where we're gonna drop issuance by like 90 once the merge happens those those memes have gone extremely far like i i'm talking to people that aren't really like you know in this industry day-to-day and they know about these things um and one five five nine the brand awareness around that number like there's no other eip in history that people know about like one five five nine not even close like you know there are there are other popular eips out there i mean you know there are there are popular ones for for different reasons like there's eip 999 which was the drama around unlocking the parity funds and that was a big deal at the time but no one gives a about that anymore like no one even remembers if it remembers uh what what that's about but one five five nine that has has penetrated not only the rest of crypto but outside of it as well uh and the merge and the triple hardening all that that has all gone outside of of and gone way beyond um you know us ethereans which i think just speaks to the fact that we've done our job of meaning it into reality and now the rest of the world kind of takes that uh away from us and and basically runs with it anthony am i imagining this but like here here's what i felt like i felt like for the first time i mean a core set of eath bulls uh folks on this this podcast some other folks not on this podcast but relatively small set of eath bulls have been beating the drum around his money for a very long time like incessantly and i felt like the first quarter and into the second quarter of this year was the very first time that we started getting others actually believing it and beating the drum themselves like it's it felt like this whole flywheel effect and you know dave and i have talked about you know that meme where it's like a guy at the festival he's the only one dancing he's like dancing solo alone and some people joining the more people joining pretty soon the whole i felt like for the first time the last six months uh there's been a new set of people that are joining the dance party and and saying these same things and i'm i'm talking like institutions right like i'm talking funds i'm talking even leaking into mainstream media am i matching this is this like bull goggles on or did this really happen anthony no it really happened and i actually have a perfect example here of why this happened so one of the detractors of the aether's money meme vlad zamfir um used to work very closely with the ethereum foundation um he through through like the last few years and he still says it to this day that he thought that eth wasn't money um and it's never going to be money well a couple of months ago he sold an nft and its unit of account was eth and he accepted eth for the nft so uh you know even the haters are using ether's money that's when you know you've won right that's when you know the narrative has taken over and the meme of eat as money is a thing but not just the meme it's utility as money is also very true but yeah i totally agree with you like the fact that that people realize that the native unit of account and kind of like uh monetary value that people want to use within ethereum is eighth because one it's the least amount of friction because as i said you have to pay gas fees so you may as well just hold eight for that but two people want to hold each like as an asset they don't want to give it up um you know they'll give it up if they're doing something valuable on the network because they're gonna pay the fees and all that like i'm sure we've all been on fees.wtf and we've seen how much we've paid in fees in the past but um you know it's utility is just undeniable as money now and and i think uh 90 of that is due to the nft economy being priced in eighth a lot of people were like oh okay well there's this new car it's like a video game right where you go into a video game and you basically see okay well this is the native currency of the game it's gold it's not like aud or usd or whatever whereas the native uh economic unit of the ethereum video game if you want to think of it like that is eighth and people just accept that because they're used to that in other kind of worlds and i don't think that's uh that that was ever supposed to be controversial and i don't know why people had to make it controversial it's it's definitely not something that's brand new and i think that at the same i mean really uh without rambling too much here if you look at how people go to other countries and they just accept that this other country has a different currency to what they're used to they're like okay well i have to trade my us dollars for yen if i want to kind of do things in japan right um and of course some of that's been abstracted away because you can use your credit card things like that but but the base currency is still kind of like uh the the country's native currency so people don't bat an eye to that so why should people bat an eye that they uh have to use eighth when they're in the ethereum economy um so yeah i guess like just some general thoughts there on ether's money and why i think that generally it's become like much more of a i guess beyond the mean it's much more of a kind of like truism now cyrus i saw you nodding your head enthusiastically when when ryan was talking about a bunch of people starting to beat the same drum it sounds like you got some thoughts about this yeah yeah i do it's actually really funny because you know ethereum community has historically never been good at memes for me me their way into anything uh i mean i think uh the five of us on the call have suffered through a lot of failed memes in the ethereum community um and you know we appropriately got roasted for it by the broader cryptic community over and over and over again and it kind of became just a kind of running joke that the theater community doesn't know how to meme uh and you know i'll admit when i first when i first heard the ultrasound money meme i i was you know i was kind of rolled my eyes like well here's the start of another uh potentially failed meme and then i was just blown away that that it caught on um you know huge props to banquets dustin drake for kind of um propagating that meme to such great success but uh yeah it's just been really cool to see that it it's almost like the theorem community almost fine finally has like support you know there's community backing there's like a whole world of people out there that are kind of forming the backbone or the spine of ethereum and they're kind of willing to dig their heels in and say no no this is you know this is a meme we're sticking behind and we're gonna we're gonna force this through um and you know it to their to everybody's credit it was a huge success and i think it's just kind of a little bit of a relief that that played out so well yeah well i was just going to add a quick thought on that because i think the reason why i was successful is because the meme is starting to reflect the reality and there's been a huge psychological shift around ether um because as we've talked before it's this thing that used to burn as gas and you still do spend it as gas but now it is this asset that people are hoarding and i think what anthony said is really important and impactful here because when you think about all the participants from the d5 summer period it brought in a lot of traders and trading funds and so on what were they all taking profits in they're all taking profits in ether that that was the start of the shift of that psychology you see the exact same thing among nft flippers as well all they care about is accumulating more ether and so i think this is the ethereum based economy is leading people to think of ether in this way well while we're on the subject of narratives we would be remiss to miss the subject of the energy debate and then the green energy consumption because in my opinion that's one of the big reasons as to why these markets seem to really just grind to a halt at the middle end of may um and and i'm a mixed opinion about the the whole green energy thing because you know people the the eco socialists if you want to call them that are you know got their pitchforks out to go after bitcoin but i actually don't necessarily think ethereum is immune to that the obvious obvious reason is that you know ethereum is currently on proof of work while we can say that we're transitioning to proof of stake and we can say that ethereum will be green uh it's not yet true and also to some degree i'm also not confident at all that people are ready to be able to separate ethereum and proof of stake from from bitcoin but then also able to like lump in you know defy and nfts as part of a green system under a proof of stake paradigm and all kids very confused and you know good luck explaining this to all the normies out there about how like nfts are actually green if ethereum is proof of stake how do you guys think about this whole like energy debate coming online into the narrative into our industry and then also ethereum being this hypothetical green technology but not yet but then there's all this convoluted mess like what's going on dc let's start with you so you know i'll just start off with my personal stance which is i don't think that energy spent to secure a public blockchain is necessarily wasted there is economic value there and and there's security there um and traditionally proof of work has been the best way the best technology that we've had to do that i think as ethereum shifts to proof of stake the narrative is naturally going to shift with it because i think that there's in just i think justin drake's um episode i forget the name of the episode that he did with you guys but he really breaks down how proof of stake has the potential to be a lot more secure than proof of work i think as people start to understand that the massive energy used behind proof-of-work will be harder and more difficult to defend i think right now i feel like you know the entire industry is being painted with a broad brush and it's somewhat unfortunate i think a lot of the esg stuff is kind of you know the kind of like garbage level concerns where people are just kind of piling into a narrative that they don't necessarily understand i've had these discussions with tons of nft people or i shouldn't say nft people but artists who are like on twitter and i've been talking to them about nfts and they just don't get it they're like oh do you know that each transaction spends this much energy and it's like well that's not exactly how these networks work and i do always take the time to try and explain proof of stake and how we're transitioning to this green system but i think at the end of the day we do need to get there um which hopefully we will in under a year but once we get there i think the entire discussion is going to shift in a really dramatic way in a way that's more tethered to reality so anthony i want to ask you this question like so let's let's play that out a little bit so as david set up i mean bitcoin maybe the crypto industry is facing extreme headwinds because of this energy consumption esg issues right and um like as dc just said the the merge to proof of stake hasn't happened yet um it's maybe 12 months away hopefully less hopefully q1 2020 is kind of the estimate so maybe nine months or so away until that time it feels like the industry is going to face some headwinds ethereum included on this issue but let's talk about what happens when proof of stake is activated you know you are a soothsayer of the narratives so like what do you think the narrative shift will be like when there is this transition to proof of stake and ethereum goes negative 99 on energy consumption is that going to be fuel for another bull run type narrative yeah so i guess sometimes i like to say that bitcoin has headwinds and ethereum has tailwinds uh over i guess the next couple of years or so and i do think this has a lot to do with the the energy debate now i don't have any strong opinions for or against here i do think a lot of the arguments that bitcoin is bring up is what about ism because they always point to other industries and say well this industry uses this much energy you know and it uses more than bitcoin it's like yeah christmas lights is always the popular example and i'm like i think to myself i'm like okay cool but like what is this going to do with bitcoin like bitcoin still uses its energy now to decease point yeah energy use when it's put to something valuable and and kind of like helps uh you know lots of people is is fine but i don't think bitcoin's there yet and if bitcoin was the scale to kind of like become the world's reserve currency and everyone was using it it would use a lot more energy than it's using today and is that kind of like worth it is it worth it to consume you know tons and tons of energy to to pay system bitcoiners will argue yes uh i don't have a strong opinion either way right now but i think that the reason why i say that bitcoin has tailwinds is because it's much more uh it's sorry it's much harder to explain to someone uh the bitcoin kind of energy argument like the arguments from bitcoin is because they will come up with lots of different arguments whether they're true or not they're complex because they go into okay well you know the renewable energy actually powers bitcoin mining and all these different jurisdictions have all these different regulations around it and you know there's kind of like mining moving from china to north america and there's like volcano mining now so you know to actually explain the the debate um in in simple terms for for a kind of like person that's new to crypto is very hard and it'd be very hard to convince someone who's skeptical by going into this much detail because you're not going to get that opportunity with most people you know you can't win a narrative war by complicating the issue you need a simple narrative that people can kind of understand so that's why i think ethereum has tailwinds here because when we do merge and people come up to to to us or to anyone and say well you know ethereum is bad because it it uses like this mining thing whatever and and we can just basically hit back and say well no ethereum uses this this thing called proof of stake and it doesn't use uh anywhere near as much energy and that's all we have to say we don't have to go into like specifics or anything like that we don't have to kind of have these convoluted arguments and debates with people so i think that that is a very powerful point for ethereum and something that's going to differentiate it greatly from bitcoin and i actually kind of little bit disagree um i think with what david was saying before about normies not getting this because if you look at tazos they have an nft platform on there i can't remember the exact name of it but that's taken off uh lately because of the fact that they've been marketing to these kind of like energy conscious people these ehg concept conscious people and it's worked um so as i said like the narratives in the marketing really kind of set these things and the easier you can make a a narrative to understand the the uh the more likely it is to perpetuate and have dominance and all i mean the taser marketing was cringe like i saw it was like something about polar bears and like tasers not killing polar bears and ethereum killing polar bears or whatever as as cringe as we think it is that normies don't care like they just see this and they think okay well you know it's not using um the energy that proof of work is using i'm i'm gonna go use this because i'm conscious of this now right now in ethereum land we can't do this we can say oh yeah proof of stake the merge is coming but as soon as you say something like the merge is coming and you have to explain what the merge is you've already lost 99 of people because it's too complicated it's not surface level they don't really care to dive deeper so i i think that once that merge happens we're going to have a much better leg to stand on um and that goes back to why i was saying that ethereum has tailwinds because bitcoin has to do with this in perpetuity they have no plans to move to any sort of proof of stake um and they're going to have to keep dealing with this narrative coming at them um and then they're going to be the lone ranger once ethereum goes to proof of stake because no one cares about the smaller proof of work networks really it's more about just bitcoin um and you know once ethereum changes over that's it i think bitcoin will will just have to take all that on and ethereum can cruise along you know just nicely on and not have to deal with these narratives anymore pent up narrative energy cyrus you have anything to add to that uh yeah um so i i agree with a lot of the points anthony made um one couple in particular that i want to point out is that yeah once you have to start explaining these things to 99 to people 99 of people drop out and i think that kind of brings up uh an interesting point about whether events are priced in or not um so i remember when the beacon chain launched in december even in like the two weeks before launch there kind of really wasn't that much buzz or hype about it and people were even wondering if it was even actually gonna get activated on time and then see it and then as soon as it flipped on everybody all of a sudden said you know holy crap this is live it's here and there's no more having to say well it's coming soon it was actually here and the market blew up and i think we're uh you know my hypothesis is that we're going to witness the same thing again with eip1559 which is you know right now there's just a lot of talk but people people want to see it in action they want to see what the fever looks like and once they do i expect um i expect them to receive it well and then i think kind of the granddaddy of it all will be when when that merge finally comes when when the ethereum community can finally resoundfully say uh we are on proof of stake there's no more energy concerns there's no more esg concerns i think a giant light switch is going to flip in everybody's minds uh including the institutional investors who you know for whatever reason take the the esg stuff very seriously uh you know the blackrock ceo talks about esd a lot there's there's a lot of prominent money managers that treat this issue very seriously and i think it just it i mean i think it's hard to overstate how tremendous the tailwind is for ethereum when that day comes i think it's a little bit hard to kind of kind of push that optimism today but you know i i can wait right we've all been waiting like five years for this thing to come if it takes another year or whatever that's fine we'll wait and then when it comes it'll be uh it'll be interesting but but i think what we can't i think what the bigger problem is for the bitcoin community is that you know i don't really see the esg fud going away i mean in fact it's just gotten stronger and stronger over time it's if anything all of the all of the education you know campaigns and the articles and the interviews and everything i i don't feel like it's really done much to kind of alleviate people's concerns over the energy the energy component and i don't know i mean it's up to them to figure that out i just feel like it's a pretty tough pretty tough gig for them hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation thus far in the second half of the show we bring up the conversation of eip1559 and the also very low gasses that we've been experiencing lately and perhaps the emergence of a lot of people showing up on l2s and staying there what does that mean for eip1559 when it comes to bernie ether are we going to be burning less ether than we thought or what's the story here and then we also ask the guests what they think about the whole layer to summer idea or the idea that there's going to be a ton of yield farming on a bunch of different layer twos in order to help distribute the tokens for the l2s as well as the tokens of the defy apps we also touch on it taos and digital organizations and what the panelists think about the rise of dows that we've seen in the last quarter or so we then finish up of course with some price predictions which turns into actually a pretty interesting conversation about uh and i'll give you a little tease here about how and why cyrus doesn't give out price predictions and uh it turns into a longer conversation than i thought was originally coming but was actually uh very interesting and i think you guys are really going to enjoy it but first before we get there we have to take a moment and talk about some of these fantastic

you brought up 1559 so i want to turn the conversation there uh everyone was really excited about eip well not everyone but the people that really care about ether as a monetary asset got really really excited about eip1559 back when gray gas prices were 200 300 400 gas but lately especially in the last two three weeks gas prices have been consistently below 20 gray and in under this current market structure we actually wouldn't be burning all that much eath at least in comparison to what historically we would have been burning in throughout most of 2021. so how's your outlook changed about eip1559 and how much ether it would actually burn because of these lower gas fees that we've experienced in the last like you know two three four weeks um i mean i think the i think the community has is certainly experiencing some schizophrenia with respect to whether they want high fees or low fees um you know high fees is more burned but horrible user experience um you know the bitcoin community has the same right like you know there some of their core devs famously celebrated high fees because the kind of uh is that the security can maintain itself um here's the thing ultimately like the the demand that's pouring into ethereum i think is hard to predict and i don't think we should count our chickens too early with respect to low gas fees we could we could see ourselves in a you know 1 000 way environment again before we know it and then we will all be begging to see low fees again um i think we just want to strike a harmony between issuance ux fees burn right like we can't we can't say we want super high fees for maximum burn but also have like an incredibly good ux for users especially uh you know new users who don't have like you know not necessarily early to the space and just can't afford high fees in the first place we can't have it all right and i think all we can hope for is to just strike a good balance between everything that's that kind of creates a consistent uh narrative kind of an egalitarian system where high fees are paid when it's appropriate to do so and that goes into the burn pile um but in times of kind of smaller usage you know we should we should celebrate users paying low fees and and being able to onboard more users and create more adoption and so forth so that that line that cyrus is just mentioning dc really resonated with me that like the schizophrenia line because sometimes god i feel like it's damned if you do damned if you don't with ethereum like among skeptics right it's like um gas fees are high because everyone in the world wants ethereum block space and people act like that is the worst thing ever and this is why the eath killers are going to win and other layer ones are going to like slay eath and it's never going to scale never going to work now we've got gas fees they've gone low possibly because we're doing things like like flash bots right so we're helping solve the mev problem we also have some layer two solutions coming online some sign chains coming online and now they're like well you know no one wants block space so i kind of take the reverse of that and i'm sure the bull panel here does too which is like if gas fees are high awesome why because eip1559 if gas fees are low awesome because cheaper transactions for the masses what's your take and take a look at this holistically for us dc uh eip 1559 as a mechanism is the first time um ether will actually be burnt uh to to anthony's point as the network is used more what does this mean for ethereum and the bull case yeah i wrote a tweet a couple of days ago where i said um you know when gas fees were high everyone was saying ethereum is dead and when the low everyone says ethereum is dead and maybe people just don't know what they're talking about at the end of the day so here's my take on this i think 1559 is an elegant mechanism regardless of how much ether it actually burns because one it's still going to reduce the amount of minor selling um on a regular basis because of how the burning mechanism works and two you know when you think about the burning component of it it's not necessarily about deflating the supply in in a significant way there will be periods when the supply will deflate significantly that correspond with greater usage but it's all about helping to keep the supply in check right so we will on a fairly regular basis either reduce that inflation or eliminate it completely through or the the new issuance of supply we're negating it basically and i think that's still important i also think i just i do want to talk about the ux improvement for a second because i know it gets glossed over sometimes but the idea of having a user be able to submit a transaction and having a high degree of liability that's going to be included in the next block is actually really huge i mean that is one of the biggest barriers anyone i know the five of us but anyone who's listening to this podcast who's introduced ethereum to a friend and they've hit a stuck transaction because they put it right when fees were going up and you know they didn't know how to cancel it or speed it up i mean those types of things are going to be a thing of the past for the most part it's also really useful for rollups which i think are actually going to stack additively with eip1559 but rollups need that assurance of getting those transactions in in the next block and eip 1559 is going to let us do that so i'm going to counter what cyrus said is we can't have it all i actually think with layer 2 we can have it all i think eventually over time fees on layer one will probably tend towards being more expensive and i will i will say so imagine this imagine we're in an l2 centric world right and l2 is layer two for those who may not be aware but really what layer twos rollups do is they increase the density of transactions that are possible on layer one so in the same space that you would have had one transaction on layer one before in an l2 i think of it almost like a skyscraper you now have dozens or hundreds of transactions in in that same amount of block space so you're increasing that density so what are those so if we start having a whole bunch of roll-ups eventually on ethereum um say five years from now guess what they're all going to be willing and able to pay much higher gas fees on layer one and if there's enough of them and if there's enough demand to use the chain they're going to have to so i think the the play on eip 1559 is actually a really long multi-year play where we look at where we look at layer one evolve into kind of this trust layer um and the value of that trust layer actually will go up over time as my hypothesis i can definitely vibe with that anthony i know you got you yeah i know you got thoughts let me hear them yeah i got i got thoughts so the way i think about the schizophrenia that people are feeling is that this is this is the crux of it high individual fees are bad right high fees for end users are bad high aggregate fees are good and this is talking to to what dc was just saying about roll ups being the ones that are going to demand the block space now as they say was saying what are roll-ups they're basically just you know hundreds if not thousands of transactions that get compressed into one that gets posted to the ethereum blockchain so the way i view layer one and the way i view the fee the fees being paid there is that people are willing to pay higher fees when they're going to get economic value out of it so we could typically see the fees go much higher during uh market volatility to the upside because there's so much money to be made everyone's having a great time you know you don't care that you have to pay 50 to harvest yields because you just made like a few hundred dollars in a day and it's all just like free money to you at the end of the day also people paying the fees uh have been holding either for a while so to them that it doesn't feel like a lot because they've made a lot of money from from ethel already going up in value so that that is a temporary phenomenon i believe i think the long term is that the the highest value transactions that are going to be on layer one will be those roll-up proofs roll-up providers are going to pay whatever is necessary to get their transactions into a block and eventually we're going to have so many roll ups that that that's going to be what layer 1 is it's just going to be a security chain for these rollup transactions and there might be some whales playing you know in the waters there still but most users you know majority 99 of users are gonna sit at layer two and they will still be fueling the uh the layer ones kind of um fee revenue because they're using these layer twos but they in the individual fees for them are going to be very very very low compared to the individual fees so on layer one so we have the aggregate fees on layer one still being high we have a nice fee burn going on uh perpetually i think what people forget is that just because the fees are maybe not going to be higher when one five five nine goes live doesn't mean they're not going to be high in the future and doesn't mean that um you know we're still not burning a lot of eight i mean even at today's gas prices we're still burning five mil uh not five million dollars we're still doing five million dollars of fee revenue most of that which will be burned and i saw a statistic the other day that someone said that at post merge even at 10 way as an average gas price eighth will become deflationary because the uh issuance on the people of stake is much lower so we only need 10 grey whereas in in proof of work we need like 100 way for that to work now i think tengwei or like the prices that we're seeing today are are just like a short-term thing i think that as these roll-ups come online in a very big way they're gonna eat into this block space and and basically be the only things on there and that's okay that's the way that ethereum is designed ethereum is not designed where layer one should be where everyone sits and and we're not scaling via layer one for the world layer one scaling and improvements to layer one are to service the layer two ecosystem where you know all these other teams will be deploying onto um you know we're already seeing them deploy onto onto that as well so i just take that kind of view and i mean i always take the long term view here and if the market hits up again we're still not in a in a world where the layer two ecosystem is anywhere near mature enough to to kind of like capture all of this it will still be captured by a layer one and users will be happy to pay a hundred way fees again because they're making money and i mean i made a joke tweet once where i said that people complaining about gas fees as they go to cash out on some unisop gem that just 5xed in a week uh it's just it's always hilarious when i when i see that it's like well you know the fact that you're willing to pay the fee in the first place means that the transaction is worth more to you than the fee is because you wouldn't be paying a 50 fee to get 10 of economic activity out of it uh because that's just not logical to do so um unless it was maybe it was an nft that you really valued personally or something but normally you're not going to pay fifty dollars to trade uh a token from you know that token to eighth if it's only twenty dollars worth of that token because there's just no no point in doing that uh so that's how i kind of think about the layer one layer two dynamic and how that eventually users are just not going to even care about like those layer one fees anymore and their roll ups going to be the ones that are posting the transactions and and paying whatever fee is necessary to get into that block space and which is where the long term nice fee burn is going to come from with one five five nine so this panel has mentioned uh layer two a whole bunch and we need to dig into layer two but before we do i i want to camp in on something you said so you said anthony that even at 10 way gas fees post merge eth is still deflationary it's still ultrasound money and i'm wondering if you could help square this so david and i were on a recent podcast we did with the bitcoiner uh preston pish and he described himself as kind of like uh not quite his words but i think i'm summing it up accurately it's like a scarcity maximalist basically i believe in the stock to flow ratio and i believe bitcoin price go up because miners have less bitcoin to sell and so we kind of presented the case of like hey have you heard about the triple hack like in in ethereum have you heard about eip 1559 have you heard about the merge and how issuance drops to one percent and then perhaps goes deflationary with eip1559 fees if you are a scarcity maximalist friend like take a look at this ultra scarce asset uh the reason i still feel super bullish on eth anthony is because i don't feel like we've had some successes in the last six months but i still don't feel like people understand this narrative like there's still maybe under 10 000 of us who actually understand what is about so many people understand every four years there's a bitcoin happening and they're like okay every four years it's bullish bitcoin okay i get that almost no one still understands these scarcity catalysts that are about to be dropped like an atomic bomb on ethereum like can you reflect on that it's like what's what it just doesn't make sense that conversation with preston did not make sense to me and i'm wondering if you could make some sense of it so i i i i think i can and one thing i want to push back on is people who say they're scarcity maximalist because scarcity is only one side of the coin if there's no demand for your scarce asset that you think is scarce and whatever then it doesn't really matter like you can print a token on ethereum and make 100 of them but if no one wants it then it's not scarce right like just because just because not much is available to buy um doesn't mean anything so i think uh being a scarcity maximalist is a bit of a funny thing that bitcoin has like to say um but in saying that scarcity is is good when it has a demand side and that's exactly what ethereum is going to have with i mean it already has that but with one five five nine we basically channel that demand side into driving value to eight as an asset here so um and and on your point about who understands this i mean i think it's way less than 10 000 people who actually understand the implications of a ultrasound money world which basically just describes the world post 1559 and post merge and that has been my thesis for it for a very long time is that i if it takes you know a while for people to clue into this that's fine but by the time we get to the point where the majority have clued into it each price is going to be like you know much higher than what what it is previously and that's why i was buying eth during the bear market you know one to 200 range we sat there for a long time i was buying ether there with the thesis that people are going to discover uh staking that uh and it drives value to eth and i i believed that proof of stake was going to happen a lot of people didn't a lot of people still don't because they think that real proof of stake is when the merge goes through so and and same with one five five nine i remember having arguments in late 2020 or debates on twitter with people smart people who were saying um that you know you're betting on one five five nine being delivered you're betting on staking being delivered it's like yeah but isn't that investing like when you invest in something and you're look having an outlook on the future you're betting that these things are going to be delivered even with big or betting that more and more people are going to buy bitcoin and it's going to increase the scarcity because more of it gets taken out of out of uncirculating supply so at the end of the day if you're a good investor you don't wait for things to happen you do it before it happens and you know 1559 april 2019 was when the eip uh was first proposed i think eth was trading at like 200 or something back then so if you had bought then with the thesis that one 559 would be delivered you'd be doing really well but if you had waited until the the official kind of uh a date was given or not maybe not so much the date but if you waited till that was merged into the network you would be buying either at least 10x i can't remember the exact price but you know at least 10x of what it was then so if you're a scarcity maximalist that's fine but you have to account for the demand side as well and i think that the demand side really is that awareness side at the end of the day like if you think that more and more people are going to come into bitcoin because most people don't own it well then you should be thinking that about ethereum because to me there's just many more ways for people to get into ethereum and many more ways people to use eth because there's defy and nfts and and dows and like everything like that so if you're a scarcity maximalist then you should definitely look into ultrasound money it's not just the meme it accurately describes exactly what ethereum is gunning for here um and if you wait until this happens because you're skeptical that it will happen well then you're just giving up all the alpha to everyone else like it could be 10k by the time the the merger goes through like that's not far-fetched to say because the merger is slated for q1 2022 so um and that's like nine months away from now or something like that so from from that perspective uh if people really are scarcity maximalists then they should uh definitely look at a look at ethan and the ultrasound money stuff but i guess that there's priors there as well you know a lot of scarcity maximalist uh list and they think ethereum is a scam no matter what so that's fine they can think that you know maybe the flipping will happen and then they'll shut up about um if you're in being a scam uh we said that for it yeah i said it now let's cast it okay so like i i want to get this just a quick pull from our ethanol panelists so confidence that both eip1559 happens and the merge happens within the next nine months to 18 months i'll give it a large width because to cyrus's point we're happy to wait two but nine to 18 months confidence that these two things will happen dc what's your confidence out of a hundred percent how confident are you um i i don't want to say a hundred percent so i'm going to say 99 and 99 anthony how about you yeah same thing 99 only because um you know the world could end and it's not 100 cyrus what about you how confident um i mean eip1559 for sure will happen in that time frame um you know i i don't i don't want to get kicked off the panel for saying this but um uh 18 months for the merge maybe hopefully you know i think currently the estimates currently the estimates i'm hearing are uh q1 uh so that's roughly six to nine months if it with another tolerance band of another six to nine months then yeah it should happen but you know i we should all be cognizant of you know fairly difficult technical lift throw a percentage out i know you are risk manager make your doubt sure i'll say like i'll say like 75 okay please anybody confident all of us highly confident david what do you want to say something i always think is pretty funny when uh bitcoiners and and other people other uh people that want to just dead on ethereum and or just generally ethereum naysayers they say like well you know the the merge is going to to come and like you know what if something goes wrong right what if what if something breaks uh and you know oh no then then it then it's broken and i think people really just kind of forget to think about like well if it doesn't go right we'll fix it like we'll just figure it out uh i mean there's a number it's hard to like you know ideate and like you know conceptualize about a hypothetical breaking scenario but the last thing i'll ever want to do is to bet against ethereum developers and you know it really depends on if if we were talking about a breaking scenario how that break actually happens but there's numerous different ways to route around a problem and so if something goes wrong it's not the end-all be-all it's not like oh well guess that we tried that like i guess we can't do that anymore i was like no we'll just do it again and we'll try again later and so the question of like if we don't get it right the first time has never ever been like a sensical one to me and i keep hearing it from from different bitcoiners all the times like oh yeah this the the the technical like complexity and the execution risk is so incredibly high that i can't just be i just can't bet on ethereum this is what preston pitch was saying on our podcast he's like the technical risks is too high well the technical risk is high if you are thinking that it's a one shot and you only have one shot and people are forgetting like no we have as many shots as it'll take to get the job done and do you guys feel i feel like i'm taking crazy pills did you guys can you guys like reflect on this with me anthony anthony uh do you have any thoughts i i mean yeah and this is like i guess so you can't reason with someone who someone's argument if they haven't used reason to get into that argument right and by saying stuff like if something goes wrong and that's it can't be fixed well you haven't used reason to get into that argument because that has never happened in the history of humanity where we've given up on something just because it went wrong the first time if we did that then we wouldn't even be where we are anywhere near where we are today we probably would have been wiped out because we wouldn't have evolved right it's the the way technology works is a process of trial and error trial and error like 100 thousands tens of thousands millions of times over and over and over again that's played out across every kind of technology in history that has played out within ethereum on basically speed running it i mean ethereum is speed running finance at the end of the day um and and that's what we need to get there now to say and that's not to say that we should have like um an error when we do the merge like like hopefully it goes through like perfectly the first time but the thing is is that we're not doing the merge the mainnet merge before we've done test nets and we've already started doing test nets we've already proved that it can work and we're going to do more and more rigorous testing here there's going to be you know audits there's going to be like people looking at the code like you know lots of people looking at the code making sure everything's fine there's going to be you know a ton of effort that goes into it uh before we even get to the point where we do a main net launch and and for people to say oh well you know none of it was tested or it's it's it has a higher chance it can fail well it's like this is why we do the the test things because we know there's a high chance it can fail so let's make let's lower that chance as much as possible and that's exactly what played out with the beacon chain uh there was tons of test nets for the beacon chain and then once we got to the main net it launched perfectly like literally it was the perfect launch everything went right like nothing could have gone better with that launch so if we can replicate that with the merge which i believe we will and i believe the merge is actually more important to get right than the beacon chain launching was because we are merging in a you know a massive network i think that it's going to be fine i i don't foresee something like going wrong i think that there's a small chance of something could go wrong but in saying that as you said david we can come back from that we can rebuild it's not a death now it's not like the network the ethereum network is dead in its tracks and i think bitcoin is know this because if something went wrong with bitcoin it's the same thing that would just basically go back and fix that uh and you know it doesn't matter if it's against their principles to roll back the chain or whatever if it put the network at critical risk if the network was basically going to die if they didn't do this they would do it like i just look at what people do and not not what they say at the end of the day i think is is the rule of thumb here but yeah i guess like those are my general thoughts on this maybe dc has something to say here yeah i've got a couple of thoughts and um you know some people may not be aware but i'm actually a participant in some of the merge calls and discussions um and and justin drake and danny ryan asked me to participate in this as kind of a community advisor so i'm going to give a little bit of context behind why i think 99 over the next um you know 18 months is ryan throughout but first i think the hardest part is actually already done which was getting the beacon chain up and the beacon chain really represents this bonded validator network and i just checked the deposit contract so there's 5.6 million ether in the deposit contract wow that is that's a staggering number so that's over 10 billion dollars worth of economic value based on current eth prices um those people that that is basically a bond on this getting done if that doesn't get done if the network is not merged those either gonna remain frozen forever so that's a huge economic bounty to actually get the work done but i think the other thing that's really important in this discussion is the development teams are having really serious conversations now around once we get through the um the upcoming hard fork in july maybe there's going to be one more kind of limited feature fork after that one or two months after that but after that the the likely situation is both the legacy eth1 and legacy e2 teams basically are going to merge together and they are not going to do anything else except focus on the merge there is a lot of there's a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm around this people understand the urgency people understand the esg discussions that are happening across the space people understand that this is ethereum's moment so yes there could always be technical difficulties that arise but there's been also a lot of encouraging results from even the east global scaling hackathon where they were able to get some of these clients to talk to one another in a really rudimentary way so i i don't know i'm pretty optimistic on even a one year time frame and obviously fingers crossed but that's really what i'm going to be looking for yeah i think to your point for me personally too like dc and and like it was once the beacon chain shipped and it went well the execution risk for ethereum eth2 as as we've called it precipitously dropped in my mind like that was the hardest part of this whole thing that was the thing no one said could be done for the last two years and and that was done and that feels like the hard part we'll see where we go from here the other thing i want to talk about this because you guys have brought this up several times during the course of the conversation is layer two uh david and i have called kind of a layer two summer maybe around the corner right it's it's summertime and it feels like finally layer two on ethereum is starting to ship starting ship some cool things like optimism has been delayed but here's arbitrum coming up with a deployment that will probably uh cut the ticker tape in the next weeks to months you with with d5 apps let's talk about this um layer two summer what do you think about that is layer two finally here and is this the solution that ethereum's been looking for from a scalability perspective let's start with udc so i think that um summer and and i'll just you know in the northern hemisphere we're at the start of summer right now maybe a little too soon for us to really look at the results from this but i think certainly by the fall time frame so let's say october september to october time frame things are really going to heat up so i think arbitrary is already now in a limited developer release where developers are exploring developing the platform optimism is kind of in a similar boat but hasn't expanded quite as much but and arbitrary is actually operating on mainnet so people can start to kind of see how it works i think in order for it to hit we need both of those live most likely and i think what is it going to look like so first imagine that you're going to be able to do a lot of traditional activities like trading and other types of stuff that you're doing on chain today you'll be able to do it on l2 a lot cheaper potentially i think the gas cost will be somewhere between 1 10th to 120th of what a similar transaction would be on chain it depends on the transaction but i think that's a pretty good rough order of magnitude in terms of how much cheaper you can expect at first i thought it was going to be hard to get people to use some of these l2s which in the properties of l2s by the way are they are mathematically secured by layer one and so they basically have the same security guarantees as a transaction on layer one but it and so i thought it would be awkward at first but after seeing how how much side chains have taken off like polygon um even like you could even call binance smart chain a side chain of ethereum because it runs evm um people don't have a problem using some of these other platforms so i think l2 will take off and i think institutions and big players will be willing to deposit millions or even billions of dollars into these l2 platforms um it could be awkward at first i think we're going to see a little bit of awkwardness in terms of well you know which roll up or is this app on and how do we work together but i actually don't think it's going to be as bad as people think because one a lot of the value that apps have on ethereum is represented in kind of what i'll call like a rap token you know it's this portable token this portable value that embodies that app's functionality and those can just move over to l2 without any additional trust assumptions so if you're if you're using a urine vault maybe you're not depositing directly into the vault maybe you're buying one of the vault tokens and our arbitrage bots are managing the deposit of additional funds into a urine vault for you and you can take that application and expand it i think what i'm most excited about for l2 summer fall whenever it is is there's going to be a new cambrian explosion of development on ethereum because the design space is about to get a whole lot bigger because things that may not have been cost effective before all of a sudden are cost effective so i'm going to be looking at stuff like smart contract wallets i think smart contract wallets could become the default on layer 2 because it will actually be cheap enough to do that and that that will also help onboard more mainstream users i think apps are going to be able to do a lot of other things experimenting with higher throughput and cheaper transactions and i think we're still going to see a successful sidechain ecosystem with chains like polygon for activities which may not require the same security as l1 or l2 part of the d5 summer meme is is partly an allusion to how we are coming up on summertime at least in the northern northern hemisphere anthony will make sure to let you know that it's not summer everywhere uh but it's also an allusion to d5 summer 1.0 which is the uh it just happened to happen in summer but it was really more of a speculative yield farming you know mania of sorts and really it was a story of a bunch of applications distributing their token and kind of the defy summer thesis is that while these l2s are probably going to have tokens people have the incentive to issue tokens people like tokens therefore they're going to issue tokens therefore there's going to be this yield farming speculative bubble that comes and arises on specifically l2s so cyrus i actually want to turn this one question to you because i do believe that you perhaps dabble in the whole yield farming universe um is this something that you see on the horizon is this something that you are preparing for how does the whole like defy summer yield farming on l2's narrative land with you is that is that something that that is valid in your mind yeah so uh i feel like there is an enormous amount of capital on the sidelines right now that are um they're not comfortable with bridging to the finance smart chain because it's centralization concerns they're not comfortable moving over to other l1 chains such as solana which would you know maybe require them to divest their eth and and kind of purchase a new speculative token and you know they may not be um comfortable with kind of the the trade-offs of some of the current popular side chains i think uh i think there's a lot of capital waiting for this kind of silver bullet l2 solution such as optimism arbitrim i think once that happens i think um [Music] i think we'll see a lot of tvl very very quickly following afterwards um i think i i think i'm most excited about kind of what it means for kind of reclaiming some of the lost users um so i think look a lot of defy summer farms was uh maybe uh not the not the most economically meaningful activity i mean i'm just kind of thinking back to a lot of the food farms and all that like i'm not trying to like recreate you know the magic of food farms on on this new uh l2 summer i want to just you know for me lt summer is just bringing users back to do normal things just kind of using maker using compound using ave um bringing back the lost users um i mean arguably if if if we're bringing in kind of you know a ton of more capital 10 or more users and that would be bad for yields you know it would kind of be like the opposite of a d5 summer which to me meant like astronomical yields and a lot of kind of scammy uh scammy types of projects i just want to see more users and more kind of d54 for the masses i think that would be a more accurate description of success than um you know just these weird forms that we typically see anthony so i have two questions for you about layer two and about layer two uh summer um so the the first is this is this ethereum's scalability solution i don't want to say the silver bullet but is this basically how ethereum is going to scale are you bullish on the current iteration of layer twos to do that and the second is what about this this problem that some see where the economic transaction activity starts to happen on layer twos and not ethereum main net does that decrease uh block space value on ethereum and erode sort of the the value proposition of things like eip 1559 you know you partially address that but i want you to maybe more comprehensively address it there so those two questions is this ethereum scalability silver bullet and does it erode may net block space value so i want to start by saying that no nothing is a silver bullet ever in this technology and i think people should really um come to terms with that because i think sometimes the narratives get ahead of the technology and people view things as like a silver bullet as if we'll flip a switch and you know all these problems will be solved i don't think that is the case here in saying that uh obviously i'm extremely bullish on layer 2 technologies i think that roll-ups uh at least for the foreseeable future are the way we're going to go maybe we discover something better than a rollup i mean there's other constructions out there uh like validium uh from starkware and zk porter which are like hybrid solutions which achieve more scalability but you get less kind of like security because instead of all the data being on chain it is posted off chain as part of some data availability committee and you do all this fancy cryptography stuff to make sure that's fine i'm not going to go into the details there but essentially for the foreseeable future roll-ups are the way to go now i was listening to the uh arbitrary guys on your podcast recently um on the bankless podcast where they said that you know if we had all these roll-ups live the the most tps we could get across all of them if we filled up ethereum's block space would be 4 500 transactions per second because at the end of the day layer 2s are still limited by layer 1 scalability because layer 1 can only do 14 transactions per second and depending on the transactions that you do is the cost is going to go up uh because of the way gas works and all that sort of stuff there so so from that point of view i do i do think that layer twos are going to greatly help with the scalability challenges that ethereum is facing but we need layer 1 scaling on top of that as well we need things like sharding that enhance layer 2 scalability and we need things like statelessness for people who aren't aware of that that's a initiative to basically make ethereum a stateless system which means that we can basically raise the gas limit much higher than it is today because we don't have to account for the state growth now you can google that if you want to learn more about it but that's uh that's another significant thing that's coming to ethereum scalability so i think really there's no silver bullet the way forward is just to do as much um scaling as we can do on layer one while preserving their decentralization and security but also um leverage the layer two ecosystem to to give us like one hundred ten you know a thousand times throughput that we'll get on layer one and i think that that layer twos are really going to shine once sharding comes in because we're gonna have a a greater increase in throughput because of that but in saying that i don't think that there's going to be you know enough demand to fill all the layer twos to to the brim and to make it you know to make layer twos kind of start reaching their limits in the short to medium term i do think that people still underestimate kind of like how i guess like i guess like how long it's going to take for this stuff to play out like yes we get pockets of of manias that last you know manias can last a little while but once the mania subsides we've seen what happens like most users simply just leave and and i think the the way i measure mania is by the gas prices on ethereum now because during um the hot market like as i said people are happy to pay 200 way 300 whatever but now when the market's quiet like uh people aren't paying that anymore because there's no reason to so we're at ten ten way and that came down pretty dramatically uh as the market came down so pretty much correlated um so so that that kind of like i think answers the first part to the second part of your question about um you know people concerns like i saw some concerns that layer one would become like a ghost chain because everyone's gonna be at layer two well this goes back to what i was saying uh previously about how layer two transactions roll-up transactions are the most valuable things that are gonna be posted to ethereum layer one nothing is more valuable than wrapping thousands of user transactions from layer two and posting a proof of that to secure it on layer one uh so from that point of view roll-ups transactions and roll-up proofs were eventually gonna push out everyone from player one anyway because they are happy to pay hundreds of dollars in fees and thousands of dollars tens of thousands a day they're happy with that because they know that they uh that that is coming from the layer two security and in aggregate and as i was saying before the users are paying small individual fees on layer two but in aggregate those fees um are going towards paying layer one security because in aggregate they're still high so um i i think people just need to kind of like take a bit of a zoomed out view here and look at what long term layer one's gonna be and read uh this kind of research process from vitalik called ethereum a rollup centric roadmap that is exactly what's going to happen rollups are going to be the dominant transactions on layer one uh they're going to push out everything else because it's a competitive network and they're going to be competing they're going to be happy to pay higher fees than other users and that is that is how the system has been designed so from that point of view i think that people calling layer one is gonna be a ghost chain because everyone moves to layer two uh i think maybe in the short term we'll still see lower fees because there's not that many roll-up transactions yet but as we we kind of scale out as this kind of stuff gets you know so in demand that we have literally millions of transactions um per second uh sorry demand or something like one day then we're gonna get to that point where layer one is so kind of like constrained that roll-ups of the literally even the whales won't even be uh be able to afford it anymore it'll just be roll-ups so a future where one thousand two thousand three thousand way uh is a norm is not too far away but that's not what users have to pay that will be what the layer 2 rollups will have to pay to secure themselves and the users will just be paying the smaller fees on layer 2 which in aggregate will go to securing on layer 1. so hopefully that kind of like covers that concern as well but i do think generally people should just take a longer term view on this sort of stuff and and forget the noise forget the short-term stuff like it it has no bearing on the long-term uh vision here guys we are coming down to the close of this interview and we want to return back to ether and markets but before we get there we would be remiss to talk about one of the big stories of 2021 which is taos and digital organization we have seen a ton of dows crop up in the last last few months uh bankless dao is one of them uh gatecoin dao is another one and interesting and notably i would like to i would like to plant a flag and say like a lot of the that have come out recently are specifically what i'm calling off chained outs as in specifically materially different from dowels like yearn or uniswap which control smart contracts on ethereum other these new dowels are more in the social layer more in the meat space me space layer more on discord so how what what's the bull case for daos and how does it relate to the bold case for ethereum in ether uh dc let's start with you so i overall i think dows represent a really exciting frontier in ethereum in in blockchains in general i think we're still in the very early innings of this and so we're going to try and fail with a lot of things i think some of the bold case from my perspective is ethereum d5 nfts these are all things that are truly global so giving people a decentralized framework and enforced by code where it's appropriate is going to create new forms of cooperation that aren't possible whether that's a shared treasury or or something else we've already seen this with some of these nft dows where people are coming together to buy these nfts spending millions of dollars in some cases shout out yeah that pleaser down is a great example of that um i do think that there are some headwinds headwinds for for dallas as well because i think it's important that dao's set clear purposes for what they're really trying to achieve and i think some of the recent doubts that i've seen spin up don't really set that purpose from the outset they will galvanize around a given nft or something that they're buying and then they come up with a purpose afterwards that can be okay too but i do think it needs to happen somewhat quickly i think also dao should really set clear entry and exit processes early on especially if liquidity big sums of money are involved because those are types of things that people um that i would like to see so that we avoid bad behavior and so on and third i think um ongoing coordination challenges are definitely going to be a challenge for dows that aren't ready to address those directly i think we're going to see a lot of successful corporate management structures frankly mirror themselves in the dow form whether that's like hiring coordinators that are keeping the trains running on time and so on um i think that those things are important so i think that taos are really immature in terms of where they're going to be within five years cyrus i'm curious your perspective on daos you know you having worked for one in fact and i i kind of think of dao's as almost like a internet native programmable llc or c corp right so like all the structure needs to be put in them but if someone were to ask me are daos the future right and like well we just created the the internet native c corp like of course they will be we're still trying to figure out how to run these things and operate them but like this is a a new way of organizing capital in the digital era um what what's your take on on dows maybe not in their current form as kind of these prototype dials but like in their final form what do you think about these structures yeah and i think it's important to highlight that like the current form is maybe not the best representation um because i think just looking around the ecosystem you can see just kind of dozens of wildly different structured dowels and i think it's clear that there's still a lot of experimentation going on on what the proper uh structure is both from a smart contract and a legal perspective um but you know i think like daos are like such a um you know typical ethereum type of uh idea where you know just kind of this pie in the sky thing that can do unimaginable things and you know gets ridiculed for years and you have a bunch of blow-ups and failures um you know i think we've all seen countless dows and dow structures fail and and there's just something about like the grittiness of the community where they're just like really determined to to make this work and see it happen and they just kind of keep going back to the drawing board and now we're we're starting to see the the beginnings of successful taos uh groups of kind of um community members who obviously don't necessarily know each other starting to achieve uh interesting things and i think it's it's actually becoming pretty scary as kind of as a thought experiment of where this can lead to um i'm a little bit scared by what uh incentivized collaborative pseudonymous communities can can create um but it's uh you know from a capital coordination perspective it's obviously incredible um like holy we're just we're seeing we're seeing organizations allocate hundreds of millions of dollars around to various uh various endeavors um and this is kind of just the beginning so it's only starting to grow like what happens when they start you know playing around with milli uh with billions or tens of billions of dollars um you know i'm not really like visionary enough to know like with that what that future world will look like but i can i can see the kind of the the j curve or the hockey stick growth like it's starting to get going and i think it's gonna just blow our minds and in ways that you know doubts are one of those things that just one of the hardest things to predict what it will look like in in a few years from now it's like it's fairly easy to see how the d5 space will evolve because there's a lot of um there's a lot of traditional finance counterparts to to kind of emulate or model after but we're not talking about taking companies that are you know typically um you know based on a particular country or nationalistic or uh physical brick and mortar and now we're creating like global digital organizations and i mean i i don't know i i think that's just absolutely wild um and scary anthony what's your thoughts on daos and how it relates to ethereum and ether yeah so i pretty much agree with with everything dc and cyrus said here um i think the long-term view that i have on dows is that they're going to be the best ways that humanity has to coordinate both socially and um with capital as well and we've already seen pockets of this play out like please dao was mentioned i think you know people came together within 24 hours pulled capital and basically created this dao to bid on um people pleasers artwork for unity swap and now they've taken that further um and basically bidding and acquiring lots of different like nfts within the ecosystem so i think that just that as like a a small example will be looked back on as something that uh was like you know part of like ethereum's uh history and the history of dao's when we look back in like 10 years or something like that as something that kick-started this whole thing um but yeah i mean there's been plenty of dow experiments in the past uh maker dow is probably the earliest and biggest kind of tower to this day obviously we had the dao in 2016 that blew up completely um it didn't really work out in the end but i think you know as as um someone was saying before like uh these experiments are just gonna you know keep playing out over time it's not like we're gonna stop uh stop doing this stuff just because we had one blob or two blobs or whatever um but i think i think that people are getting smarter with it now the the entertained owls uh as you mentioned david things like uni-swap and and like arvand stuff like that like like the grants programs as well coming out of these things are really cool where the dowels are basically um allocating capital to two different builders within the ecosystem to to build different things uh whether that's as a developer or to do marketing or bd or whatever um and then on top of that yeah we have like the please of the hours of the world uh and and as cyrus was saying it is it does get a little bit scary when you think about what can be achieved when you have basically an honor people that are anonymous or pseudonymous where they can basically do anything they want with with these kind of like um tokens or this money that we have because there's no kyc or aml there's no regulations there's no way to stop people from doing what they want with their money and that's a double-edged sword because it means that you know the the good people can do whatever they want but the bad people can as well so will we see like ransomware dowse for example where you know the more kind of like ransom you get the the more value this dow gets and the more value that the token backing this down gets so um and that just would incentivize people to keep kind of like doing ransomware things because we've seen this a lot in the news lately but i i think that that would incentivize people that are holding the token to basically start doing uh generating revenue for the dow by hitting more people with more companies and more people with ransoms like ransom software for example of ransomware software for example so i think that that is the dark side but at the end of the day you know this is just what happens with every technology that is a neutral kind of technology like the internet is the reason why ransomware can kind of like exist and in such a big way it's not like people were saying oh it's bitcoin's fault because crypto makes it a lot easier it's like well but it was already happening before before crypto um and and maybe crypto makes it easier for people like bad people to coordinate capital but it's already been happening for thousands of years um and it still happens to this day in a very big way and even banks have been caught uh basically holding money for criminals and and and getting involved in this sort of stuff so at the end at the end of the day these tools will just be used for for different purposes and i think that that the good that dao's they're gonna bring to the world and bring to ethereum and and ethanol that vastly outweighs the bad when it comes to this sort of technology so yeah i'm very optimistic on the future of dows i'm excited to see how how it evolves over time i'm excited to see which ones blow up and which ones go on to become uh billion you know the the new companies essentially that we see uh of the world one thing i've noticed that makes me particularly bullish on ethereum the ecosystem is that every dow that i see almost every dow tends to denominate and hold value in each uh the first the first sale nft sale that bankless dow did it generated a revenue of 0.85 eth and the discord just absolutely blew up because of how stoked they were to get .85 eth on the balance sheet and i mean if we look at like the og dow um uh actually not not the dow but the first dow that started d5 which i consider maker dao maker dao is all about putting eth inside of maker and uniswap is all about a dow that puts eth inside of lps uh and you know pleaser dow it's all about putting really awesome nfts on the in the pleaser dao dao but it uses eth to do it uh and so when ryan talks about how bullish and exciting it is that you know a dao is just an internet native c corp well the difference is this internet native c corp denominates an ether not in usd and like every single dow either be on chain or off chain is inherently considering par part of the ethos money cohort and that's what gets me excited for for better or for worse uh just like you were saying perhaps there's evil doubts out there perhaps then perhaps and hopefully there's a lot of good dows out there but they're all going to be on ethereum and they're all going to be using eth as their treasury asset and so if if there is a bajillion llcs out there there's going to be even more dows out there and all those dials are going to use eth as money and that's kind of what gets me really excited on that does anyone want to riff on that david i just want to say that was super bullish man i i can see you're trying hard not to get kicked off of this panel [Laughter] i mean i i just want i'll speak to that point for a second as well i totally agree i think that you know we do have stable coins in this ecosystem but long term i i don't think that the long term unit of account should be tied to the u.s dollar like if we we obviously need something stable but it shouldn't be tied to any one nation's currency because at the end of the day ethereum is its own nation if you think about it like that it is its own economy it is it can be completely detached and live on its own without any kind of like government or nation state giving it legitimacy or giving it a right to exist it has the right to exist anywhere in the world at any point in time and on anyone's computer anyone can run a full node so we shouldn't be tying ourselves to any sort of uh individual nation state or any sort of currency that exists in the traditional world so i know usd stable coins are popular today they're probably going to be popular into the future but i think that my ultimate vision for for that sort of stuff is for um you know not only eat but something backed by each that is stable you know and pegged to itself something like rye they're really interesting experiments because it means that we can get off our kind of like reliance on usd for stability and we can kind of like potentially make it so that we can hold each as our money but also hold a stable each like i know you david you used to meme and die as stable ether and you know it was under single collateral diet but now with multicollateral diet there is centralization concerns because it is backed by other assets other than eath so um from that perspective we need something new i believe and and and dye still inherits the same problem where it is it's pegged to the us dollar it is still inheriting the us dollar's problems and it's still tied to that so um from that pers and it still has its own issues and of course like nothing's perfect but from that perspective i'm glad that that that all these things denominated in eth but unless like eight is not going to stabilize any time soon so unless we can come up with a way to create something that is truly stable eat that he's just pegged to itself and works and and is actually battle tested you know rise and experiment right now i i don't believe it has been battle tests or anything like that but once we get to that point i think that's when you know all these dows and stuff become completely unstoppable because they can just denominate in eath while not having to essentially take on that volatility risk which can actually kill daos i mean if you look at um the ethereum foundation for example during the bear market like the ethereum foundation isn't a dow but they hold money in each like they hold a lot of money you need it today it's worth you know it was worth a billion dollars at the top it's probably worth less than that now um but you know they cashed out some to fiat because they had to protect against downsides so they sold some end of 2017 they recently sold some at the highs you know i think like four thousand dollars or something so can we get to a world where these kind of like uh dows and these foundations uh can dominate an eth and don't have to risk off eighth um into usd they can risk off into something else that's stable and ideally backed by eighth so um i'm interested most interested to see that play out and i think dours can play a big part there because they're motivated to see these kind of things happen by the way what about the ef's ability to call the top huh yeah that was metallic right that was metallic yeah i mean i don't know how much how much involvement metallic has over there managing their treasury but i would i would think that vitalik has a pretty good pulse on on the local tops and everything um these days because he's been around for so long and he's also doesn't have that much of a bag by he's already like ultra rich he doesn't give a about money either so i think for him he's very grounded and very clear on when he sees like the mania he's like yeah let's just sell it because this is prudent rather than us moon boys who are like oh this is fine they just show some stuff so since we're talking about markets i think it's time to come full circle in this conversation to come back to to markets and predictions but first before we get to predictions just a few weeks ago eth was marching up past four thousand dollars it was crushing btc on the ratio institutions were loudly signaling their intention to get eth on the balance sheet and the flipping talk was absolutely deafening what's happened like where did we go wrong like why haven't we why haven't we done the flipping yet uh why where where where are we in the market cycle right now and what's been like what's been the um the post-mortem on the very loud april and may to a more subdued june where do you guys think we are in the in this phase of the market anthony let's start with you was eric connor right is the question don't say it [Laughter] no i mean no technically he wasn't because he called the top at 2500 we went to 4 400. so screw you eric like you weren't right okay but okay let's look at this in hindsight now because you know hindsight's always beautiful yeah take off the ball market goggles yeah exactly what happened was that uh we had dogecoin happen we had a extremely uh uh retail fueled mania in in in may late april where all these people came into this ecosystem and they were speculating on things like come rocket yes people haven't heard about that that is an actual token that has a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars they were speculating on safe moon they were doing the dog tokens they were playing in the bsc casino they were getting rugged in the bsc casino like and there were just scams absolutely everywhere i think the best indicator ever ever for local tops or for market cycle tops is how many scams exist at any point in time right now the scams are there but they're not really there right no one's getting like rugged every single day and losing like you know billions of dollars um but they were last month and they were at um you know maybe towards late april as well now the people who are playing in these things whether it's a rug whether it's a speculative token you know a lot of them will take profits into eth or btc for example but the thing is i i think that during that time people were taking profits in to eat because btc was weak it was going sideways it wasn't breaking new all-time highs it was crab season in itself like people like to call it these days so people were going into eath because there was a lot of hype around ethan one five five nine specifically and people were denominating in eighth you know if they were speculating on tokens on ethereum they were going into eth and i and you know i i i remember seeing that every time dogecoin pumped the profits would flow back to eat after it was done pumping so there was that aspect to it but the thing is the money runs out eventually there's not unlimited money out there i know the fed is printing a lot of us dollars but it's not like that's immediately going to go into circulation and immediately going to like uh like 8th right or whatever that that's going to take time to kind of play out people are going to take profits into usd still like usd even if it's inflationary at like 10 it's still better than um something like eight right yeah yes you're using temp losing ten percent of your value in a year but with eight you can lose fifty percent of your value in a week which is what we saw happen when it went at local top to there so i i think that people just vastly underestimated how much money was being kind of like used on you know bsc and on and in within these scams and how much money was being lost and taken out of the ecosystem because at the end of the day the scammers aren't dominating in ethan btc um a lot of them are dominating in dollars and they're just trying to get dollars out and they're just going to take it to dollars whether that be stable coins or whatever is another kind of um thing there so and enough people got got wrecked and the new money stopped stopped coming in the fresh money stopped coming in and we had a blow off top and of course we had the concerns like um elon musk you know turning bearish because of the esg stuff we had the china bands you know bitcoin mining fudge whatever i think you know that's just being fooled by randomness again i think generally it just all happens um at the same time where the market just had to cool down now did i expect east to go from 4 400 to 1700 in like a week or a week and a half no of course not that's absolutely insane that is the biggest drop i think ethan's ever had um in like a week and a half i believe um and same with bitcoin it's one of the biggest drops in bitcoin's history uh if you if you discount um you know 20 the early days or the early years of bitcoin like 2013 or prior um then that is probably i think the biggest drop bitcoin has had in the shortest amount of time so um from that perspective i think that i still stick to my thesis that we're going to have these shorter bull and bear kind of like cycles where we go crazy then we come down crazily we go crazy again and we just keep like doing that you know for years to come uh but yeah that's that's my general view on it i i don't like generally i think eighth btc was going up because of things like one five five nine because of d5 getting a lot of activity people realizing and the narrative changing and btc has actually held on incredibly well during this downturn like typically we see um everything getting crushed if there's a real kind of bear market and btc is the only thing that survives but i think people actually have a reason to hold eth this time for the longer term and i do i don't think anyone actually believes that we're going into another two-year bear market i think people just feel like we have to come down we have to cool off a bit people want to take profits and we have to just wait until you know more people come into the ecosystem again and we're not like where we are today which is i think most people left you know the speculators left they'll be back but it'll take some time to repair the damage cyrus i've always enjoyed uh your takes on the market commentary they always seem relatively sober in a very uh you know tentatively tipsy or drunk industry cyrus what is your take on the markets right now yeah i mean i i think what anthony said was well said um he hit upon a lot of the right notes um you know these days uh i think with the benefit of kind of being in this industry for for a few years you stopped trying to explain every every drawdown even the major drawdowns you start you know it's 40 50 like why did it happen trying to point to you know elon musk or regulation or whatever i think you just slowly grow out of that that behavior and you kind of just start putting on your very very long term uh goggles on um you know like the pre the previous uh you know you think of those charts of uh bitcoin or ethereum over like the very long term and like the previous cycles um bubble and bursts it just looks so inconsequential right like the the 2013 bubble for bitcoin like you can you can barely even spot it on a chart um you know i think with with the radical new industry like this i think have to accept that it it takes a little bit of time to um build the right market conditions the right environment you know get get all the capital flowing in at the right time um it's just it's just natural that it's going to run out of gas from time to time and it's just going to kind of cool off for a little bit um for me kind of the whole the purpose of this podcast of this of this panel is to just you know to kind of keep conscious of what are these long-term macro trends for for ethereum um certainly some of these you know very short-term um events such as eip1559 and the merge but but even those they're like so fundamental to what is the long-term vision of ethereum and focus focusing on those long-term fundamentals uh i guess just the short-term trading aspect has just kind of stopped it's not mattering as much right like 4 400 2400 you know what's we all know what the what the final goal is we all know where you know what the potential is you know start adding up the the tams for all the different use cases for ethereum you know you've got the institutional ethos money adoption you have the everything going on with fi now you have like kind of social and cultural uses coming in with nfts you have you have a capital allocation through through daos i mean we hit upon a lot of points on this on this podcast and when you sum it all together um it's clear that these all these things don't happen at the same time in like one week or one month it's it's sprinkled across many years there's a lot of blood sweat and tears that goes into developing these these products and if i were to focus on one thing it would kind of be the compounding growth effects of all of these various fundamentals and and you know try to remind myself that there's a tremendous foundation being built in the ethereum ecosystem um and if you just kind of follow those fundamentals and you just have to you know it's just like how can you argue against the idea that these fundamentals will eventually manifest themselves in the price eventually could happen next week it could happen next year it doesn't matter but like once they start to take take root and and grow it's almost like in hindsight it was inevitable right spoken like a long term permeable cyrus dc uh how about you and i just want to make the point that like all of those tam use cases come true that you just said cyrus man 10k eth that seems cheap one trillion you know total addressable market size and that that that seems very low but dc let's let's move to you for the for this question market cooldown was eric connor right is this is this a multi-year stall are we going to be back online soon in a few months what's what's happening here so my general take on what happened and where we are is and i'll preface this by saying there's a certain cyclicality in these markets um both against you know ether against usd but also ether against bitcoin and i think what we've seen historically with um every bull market is ether tends to outperform during clearly bullish periods in the crypto market because it represents more of this risk on bet exposure to a lot of other parts of crypto whereas during bearish periods um bitcoin tends to outperform a little bit um although the dollar tends to outperform bitcoin so that's just how the market works overall i think this market got ahead of itself in a lot of ways um and i think that's evidenced even by my price prediction earlier like i really did not think we would see a four thousand dollar ether by may um when i made that prediction six months ago um that was astounding similarly i did not think we'd necessarily see a 60 000 bitcoin by by april and or actually i think we saw it by march march or april so that is very significant i think what was also interesting around this rally is that the there were very few pullbacks pullbacks are necessary in a sense like this because they help to consolidate people naturally enter and exit positions but it gives people the opportunity to take profits and and what you saw with bitcoin we'll just use that as a as the exemplar here there was there was only like one thirty percent pullback um on the way up to 60k and then we saw the big like 50 sell off that is highly unusual um compared to some of the previous cycles so i think at the end of the day we got to have ourselves there's a lot of reasons why that might have happened i i will i will pin it down to the market was extremely foggy i think a lot of a lot of speculative markets were accelerated by the covet period where everyone's sitting at home some people had stimulus checks that they were investing into the market you know i won't go too far down that path but i feel like that was kind of a unique moment and now the world is coming out of that torpor and and we're kind of getting back to normal life and so where do i think we are now i i generally suspect we're probably in like a six to 12 month more bearish or sideways period and i i could be totally off on that length but that's just my kind of gut feeling and we might not set an all-time high during that time period but the development work is going to continue the adoption is going to continue and fundamentals are going to keep strengthening across the board so i really view this as an exciting opportunity you know similar to how december was a great opportunity i think this is a great opportunity for people listening to this podcast to pay attention to what's going on ethereum and crypto and you know my advice is to anyone who's deploying significant amounts of new capital is it's better to dollar cost average in just because the volatility is so crazy you don't know what's going to happen so it's best to prepare yourself for a range of different cases in the near term but long term i'm just as bullish as cyrus and anthony are on where we're headed over a multi-year time frame yeah and i think all the all the bulls on this panel are are long-term bullish on eth well past uh 10k price of eth it's just the timeline that is the question now is the time the end of this podcast panel's been fantastic thank you eth bulls for a beat of a fantastic panel here now is the time for price predictions i hope you have them ready um so last time we talked in terms of cycles we felt like in december 2020 that we were headed into the next bull cycle it's kind of the the way we phrased it it's it's hard to know whether it makes sense to talk in cycles anymore i know some of us here probably believe in this kind of like more elongated super cycle as uh anthony and dc have kind of articulated it but let's stay with the nomenclature of cycles here just to keep things consistent um what is your price prediction now we'll start with with dc uh at the end of this cycle whether that cycle kind of ends in you know nine months or 18 months or or two years before we have a like a major drawdown event dc what do you think you hold with your prediction you can adjust it i'm going to adjust it based on the speed with which we hit 4k because i that was truly astounding and i knew that would be a critical level and and that's probably why we corrected off of it so i'm going to change it to say through the end of this cycle we'll probably see a 10k to 30k ether and i know those numbers are big but um you know there can be real speculative mania in this market and it can exceed what we've seen already and it can it can border on true euphoria and i think over five years just to give you a sense of how bullish i am long-term i think we can see a 100k ether over five years if ether is widely used as a programmable store of value collateral asset which is what i think its long-term destiny is so long-term i'm super bullish midterm you know i i'm just writing through writing out this chop and i'm not going to worry too much about what the price does tomorrow i'm more interested in what it does a couple of years from now wow some pretty big numbers cyrus what do you think give your predictions my friend i'm gonna this is maybe uh taboo but i'm gonna abstain from a price prediction i've never done price prediction in all my years uh in the ethereum ecosystem uh to me that that implies like you know if you think it's the top should you be selling you know how much should you be selling when should you be sizing down uh similarly when should you be buying back in and kind of rebuying the dip i guess kind of like the more eric the bearish eric mentality of trying to trade the the the back and forth and for me i think uh i'm in it for the long haul and the ride and see you know how parabolic this thing can go um i don't sell at the top of last cycle which may have been kind of not the best trading decision and now a few years later we're kind of just like well past those numbers um i think part of being a trader in this space is knowing when not to trade knowing that kind of admitting that we have no idea how high this thing can go it could go to ten thousand could go to a hundred thousand it could go to wherever i just don't know i'm just kind of i'm just in for the ride and see where this takes me but uh zero clue what the price is going to be what do you think cyrus has a scale of one to ten how bullish are you on the fundamentals of ether the asset uh i mean it's it's he's i mean at 10 for sure like i'm like i you know i've never been more bullish but yeah that's probably obvious from from even being here cyrus uh this is a little longer term so dc said five years from now he wouldn't be surprised to see 100k plus eth what do you think about that there there's there's so many things going on there's there's so many kind of uh x factors both in the macro world and in the your ecosystem it could easily hit it like it easily you know who knows i i've structured my involvement in the financial side of ethereum so that like don't have to worry about those price points in that way i'm just kind of um kind of trying to take a more measured approach to my portfolio and just again in for the ride i think it's going up where it stops no clue uh don't care anthony how about you same question rice predictions well first of all i think eric connor hacked cyrus uh cyrus's brain or something to make him the resident bear here no no but i actually respect cyrus's approach here um i have obviously haven't been shy with my price predictions and everything that i'm saying you know some people give me about it but i never actually put a time frame on it um i really don't give a crap about the time frames i am obviously in this for the long term i have already kind of decided i decided this a while ago that i'm here for life so if i live to be 80 years old well i still got like 50 years in me so um you know take the multi-decade approach here but uh in terms of like uh this cycle i guess if you want to call it price prediction i mean i agree with dc we could see 10 to 10 to 30k or something like that and i also agree with dc that within five years a 100k is definitely on the table five years is an eternity in crypto it may seem like a short period of time in normal kind of like years but in crypto i mean five years ago was 2016 that was eat at like 10 bucks right um and that was uh btc at what like not even a thousand dollars or something like that um and you know you've got to look at market caps not just price of assets and things like that i get that but at the end of the day the fundamentals for ethereum haven't changed at all during this downturn like they've probably gotten even better because we just built keep building we keep discovering new ways to add value to ethereum you know one five five nine is still getting shipped the merge is still happening layer two is still happening i mean it's happening right before our eyes um uh everything else is still growing like d5 still growing i know obviously yields come down when the market quiet but yields are going to come down long term anyway as more capital enters this system the the yields being high is a function of two things it's one the market being hot um people wanting to borrow stable coins to go leverage long or whatever and two the the uh is a consequence um sorry one is a consequence of two which is that there's just not much capital in the system compared to the traditional system so if we have trillions of dollars flowing into this system even during a hot market the yields aren't going to be that high because we're just going to have more capital to pull from more stable capital so i think that um you know regardless of that the fundamentals are still stronger than ever and they get better by the day and because of that i mean my long-term kind of like outlook for 8th and ethereum is still incredibly bullish i am i've been a permabull for as long as i can remember but i i see zero reason to be bearish in the long term now short term of course we can we can go sideways for months yeah that's just the way markets work because markets primarily work off human emotion and humans aren't always rational actually most of the time humans aren't very rational when it comes to investing and when it comes to uh these kind of like games we play with with speculative manias um but but like just generally as long as the building keeps happening as long as the fundamentals keep getting stronger then then there is no reason to think that eighth is going to just like you know go back to you know 500 or whatever whatever you know bearish predictions i've been seeing flying flying around out there and we don't exactly have to wait long for this stuff either as we have gone through one five five nine is still slated for you know end of july uh uh early august now and then the merge hopefully in q1 2022 but even if for some reason the merge takes till the end of next year i don't think that really affects much like it that's such a short amount of time and once that happens people get over it i mean i remember people actually saying for a long time it's like oh my god proof of stake took forever to come we launched proof of stake and now no one says that anymore and like no one really cares anymore that was just a thing of the past now and no one's even talking about um the price anymore because when people were saying that the price of eight was like two hundred dollars now the price of eight is still twenty four hundred dollars so from that point of view i think uh you know long term nothing's changed long term uh you should be an ultrabook i mean i'm still buying eat every day like literally every day with whatever i can with whatever money i can get together from whatever yield finding profits i'm buying it because um if you're in it for the long term then you shouldn't concern yourself with these like uh short-term movements because as cyrus said you're going to look back on them in a couple of years and they're going to look like a blip on on the chart uh compared to where we are so yeah i guess those are my general general kind of thoughts on the market it's like one comment to add on that like you know with in terms of price predictions like how many times have you guys said to yourselves over the past couple years that like oh when eth gets to x price i'm gonna sell you know 10 or 20 or whatever especially when you know we suffered through you know a couple years of of a range rounding between like 100 and 300 through um 2019 and 2020. i'm sure everybody said okay like when eath gets back to all-time high or when eat gets to a thousand i'm gonna sell this much right and then it comes and you know maybe you sell some and then it's like okay now what well like now that you're here it's like not only validation for all the work and kind of the investment thesis that you had but you know you know that the journey is not even done like okay what about everything else he thought was gonna happen that still hasn't happened yet right we only maybe banged out like 20 of the things that i thought were gonna happen and we're already here like what what am i am i supposed to sell just just because we hit this number when when you know all these fundamentals are on the on the line and you know i can see something similar playing out like like okay eth gets to 10 let's say he gets a 10k in like the next one to two years but like you still know that there's all this other stuff coming because you know like ethereum the grand vision is not going to be complete in in one or two years but so it's like who cares if it gets to 10k like that's not what this is that's over here cyrus yeah this is the thing i say it's like it's like so if you have your living expenses paid for like when you sell your eth you have to buy something else right and it's like if you're maximally bullish on eth what else are you gonna buy i mean if you have what you need to live on you just kind of go full circle and you're like okay well i sold ethan that was a nice tax event but i kind of want that eat back don't i exactly and and given that like you know the cardinal rule of crypto investing is don't invest more than you can afford to lose then really nobody should be selling for any reason unless there's like a really good fundamental reason for doing so right but like arbitrary prices like round numbers whatever i don't know that's just all noise to me like just doesn't mean anything 10k is just a number guys this has been a fantastic panel and i've particularly enjoyed this price prediction conversation i don't think we've ever had a price prediction conversation like this on the bankless show but now for the climax of the episode the question i've been trying to get to for this entire entire podcast anthony why did you shave your beard bro so so i said on twitter that i shaved it to save the market and that eth can resume up only now because i made the ultimate sacrifice but in reality i just wanted to try a new look if i'm being totally honest staring at myself in the mirror before i was gonna have a shower and i'm like what would i look like without a beard and just a mow on like would i would it suit me and i did it and i put the hat on to complete the look and i'm like you know what i think it's all right and people seem to agree with it i don't know like it's all subjective um but i think that uh you know it might be a look that stays around for a little while i haven't decided yet it's it's it's grown on me uh sort of so to speak but yeah well you know if ether starts going up you know you got to keep it like that that's what it is uh-huh uh-huh yeah and if people see me growing out of beat again maybe they'll just use that as a sell signal because during the run up i was a sell signal every time i got too euphoric and i caused some big dumps if you look at the chart not that i really think that i caused them but you know the narrative is more powerful than their than the actual reality here you're sell signal because you won't do the dance dude [Laughter] yeah yeah um i know i get reminded about that all the time i'm painfully aware that i still owe crypto twitter a dance so yeah you do we all know yep yep yeah guys this has been a really fun panel we have a lot of time fun talking about price but at the end of the day this is uh these these panelists are all long-term bullish eth and i really like the zen way that cyrus is thinking about this uh and i think we we all agree that this is kind of a long-term asset hold um for all of us and we can't see we can't wait to see what is going to happen next with ethereum so thanks a lot guys for reminding us of why we are bullish eth really enjoyed this panel thanks for having us i really enjoyed being on it thanks david action items guys um of course if you want to get in a bullish mood you can always listen to this episode again but you could also listen to the first eath bull episode that we recorded in december of 2020 we will include that in the show notes also while you're at it why not take another listen to the justin drake trilogy the ultrasound money trilogy where he laid out the case what is going to happen to ether supply post eip 1559 and the merge of course risk and disclaimers guys eth is a crypto asset it is risky we don't know whether it's going up or down on a given day but we are bullish about its future of course you could lose what you put in we are headed west this is the frontier
