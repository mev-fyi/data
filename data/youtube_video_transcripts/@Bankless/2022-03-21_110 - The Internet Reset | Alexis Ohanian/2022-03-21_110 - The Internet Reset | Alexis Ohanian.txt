when i got krypto pilled was the wedge informed me was seeing this community behavior that reminded me of early days of reddit except now with so much more potential and so much more upside because it's not singular it's it's not centralized it is truly global welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless great episode for you guys today the internet reset can we just pull out the power cord and restart this whole thing that's the idea we get into this discussion with alexis ohanian who has been recently crypto pilled a few things to take away from this episode number one hear his story how did alexis actually get crypto pill the founder of reddit co-founder of reddit he fell down the rabbit hole what does that look like number two how he'd actually rebuild reddit if it was on web3 what does that look like and number three his investor cheat codes where the next opportunities in crypto be on the lookout for some of those that are mentioned as well david what were your thoughts in this conversation with alexis yeah i very clearly remembered the moment i got into reddit and understood like started to understand what was really going on there and the thing that captivated me about that platform was just the emergent behaviors that the platform enabled the communities and it was one of those it was just one of these things where all these weird quirky internet culture things all seem to be born out of reddit so like the rage comics some of the early memes and like memes and reddit i discovered these things around the same time and it's really all about emergent behaviors and so we take this conversation to alexis about what he sees in the early days of reddit and the parallels that he's seeing now in web3 and that was a very important story for him and how he was able to wrap his mind around web3 it was using a lot of these early concepts these early principles that reddit really leaned into that are now like on steroids in the world of web 3 in the world of online internet crypto enabled communities and so we unpack all these parallels and connect them to the internet at large and how we're going we're kind of uh this internet culture was definitely existent in web 1 kind of lost in web 2 but is now as you said getting reset and reborn in web 3 which is what alexis apparently makes him optimistic about the future of where this whole internet experiment is going it's a super cool conversation in in reddit i think is one of the most organic um internet native social media platforms uh certainly today it's where i kind of got my start learning about crypto as well and i think probably many the bankless audience did too uh so fantastic conversation really fascinating i think there's some insights here you can carry with you into uh the investing world as well about what's coming next in web 3 and what's coming next in crypto alexis has been on our bankless podcast wish list for quite some time so we are super excited to get right into the conversation with alexis ohanian but first we want to tell you about these awesome tools that will help you go bankless living a bankless life requires

making the world a better place as vc firm 776 he's an early investor in lots of products that we know and love coinbase axe infinity open c in the web 3 space even the software we're actually using to record this it's called riverside if you invest in that too you may also know him as one of the co-founders of reddit and he's really an expert in the internet i i think specifically internet communities uh so he's got a lot to teach us today alexis welcome to bankless how you doing man well thank you for having me ryan i just happy to be here okay i enjoyed chatting with you and david before the show began i'm happy i'm happy we hit record so we can save all this gold for your listeners do you know what you always look like you are having fun with the internet like whatever you do it always looks like you're having fun and everything you do also feels like mostly true very human like it feels just very authentically human do you is that a through line is that something you you've uh striven for is that just part of your nature uh i think it's the latter i think it's a part of my nature you gotta look i guess you gotta dig up the old content from like 0.5 and oh six you know grinding it out founding reddit to see if i still have the same vibes but i think so i don't know i've the advice i find myself giving ceos uh more often than not is to be to think of communication on the internet just as you would communication offline and and you know this this really comes up in community building because people for 16 years especially in the last couple years been asking like how do you build community blah blah blah and and a lot of it comes back to the same way you would do it offline if you were inviting people over to your house or bringing folks over to you know a convention hall like you you think about community building online the same way you do offline you bring good people together you give them opportunities to to you know have great experiences you're you know that's sort of like the the ideal party host is someone who's not there talking about themselves but helping connect good people and starting good conversations in good times and that's that's so much of it and i think i've been fortunate because creating reddit was probably was was not just a great outcome for me professionally but it also set the stage for getting the reps in for all the things that are most valuable now in web 3 16 years later and uh and it's it's just about that authenticity and i guess that's i don't know that's my vibe is that what brought you into web3 is that what brought you into crypto it's like we talked to so many people on bank list and they all have a story of how they came into crypto and crypto has all of this surface area right some people are uh you know it's appealing the finance side of it the economic side of it the like uh sovereign money side of it the individual expression side what brought you into crypto what was your hook so there's what brought me into crypto and then there's what crypto pilled me which are two different questions for the first i 2011 2012 i was a partner y combinator and i meet this this bright young man who had just left airbnb a great job at airbnb i think it had just become a billion dollar company it was a clear winner in silicon valley and he had been doing uh fraud uh detection and prevention there his name was brian armstrong and he entered that batch of yc and he said you know what i think bitcoin is going to be a big deal and right now it's a pain in the ass to buy and sell and i want to make it really easy i want to make it so simple for anyone to buy some bitcoin to participate in this and candidly the only reason i did that seed investment was because the r slash bitcoin community on reddit at the time was so engaged and and as an investor i'll tell you my cheat code and i've been a pretty public it's not that secret but i visit the nascent reddit communities if there are them if they exist for the things i'm investing in because that's a great barometer you can't really fake community on reddit if it's there it's there if it's not like it requires such a herculean effort to make work that you're not gonna fake that one easily and i don't know i just saw something there that was pretty wild it was really emphatic i had been to enough at this point i still think i've been to more reddit meetups than any person on the planet like literally all over the world and at more and more reddit meetups i was hearing from more and more readers i mean think of the folks who came out to a reddit meetup in like 2011 2012 2013 these are die-hard users when i'd go to some meetups yeah i'd go to like riga in latvia or i went to a reddit meetup in in halifax uh up there in canada nova scotia like i mean not just la new york sf but like everywhere and i went to one in bangalore india so okay one of the interesting through lines was like for these really hardcore redditors i started hearing more and more about bitcoin and about crypto and about these ideas of decentralization and i thought okay well the our slash bitcoin community is super hyped about this if you can get that many redditors that excited about a new technology you're probably there's probably something worth paying attention to but the government will definitely shut it down so i'm not going to get my hopes up too high but still that and those were the pretenses through which i i got excited about doing this investment and it was years that went by as i started to see more and more talented people you know wanted to go all in on it and i thought okay this is interesting you know i still don't think it's going to like survive because if it works this will this is this is going to assail so many institutions right it will upend so many parts of our lives and and reimagine them and uh and there's no way that that's gonna actually work because it just candidly just seems so far-fetched um and uh and then when i got crypto pilled properly was at the start of kovid because i started looking around and seeing you know and at this point right coinbase is on its way to ipo i had been making a number of investments over the years around the space and been lucky to be a part of some early pre-pre-sales and i i'd done well but the whole time i'm just like kind of holding my breath because i'm like this is too good to be true like when when you're a kid reading about major historical events and and technological shifts uh there at least when i was a kid doing those things i just never could have imagined myself being a part of it let alone live like living during that time let alone being party to it just seemed pretty pretty far-fetched and so with every passing year i'm like holy  this thing is actually like it's it keeps growing it's growing there's there's more and more talented bright driven people building on it which is a great sun and and then i started seeing things you know as we're all locked inside we're all feeling all kinds of you know existential dread anxiety about the world you started seeing people looking for ways to commune digitally and all of a sudden twitter where i was already spending a ton of my time started having more and more conversations around all things krypton nfts were certainly one one popular one but more broadly just more and more people talking about building creating together and i started to see things that reminded me of early reddit and that's when i got fully crypto pilled because i realized like okay we've reached a point of no return this from a like a regulation standpoint and we'll see with this executive order that's coming out but you know we we've essentially reached a point where i mean you know country ukraine was taking donations over bitcoin and ethereum like we've reached a point now where it's a part of the culture there's enough people who are bought in literally and figuratively to it and and and it's here to stay and so now you start thinking okay what can we do with this and and over the last few years i just started seeing so much of this really interesting energy that just like i said reminded me the early days of reddit except now people who were early and right could benefit from the upside and and i mean that both financially but also sort of spiritually right we are i don't even back when we were just collecting like seashells on the beach our species really likes private property and we we like this idea and look the ability to have private property also incidentally makes it even more interesting to then have shared property because that shared property is only special if you have a concept of of personal and private property but at its core like there is something special about that and seeing that switch flip among so many people who now found a new gateway into why this should matter because now they could reimagine how gaming could be different and they started seeing versions that obviously an investor and actually like you said so rare another one and seeing seeing this resonate as a kid who grew up playing tons of video games and spent tons and tons of money that i'll never get back um and yet also a kid who you know bought a ton of trading cards and magic cards even spell fire which was like the d knockoff of magic the gathering you know i we took for granted the fact that we owned all of our in-game assets because you know you bought the card and then you got to keep them and if you wanted to give them to your kid's sister you could sell them you could do whatever you want with them they were yours and the metaphor seems so obvious to me it's obviously still pretty contentious in some communities but i think in hindsight well again just feel very very very clear and and so as i sat here watching all of these people get so excited creating together and hoping together and and that i guess it was the that communing of people tied into a sense of ownership and a potential for for creating something bigger i mean even looking at you know failures like constitution dao you still see the same kind of energy that just reminded me of 15 years ago on reddit as people pooled money together to help for a fundraiser just to do some good work right but now you have something that's not limited to one platform it is truly global it is it is boundaryless and man i mean we're in the earliest days of it so anyway that's when i got cryptopilled was the wedge informing was seeing this community behavior that reminded me of early days of reddit except now with so much more potential and so much more upside because it's not singular it's it's not centralized it is truly global and that's definitely where i want to go down the rabbit hole of just to get this conversation started off which is just the the the parallels because there's so many parallels between reddit and web3 as you've alluded to and i think a lot of the parallels between these two things are also very foundational to the internet itself uh there's a lot of things about reddit that captivated my attention when i first got into it that also captivated my attention about web three and i i kind of want to unpack these things with you because i think it'll uh give listeners premonitions of things to come in in the rest of this decade the things that captivated my attention about reddit when i first logged on was that like it gave the user so much control and it gave the community so much control so like a subreddit was basically like uh a blank slate of a dao of sorts it had it was just up to the community to etch in the the story of what the subreddit was and everyone on reddit would start with like a blank account and it kind of feels like it felt like when you made your reddit account like it's like you spun up your your brand new ethereum address for the first time these felt like the same things uh and like learning how to read it and learning what reddit was was something that you had to experience for yourself there was no onboarding you had to just go do it and then the same thing of web3 like you can't really just like listen to bank lists and understand web three you have to go and actually experience it for yourself and like this is also true for like kind of the the web the web 1.0 days like you couldn't just go read about it you had to go experience it it was all community driven and i'm and i'm now like now that we have this web three data point and this reddit data point and this web one data point it kind of all seems that there's some amount of just like uh individual first community first user self sovereignty emergent behavior platforms that the internet is trying to produce and i'm wondering what you what how you see this uh using your history and experience at reddit how you see this all unfolding in the world of web 3 and beyond i think we inadvertently got a lot of things right in a process that really was was rooted in an experience growing up on forums i mean i ran a php bb forum in college you know open source software ran this was called eyeswide.org had maybe 600 700 community members active and and we just talked about politics we talked about philosophy it was just i just loved doing it in college and my friends at the time thought i was pretty weird for doing it but it was it just felt good to be a community manager and i just really enjoyed the conversations there and i felt like it was satisfying this was right after 9 11 it was satisfying a part of me that wasn't getting fed uh with with traditional media and you know you know starting reddit right after that really in a lot of ways right this is just repackaging message boards and forums that have been around since the early days of the internet but creating it in a sort of singular network with a slightly better interface slightly uh i still i got a few things right with the upvotes and down votes and comments sorting but some of the other things a little little too spartan um but designing all that was really just an a sort of remix of web one and and then you know the whole innovation of quote-unquote web 2 and look i know people can roll their eyes at the branding of web3 this is sort of a necessary evil um we're going to just at the same time i swear in 2005 uh 2005 starting reddit everyone was rolling their eyes the same way around web 2 and they were just like oh this is just some fun javascript that lets you load things on the page in real time like why are we calling this a movement and user generate content whatever yes it's all just branding but it's it's i think it's an important shorthand because it is identifying a major transition now and this isn't my quote but the the idea that you know web 2 was read and write and now we've moved to web 3 which is read and write and own is really meaningful because we we inadvertently got some things right and i remember even designing the karma system was just look name taken from slashdot uh the upvotes minus downvotes equals karmascore was the laziest implementation i could come up with simply because it worked to encourage good content and discourage bad content and you know it turned out it was very motivating for people because they liked seeing their name on a leaderboard and i borrowed all kinds of elements from video games for things like awards and 10-year club badges and all these other things which now people identify with they'll introduce themselves not with their government name or their reddit username they'll just say i'm a five-year reddit or a 10-year editor 12-15 year editor right but those are just pings that live on our server but now all of a sudden if you talk about pings that live on a chain you now have real receipts right and and my very naive take on this is if it worked without ownership it will work really well with ownership because there is value in having those receipts and and so i really believe in you know speaking broadly around web too so this side you know social media as as we know it as i know you all are younger than me so you all grew up with is probably gonna look like a weird transition it it i think in the grand scheme of the internet is actually gonna look like a blip because i don't see one i don't see it it becomes an intelligence test once you provide ownership as to why you would ever want to participate in a scheme uh where you don't actually own the things that you produce the user experiences today are still so janky and i actually don't i mean yeah like we still could have done a better job i i take full responsibility could have done a better job onboarding new users to reddit for sure i think it would have helped us grow a lot faster i think don't don't take don't have the lesson be make a terrible new user onboarding experience make the lesson from this in spite of a terrible new user onboarding experience there was something here that people still wanted to dive into into because the content and the community was so good and so strong but even if we had had a better new user onboarding experience you still would have needed one still would have needed to like take time to actually understand the community before diving in and why because these online communities are the same as offline communities you move to a new town if all of a sudden i don't know where you all are in the world but all of a sudden you move uh uh the next day to to bangalore shout out the redditors who i met at that meet up you you you show up the first day and want to make some friends you don't just barge into the first i don't know meet up you can find a first restaurant you can find it just start saying hi to people and start pitching whatever you're into right that's just not we as a human as a species we're going to spend a little bit of time understanding a new community we're going to spend a little time observing and watching and listening to start to learn etiquette and culture and all these other things that we can have a good experience online community should work the exact same way and that's the part that is on the one hand it creates friction but on the other hand that friction creates the culture and the community and the reason why there are in-jokes and there are out jokes and so that's always a tension that we as a species have to figure out and navigate but it's what defines communities and what's wild now is we know it worked social media proved it worked at scale with billions of people all across the world in spite of the fact that the the the ownership equation wasn't there the user experience was was all things considered actually pretty bad right because at the end of the day the way that you kept the lights on was by harvesting people's private information for advertising or some other version of that which was not really rewarding the content creators or the community builders at the end of the day so i don't know i think it's going to be a blip and i know i just monologued at you but hopefully that's a few lessons that are valuable for the builders of today well we are definitely here to hear your monologues and so the next monologue i want to hear is uh unpacking the topic of just like emergence uh when you don't ascribe too much uh top-down uh design structures as i think as i claim that like twitter and facebook and instagram have done in their designs telling the users well this is the way that this this app is structured reddit and a lot of the web one days and i think what we're seeing a lot in the web three days is like just like a basic here's a fundamental primitive platform for your community to exist now go create you go do something and like this natural the creativity that that a lot of these platforms besow upon their users gives them a lot of room to have their own emerging behaviors and what is really immersion behavior other than like the culture that we all agree on that we decide that we have value how do you see this like role of emergent behaviors in online communities like how do you see this trajectory moving forward beyond platforms like reddit and into the world of web3 so so we are in the earliest days of this year right and we're going to see emergent behaviors come up and and they're going to define a lot of what we love and enjoy the wild dynamic here is i actually think at some point you know on the adoption crown the tech adoption curve you get to that fat part in the middle and the average user there actually doesn't want to tinker doesn't want to create does not want a blank canvas the person there and and their necessary component right to become mainstream you by definition have to grab those folks in the middle maybe you don't want to become mature but if you want an idea to truly become rancher you need a lot of people who actually are never going to care about that stuff and and as a product designer and as an investor now i think a ton about user experience because the user experience for those earliest adopters is different from the user experience of the mainstream and that's it's an interesting intention because yes by its nature everything on chain is very like good luck sovereign individual wish you all the best figure out for yourself and look i consider myself a pretty early adopter i i still however i want to be coddled in certain parts of my like crypto and web3 experience because i just like there are things i want to invest my time in and then there are other things that i don't there are things i want to invest my anxiety in and then there are other things i don't and and so every user is going to fall somewhere on that sort of tech adoption curve across different technologies and different needs all that said the emergent behavior period that we're in right now is fascinating because i'll give you a specific example right some of the most famous things about reddit did not come from us it it came from our users so for instance even the co the notion of self posts so the idea so originally reddit started we just let people link out that was it and we had a not very good seo strategy which meant that our comments pages were just sequentially numbered so when you posted a new link it would just it would be appended with you know 3465 and then if you posted one would be 3466 and one of our users realized this and guessed what the link would be when they hit publish and made a self-referring post which created the first self post we thought that was clever okay let's just productize that and so we did and then it wasn't long thereafter that one of them showed up and said hey i'm gonna you know i'm a dental hygienist ask me anything i forget what the original one was and it was this interesting meme and and people loved asking questions of some random person who wasn't a celebrity just had an interesting life or maybe not even that interesting ostensibly but you get to ask some fun questions and actually becomes really interesting and and you know amas are now ingrained in internet culture i don't even know how many people actually even know those came from reddit we have a show called uh ama ask me anything and it's all from reddit right that's where it really loves ama well i'm well i'm glad see and i'm glad that it has flourished it is totally invented by some random person on the internet some pseudonymous person will never know and and it's probably one of the most famous things that reddit has done right and so that gives us a lens into like how you can benefit from emergency behavior even when you have a top-down centralized company like we did which is just you know still still shipping the things we want to ship but doing so that's pretty well informed and reactive to interesting stuff we see happen and and that is the very nature of everything that is getting built right now and the the problem at the end of the day any centralized organization still has to make i mean it's a gift and a curse they still have to make hard decisions about what to focus on and what not to because if you focus on the right thing like i don't think spacex can happen in a truly decentralized fashion maybe someone wants to get out there and get it started prove me wrong but i i really believe right something that complex something that uh you know the average person actually can't contribute to helping spacex in a lot of ways like you actually need rocket scientists to do a lot of that work kind of thing there are some projects where you really need centralization and you can still take lessons from this world fine but like i don't know i we'll see if we'll see if the rocket down proves me wrong but the there are plenty of things though where a a properly incentivized and connected decentralized community will outperform any centralized group a million times out of a million and content creation is a really great example of that right as evidence you can look at i mean even tic toc which is still one of those web 2 manifestations crushing quibby didn't matter how many dollars you had how many a-listers you had you're never going to compete with millions of teenagers with smartphones able to produce content endlessly that is on trend that is inventing trends that's you know what people want okay but this i i'm excited to see now because we get the web one energy of hey holy  i just made a website on geocities like what can i do next and i was that kid right that's how i got into programming was was i got a i got a book on html4 and started building a website on geocities and like this is the coolest thing ever and i misread the page counter at the bottom and so i thought because i every time i'd reload to check you know i was updating an image or whatever i assumed it was a random person actually coming to see the website it's like oh my god there's like 10 000 people on my site this is amazing it was just 10 000 page views and it was all me but right that changed my life now that in uh gosh i was in let's see graduate 2000 was from 1997. maybe that's when i was 96 97 i was 13 14 years old i had no idea i could not have even conceived that 10 years later i'd be designing these up votes and down votes in a real-time commenting system and a platform like reddit just 10 not even 10 years later and because my brain was still so naive and so just awestruck with like oh i can put an image on the website that on a website that anyone in the world can see and so we're in a similar stage now where everyone's just kind of like oh  we can put things on the internet that anyone can see like what can we do next the difference is when all of us were doing it back then you know aside from us except for some forums and message boards we were pretty siloed right this was a sub sub culture of people building today thanks to the web 2 blip it is now mainstream culture internet culture is culture everyone is online and spending most of their lives there right you can even argue the metaverse has been here not just with obvious examples like world of warcraft and fortnite but even instagram there are people already buying assets they're buying the louis vuitton purse to take a photo of to impress a bunch of digital people with their digital asset which just happens to be a photo of them wearing the purse that 99.99 of people will never actually see them with so the metaverse is here it's just not evenly distributed and we're still in this interesting tinker phase of creation except we have an audience that is global and ready and and excited by what we're building and so instead of it taking the next alexis ten years to be like oh i can make a website on geocities too hey i'm watching this thing called reddit it's going to take it's going to take them 10 weeks 10 months i don't know but the rate of innovation is going to happen so much faster and and i'm i'd like this is why i'm so excited by this is why like i i don't have to be working right now but the reason i needed to start 776 the reason i need to spend the time that i spend building this and working with amazing founders is because like this is building a new internet for my daughter and lots of people's kids to inherit and i i'm just amazed that i get to participate in it this is awesome and this is exactly the you know the energy i think that we see in the space um i i'm curious about this because like i think there are a lot of probably 14 15 year olds listening you know to bank lists and exploring the web3 space in the same way you were when you were that age like building stuff on geocities right and i'm curious if you could like i guess put yourself in the shoes of let's say you only rather than you in in 2005 when you started reddit you're in like the year 2022 and you've got these new web 3 primitives that are basically we we have the web one web two communication protocol primitives and that's great but now we have this ownership protocol primitive now how would you re build a reddit or how would you build the next big thing like put these ingredients together for us because you you've got this expertise around communities this experience with reddit now you you've seen the potential of all of these new ownership primitives that are coming in web three what would it look like uh you know a new reddit for example i would think of reddit a little bit like craigslist or a little bit like entrepreneurs 15 years ago thought about craigslist and not just because of the aesthetic similarities but if you'll recall you know there were a couple of plucky founders nyc uh who we had backed who were going after a section of craigslist called rentals and they said look like people can rent you know a bedroom for a couple days on craigslist but user experience is terrible right it doesn't feel safe at all and we're gonna build something called airbnb which will make it beautiful for people to feel safe renting out or renting someone's spare bedroom someone made this great mock-up of how all of these businesses basically carved up parts of craigslist to offer verticalized sections of that platform and so the way i would think about it is you know there are all these emergent community behaviors that we saw across reddit over almost two decades across all kinds of different things from raising hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in a fundraiser to trying to coordinate dollars to like name a bowl game off of our cfb on the college football subreddit to you know even just creating artwork have giving creators like shitty watercolor a platform where they could just make great content and and so you start thinking about this and you're like okay well i i commented somewhere i think i was on i was on another pod and i got asked about dows or i guess there's ambitious predictions in the next five years i think everyone or a material number of people are going to participate in a dow over the next five years they won't know it they don't need to know what it's called remember the average person doesn't know what a hypertext transfer protocol is they don't need to they just need to know that they want to go on the internet and visit a website and we should be thinking about nfts the same way we should be thinking about dowse the same way right these are underlying protocols we are so damned down in the weeds the average person only cares about user experience the average person only talks about user experience that's the thing they tell their friends when they use something delightful right they're not talking about the protocol layer to make it happen they're talking about oh i did this dope thing you should come do it with me uh and so that's if i'm if i'm building here i'm thinking about this stuff and i'm thinking about how do we abstract away so much of the crappy parts of the user interface to make it seamless for people to get value out of this new technology and so maybe it is pooling money together so you can buy the constitution and you know there's there's probably a a dozen companies now trying to do some version of the easy dow but thinking along those lines is what is going to get this all to the next level and and again it's exciting i wake up every morning like a kid on christmas day because i'm like frantically on twitter and catching up on some discords just trying to see what i missed just trying to see what else shipped and what else is happening and and so i would spend a lot of time actively engaged in the communities of builders who impress you the most right follow them on twitter be a part of telegram groups that you feel are high signal discord communities like this is where the learning is happening in public um there are so many charlatans it breaks my heart all the charlatans in this space i know tai lopez just didn't have tea drop like they suck i hate hate hate that part of it it's a it is a unfortunately a you know it is a reality right when you create when you have a system like this especially one that involves money and value creation like this right it's going to attract grifters it's going to attract charlatans and you know it i i cannot ever endorse any of them but i realize they're a part of the process so the best thing we can do is just shun them and hopefully encourage them to build real things and but i would say stay away from the stay away from quick cash grabs i i being long-term greedy in this environment is going to be so much more selfish and such a smarter move financially than being short-term greedy and so that's that's my like one of my mantras um because if you're really creating something of long-term value for as many people as possible like that actually in this system is going to create a lot of outsized value for you in the long run but also do the thing that we need which is building things that people actually want and and actually sort of moves the needle on progress not just another lazy cash grab i do think people forget that the best asset they have in the web 1 web 2 web three spaces their reputation and that that remains sure yes absolutely i was fundraising from a pretty well known i could say it's peter thiel and um this was we were we they passed incidentally and um but he asked he asked me this was a long time ago but he asked me he's like what's one thing about the world that you realize other people don't or whatever the the canonical peter took question and i was like well it's that people will care more about their reddit username than their government name and i i think i got it half right i do know that that is true now it's you know five years later six years later um and there are so many writers who care more about their identity even though it's totally contrived it's fluffy bunny 16 because that's where they have relationships that's where they have fame that's where they have whatever a history of things that they've created what purpose they have something right they have meaning they have community whereas they could show up for work at the office i mean foreign offices but you can show over the office every day see the same people every day and not have any kind of connection with them and that is special and so i say i got it half right because i will now apply that argument to what is being created in web 3. i believe wholeheartedly the online identity the digital identity which will more often not be pseudonymous is going to be more valuable to more people than their government name and incidentally as a species this is not totally new and i learned this at uh we we sponsored a drag con gosh this was like 2014 2015. and i remember talking to a couple of folks during the amas and a couple of queens said like we were talking on the subject and they were like don't you understand our entire culture is around a community of people who have decided we want to create an identity for ourselves right this is the truest expression of our self and doesn't usually align with what's on the government issued id but it's who we are and i'm sitting here like okay here is now a very clear offline precedent for this the internet now enables it at a much greater scale but still preserves this level of intimacy and now that you add ownership to it i mean get out of the way it is this is going to keep growing and steamrolling and like i said you might be sitting here listing this podcast thinking well like i don't actually want to spend all my time online i i never could imagine getting excited about digital asset and i just remind you of i remind you that instagram photo you took of that great outfit uh because you're actually already participating in this in a way because you're you've created a digital self you have a digital identity that you probably care just as much if not more about than your offline one that's why that's why these apps are so popular and that part for the generation coming up is it's already hardwired there's no i for for this generation of true true digital natives now there's no turning that clock back because it's such an empowering thing to have it that uh i don't see it going back layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with a cross you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer 1. assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously across these bridges are powered by uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer 2 back to ethereum

proud to be sponsored by unit swap unit swap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the

uniswap ecosystem no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply it for a unique grant at uniswap grants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless if you're going bankless you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet you can now trade tokens on any decks or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across all the default exchanges allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increased transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that i use when i'm out and about which i use to collect po-apps nfts and do all my defy things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you gotta try it out web3 wouldn't be the same without it download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamask.io and load up your trezor ledger lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web 3. do you know the last the last concept i think we want to talk about is um conceptually because i think you're making a great case for for web 3 throughout this and to me web 3 more resembles web one than it does like web two right in that everything is yeah so i i read the uh the book that you wrote um i don't know back in 2013 2014 without their permission wow right yeah so yeah yeah deep cut i went on the deep cut and so um but i think that the concept of without their permission is like with web one anybody could create a website launch an app start a community build a company no permission required no intermediary right and i feel like between web 2 and web 1 and web 2 we sort of lost a piece of that you know chris dixon calls it a little bit like the internet became disney disneyland we've got like a few centralized companies that kind of control all the property didn't feel like new york city didn't feel like brooklyn there was nothing organic about it but now i feel like web 3 is starting to recapture that element i'm wondering if you could talk about this this maybe last concept of permissionlessness why is that so fundamental why is that so necessary so i believe it is fundamental and necessary for tremendous creativity i do look at this stuff as cycles and i do think we're at the start of a new excuse me to your point i think similar to web one we're the start of a new cycle where it is sort of inherently well it is inherently decentralized and where now we have a bunch of people just figuring out what we can do and they don't have to ask for permission to go do it ultimately as you work your way up that tech adoption curve we talked about earlier you're going to get to folks who want a certain amount of not necessarily centralization although in some cases yes um but they just want a different user experience because they don't want to do all that work right like at a certain point myspace just touched on potentially what people wanted as a social network but facebook really nailed the simplicity of and the timing frankly of being able to share photos really at the core of it right i i was at this thing i took a photo of you you get an email notification that says hey i took a photo of you and you want to go see it and that was the viral loop that spun up and it was a perfect storm of timing more than anything else that just got a bunch of people to be like okay my space felt a little i don't know but now that the timing was right and okay but for everything that's coming now you have an underlying permissionlessness in the very technology that is going to stay even as we see it centralized more and more because you're gonna what's a good a simple example of this is even like let's just take custody at a very basic level right there are still plenty of i mean there's there's good reasons to also maintain your own storage uh and have cold wallets and all that stuff but on a simple human level there are a bunch of people who would just rather know coinbase is holding their bitcoin because they don't want to think about it they don't want to worry about it they don't have they got my seed phrase my ledger where they right they're optimizing for user experience and they're willing to trade some of that decentralization that's inherent in the technology for some centralization and so the good news is the underlying technology is itself unruinable [Music] and so even as we watch this develop over the next 10 20 years we won't see another disneylandification because the atomic units of money and identity are still owned by individuals and so i look i'm not a hardcore crypto anarchist i actually again i my north star here and this is i think just as a product builder still always comes back to user experience what what what ends up winning a thousand times out of a thousand is along those lines of a user experience and making something people want that is the motto of y combinator for a reason and so what heartens me though is because this underlying technology is decentralized even as we start to see people and as it goes more and more mainstream being willing to make the trade-offs and saying like actually no i don't want total permission list for i don't want total permission listening permit permissionlessness is not a feature for me it's a bug like i just i'm fine with that you still have a fundamental structure that is itself permissionless and the builders can always keep building and that in the same way that markets and you're seeing you know meme stocks are just a reflection of what's already what's it's the it's an old system being uh sort of radically affected by new tools but the new system has this sort of you know baked into it right whether it was all the things with defy whether it's been here now with nfts um markets i mean even just looking at tokens as compensation right we're seeing more and more employees uh even working fiat jobs looking for tokens as a signing bonus we're gonna see more and more people taking multiple gigs getting paid in tokens what happens when you know traditionally a startup founder you know we compensated every one of our employees at reddit with with reddit stock or options specifically and eventually rsus these things are not liquid at all right there's an inevitable future here where those employees are going to get paid in tokens what does that do to a world where now there's a market available you could wake up one morning and realize hey look at that like elon musk just tweeted about my company uh my tokens have 10xed i'm going to sell a few of them and put a down payment on a house like that will be a reality right and so this notion of liquidity is having a tremendous effect on shaping markets on shaping behaviors and we're seeing it right whether it's gamestop getting memified uh whether it's you know different tokens popping off whether it's all this stuff with nfts you're now gonna see a scenario where we play this out five years ten years for anyone who's building where your users are actually just as sort of liquid because now you don't actually own all the keys to the kingdom because it's not like yeah google lets you download all of your data and facebook ostensibly lets you download all of your data but the process is cumbersome it's a pain in the ass like it's not it's not really a feature of it right they're deliberately doing that but now users have all the authority and and you saw this a little bit with um uh open c like it very very ingenious approach because it all lives in a public database right you can now overnight reward a user base that you don't actually have and potentially bring them over to care about your platform right that the the market of companies of startups still has not fully processed this new world because it hasn't really it's still in its infancy right but in the same way that financial markets are are rapidly going to have to and and are adapting to this liquidity it's going to happen across every front even users and and that's rooted in the fact that you will actually own your identity online you will actually own those photos you uploaded you'll actually have the receipts of the time you spent right and so to you know put it specifically right you've got now the bar is going to be so much higher for platform creators and builders in web 3 to maintain and earn attention and time and i think that's a good thing i think it means you really have to earn your users every day and that's a thing like we would say this i'd walk around the office be like we got to earn our users today right we have to be shipping features that they want we have to be creating a great user experience we have to be you know creating community events we have to be doing things to earn our users every day but it was kind of a metaphor because people couldn't i mean they could leave but tomorrow it will be literal and and that's a very exciting new world to be living in because it gives i think it more much more fairly gives the value back to the people who have been creating all of it for so long and i that's a whole nother i mean it we're we've barely even started to see it happen yet but we will and it's going to be pretty exhilarating to watch yeah the way i've explained this this concept is that uh everyone on ethereum or everyone in on on in crypto is always just one transaction away from being somewhere completely different yeah you're it's so you're so close to everything else that's being built and so the uh ability to migrate is is so low that it almost incentivizes it at times um yes uh alexis i'm going to ask you the the impossible question i know no one can actually predict the future but i'm gonna ask you to do it anyways uh there are so many things in web three we got dows we got nfts we got tokens we got permissionless communities uh and you're a veteran of much of the internet uh and so i'm wondering what you really see as like uh what's on the horizon what what are these primitives that we're talking about and not only just with like tokens but also the properties like the permissionlessness and the community first aspect of web3 what are you seeing uh on the horizon as like colliding with web3 like what is where is web3 really going to the where the rubber is going to meet the pavement that you're seeing that you're hopeful that we build out in the short term one thing that really clearly dawned on me over the last couple of years was so if i give someone the chance to sell tim eath or n eth whatever one eighth or uh an nft worth one eighth they will be more likely to sell the the one eat or whatever the amount is um and and non-fungibility is actually for our species a lot more valuable than we realize and is it rational no but humans are not rational creatures and when i think about when i think about how we start to build utility into nfts as an underlying technology i mean we're still in the again these are the the simplest stupidest days of it right we are we're still at geocities here and as we start to understand more and more utility whether it is you know getting i mean we've seen examples of this right restaurants using it as exclusive membership or you know hopefully maybe one day at a golf course to get in or you get on the list of different utility that is offline but then you start thinking about what we can do even if it's just allowing people access to online communities allowing them access to coordinate uh and even just have spontaneous meetings i like there's just we know that communities already and reddit is a great precedent for this where there is no incentive other than we have a community we have a culture you're part of it we know that those work at scale massively well and they'll do amazing things together from raising money for total strangers to getting together offline we know this there's a precedent for that seeing the infrastructure gets built up around enabling communities in web3 is is one of the things i'm most excited about over the next year or two because we're gonna start to see more and more people doing more and more clever things that pushes everyone to be like oh that was clever okay i'm gonna do something better now and that rate of innovation can happen so much faster now thanks to you know the internet social media stuff we're all watching we're all building in public and that's gonna increase the rate of innovation and i think even like i don't it's hard i know okay the things i'm betting on are the things that are creating this kind of infrastructure around community or these communities themselves right i'm a pretty out and well-known ape holder from from pretty early on i'm very excited to see what happens in the coming months around all things border pia club um and even that actually you know the reason i aped in uh in like may or june or whenever last year was because they launched with a board like the only the only quote-unquote utility but it was novel at the time was that you could visit a part of the website right to be able to mess around on the bathroom wall which was a total homage to our slash place which was a reddit april fools day thing we did with pixels that was collaborative the same and the hugo labs team admitted said as much and i saw this and i'm like oh cool this is like reddit but now all right i'm in and and again i'm not this i don't need to be the smartest guy in the room i just need to be looking for things that i know work to 10 years ago when there was no real ownership involved and as i'm seeing this stuff start to progress i just can't help but feel like we will see real utility evolve we'll see technologies that will make it even more valuable to either own nfts with robust communities or maybe find ways to access and and get in and and just to further democratize it right it doesn't it it doesn't help if you just create a bunch of exclusive communities that only a few people can be a part of when there's you know millions and millions and millions billions of people on this planet um and so that's obviously gonna have to find ways to scale i'm excited to see the stuff that does that because this connective tissue is it's so strong it's so incredibly strong and again if if we know it works without real ownership then by adding that really important element it should grow even faster and even stronger and and then you start imagining ways for more and more on-ramps to exist this is this is probably another big area whether i mean i backed lolly because i was excited to see more people get into bitcoin just from shopping online you just passively just like with honey except in bitcoin you save money on buying things you normally buy online and for folks who would never even consider ever opening an investment account on coinbase you're now a bitcoin holder and and you're now creating wallets for a whole hell of a lot of people who will probably they're at the other end of that adoption curve when it comes to investing in in crypto they're now crypto holders they're now wallet holders and the on-ramps are are and the other really exciting area for me because the look it crypto is still a very male dominated industry um we have again long-term greedy incentives to bring more women in to web3 because if we just look at the data from web 2 women outperform on social media they out consume it they out create it right the engagement numbers the things that we need in order to get web3 into the mainstream will only happen with women uh and so i'm i'm particularly excited about that as another on-ramp um in terms of things i'll be investing in and things that we'll be spending our time with 776 because it's it has to happen uh and the sooner it happens the better it is for all of us so alexis with 776. i know it's over 350 million dollars or something in assets under management like with uh 750 but 700 that was our last so our yes now 750. it's been a busy year is this so is this all going to be deployed in like actually that was probably that's funny yeah that was i'm sure that was what it was up until a few weeks ago yeah sorry yeah yeah it's just it keeps going up is this is this are you mainly focusing this towards crypto or it's like crypto and web 3 is that just a portion of the portfolio notice you let around in a rainbow wallet which is absolutely fantastic it's um an nfl delightful ethereum that i think um is everything you've talked about which is like making the user experience in web 3 actually good but how much of the fund is allocated towards web 3 versus other areas it's not specific i mean it's not like redlined in but a majority of the companies we're going to invest in are web3 we still you know we vested in a reusable rocket company called stoke so we're doing space tech we're doing climate tech we're doing food tech we're doing some boring you know traditional software businesses sas businesses too but a little over a majority is going to be crypto that's awesome what else are you up to on shane i noticed you uh you just launched a project on the a proof project on grails what is this i loved seeing your community ask about that yeah my old arch nemesis ceo uh kevin rose uh we've become pals over the last couple years and he's he's been so so spot on with with nft art culture and he launched this project called proof it's a community of you know cr uh some artists but also curators went on and he asked me to be a part of this drop where they it was brilliant like they brought 20 artists well 19 amazing artists and me together didn't tell anyone who made the art and simply gave the opportunity for all these proof members to mint which i think was one or two depending on how many passes they had so they can mint artwork for themselves but not know who the artist is and a lot of the artists were encouraged to sort of hide their identity in the art so that people were buying the art based solely on the vibes like did they like the art and then there was a big reveal and this was amazing i mean the you had the really the who's who um that one that protograph from larva labs is like the original cool punk it's like the og uh punk code um so there's a bunch of amazing stuff and so i did my first ever nft artwork for it because it was a pretty amazing opportunity and i was like all right i can dust off the old illustrator uh that's a photo that my wife took at me in olympia and i i'm really into low poly art uh for the last year or so and so i just decided to make it's my first i did a lot of snoo uh doodles over the years our reddit mascot i've done hundreds of those uh this was my first time doing low poly art but it was it was fun and yeah i was happy your community was asking about it i might have to i might have to put out some more uh more artwork yeah they are excited about it and we've had kevin on the podcast uh but before so people are familiar with uh with what's going on there it's really cool you guys are uh you know teaming up on some of this stuff i guess as we uh we draw to a close uh alexis this has been super insightful for us you know thank you very much kind of the final question for me is there's been an increasing amount of pessimism i think about the internet like some people say the internet's best years are behind us right we have like social media toxicity uh this feeling of being preyed upon by large tech companies all of these things um but i think you're optimistic about the future of the internet give us the case for why we should be optimistic about the future of the internet uh because we have to be because if we're pessimistic we can't possibly build the better internet that we want i i think the criticisms about social media are very valid very valid i i think we we have an opportunity now to remove um to reimagine that like we basically saw one version we saw one timeline and so we've learned how to build a lot of stuff we we have a blueprint for how things can work and now we get to build another timeline taking those lessons and reimagining a lot of those technologies now with ownership and with decentralization at its core and i think the point you know for me personally and and folks know how i resigned uh from the from the reddit board and in protest last a little over a year ago now um i think we we get a chance now to not have a centralized platform making decisions that provide reach to specific ideas and not others and i think this is an important distinction because first off freedom of reach is nowhere in our constitution um and and when you have a centralized platform putting something out to millions and millions of people it's a tacit endorsement right having looking scrolling through a feed and seeing you know oh look my uncle just got a new job and oh look how cute my niece is and oh like this vaccine is putting a microchip into my brain like that context matters because that context is normalizing stuff and providing reach tremendous reach weaponized reach that is is not something that's a founding principle of our democracy and and is creating really harmful impacts on our society and so what i like about this i i hope i really hope it'll be a renaissance with web3 is i know those toxic parts of our society are still going to be there they're always going to be there they have always been there they will continue to be there but we will not be reliant or victim to a handful of platforms making decisions or not making decisions about what belongs and what doesn't and and i actually think we're all going to be better off for it because it's going to be a chance to reset and i don't know we'll see we obviously got a lot of work to do in this country to help normalize things um but from a technological stem but from an internet standpoint i do think the internet's best years are ahead of it and i really do believe that in 50 years we will look back on web 2 as being a blip as being a uh sort of an errant thread in the timeline where uh you know we made some mistakes and now we we got to spend the next few decades hopefully writing them well said opportunity reset the best years of the internet are still ahead
