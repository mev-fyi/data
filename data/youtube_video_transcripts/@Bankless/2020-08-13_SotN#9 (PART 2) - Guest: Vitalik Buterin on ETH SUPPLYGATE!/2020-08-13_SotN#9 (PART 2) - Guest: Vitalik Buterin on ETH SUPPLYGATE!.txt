all right everyone welcome to state of the nation this is episode nine this is part two so in part one we caught you up on what is going on with yams it's still going on as a matter of fact as we're recording part two um also we gave you an update on dex volume versus centralized exchange volume in this special part 2 episode we've got vitalik buterin we're going to talk about something called supply gate david what was your take on vitalik's comment on each supply gate and everything he said yeah there's just been so much going on in ethereum in the nation that we had to split this up into two categories like yams deserved their own episode honestly uniswap exploding deserved its own episode uh and also going through the nuances of each supply gate deserves its own episode uh ryan and i we aren't really coders and so we wanted to get someone who could speak on a more technical level uh and so we just went straight to vitalik and vitalik actually loves to talk about this stuff so we got him on the state of the nation to help us get through some of the nuances of each supply gate for those of you guys that aren't familiar with east supply gate i believe it all started with pierre richard not to name names but i'm going to do it because it's kind of like a call out gotcha moment so pierre richard a famous bitcoin maximalist uh is he's he's also an accountant so he or a an auditor excuse me so he's very much in this world and loves the fact that you can easily audit the bitcoin supply and is a very big proponent of bitcoiners running their own node he's a bitcoiner to the fullest degree uh and he spearheaded this east supply gate effort where he realized that there's no internal function to the ethereum blockchain that allows you to audit the east supply and so he made this public tweet asking like okay what's this what's the supply of ether do we even know how much ether there is out there which coming from the camp of bitcoin or sound money is like sacred right like you must know what the supply of bitcoin is because you check your own node and you check and make sure because you run your own node and you do your own math right that's the that's the bitcoiner ethos and they and the the pierre and other bitcoiners bitcoin maximalists i would i would call them uh realize that eth doesn't really have this built into the clients right we don't really have that function and so we actually didn't really have a quick and easy answer as to how much ease is out there because it's not built into the system now that doesn't mean that with that we the amount of ether is unknown it's just importantly just a different way in construction between bitcoin and ethereum and that's about as much as i know and so i'll pick it we'll we'll pick it up with italic when we turn to vitalik there's just one last piece i want to bring up before we turn to vitalik and i got into uh the conversation as to like why bitcoiners are doing this kind of like gotcha thing like it's a very gotcha moment there's not real much substance behind it vitalik will explain more uh and but i asked vitalik like where is this motivation coming from like why are so many bitcoin maxies trying to like have this gotcha moment for ethereum and his answer while we recorded it might have gotten jumbled by the internet so i'm just going to reiterate it here but vitalik answered that he thinks that there's a lot of people who are really insecure and worried that ethereum is becoming completely legitimate in everyone's eyes uh and so i'll leave it at that ryan if you want to have any last comments before we hop into the vitalik interview uh let's hear them yeah that's absolutely you know just one point of clarification of course each supply was known it's just not built into the geth and parity client so like you can view it on ether scan you can view it in all block explorers it's been charted over time coin metrics other analytics firms chart it's just not a function in the geth or parody node so that was really the point of contention and um you know what i i guess maybe i'll end with this and we'll jump to the interview just actually i asked a question every week um you know what what something cool you did in crypto this week right and um last saturday pierre pierre pierre answered the question and he said i helped ethereum figure out its supply issues something like that and i was like you know what um i think this is helpful this is part of going through the gates of what it takes to become a reserve asset and a money and ethereum should have a good answer to this question and i think vitalik does quite frankly and i believe we will see the the click here for each supply button in future ethereum clients whether it's eth 1.0 or eth2 so with that david let's get to the interview with vitalik all right vitalik welcome to the nation we are doing this very quick episode to kind of just get right to the heart of things uh for context there has been this uh pretty pretty avid movement in the bitcoin maximalist camp i would i would categorize them not the bitcoiners the big swine the bitcoin maximalists who uh are going after the difficulty of auditing the eth's supply and so there are a lot of different conversations to have that are relevant here a lot of different nuances to get into and ryan and i aren't really all that technical and so we're just going straight to the source of uh one of the guys that can speak the best about this subject so we're bringing on vitalik to help us kind of dig through these this con this actually kind of difficult and nuanced conversation so vitalik thank you for coming on the state of the nation nothing thanks it's uh good to be back in the nation again awesome hey vitalik i'm going to start with maybe a tweet that i saw and this is not the only tweet of course uh this is just one of of you know flavor of some of the conversations that have been uh going on um but i i just happened to see this i think well on eight was that saturday sunday something and it's basically this sentiment coming from i think members of the bitcoin community maybe more skewed maximalists uh and it says something like this the the ethereum community can't figure out what the total outstanding supply of eth is this is a major problem and showcases why eath is not good money so comments like that i guess maybe like my first question uh is that right can the eth community ethereum community not figure out what the total outstanding supply of eth is no and i think the ethereum community definitely knows what the total outstanding supply of eth is and it's like about 112.1 million right and you can see that by just um in a whole bunch of ways like there's all of the different scripts that have been run the past few days there's um i mean you definitely shouldn't trust them but you but like the fact that all of the different supply calculators kind of on the internet to basically agree to the answer within a a factor of about a hundred thousand um you can even look at the ethereum protocol and know what you know about uncle rates and you can try to estimate the ethereum supply from that and you can get somewhere very close um so no no the supply is about 112.1 million right now um i think like the like people like this they're definitely kind of engaging in a very serious i guess modern daily fallacy here are you familiar with that term it's a kind of popular slate star codex system oh yes yeah please yeah so basically the idea is that this is a kind of old medieval terminology where kind of in a castle like i think it's uh the mod is a sign of well-protected castle that uh um you know you got the wall you got the tower like it's very hard to invade and then the bailey is this a kind of farmland below and the idea is that normally everyone's kind of you know happily off uh farming the bailey um but then whenever someone attacks everyone kind of rich meets back to the mod right and so the idea is that it's this kind of argumentative dark arts technique where basically you have one position which is kind of the bailey that you are stayed publicly and it tends to be a much more extreme position and then if someone actually challenges you in the extreme position you just kind of say no no you don't get it i just meant this a kind of other smaller totally reasonable thing um and you know you can see people in politics saying this sort of uh um or being in this kind of pattern all the time right um but here basically the mod is that you know there doesn't exist a kind of convenience function that's very easily accessible from ethereum clients that lets you kind of go and click and say you know the ethereum supply is like one one two zero two four five eight nine point or whatever it is and that but the mod that or but the bailey that they tried to uh kind of implicitly go after i think is this idea like oh my god no one knows what the ethereum supply is maybe someone snuck in an extra 25 million coins like if someone actually did sneak in an extra 25 million coins that um you know yes you probably should be kind of selling and shorting if because uh they're gonna do something um terrible with that 25 million and probably dump it before everyone realizes what's going on but no nothing remotely close to that has happened right um so like this is all basically this kind of dispute that has just been blown horribly out of proportion about a difference of you know like really about like was it 100 000 coins a few thousand coins like pretty much nothing right here's like 100 000 coins get issued every week uh so that's so that's kind of i guess the core of um of how i see this like another analogy i might add is you know in neither ethereum nor bitcoin nor most cryptocurrency is can you estimate say the gini coefficient right and the gene coefficient is important you know the gene coefficient is really important because you want to like if you're going to create a new monetary system it's important to know you know how much inequality the money in the monetary system has because if it's introducing a really huge amount then maybe that's not a monetary system that you want to support and cryptocurrencies are of course pseudonymous you know you can have many people sharing in accounts you could have one person having many accounts and there's just like not a good way of actually estimating this number uh and so could you just like you know you could imagine a uh proponent of fiat currency uh kind of just pressing really hard on this points and you know going around asking what is the genie coefficient of bitcoin what is the gd coefficient of bitcoin you don't know then how do you know that you're not um that you're not introducing a um um a plutocratic dystopia on the order of north korea um obviously that argument's crazy and like and we have stat of ideas roughly about what kind of uh inequality and con situation there is uh in these systems and you know we actually know that for example as far as all the cryptocurrencies go and if bitcoin and ether actually both among the more equal ones um you know like a lot of the other big um heavily pre-mined and heavily uh kind of non-transparently ico altcoins they tend to be very very concentrated and you know btc and ether not um but like that's that's one analogy right uh so the the mod that they can claim like the thing that the thing that they basically are claiming is that the total supply of if just is this parameter that no clients just haven't created this convenience function for because they um haven't there just hasn't been much demand for it right now one thing they might you might say as like well if we don't have this auditing and we don't have this convenience function does that mean that there is actually a significant risk that someone will um you know somehow sneak 25 million ethan to the system like okay maybe right now it's a disparity of 100 000 but if we're not auditing maybe someone will sneak in 25 million and i think that kind of completely misunderstands the security model of ethereum and i would even argue the security model of kind of cryptocurrency generally like the basically i think um this is a kind of a bit of a deeper kind of rapid holy philosophical point but i think a lot of people think of verification of cryptocurrency as wrongly being a kind of very piece meal a kind of fact by fax thing when in reality verification of uh of a blockchain is all or nothing right and to give a totally different example of this like there were some older blockchains scaling protocols that basically said things um like you know we're going to create a scalable blockchain that makes it easy for you to verify the presence of your own coins right so basically you know imagine like a highly scalable blockchain you know even bitcoin sv size or something like completely insane like that but where you have a light client protocol that makes it very easy to just just verify kind of the history and the kind of pro provenance of your own coin right you know you have your etxo here's the two parents here's the three grandparents here's the five great grandparents and and so on and so forth right you know all the way back to uh genesis and like that's gonna be a substantial amount but maybe a few hundred megabytes but you can verify it the reason why that kind of verification is just totally stupid and pointless is because in order to verify that your coin is valid in order to verify that kind of your coin will be accepted by people but you don't just have to verify the prominence of your coin you have to verify that your coin is part of a chain where the entirety of that chain is valid right because even if the prominence of my coin is completely valid you know if your coins in there and your coin got double spent and the double spending got accepted by the network then that is a chain which is fundamentally kind of invalid and corrupted and so that is a chain that once people figure that out is just going to get rejected by the ecosystem right and so like the fact that i have a coin that's totally valid within the context of a chain that's totally invalid it's going to be rejected like that's worth pretty much nothing right and so the only verification that matters is verifying that the entire chain and all the rules of consensus have been kind of fully satisfied and it's the same situation here right like basically there's no value in kind of privileging one specific rule you know whether it's the rules about issuance or whether it's the rules about you know were the ecesa signatures all correct or whatever whatever like you have to basically verify all the rules right and that's what clients do you know they verify all the rules um and so the um like basically if um like the reality is that if he wants to verify that ethereum is a system that satisfies the goals of being a blockchain that satisfies the goals of being a valid kind of substrate for ethan's money and for diaz money and for whatever other money you like that's um on ethereum then like you have to like there's no value in looking at one single consensus rule in isolation right you would also have to verify you know verify that um smart contracts have never been illegally hacked um you might have to verify that um transactions without valid ecdsa signatures were never included you have to verify that your coins were never invalidly taken away you have to verify that everyone else's coins were not were never invalidly taken away um so like specifically verifying that um you know this one consensus rule has been satisfied as a kind of you know it's just it's focusing on one specific thing when in reality like you have to focus on everything together and you really have to think about it in kind of two parts right the first part is were the consensus rules that we think the consensus rules are actually followed and the way that we know that is well there's a whole bunch of clients and the whole bunch of clients have processed it and there's lots of people in the ethereum ecosystem that have run those clients um so like i talk about the concept of herd immunity here right like you know fortunately it's 2020 and herd immunity is an analogy that like pretty much everyone understands but like you know the idea is that um you know if you have like a thousand people like in a whole bunch of places in the community that have run a note and have verified each individual piece of the chain then you know realistically the chain's valid and like it's incredibly unrealistic that an invalid chain is just gonna sneak through all of them right so i mean like this is the sort of thing that we could kind of rabbit hole deeper if we want to talk about you know the philosophy of sharding for example but you know that's a whole other topic but no that's the first thing right the verifying that the consensus rules were followed and we have multiple implementations you know lots of implementations that lots of them have you know sunk the chain at one point or another um lots of them have um you know verified any individual block and then the second piece is okay well given that we know these consensus rules let's take the consensus rules and let's figure out what the supply is going to be today and what the supply is going to be at kind of different real realistic points in the future that we care about um so and if we want to estimate what the supply is today you know we can run some of those scripts that determine exactly how many uncles there are you can do estimates based on kind of like basically the more exact number you want the more kind of work you have to do and if you're willing to actually process the entire chain you can get a number down to the last way but you know the value down to the last way is not very useful because 14 seconds later there's going to be another 2.0 something ethan introduced but you know if you want that number you can get it but if you're okay with like five or six decimal places you can do a bit less work and if you're okay with three decimal places you can do even less work and so like there you go okay so vitalik i'm going to try and recap all of this in as short of a bit as as possible so uh bitcoiners uh and the bitcoin blockchain has this function built into it that just does the audit of bitcoin right and it's built into the protocol which is really aligned with bitcoin or values because they really like auditability that's part of the whole proposition of bitcoin it's serious it's a function right it's a function that's built into the bitcoin client if ethereum clients wanted to they could build in that function too it wouldn't even take a hard fork right okay and so bitcoiners found out that there isn't a a this function in ethereum clients and so they found this opportunity to nitpick about that when in in reality it would the the the the re the reason why we know that no one has slipped in any ether in any ways that that don't fit the rules of consensus is because we haven't hard forked the chain we haven't had a hard fork if there if somebody wanted to slip in ether in a way that would be invisible to people it would result in a hard fork and that thing either being invalid or there being a hard fork which we would have known about and so and so this kind of then goes into the the second criticism which after you pressed some not not you specifically but also you specifically but also people like chris burniske and eric voorhees and andreas antonopoulos after they brought up the issue that this is mostly a non-issue it's kind of like this gotcha moment the the conversation then kind of turned to well ethereans don't even run their own node because it because that's just not in their culture which i agree is actually not really in our culture to run our own node i don't run my own node i have it in a while i don't think ryan runs his own node but what you're saying oh you do pardon me but what you're saying vitalik is there's this hue he heard immunity where not every single individual needs to run their own node we just need to have enough individuals so to the point where we get sufficient decentralization was all of that accurate yeah i think so and i definitely think that it would be nice if we could get more of a node running culture and ethereum in the future but i think like we do have to kind of think pragmatically about this right because right now i think a lot of people don't run ethereum nodes because ethereum nodes are expensive and ethereum nodes are expensive because we have these big hulking blocks with uh 12 and a half million gas and the reason we have big hulking blocks with 12 and a half million gas is because right now the gas price is well i think an hour ago when i checked it was like was it 240 gray or something and if we had not done those increases it would probably be like 2 000 grey or more realistically everyone would have um left ethereum and everyone would be on you know ethereum classic or neo or you know one of these other chains uh so like in the short term there's this unfortunate uh kind of trade-off that we do have to make and i do think that the ethereum community you know like the bitcoin community really values the accessibility of reading the chain but i think the ethereum community also really values the accessibility of writing to the chain right so accessibility of reading the chain means you know like how much does it cost to run a node basically accessibility of writing the chain how much does it cost to stand in transaction and those two are in conflict because the more space there is the cheaper the transactions but the harder it is where i know the less space the you know the more expensive the transactions but easier it is to run a node um so in the short term there's not much that we can do but at the same time um you know like this gets back to one of these other weird like talking points that i saw yesterday that you know people are kind of gotcha quotes meeting with this tweet for myself like four years ago and i said the internet of money should not cost five cents five cents a transaction and i'm like yeah you're right it shouldn't i mean you know the fact that it costs more than five cents a transaction right now is terrible and that's exactly why we've been working on charting in boston roll ups and all this stuff for the past years um you know if you send a transaction in like loopering or z casing or one of these systems like i think i mean we can calculate the transaction cost on one of those right now like it was what's the gas station gas price right now i just said 220 240 one of those i checked it was 273. oh wow oh that's uh zero zero grey celsius some excellent um okay so okay let's like round it up to 300 and be like sportons that are lazy at math and um you know 300 multiplied by about let's say 500 gas per um transit per uh transaction that happens inside of a roll-up and so we get to uh 15 000 away and then 50 000 multiply by uh was it about a bit about 400 dollars um and we get about uh six uh six million and this is all in units of one over a billion um and so it's about 0.006 dollars so even in the context of today's sky high gas prices if you personally today are living inside of loop ring or zk sync then you know in optimal conditions you get a transaction fees of 0.6 cents if the batches are a bit smaller you might get transaction fees of like three or four cents but like basically you know the internet of money is still alive and it's called highly scalable if you're emily or twos um and so these are a thing like basically the future that we're working toward you know where we have roll-ups where we have um scaling uh another one that hasn't been given enough love is the omg network you know they were kind of very hyped up a couple of years ago and then i think a lot of people got the impression that they kind of went away and were dead but you know no they you know they have a beta running on mainnet and you can go and use it and i think tether is planning on migrating to it soon um so like after we have these scaling solutions then like we can consider um or we will be able to have both very high scalability and a low cost of running a node like for example the cost of running an e2 node is definitely already like much lower than the cost of running in each one node so that's exactly the sort of thing that i think we're working towards and i think we can have more of in the future so vitalik this conversation came out of that that tweet from a big a somebody who i would classify in the bitcoin maxi camp and it's an it was another one of these gotcha tweets and this whole east supply gate thing has been classified by a number of people like andreas antonopoulos is one of the people that i think is the person that coined the the whole thing the gotcha the eath gate gotcha moment got your question uh and so it seems to be like the there's a certain camp of of people coming out of the big swing bitcoin maximalist cohort that are trying and going for these gotcha things for whatever reason and so it's it it delves back into like this whole tribal mentality where there are a couple bitcoiners who are really loud out there trying to poke holes in the ethereum value proposition like what's your take on that like why are why are there so many people that seem to be motivated with like these gotcha things without actually contributing anything of real value either to the ecosystem or to the conversation going on like what's up with this i think people are scared that a theory i'm just getting what you have to miss so i have my bitcoin hat on and play devil's advocate so um here's a devil's advocate here so fact that ethereum is five years old it does not have a east supply calculation function in parity or death does that about the prior i can picture maybe somebody saying that because ether didn't write calculating supply in uh in its clients as a like a an easy button that you press um its priority is not to be a like a fixed supply sort of asset i mean the reason you can imagine someone saying that is perhaps because i said that myself on twitter i think about two days ago as an attempt to kind of summarize what i thought the best argument of the camp was um oh so you did summarize that okay i didn't read that um like uh the my words were something like um you know the facts that ethereum clients don't or energy community doesn't seem to care about having a convenience function for calculating the ethereum total supply just shows that ethereum is kind of much less i'm interested in kind of the sound money religion um i use the term religion mutually by the way so like if you entered bitcoin are both part of the cypherpunk religion for example um and um you know if you are want um a sound money then you know it's better to have a money whose community is uh kind of subscribes to the sound money religion right which is you know a fear argument like i think uh that's one way to kind of understand a lot of their positions like you wants to have a money whose um community subscribes to the sound money religion you want to monitor this community subscribes to the immutable ism religion and um you know so on and so forth right it's kind of that kind of you know richard dixon uh kind of rationally crazy sort of uh um a sort of line where uh you know being incredibly attached to something can be a um an advantage um if it basically uh kind of makes it more difficult to kind of push push a certain thing through someone or through a group of people um so i think that's fair um ethereum's definitely value the sound money religion less than uh people in uh the bitcoin camp do and i mean it's to be fair like the whole ethos money meme is like barely a year old for us the bitcoin is money meme is i know many years old um so i think um like first of all if ethereum people want to that's uh that something can change over time but second i think it's important to note that like there's a limit to the extents to which we can comply with some of these values while the ethereum 2.0 roadmap is not yet complete right and this is another thing that i think is important to and understand right because um you know we have this um looming uh transition to proof of stake and then sharding and then killing the proof of work chain and during that whole uh transition we're gonna see massive changes to the reward formula we're also going to see fee market reform aka eap 1559 implemented at some point um we're going to see um actually see for the first time like how many people are willing to stake and kind of what exact exactly the actual issuance rates and what exactly the actual burning rates are and out of this we know it could end up being that the supply growth rate is negative right and the fees continue the way they are today the supply growth rate is definitely going to be negative um in which case um you know the analogy i made is like if a zero growth rate is sound money then you know this what does the negative growth rate mean does it need supersonic money um so that's like but like this is a little future stuff and this is all a kind of unknown and there's definitely aspects um to the ethereum culture that they're kind of explicitly understand right that like as i think i summarized a couple of years ago like bitcoin people think bitcoin is 80 complete ethereum people think ethereum is 40 complete and i think now maybe instead of 40 it's more somewhere between kind of 50 and 60 percent but you know it's it's that kind of mentality right and so people understand that there is this technological roadmap ahead there are these kind of economic unknowns ahead and it definitely is something that you know aspires to have certain economic protocols but like what's the point of verifying that the current rules are being uh uh uh kind of you know miss satisfied to this extreme extent of having kind of all of these different functions for verifying it if we know that these are things that are going to change in one or two years anyway and after the one or two years i think people and after the economics get nailed down that's something that people can and will take very seriously and people are taking very seriously right so like for example people you know we see these eth2 staking reward calculators and we see these two issuance calculators and there is this growing community of people that do take to economics kind of extremely seriously because they see that you know the eu economic model is something that's been made with kind of a lot of care and love and that's um this thing that's uh theoretically meant to kind of stick with us for the long haul um so yeah i mean we do basically we we need to take this a kind of more long-termist perspective and you know look at well it's funny to say yeah caring about what will happen three years from now as a long-term list but that's like basically easter will change things yeah and you know also that another narrative that pops up um david david mentioned one which is you know bitcoiners or maximus will say hey ethereums don't run their own nodes and that's a big problem um which many do by the way but but another i guess narrative that gets put out there is that vitalik and insert you know dev overlords here act as a you know federal open market committee basically the fomc of the us and they set um issuance they set supply can you talk about that i mean what's to prevent the fomc of ethereum um you know as as they would as they would phrase it uh from you know increasing issuance to something and maybe like funding uh funding a yacht or funding your favorite charity or funding um i don't know eth2 development even um sure so i think people are kind of further away from the ethereum community definitely and they definitely overestimate um the uh ward dictator vitalik but they also um overestimate even the ethereum line of fomc uh so first of all i mean you probably remember this yourself right when the issuance reduction from speed per block to two weeks per block was happening that was not core death driven that was not metallic driven i think that was even driven by like ethereum community members that were in what was uh maybe not yet called but starting to become the ethics miami camp right does that sound accurate to you yeah i you know from my recollection i think people who are holding each and who are believers more in the the idea that eth is a you know sound collateral sort of drive those sorts of changes and they'd have a lot to say i know i would i could speak with david too if uh issuance were to increase for something that was outside of the social contract for instance right exactly um now let's look at another dimension uh gas limit increases so gas movement increases the interesting thing is like so if you go right now to etherscan.io slash chart slash gas limit right open up that page um you see like the graph right and it looks like a bit like a kind of city skyline line you know it's got it i guess i'll wait for you to open that up sorry what was that url one more time ether scan dot io slash chart slash gas limit there we go yep see okay you see the city skyline um so let's look at that chart uh kind of very closely right um so one one of the things that you might notice is if you look at kind of the beginning stages of that chart like um open up and um search on google images um us historical income tax rate um like images um yeah images let's see if we can uh find a good one just the second one um no the second marginal tax rates right um so see how like the chart like kind of jump back and forth between the two right just like look at the ether scan look at the um okay back to the taxes ether scan taxes um so i i actually made this point in a blog post uh kind of actually this is another one of my points when i was like being kind of self-critical of ethereum governance um a few years ago where basically these charts both look kind of similar right they have this pattern of like staying very very cleanly at one particular one exact position for a long time and then jumping and then staying very horizontal and then jumping and this is a property of basically a magic number that gets constantly renegotiated by a committee of technocrats right like if you have a number that's constantly renegotiated by committee of technocrats then you know this is what it looks like uh so the um now let's look at the chart more recently um if you look at specifically what happens after january 2019 right like look at the um the last kind of bar like there and then kind of after so notice um zoom out again i might just refresh maybe um notice how that last 20 of the chart looks much less clean than the first eighty percent do you see that mm-hmm yeah the first thing yeah the first 80 looks incredibly clean and then after that it gets very choppy um so here's what's happening right basically what's happening is that the first uh the gas limits at the beginning they actually were essentially set by a community that sets magic numbers right basically the ethereum foundation maybe maybe one time or dictator the vitalik um said hey guys maybe we should increase the gas limit and all the miners were like yes my lord we should raise the gas orbit and they changed their settings for the clients and they raised the gas limit and you know this was how this was admittedly how governance worked in the earlier days of ethereum and we were when we were able to kind of pull off the downfork and these other things right so [Music] that um but more recently what's been happening was the latest two gas limit increases were minor driven right basically there was very little input from the from lord vitalik there was very little input from the federal open markets committee um it was basically miners initiating and in some cases miners disagreeing like there are a couple of mining pools some just um switched from 8 million to 10 million a couple of other mining pools stayed at 8 million and so you saw the gasoline kind of going bouncing up and down and even when it got to 10 million if you look at kind of the daily average it wouldn't be 10 million it would be maybe 9.9 or 9.8 million because there was this kind of ongoing disagreement and the gas full limit would still be kind of bobbing up and down a lot right and the most recent one um the rise from 10 to 12.5 like you can see even more clearly how bungled that was right basically what happened was that i remember back in may um i think it was a spark pool i think i remember it was sheen uh reached out to me um and he basically said you know hey vitalik um we're considering maybe we should increase the gas limit because uh transaction fees are getting a bit higher and this was back when it was about 20 to 30 quay right and i replied at the time you know maybe no we shouldn't because um that'll get um lord peter solagi and uh salaj and i'm sure i'm buggling then the name i'm angry and you know lord peter sajda's doing a lot of uh you know great work and uh you know we should not be making his life harder because um you know he's been doing a lot of um i mean he and his team have been doing a lot of great work on uh kind of making uh geth work more efficiently and um if we're just gonna go and kind of undo those efficiency gains with the stroke of a pen that's you know not a very good thing and that could cause uh kind of dos issues and all of this stuff now six weeks later the transaction fee situation got way more serious and i guess the mining pools by themselves you know they talked among each other they um talked in each other you know like in their wechat groups and they tell in the telegram and um you know discuss had some discussions and they started kind of bumping it up from 10 to like maybe it was like 12 or 12 and a half and the this happened without permission from myself without permission from the federal open markets committee without permission from any of these people and i learned about it when i saw some a message on twitter and i checked on etherscan like oh my god there's a block with a gas limit of like 10.4 million and it's rising now um indeed peter was not happy peter was not happy um and the interesting thing about the rise was that apparently they did not even agree on whether it was they would rise to 12 or 12.5 right like i remember like when the gas limit went up it rose and then it actually i think it might have even like briefly gone above 12 million and then below 12 million and it kind of bounced around and it seemed clear that there were some people voting 10 some people voting 12 some people are voting 12.5 and then like if you go back to ether scan like you could see the like the etherscan chart gasoline you could see the day by day volatility in the gas limit because there was this kind of gasoline voting war going on and after another couple of weeks i guess uh one of the mine aprils that was voting 12 relented and went up to 12.5 and now we have 12.5 right so this whole thing was initiated driven carried through by miners without core death permission without lord metallic permission without any of this stuff and so like in light of this like how can you call ethereum governance centralized right like it's clearly this kind of complicated multipolar uh um kind of tug of usually cooperation occasionally a bit of war between these multiple kind of highly independent independent and kind of diverse people from diverse backgrounds um and like realistically i think like issuance is um uh similar right like issuance is not going to go up just because like one group of people wills it and i think there's definitely a strong enough constituency that'll just fight to the death against issuance increases that like people can feel kind of safe and sound that issuance increases are not going to happen i think the answer to the question vitalik as to to how you can call ethereum govern and centralize is by just totally foregoing your your anyone's one person's responsibility to understand nuance and kind of just cater to their audience and tell people what they want to hear so in light of all that vitalik i i commend you for for keeping your head above all the mess that you can you can easily find in the depths of twitter and i thank you for being a a sober voice in a very loud messy conversation that's uh i mean i'm always glad to say stuff all right ryan do you have any last questions before we wrap this up no vitalik that was uh that was super helpful thank you i think um i think folks uh will be interested to hear all this i guess maybe one last question just because it's uh super topical and we will be releasing this sometime today today is back to those gas prices they are going vertical right now there's uh craziness something called a yam token and which is going crazy there's there's always something happening in d5 it it appears like ethereal block space is becoming more and more valuable some of that value is is driven from speculative value at this point um like is that going to continue to to be the case are you seeing any any hope uh you know around the corner with some of this layer two scalability before e2 ships ooh a very good question and i think i have a bit of an answer which is that um which has to do with roll-ups and specifically optimistic roll-ups um so we know right that there is the two families of robes there's a zk there's the optimistic the zk's are live already um but the optimistics are still a few months away and the reason why the optimistics are a few months away is because they're trying to do something much more complicated than these z gains right the zks are just trying to support payments and like maybe a dex the optimistic ones are trying to support full evm execution inside of a rollup and there's a lot of kind of device really hard challenges involved in that um so what basically the one of the silver linings of this though is um that i think optimistic roll-ups are going to be ready for a kind of non-financial applications and for you know like natively issued assets and some of these other things before they're ready for d5 and the reason for this is that for for a roll-up to be useful for defy it has to be like really security-wise nailed down right and if the security breaks then you know all hell breaks loose and people kind of lose a whole bunch of money but if you just wants to use a roll up say for like reddit community points or you know like some other kind of lower value thing then the nice thing is that the security requirements on the roll-up are much lower right and the reason is that if it turns out that the roll-up smart contract is broken then as long as your roll-up scheme is only using a kind of assets that are native to that protocol so it's not using external assets all you need to do is just deploy a new smart contract and that new smart contract can have the fixes and everyone can just be told to kind of pay attention to the new smart contract and accept the new smart contract as being a kind of the canonical definition of those assets instead right and so basically kind of when you're using an application that only has native assets so like an example of this would be like if you imagine a version of augur that only uses wrap for everything right because the wrap is kind of defined by the ethereum protocol and if auger breaks then and if auger works that way then a fogger were to break then they could just hard fork rep then so for those kinds of applications like the security requirements are lower and so i expect those things to be among the first use cases of some of the optimistic roll-ups that are coming out and i'm looking forward to those optimistic roll-ups and i i think they are going to come out quite soon so we've got zk right now with loopering and others that's happening right now optimistic of the type that you were talking about uh are we weeks months away do you think um i think uh the optimistic roll-up teams that i know we're definitely saying like a coup um a couple of months um but i do think we'll have a kind of test versions uh interview even before that very good well it does seem like the high gas fees are pushing and accelerating hopefully some of these efforts because it is becoming a very urgent and kind of center point for the ethereum community right now vitalik this has been absolutely fantastic thank you so much for joining the bankless nation in this special session we appreciate it thank you it's been good to be here take care
