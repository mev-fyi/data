are we doing today we are rolling it up the crypto industry moves so fast so we are rolling up the last week of december the last week of the year and injecting it right into your brain so you can stay up to speed with this crazy world of crypto happy thursday morning everyone this usually comes at you on friday but we are releasing thursday due to the holidays we release it on both youtube and the podcast so catch it in both places david how was your christmas man absolutely fantastic well complimented by the uh number go up of crypto prices which is definitely going to be a topic of today's roll up as well did you see what i'm drinking from oh i did not show it to me show it to me this this is my wife's gift to me this is a coffee cup gift all right for the listeners on the podcast it is two tokens one's bitcoin and one's ethereum and ethereum is is running saying keep up old man and bitcoin's got a cane i love it she thinks this crypto stuff is weird but she got me a an ethereum maximalist coffee cup and that cracks me up dude all right uh markets let's get right to it you you alluded to it david but bitcoin price go up let's take a look at the charts yeah bitcoin is flirting with 29 000 at the time of recording that is obviously an all-time high for bitcoin i would not be surprised if by the time this is getting into your ears bitcoin has pierced 29 000. ether is moving above 750 is currently at seven hundred and fifty four dollars at the time of recording that is really really just a very high prices very high prices uh ether at seven hundred and fifty dollars is just above the fifty percent mark from his previous all-time high so it feels like it's gone up so much david like so bitcoin is obviously well past its all-time high it's only 10 or more past its all-time high but ether is still down 50 from its all-time high is what you're telling me yeah and i don't really ascribe too much weight to all-time high prices because they these uh cryptos didn't spend much time there previously but yeah like we still have a long way to go to to breach the all-time high for ether price that is hilarious but both are are going up not quite in lockstep i think bitcoin is a little bit ahead but ether has had some very good days over the past week as well what's happening in defy land with total locked value yeah we are up from 14 billion dollars to 14.4 billion dollars still ranging in that 14 to 15 billion dollar range uh the dpi token the index token for defy is up from 108 to a hundred and sixteen and a half dollars do you think we are you know in for a blow off the top at some point here it just can't keep going week over week with these like you know 20 30 gains yeah yeah and i mean that is the symptom of a bull market i feel like the the bull market happens when uh dips don't happen and number continues to go up however i'm not a trader but i do listen to traders and traders are very very focused on the 20-week moving average especially with bitcoin because in bull markets even with bullish attitudes we always retest the 20-week moving average i don't have those figures off the top of my head but i do know that if we had a retracement back to the 20-week moving average which happens all the time in bull markets that would be a very very steep drop that would be like ether going down to i think like 450 and bitcoin going down to like almost like 15 000 uh like less almost half of what bitcoin's price is so like okay wait so so what you're saying is like we could we could be in for a really steep drop right david yet still be in the bull market yes yes that's exactly right what i'm what i'm saying is we are really really overextended and i'm still bullish i'm not selling uh i'm not usually a seller but i'm i'm precariously noticing how far away we are from the 20-week moving average things have moved really far really fast i'm still bullish but i'm really cautious also the market did have a lot of catch up to do from 2018 2019 particularly the price of each so it's not surprising that we're seeing these numbers but we will see what happens in the weeks ahead i'm pretty confident we're gonna have 2021 up though we will we will see what happens there's also david 2.2 million eth now locked in the staking contract in eth too that's like 1.65 billion dollars something close to that how crazy is that yeah that's pretty cool and people are bullish on e2 and this is just really good people are are becoming woke to the yield on east returns people love bitcoin for their constrained asset supply asset and ether is that same thing but with yield uh and so it's constrained supply but yield is something that is really interesting to investors and that's why we are seeing the eth2 deposit contract uh receiving a bunch of youth while we're talking about the market we should talk about the future coinbase ipo the uh the ftx futures options market has a coinbase uh sort of derivative synthetic um going and it's it's trading at over it's like valuing the coin base at over 50 billion dollars if coinbase gets listed not ipo in the 50 billion dollar range how bullish is that for crypto in 2021 yeah this is going to be a really awesome story to follow coinbase will be the first uh vehicle on um on public exchanges that offers you like pure exposure to the cryptocurrency industry right like microstrategy it with it's like backdoor bitcoin etf still has like this software business in the front right it's still something else coinbase is actually selling shovels to the crypto industry investors like that i think that 50 billion dollar valuation is only going to go up as crypto prices go up as well as the crypto mania works into the mainstream works into legacy markets i think a lot of that is going to be reflected in the coinbase ipo price i think it'll be really well timed for brian armstrong and you mentioned sort of um you know fintech in the front but but d5 in the back that's that's the crypto mallet as we call it the d5 mullet coinbase is definitely in that space it looks institutional on the front side of things but it is playing around these crypto and d5 protocols which is good and bullish for the space i think all right that's market david let's talk about releases i think the big release this week uh was the one inch token so everyone got air dropped who used one inch i think you had to use it like four times in the in the past three months or at least one time before september 15th they got air dropped one inch tokens tell us about this yeah so this is just like uni uh except one inch is a little bit more niche it's a little bit harder to use it's got a little bit clunkier ui because that is because it's a dex aggregator right so it's a centralized service aggregating a bunch of different uh prices from a bunch of different exchanges and then giving you the best price in return right uh and so they airdropped you a token i'm not too privy on the details of the token it is some sort of governance token but if you qualify for the token you got something like 1080 one-inch tokens which was worth roughly 2 500 so roughly double the uni swap airdrop and i think the reason why it was it was uh so much more in dollar terms was because so so many fewer people had used one inch first unit swap yeah it's it's pretty it's a pretty phenomenal airdrop though but like like one thing it tends to incent i think is is for defy users to create all sorts of different wallets right like people see an airdrop like that and they're gonna go out for you know get ready for the next ones create all of these different wallets so that they can look like they're a separate user and get more more tokens so it's a it's a strange incentive as far as that goes although so that's actually why one inch uh did differential rewards if you used before september 15th september 15th was the date that uniswap token was released and so if you wanted to game that you wouldn't have known that that was a game to play before september 15th so that's why they did that differential reward did you get any one-inch tokens david i got some one-inch tokens yes what what did you do with your which is funny because i literally made i have literally made one trade on one i was the minimum entry right i dumped it for eth you dumped it for eid okay well you know i got some one-ish tokens too i did the same thing part of the reason why is like fully diluted valuation of one inch at the time when it was airdropped was like something like four billion dollars five billion yeah right doesn't make sense from a um from a valuation perspective to me so of course i think a lot of those one-inch tokens ended up in the reserve currency of d5 which is eth not a big surprise um david let's talk about this haseeb our friend has sieve had a fantastic easy venture capital has been on the bankless podcast before he had a really good take on stable coins and regulations i think this image maybe sums it up did you read this article i have not read it it is in my queue okay well it's a it's a really interesting article and has seberly talks about an evolution of stable coins but um he talks about the the first uh pure crypto era before stable coins where you just had bitcoin and ether and then he talks about the second stage which is roughly you know 20 2017 or so the age of um of tether and that's kind of the age that we're in right now he predicts that regulators are going to crack down on these tether type coins and what we'll get is sort of a regulatory age of stable coins where we might get things like libra and usdc and these things take control but eventually he thinks regulators will clamp down even hard on the regulated stable coins and eventually we'll we will enter a reign of the decentralized stable coin so you know protocols like dye will make a comeback and maybe new decentralized algorithmic type stable coins uh will take shape and form that are outside of the grasp of regulators super interesting set of predictions i think very timely given all of the stable coin type murmurings and regulation we have heard about recently and he takes there yeah it's interesting to see all of the coming regulation around crypto dollar stable coins coming and also these experiments going on if you've been paying attention to this world of decentralized stable coins you know about uh d um dynamic set dollar empty set dollar rye and a few other ones there's another a few other ones i'm missing as well but there are a bunch of experiments going on with how to generate a new form of decentralized trustless stable coins people are pointing at dying and saying that there's a lot of usdc backing dye and if the prediction that uscc is going to become heavily regulated that impacts dye which means we need more options in our trustless stable coins than just die and there are many many experiments coming to fill that void i think that will be a very cool story to follow in 2021 yeah totally agree i think this is a good model for how stable coins could evolve so keep your eyes on that and that's haseeb's thesis we'll include a link to that in the show notes um the block put together a timeline of defy events that happened this year anything pop out for you david like anything worth highlighting man this this year's been such a blur for me like so much happened but why don't you why don't you pick out a few of the highlights here yeah this is just like as somebody who's been living and breathing crypto especially in 2020 this was just like a a trip through the pass of 2020 which both seems to have flown by and also taken forever somehow at the same time i don't really have any special takes here it's worth just going and checking out the graphic uh this has a graphic to view if you guys like visuals rather than text and so it's definitely worth to check out it will also be in the show notes just a recap of last year really talks about the uniswap drop it talks about d5 summer it talks about um ave all of these things that happened that were sort of a blur uh from from the the year that was crypto in 2020. um david another protocol launched open which is a defy options protocol they just launched their v2 any takes on this yeah i think another important story of 2021 is trustless decentralized protocolized options on ethereum we're seeing a race for this as we speak right now the race is already hot open is not the only team going after that there's also hedgic andre also released something as well we'll see if that turns into into anything real um 2021 decentralized trustless options on ethereum it's totally gonna happen here's another one that launched just last week called uh primitive i haven't had a chance to explore that but that's yet another that we're talking about um going back to maybe a story from from 2020 as well yeah the original food token the food token that started it all started of course with an ample fourth type rebasing mechanism uh be familiar with what that is uh you know it's it's it's it's a little bit of a gimmick but it's it's kind of a way to um i guess make the appearance of a token like em to like to to make it appear like it attracts a dollar it doesn't really supply fluctuates um but they just turned their rebasing feature off so yam of course uh became a food token which became a which became a dowel uh i don't know if you don't know what i'm talking about david maybe you could explain this a little bit better so there's a lot of history here yeah so ample fourth created rebasing and then yam took that rebasing mechanism and turned it into a way to add value to the treasury and then then yam turned into a dow em as a governance token with a rebasing mechanism built in and i think the governors of yam just decided that they just had it with the whole rebasing thing they were tired of like the supply of yams that they own keep on changing right and like that was annoying and it's difficult to operate with and at the end of the day i think like they thought that the rebasing mechanism wasn't really adding much value back to the yam ecosystem so they just decided to ax it and i think what's really cool about this is the collective governance decisions around something like yams to make a coherent decision with each other saying yeah we don't want this anymore let's like let's do something new and so like yam started as this rebasing mechanism that generated a treasury and now it's turning into something else which means that like what yams really is is completely decided in the social layer right it's completely a governed protocol and it's up to the governors to figure out how to make yam more valuable and they're clearly ready to cut off anything or add anything to make that happen yeah it's kind of a cool story i think we'll be excited to see how this evolves because now that they have this capital pool you talked about the yam ecosystem they're actually launching products on the yam ecosystem so these are like d5 products one is called degenerative finance they also have like an insurance product called umbrella i've been monitoring this a little bit they're also taking a part of their treasury and like investing it so they they invested in the the dpi the defy index as well so they're they're taking this treasury they're making it more valuable this is kind of what uh any capital pool will do any kind of like i guess corporation in the real world might do and it's a it's a very interesting uh i think model for what a decentralized autonomous organization uh capital pool on ethereum might do in the future um david i think that's that's what we have time for as far as releases we should jump to the news i think one big news item of the week is in i guess the good gov section we've got a new sec chairman who has been appointed so bye bye jay clayton bye jay clinton he's been around for for most of my tenure in crypto always kind of the like the face of the sec about to pounce on crypto um now there is a uh according to reports i don't know much about this this gentleman the new sec chair um but apparently he is very crow pro crypto any takes here yeah um nothing no no takes here interesting to see a new sec chairman getting people that are pro crypto in regulatory bodies is really really important and really really good and this is a really important regulatory body to have a pro crypto person inside we say pro crypto and it's interesting the sec at the same time is of course launching a pretty massive lawsuit investigation etc against ripple against xrp's pro crypto xrp isn't crypto that's what i would say right yeah you know um so they're going to be pro crypto hopefully but um you know maybe not pro all of the the centralized shenanigans that you know happen in the crypto space keep crypto crypto in the bad gov category though we've got uh mnuchin and uh jake travinsky um published this this is kind of over the holidays so i was looking at it a little bit but apparently fincen the working group under munition has issued another statement this time calling for on-chain kyc basically to any crypto wallet any eth wallet any unhosted wallet as they they would call it that have stable coins in them so of course on chain kyc at the ethereum address level is not possible it's not part of the ethereum protocol but mnuchin well they could submit an eip if you really wanted to i i would i would invite uh uh mnuchin to submit an eip to add that and maybe we will consider it well what's what's very interesting here is not only the the lack of feasibility and technical feasibility right like they seem to think that um ethereum accounts ethereum addresses are are similar to uh to banks and right that because the banking layer has an aml kyc function that a protocol like ethereum would have a kyc function but of course that is not built into the underlying protocol of ethereum and never will be because the social layer will reject it this is i think partially concerning because this is what many of the kind of big bankers like munition really want for this space at the same time jake says it's not enforceable at this point in time but but it just shows where their their head is on this yeah if you get down to it and you can go into the nth degree what minutian is asking for is to have private keys have kyc data embedded in them somehow not possible not possible and what's concerning to me is that they are trying to get rules passed which again aren't possible because they're using frameworks from the legacy world to try and make rules about a new world that they don't understand so they're not even bothering to like ask is this even possible before they write a rule it's  crazy excuse me yeah it is and here's what you need to do guys so we had this conversation with again jake travinsky last last week on state of the nation but um there there is a vincent proposed rule out there that is not quite as severe as what we just said but requires um requires exchanges essentially to implement aml kyc type function for any unhosted address if you're withdrawing from a coinbase or something like that they would have to identify you there's this comment period that has just opened up we talked about it with with jake and what we need you to do what you should do is submit your comment you don't even have to be a us citizen to do this jake has a great thread on how to construct a good comment uh it shouldn't be insulting it should be fact based i submitted mine on monday it was very very much um basically framing framing the the issue as the us would be left behind if it didn't embrace uh defy on behalf of kind of a crypto investor crypto entrepreneur it's kind of my take um so submit your comments this is this is how we use our voice to take action in the traditional crest the old legacy nation state it still is important that we do that so that we don't get uh regulatory requirements that are bad and set the space back and try to stymie this space yep agreed all right etoro ipo rumors so do you know much about etoro david yeah they're in an exchange like coinbase they have a couple extra features like a social trader feature that they have uh pioneered i think the big story is is that coinbase is not going to be the only crypto ipo of 2021 if this rumor is true and that makes me ask the question what other ipos are going on behind the scenes yeah exactly so etoro is rumored to possibly ipo there's probably a list somewhere of other similar like ubiko might be one for instance other similar size companies that might follow coinbase's lead and ipo could be an interesting year in the public markets from that perspective um well we're talking about coinbase coinbase was among the first to d-list xrp followed by binance followed by bittrex followed by trading desks everywhere what's going on here david yeah so this is bad for xrp as a currency xrp is designed to be extremely liquid and extremely available and having it delisted from you know the biggest exchange in the united states and then from binance u.s and also from big trucks and then also from trading desks i don't know how you achieve the goals of being an extremely liquid crypto assets without having any exchanges that doesn't seem to make much sense also the the xrp asset price is like plummeting it lost like 25 or something in the last week so you also don't get liquidity when you're when number go down uh so not a good week for xrp and and so why are they all delisting david for folks that have kind of not followed things up to this point so the sec last week came out and said that they are going after uh ripple the company because xrp is an unregistered security and there's also a bunch of extremely damning statements coming out of ripple leadership uh talking about how just how to pump and dump the coin basically uh it has been out basically the explicit strategy of ripple to pump the coin which i guess if you're trying to make an extremely liquid currency that makes sense because you need number to go up to go to be liquid but it's the way that they did it and also there being a centralized issuer makes that you know not good right now information asymmetries between the buyers and sellers and just a bunch of whole host of just like nefarious activity that you just don't want to see happen and yet they did it anyways i've got a hot take here that we'll get to in a little bit but but remember this nasty listings of xrp are happening and it seems like they're accelerating as well there's also another sort of d5 protocol hack this is the cover protocol which as i understand it david it's like an insurance d5 protocol that's supposed to be protecting some of uh the the d5 critical assets what was the attack what happened for those that missed it yeah so this was an exploit in the cover token there is a token that goes with cover and the attacker managed to uh do a a an inflation bug mint right and so he the oh he or she just minted something like four quadrillion or quintillion tokens right and so basically infinite basically infinite and so when you have basically infinite numbers of tokens you can take those tokens to any amm and then drain the amms and so that what the attacker did is they minted basically an infinite number of tokens took them to uniswap took them to balancer sold them into the amms to drain all of the other tokens on the other side which would be ether and and then i think also some stable coins um and then what's really interesting the as the tweet that you're showing the attacker was able to drain 4 350 eth and then in a transaction he sent it back to the covered deployer address so he gave it back so let it be known he still did damage because the token price dropped but he gave what was what he quote unquote stole he gave that back so people still have lost because you know the the trust in the in the cover token the the value of the cover token you know dropped um but at least that he gave the ether back interestingly um if you hit that click to see more button ryan on the bottom left you'll see a note from the attacker that says uh oh maybe maybe i can't see him it was in a different tweet the attacker wrote uh next time like uh fix your stuff yourself idiots or something like that it was like a kind of a funny funny but pretty mean note from the attacker saying you know fix your next time um so that was pretty funny uh sorry to anyone that got uh got burned by this but hey at least he sent the uh the ether back cover right now is figuring out how to redistribute the ether back to the people that lost money it's d5 truly is the wild west this kind of stuff happens and it's uh it's so bizarre so the hacker gave back 3.2 million dollars what thief do you know steals millions of dollars and same day turnaround anonymously like gives it back this space is so strange from that perspective like the unexpected tends to happen almost all of the time i think if you have these sorts of skills where you can you know how to do this you probably have a decent amount of money in the space those are very specialized skills i bet you he didn't really need the money um and you know maybe at the end of the day like it's a what kind of hack this was what is it it was a black hat but was it a gray hat and because he gave the money back i don't really know he's willing to do some harm but not all of the harm very interesting um sometimes some people just have a fun time playing with real people's money and and i guess they enjoy that that's why we call this guy as the frontier there are risks out there be careful this was a relatively newer d5 protocol this kind of thing can happen to you especially to newer protocols but also even to more established protocols from time to time so be careful out there of course if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallets i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in defy and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and d5 is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at why earn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well david let's get to some takes and i want to start with dc investors 2021 predictions since we are beginning 2021 this is the time where everyone takes out their crystal ball and starts making predictions i enjoyed dc investors predictions on each should we go through some of these let's do it all right so what's the first david number one institutions are coming and many will start to buy eth why dc asks liquidity plus cme futures plus reflexivity as the number two asset and then also the narrative all the apps being built on ethereum therefore you might as well invest in eth and then also the building of fiat on-ramps and also flailing competitors a bunch of different variables that are all contributing to why dc thinks that uh institutions will come and buy east in 2021 what do you think agree disagree oh i do i even need to answer that question i absolutely agree that makes complete sense to me i do think ether is an asset that has like two engines of growth which is pretty unique it can go the institutional engine of growth the same way bitcoin is growing with cme futures right it's not a commodity or it is a commodity in the us um and it can also it also has the d5 engine of growth so i i totally agree too dc is right on there personality is really important and that's what makes you eat compelling exactly uh what's the second here defy will explode again starting with a big surge in q1 and again in q3 so that's a very specific prediction from dc here he says the emphasis will shift from food tokens to synthetic assets financial contracts and collateralized lending financial contracts maybe maybe he's alluding to the growth of options as we were talking about earlier in this podcast um and may he i guess with synthetic assets he's talking about things like synthetics and uma collateralized lending we all know what that is he says this will be fueled by centralized exchanges pooling customer funds to allow for small participants interesting interesting that is a take i have not yet heard before well it is that a little bit of protocol sync thesis basically you know crypto banks start building on top of these protocols and they become a user onboarding uh source for d5 protocols and i guess the yeah dc is saying that this this is going to happen yet again in q1 that's pretty soon and also potentially in uh in q3 so um yeah d5 is going to have its day another d5 summer i suppose is what what he's saying here i'm down all right let's talk about this third one here what is it l2 will make it will take the main net by storm heating up in earnest during q3 dc getting really specific with the time frames here these will be based on roll-up technologies and will help ethereum and not only scale to more users but also create far better ux and allow for new services all together i do agree with dc here i think that the growth of quote-unquote money legos that we've seen in ethereum so far is going to extend out to roll-ups people are going to get really creative with how to make roll-ups interoperable and fluid and liquid with the main chain and other roll-ups i think i think the creativity that we see in d5 is going to get extended into the l2 ecosystem and that's definitely going to happen in 2021. to me david this has got to be the year roll-ups and layer 2 ethereum layer two really delivers right because like it seems like every year it's not only ethereum but also bitcoin there's some bullishness on layer two something right like every year for bitcoin it's like this is the year of lightning this oh next year this is the year lightning oh next year but ethereum to be ferrous has you know some of the same things right stage channels uh you know do you remember when raiden was was kind of all the rage was going to scale ethereum and then uh there was plasma and now uh the zeke is is roll-ups it feels like roll-ups have the most substance we're seeing real world solutions start to be deployed but we're not seeing the killer use the killer app the killer roll up the killer um layer 2 at this point in time do you think this is a do or die year for ethereum layer 2 well we all got um we all felt the pain of super high gas prices towards the end of d5 summer 2020 and that was definitely what incurred this rage into l2s um and roll ups as well uh and i think the difference between like you know oh it's different this time this is the year of you know this scaling tech well we never have had like prolonged demand force for l2s as we've had recently and we actually kind of lost it right d5 summer ended and gas prices aren't aren't you know low but they're definitely not high if the if 2021 is like 2017 gas prices on ethereum are going to absolutely dwarf what we saw back in d5 summer 2020 and once again that will generate the impetus for getting people on to l2 and so i do think that this time is different all right we will see if that prediction proves to be the case let's get to number four david what's this one eth will establish its brand as a programmable store of value reinforced by d fights deposits and staking in east 2. this will pro this will propel east on its inevitable journey to become the world's first programmable macro asset and over five to ten years the implications will be staggering yeah this is this is the same drum we've been beating on the bankless program for a long time dc's right there with us uh people are going to come to understand ether as a macro asset alongside bitcoin that's going to get people really excited very good all right the last but not least can you read out this one eip1559 will launch onto ethereum 1x introducing the world to what truly could be deflationary ether this reinforces ether as a store of value ending discussions around eth as endless supply and and start uh to have conversations around why proof of work hard caps are unworkable ooh that last part is spicy interesting so eip-1559 there's almost like two parts to this like the first is that the feature will actually be delivered in 2021 and at some level that depends on sort of ethereum development and eth one development and tim baker hope you're listening tim it's it's dependent on you partially uh so that's the first prediction you think that that's gonna happen yeah yeah i know i think that's totally gonna happen um people have been murmuring about accelerating eip1559 i'm not a core dev so don't cite me on that i don't have any support any like uh authority in the matter so that's just my speculation but i do think it's coming in 2021. the people who are close to it who i've talked to seem to think there's a good case for it happening in 2021 too and the second part of dc's prediction here is that once that happens that will reinforce this this um narrative around eth as a store value asset and contrast it you know between something like like bitcoin and other proof of work uh you know fixed cap issuance schedules as well what's your take there yeah i wrote an article in the bankless newsletter a while ago called bitcoin and its musical chairs its scarcity game well eip1559 and bernie ether really is a very salient similar game for ether because ether is being deleted therefore chairs are being pulled away from the circle actively rather than passively right and so that becomes like it's very understandable over time ether is burned so if you buy ether now you will have a greater percentage of the overall ether because of burning ether that's an easy thing to understand all right those are dc's five predictions for 2021 uh i think pretty good there's lots of predictions going around but we picked dc's because uh they they were particularly good and very concise um david some other takes going around can i get to this xrp tank let's do it all right so here's the thing all the xrpd listings right this is really what happens when your liquidity or token's liquidity is dependent on centralized crypto banks as we said this is this is a hot take that that i've talked about for a while but i think because of this eth is more censorship resistant than bitcoin at least on this dimension because all of bitcoin's liquidity is very much based on crypto banks it's based on essentially these side chains like a coin base or a binance it does not have a uniswap uh on chain on bitcoin eth does have units 12. that is what makes it more censorship resistant at least on that dimension i i think very much bitcoiners discount the rule that defy can play in making their monetary system more censorship resistant and that is definitely a strength of ethereums that's my hot take dave what do you say to that yeah so when you when you consider liquidity you can divide liquidity into trustless liquidity or trusted liquidity right and that's where ethereum really excels ethereum offers trustless liquidity for its assets bitcoin because it doesn't have smart contracts and because it gains scale and accessibility through the banking layer also has zero trustless liquidity and that's that's kind of why we are really excited about ethereum is because if you are in uniswap if you are on amms if you're in balancer you have trustless liquidity no one can rug pull that liquidity from you uh if you are in a an unregistered security on a crypto exchange it is really easy to get d listed uh and um yeah i'm totally with you there well so let's play this out uh david just to you know talk about this let's say the government for whatever reason went to war with bitcoin and sent letters to coinbase and every everyone they could every centralized exchange operative they could to de-list bitcoin immediately what would happen i mean i think what would happen is the same thing that's happening to you xrp right now it would be like we would run out of sources for liquidity for bitcoin now they could do the same thing with eth but you can't delist something from a trustless protocol like unit swap so on ethereum they'll always be um exchanges without an off button that can't be censored and are outside of the the arm of um of regulators that's that's kind of the scenario like in my mind when when i think about this take yeah the internal defy ecosystem offers like the strongest backstop for ether and other trustless assets on ethereum uh i i think that hopefully that future does not come out and ether in that same future where you know the nation state goes goes hard after bitcoin and probably ether two in that same uh in that same vein that would still be bad because then we don't have on and off ramps and so we're kind of stuck in the defy world but at least we still have liquidity exactly yep exactly it's not gonna happen but at any time soon i hope but it is nice to have that feature here um here's a another take by uh by jacob uh franek yeah from coinmetrix yeah from foreign metrics this is one of my favorite takes i've heard lately a global value settlement layer needs no total addressable market it is the total addressable market i think that's an interesting perspective what he's really saying is ethereum as a global settlement layer there is no like total addressable market for ether right for ethereum right it doesn't it's not going after one specific market it is the market right it is the host of economic activity um i think that's pretty cool yeah absolutely okay here's another take from eva baylin every time a payment company marginalizes more people i buy eth what do you mean by this yeah ava works at the at the graph uh she what she's just saying is that um if if somebody gets like uh cut off from payments infrastructure in that same way we were just talking about how you can't list d-list assets on uniswap or whatever you also can't stop people from sending you money on ethereum right stablecoins ether whatever and so any anytime a payment company cuts off access to a in industry or services ava is saying that she buys eth because she's bullish on the need for trustless permissionless payments um quick take uh just so super simple sentence i love it nice job um kevin awakey as well from get coin wrote this editorial in coindesk and uh i love the headline here how d5 degens are funding the next wave of open source development david how are d gens helping the public goods thesis here yeah kevin iwaki extends this out of defy summer 2020 when people would like ape into some random tokens or like just do something degenerate as he would say like ill-advised perhaps trying to get rich quick and what he's saying is that as a result of defy summer a number of protocols wiring uh yams a few other ones synthetics they ended up donating and committing long-term funding for ethereum development using git coin right and so if you ever yellowed into like wi-fi or if you ever yolo into yams or something you buy proxy helped fund public goods on ethereum so cool really good job for kevin milwaukee for first of all building bitcoin and allowing that capture to happen and then also nice job writing this article and putting it in coindesk check that out there will be a link in the notes david you had a really good take here and maybe this uh this will be our last take um so you you said that yield is drying up in legacy markets with 30-year treasuries below 0.9 aaa corporate bonds aren't much better but you said on ethereum almost every single protocol offers yield in some way so ethereum and d5 according to you almost becomes the last bastion of yield and investors will want this do you think that they will want this in 2021 absolutely yield is drying up in the legacy world yet it is flourishing on ethereum i actually have a short piece coming out in coindesk following owaki's piece in their 2020 year in review about this um people are waking up to bitcoin and the idea of protocol constrained monetary policy and i think when that when you open up that door and you say yes to bitcoin you see behind bitcoin a very yield rich fields in ethereum and i think that's going to get people very excited when um when treasuries when 30-year treasuries drop below one percent in yield uh people are going to take that capital and put it elsewhere um and some people are putting that in bitcoin even though bitcoin doesn't offer yield uh but then also some people could start to you know put their usdc into ave you know maybe they maybe they provide liquidity into a uniswap position people that provided liquidity to uniswap within the eth us dc pair in 2020 earned a staggering 35 apy on a hybrid ether us dollar position so if you are cool with exposing yourself to ether which i think people if you are interested in exposing yourself to bitcoin then therefore you're probably pretty interested in exposing yourself to ether but you can also get yield in partially us dollar denominated terms by providing liquidity to unit swap yields in ethereum is abundant and investors want that absolutely it's you know we we always use this uh this image if we've got the traditional finance system and that's that's kind of one world and then we have like this bridge right they're connecting and it's like kind of coin bases and exchanges on the other side of this bridge once you upload your money into the bankless financial system you you pop out into this magical world of yields of like five percent 10 20 potentially right and so like the the pipe is relatively small because uh it takes a lot like it takes a decent amount to cross cross that chasm to to understand what it takes to convert your fiat upload your us dollars into some sort of stable coin or some sort of reserve asset like bitcoin underneath but once you pop out on the other side you're in this land of magical yields right and i think more and more people will be attracted by that and uh take that journey across the bridge to the other side it's a good take david what's in here what are you excited about going into 2021 uh i'm pretty excited about uh this this new car that i just bought but i'm particularly excited about how i financed it and so i applied for a loan except they didn't really like my four month long uh work history as a self-employed content producer in the crypto space that didn't really sit well with them i didn't i did not get that loan approved uh and so i just went to ave and got a loan from ave and they didn't care about what job or profession i was because i had collateral in there albeit that is apples to oranges one is unsecured credit one is an over collateralized loan um and i think i thought that the experience of financing a car using a loan from defy where i didn't have to fill out any paperwork was a treat um the yield the the interest payments i'm paying from ave are pretty steep i think for the average car loan but i'm in it for the experience you know i'll pay yield extra yield on aetherium uh just to have the experience of having financed a car uh using ave that is a really cool story now you you've got to watch of course so your liquidation price uh on there so if there's a massive price drop you could be liquidated david are you concerned about that yeah well no my liquidation price is very very low i'm keeping that nicely under control and always keeping an eye on it as you should um but at the same time i needed a new car because for those that didn't know i was driving a 1972 volvo in seattle which it rains quite a lot and within that car when it rains i would feel the rain at my ankles and so i definitely needed a new car well congrats man and the benefit there is of course you don't have to sell your precious youth right this does not require that when you take out a collateralized loan i would not have gotten a car if i would have to sell my ease not worth it not worth it all right ryan what are you excited about dude i i just think um bank lifts had a crazy awesome year so we published 150 articles uh on the newsletter plus 53 how-to tactics and how to do something cool in d5 plus david we just recently surpassed 100 podcasts uh that's that's a lot of time that we spent together like between kind of weekly roll ups between our monday podcasts to the nation's 100 podcasts my friend um our getting started guide getting started how to get started go bank list has been viewed over 1.2 million times and somehow even though we suck at youtube people watch this on youtube and we have close to 14 000 subscribers so it's been a really exciting year i think for for for bankless and this movement is is global now we've got chinese translations we've got russian translations um we've got um french translations the community there so i'm really excited about um the reason we we started this whole thing david which is to onboard the world like a massive goal of getting a billion people into the bankless ecosystem into open finance that's kind of why we started and we're not necessarily going to do all that you know kind of our media efforts are just one drop in in in the bucket but the bankless meme lowercase b people choosing to take back financial sovereignty and go bankless that is i think the narrative and the meme that can get us to a billion people uh in open finance a billion people in crypto and david this is my prediction i don't have a prediction for 2021 at this point but i do have the prediction for end of decade there will be over a billion people in crypto they're owning crypto using crypto systems in some way by the end of this decade uh i believe that and uh you know i wanna i wanna keep keep doing what we're doing to help make that possible so thanks to everyone who has supported bankless over the past year whether you're subscribing the newsletter whether you're watching this whether you are telling your friends you have made this possible and uh we appreciate it we're honored and and humbled to be part of this movement one billion bankless citizens by the end of the decade i definitely hope that that's comes true and if if that does come true it's definitely not going to be because we did a bunch of podcasts or wrote a bunch of things yes it's going to be because our listeners and our and and everyone else in the crypto world helped spread the message and so if you want this industry to survive you need to pull in people in order to make that happen we do believe that the value that the crypto industry is creating is um not understood by the rest of the world and and it actually is ready for the rest of the world to come and use it and so we just at this point we just need to get into more ears and that is where you the listener comes into play i hope you enjoyed all the podcasts i didn't know that we had passed a hundred podcasts in 2020 that's pretty crazy i hope you guys have enjoyed listening to our voices all of that time um i hope that's true they better have better i've been trained but thanks for bearing with us all the step of the way and look forward to a very content-rich 2021 absolutely guys happy new year from bank list of course recent disclaimers none of this has been financial advice this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad that you are with us this has been weekly rollups from bankless
