long would this all take after all the test nets and the bell tricks hard four yeah the hard thing with timelines is like unknown unknowns right it's like sure there's a world where like everything goes right and like we merge in august but at the same time if you set that expectation and say we find a weird sync bug on one of these test nets and it takes us two weeks to shape it fixed and it's like well maybe it's on august and it's september and if you find two of those they're like oh maybe it's not early september is like mid-september did you find like three or four then it's like oh maybe it's like october the thing i am like really confident about is like for it to not happen in 2022 there would have to be like a really terrible thing that happens it's like if you told me you know will we find a bug for the merge i'd say like sure there's probably a good chance the odds of like finding seven or ten to me are tiny
