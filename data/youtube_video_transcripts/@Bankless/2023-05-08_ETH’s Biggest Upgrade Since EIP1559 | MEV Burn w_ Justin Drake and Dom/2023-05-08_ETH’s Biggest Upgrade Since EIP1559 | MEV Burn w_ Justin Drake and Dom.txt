we have this positive feedback loop going on because the more coming back if you have the more decentralized stable coins we have the more economic activity we have the stronger the shelling points become of scarcity and security there is going to be in my opinion one asset that's going to win the the beauty contest basically of being the most attractive asset and right now E30 asset is the number one you know Contender to winning this beauty contest welcome to bank let where we explore the frontier of Internet money and internet Finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless did you know bankless listener that in the not too distant future it's likely not 100 but very likely that ethereum is going to get yet another economic upgrade that will burn even more eth David did you know that before this episode I do now I mean we learned a lot in this episode this is going to be the biggest potential upgrade to eth since eip1559 at least when it comes to the burn of course you remember eip1559 we talked about it a lot on Bank lists in the days before the bird the burn and the days after the burn but that was the first of two potential Burns that are coming we're going to talk about the second today this is called the Mev burn and the guests today call this ethereum's second business model a few things we're going to cover number one why Mev that is maximal extractable value is so annoying to protocol devs number two why eth is not only money but it's also like oil Justin uses the analogy of crude oil and petroleum and jet fuel you find out what that means number three why Justin Drake says all validators are losers but there's a way we can fix it and number four we talk about this metaphor Birds bread and Mev burn what do they all have in common what is ethereum's second business model David I just when you thought you couldn't learn more about ether and the economic potential you couldn't get more bullish on either the asset of course Justin Drake comes in with another episode this time he's accompanied by another protocol Dev whose name is Dom David why is this episode so significant this episode is going to apply a lot of previous bankless content so we are going to layer on the lessons here in this episode and I think we did a pretty good job of of referencing those lessons that we talk about in the episode so some previous episodes that we are going to to need for the bankless listener in order to understand uh the episodes about eip1559 either with Justin Drake in the ultrasound money episode or the one that we did about eip1559 with hazu understanding eip1559 as a mechanism will be a core building block for this also Matt Cutler's blockchain supply chain how and how a block comes to be mined on ethereum or minted on ethereum which leads into the conversation of proposal Builder separation there's a lot of pre-existing knowledge that culminates in this new upcoming EIP I don't think we have a number for this yet but this new protocol changed to ethereum that what is what Justin and Dom say is a logical continuation of eip1559 and so there are two main patterns two main mechanisms of eip1559 that are being continued one about eip1559 is that it actually places an oracle of ethereum into itself what do I mean by that through eip1559 ethereum is actually able to see how much block space is being demanded it is is providing itself with information about how much demand there is for its own block space and through that mechanism eip1559 allows ethereum to price itself a very important mechanism and then of course the second is the burn these two mechanisms are being extended here in Mev burn two great benefit for many different parties in the ethereum ecosystem but primarily the etholder and so really the significance here is about the economics of ether and the other thing to pay attention to is this part of the conversation where we focus on how ether is actually the most decentralized part of that stack and so the choice to place emphasis on ether is a choice in decentralization so these I would say are the themes of the episode to really pay attention to and if the banklessness or need to pause and go acquire some knowledge from other bankless podcasts before diving into this one I would definitely recommend you to do that because they are all very valuable podcasts yeah I would definitely say this is maybe 300 level content and you know we thought we were going to do one ultrasound money episode with Justin Drake but it turns out this is like the ultrasound money never stops because uh we keep improving the products more ultrasound I mean if you're curious about what this Mev burn uh is how much eth per year it might burn you know Justin Drey comes in with numbers so he's got estimates of that when is it coming we have all of that information the podcast and David I am super excited to actually do the debrief with you after this episode because I learned some things about ethereum I didn't know and I want to pick your brain about those so of course our debrief episode is the episode we record right after the episode it's on the bankless premium feed you can access that if you're a bankless citizen and some citizens have told me recently that this is actually their favorite part of the bankless podcast and some of the episodes they're just like you know the episode is good uncut no I know we just you kind of ramble and people enjoy that but like maybe the debrief is for you maybe uh that's a good uh addendum to the episode anyway that is available for you click the link in the show notes

illustrates the metrics and data around the world's most interesting financial asset eth Justin has helped the bankless nation navigate the world of cryptography crypto economics and today he returns to bankless with a brand new course of study to teach us this time in the world of Mev Justin welcome back to bankless thanks for having me again we also have Dom aka damathy the robin to Justin's Batman also a researcher at the ethereum foundation and has a comfy seat aboard the ultrasound train as well he's also played a big role in today's subject behind Mev Byrne research Dom welcome to bankless for the first time it's an honor to have you yeah I'm happy to be here I'm really excited for this uh conversation especially when Justin gave me the line that Mev burn is simply The Logical continuation of eip1559 we've got a great conversation mapped out for the for you bankless Nation but first I think we really need to start at the highest of levels before we map out that conversation just so we can set the stage Justin what is Mev burn okay so Mev band is a a very simple idea is this idea that all the excess Mev that's being generated on ethereum that is currently going to proposals through what are called Mev spikes um no longer go to the proposals in the form of MV spikes instead these spikes get kind of smoothed out and so that's one aspect of Mev brand is this smoothing of the spikes and then the second aspect is the redistribution meaning that the if is burnt and it's essentially redistributed to all the eve holders Justin can we really quick for people who even Mev was too much for them I think we have to Define what This Acronym actually means m-e-v so if you're deep in the crypto weeds you've probably heard crypto folks talk about this a lot in different contexts can you define what Mev is for us and tell us why it's important why are crypto people always talking about About This Acronym Mev right so Mev stands for maximal extractable Value it's basically the value that can be extracted by the participants that are running some sort of economic system from the participants the activity on top of that economic system so in the case of ethereum we have a blockchain that's the economic system the participants behind it are the proposals the testers the block Builders The Searchers Etc um and the activity is transactions and it turns out that these participants that are making a fear move forward block by block have the opportunity to extract value from the transactions now I'd kind of distinguish two forms of of Meg one is what I call contentions or congestion fees is the more people want to use the chain um the more you have to pay in terms of Base fees for eip1559 and that is the the most common use of uh ethereum and it it leads to again these these so-called congestion fees but there is a a second thing going on which is contention so sometimes you don't only care about getting your transaction confirmed getting your transaction included on chain you also care about specific ordering and this is for very sophisticated actors for example arbitragers that for example want to be at the very top of the block um and it turns out that what eip1559 did is that it took um these congestion fees that were previously going to the consensus participants to the proposals and now it's giving it to the system itself to the eve holders and what Mev burn is all about is basically continuing this story of eip1559 but for contention and so now um you know we have this potential opportunities you have two separate business models for for ethereum both in terms of revenue from congestion fees but also revenue from contention and it's not just about all sorts of economic advantages that we get from that but there's also Security benefits from the smoothing that I was talking about so right Justin we're definitely going to talk about the you know the the smoothing and the security benefits and all of those things but but really quickly while we're still on the topic of Mev and bankless listeners you can there's a library there's a library of previous Mev episodes if you still need to catch up on Mev itself but just the ethereum posture that from a protocol perspective on Mev what is Mev is it is it good is it bad is it something we're trying to squeeze out of the system is it something we're trying to harness and manage um trying to form an opinion on Mev if it's if it's good or if it's evil right so Mev just is it's a emergent Behavior so it's something that emerges from the economic activity on top of this economic system and from the perspective of a protocol designer it's kind of annoying and the reason it's annoying is because it distorts the incentive that we put in place right so we we have these crypto economic incentives you know for example issuance is this thing that we control as a designer of a blockchain and the Mev comes and distorts these incentives and so on the one hand from the perspective of the protocol we kind of want to tame and we want to mitigate the Mev but it turns out that not only can we mitigate some of these negative externalities of Mev but we can actually embrace them we can harness them and Mev can actually make ethereum stronger it can provide more Economic Security it can provide more economic bandwidth and ultimately it can help ethereum succeed in its mission of becoming a settlement layer for the incidental value so when as a podcaster one of the reasons why I love doing podcasts with Justin Drake is because he provides very robust agendas which makes my job very very easy so Justin we've got four parts that we're gonna walk through um just part zero the intro setting the stage uh part one uh the mental model congestion and contention which you've already established and then after this we go into smoothing which are talking about the security benefits for ethereum and then redistribution which are the economic benefits and so the way I see this conversation going forward is uh we're just going to start to set the stage continue to Define some terms a little bit and then we're going to really unpack that mental model of what Justin calls congestion versus contention and both of these are block space demand but one is just congestion is just like basal block space demand the average transaction and then contention is the demand to be first in a block and these different demands have different properties smoothing is Mev smoothing and redistribution is Mev burn uh redistributing it to all etholders but Dom I'm wondering where do you fit inside of this conversation where have you specialized uh what What's your your role here when you do a lot of the ethereum research uh what are you specifically researching and what should we know before we we go through this conversation yeah I'm mostly interested in the way we quantify Mev we're working with the auction model or having proposers like impose their view of bids from block Builders so this is like step one of Mev burn is actually quantifying the the bids and the because mbv is very subjective when you think about it like an arbitr using putting a transaction first the block to extract like one eth from like two different decentralized exchanges that's not something the protocol can be aware of because that's all application Level stuff so we have to use uh the subjective view of blog Builders and how much they're willing to buy proposers and if we can then turn that in the protocol then that's the that's the way for the protocol to be aware of of what's going on like the most objectively it can even though it's still application Level and once we have this way of establishing the biz in the protocol then we can proceed to the burn and doing whatever we want with it the same way eip1559 has this on-chain Oracle for the base fee uh this is what we want for Meb uh this makes me really excited because one of the beautiful things I think that got a lot of the ethereum community excited about Mev was the Elegance in the mechanism of actually being able to instantiate what is the market rate for gas on chain so that now that that kind of becomes like an on-train oracle of sorts like the ethereum protocol knows something about itself because of eip1559 and that thing is what is the net demand for my block space uh that it becomes an output that is what the output of vip1559 the mechanism is and I think what you're saying is that we've got this new mechanism and this new mechanism actually allows the ethereum protocol to come up with some quantification of what the level of Mev is going on on top of it is that my understanding Dom yes it's all external demand that the protocol can be aware of and then do whatever we want with it and tweak the incentive for security and economic properties which is all exciting stuff and this is a really important part of this conversation because when we talk about uh the two things that are Downstream of that um the uh smoothing and the redistribution it first starts with understanding how the ethereum protocol actually quantifies Mev because we need to know how much to burn and how much to to smooth correct yes okay cool all right um so let's where do we where should we start here uh do we Justin do we have any more definitions that we need to get through before we get to congestion and contention I mean on the topic of uh congestion and contention I kind of have this this metaphor that I came up with this morning let's let's see how how well it sticks so I kind of think of three uh forms of of of oil of uh for for E30 assets so this kind of crude oil which is the the unrefined format and this is what you're holding in your wallet in large quantities you know in barrels and barrels of oil you know stored in cold storage and you're not using on a regular basis and then you have this more refined form of oil which is petroleum that you use on a day-to-day basis to go drive your kids to school or to go to the to the grocery store and what happens there is like basically you take a few liters of crude oil and then there's this digital refining process which turns it into petroleum and then you go burn it and this petroleum can go in like most engines for most transactions so that's the transaction base fee that get that gets burnt and now basically Mev is this Ultra refined type of oil is this high octane rocket fuel jet fuel or Formula One fuel that is used to to to fuel a very sophisticated engine which is this Mev engine which has this very high performance Pistons that are driven by Searchers and and builders um and really what Mev burn is is all about is about recognizing that there's this Ultra you know refined form of oil that you can harness to improve ethereum security ethereum's economic bandwidth that ethereum itself as a system can be aware of and can have an oracle for Mev and not only that but we can remove a lot of negative externalities from from kind of leaving this on on this super refined oil just explode nearly Willy and potentially affect chain stability okay so to to put that I really like that metaphor so like uh the average consumer the average operator of a combustion engine uses the average gas and when I send uh ether from David hoffman.eath to Ryan Sean adams.eath that's actually not Ryan's ether uh ens name um I just use normal oil and and uh that's fine that's great that's what I need to do to get from point A to point B what you're saying is like the contention part of a block which is that first slot in the block is a insanely efficient place in the block because of this um what you're calling an engine because you're with you the reason why you're using that word is because you're looking at the Mev landscape as a system as a whole we have we have transactions and then we have transaction bundle Searchers who search through the transactions to make a bundle and that bundle gets uh uh conversion to a larger group a larger bundle and that ultimately becomes a block and we have Mev Bots we have liquidation Bots we have people people that are micro arbitraging uniswap we have everything all the Mev that's all happening a massive industry and they're all fighting for that one block that one excuse me that one slot that in the block the top transaction uh slot because that is where they fight for that's they fight for all of that economic activity and you're saying that that one slot consumes uh Mev consumes ether to get into that one slot and that's just a highly refined version of ether even though it's the same ether that we all use it's still highly refined because of the net output of that one slot is this massive explosion of economic activity inside of that one block that's that's the metaphor correct right that's correct so if there is oil if there's not only it's money to purchase oil I suppose and then there's and then there's a flip side which is just contention excuse me congestion but I think that's not the subject of this podcast that was the subject of our older podcast that was just about eip1559 right so this podcast about Mev burn is just primarily about the activity in the contention part of the block space correct right that's correct Okay so we've defined congestion we've defined con contention as well congestion is sort of the basal level of block space demand that was EIP 1559 it burnt that now we have contention which is the desire to be the number one transaction and any Mev burning is uh going to solve this I I'm wondering if you could get us to the higher level because in the next part we're going to talk a little bit about smoothing and redistribution so the actual burning of Mev itself but why are we doing this in the first place like what problem is Mev smoothing and burning actually trying to solve Justin you were talking about earlier that the desire of the protocol is a protocol researcher uh Mev is this annoying thing that we have to tame at the protocol level so Mev smoothing in the burn is is one way to sort of tame Mev but describe to us what problems are we actually trying to solve at the highest level here as we get into these next sections right that's exactly right Ryan so when I you know first came into this problem the I was trying to fix some of the negative externalities of what I called Mev spikes what is an MVP Spike it's basically when you get randomly chosen as a proposer and you receive some unknown amount of Mev you know it could be a very small amount of I mean it could be like 0.01 if or it could be a massive block it could be hundreds of if of Mev so you participate in this Lottery and that's why we say it's spiky because there's these big spikes and this the the small spikes now what are some of the negative externalities of Mev spikes well one of the first ones is this chain instability so the metaphor that I have in my mind is you have a piece of bread and you throw it in a park or you throw it in a pond and then you have like ducks fighting for it or birds fighting for it or anything yeah and it's it's complete chaos and it's a lottery because you know if you throw the bread slightly to the right then you know this bird gets it and if it's right to the left the summer bird gets it and it's it's just clearly from Britain I used to do this all the time you didn't do this David I would always Target the you know that one bird or that one duck that that seemed a little weaker than the rest and try to yeah directly in front of that one the benevolent Mev bot yeah yeah that's what I tried to do it sorry I love this metaphor Justin continue please and you know what it means in practice is that there's uh these various participants that try all sorts of attacks they're going to try ddosing each other they're going to try Eclipse attacks they're gonna try chain reorgs and propose their equivocations and they're going to try anything to basically catch the Mev and that's because some birds have teeth and Claws that the other birds just don't got yeah exactly you're incentivizing people to come in with their teeth and their clothes and their guns to try and hit each other but you know if there isn't a reward you know we don't need to be hitting each other we can all live in peace and have a table stable chain and like one maybe you know Vivid example is you know what happened historically with binance binance got hacked for many many you know hundreds of of if uh sorry of Bitcoin it was I forget the exact amount and one of the things that they were considering doing is revealing the private keys for those Bitcoin thereby incentivizing the miners to go back in time to reorg the chain and to basically fight the attacker take a cut for themselves and return the book uh to to binance and the the Bitcoin Community was very scared about this because you know it would lead to you know potentially massive chain in instability now the good thing is that if an equivalent scenario happened you know binance was hacked but this time it was if not BTC and we had Mev burn then the mere fact of releasing these these public Keys would effectively burn uh all the eve and so there wouldn't be anything to fight over so and this goes back to I think when I was just first trying to wrap my head around Mev a very clear articulation of why Mev is fundamentally can be fundamentally bad insta like small my new instances of Mev like you said Justin just is but from a chain stability perspective they can be okay like they can be massively chaotic and I think that the simple example is that ether um just to use nice round numbers ether every single block ethereum every single block issues two ether per block as reward and then there's Mev like gas fees on top of that and because of uh defy and in smart contracts we have these opportunities that oftentimes can be much larger than the value of a single block and so if the rewards for mining a particular block are like 10 eth and ethereum isn't is only issuing two e's per block then that block that has a 10 eth reward isn't actually considered secure until there's 10 more eth issued in Block rewards for the next corresponding blocks to lock that value into the chain and so until if a very large block gets mine and sometimes we've seen blocks in the ethereum world get mine that are like 60 to 100 ether and so you can't really consider these blocks finalized until there's a sufficient level of weight of economic weight in front of those blocks to like embed those the Big Blocks into the chain and this was like the original way to understand the dangers of of Mev and so this is a mechanism just in what you're saying Mev burn and smoothing that directly goes after this phenomenon which takes Mev spikes and Smooths it up and hence Mev smoothing right I mean this is especially true with Bitcoin where they only have proposals not a testers and so if there's a very very large bounty to go back in time then you need to take these bounties into account in addition to the to the issuance in ethereum we have this other mechanism where the attest has come in and they provide economic weight and don't they don't really have a dog in the fight and so they're a little bit more neutral and so if they're you know will converge you know eventually even if there is like this this big MAV Spike but kind of locally it could lead to this these chain instabilities which are Justin back to the bird analogy rather than just throw one big hunk of bird and then watch how the birds kind of fight what you're doing with Mev smoothing is you're just dividing that chunk of bread into all of these bitty pieces and you're somehow letting all of the birds take it at once uh and I guess maybe the bird just been a bird yeah you just and so that that feels very nice that feels very egalitarian it feels like the um you know some of the weaker words actually get a shot at getting fed rather than the big birds with you know the teeth and you know just plowing their way to the front don't get all of the food that would make childhood me very happy if I had that sort of protocol in a bread distribution and just to be really specific this is the weaker birds are the lower capitalized hobbyist solo stickers and then the big birds with guns and teeth and claws are like the data center birds that have fiber optic connections just to make that extremely specific so Dom I think this this conversation now needs to turn to how Mev smoothing and burn actually happened and this is I think where where your role and your research at the ethereum foundation starts to play in here because we're going back to like we actually the protocol ethereum the protocol needs to do this autonomously therefore the ethereum protocol needs to be able to measure the size of the breadcrumbs that are being thrown out to all of the the minor the the validator birds so can you walk us through that process how does the ethereum protocol come to under understand the size of the bread man I love this metaphor all right so today there is no mechanism for that at all all the Mev the pro we need we would need proposer Builder separation enshrined in the protocol because today we have math boost which has this PBS but out of protocol with the relays acting as the Brokers to receive bids between Builders and relay them to proposers and then brokering their relationship and having the having all the trust to them but what we wouldn't want is enshrined PBS for not only removing the stress and having a fully trustless and unconditional payment between Builders and proposers but also having the protocol be aware of the bids so one way to do that well first there's all these designs proposed for insurance PBS which is the first step for Mev burn and there are a few mechanisms to do that one of which is having simply bids be a part of the beacon chain having a structure for what where Builders are supposed to send their bids instead of having relying on external protocol like math boost and once we have that then we can have the attesters impose their view of bids on the proposer so that if they say they're they're all hearing Builders bid one East to ease and then the proposer says okay I'm gonna bid zero and then I'm gonna just steal the MVP then that's not gonna work because other adisters are just not gonna vote for that block so that's like one high level overview of how we can have not only be aware of bits but also impose this view on the proposer so Dom are you saying that um PBS by the way a bankless nation if you're not familiar with that term it's not the broadcasting network uh in the US PBS stands for um proposer Builder separation we've done entire episodes on this and we will include links in the show notes uh to get you caught up this is a future ethereum protocol roadmap item that we've been wanting to achieve and it's not going to happen this year uh it's in the more distant future than this year protocol or proposer Builder separation are you saying Dom that that PBS some version of it is a requirement to get us to Mev Byrne and Mev smoothing that we're going to talk about in the rest of this episode so yeah first things first we need PBS at the protocol layer we need to deploy that then we'll have visibility into the Mev is that what you just said yes got it okay that's understood and I think the really the the the episode that we did with Matt Cutler from block native talked about the ethereum uh blockchain supply chain which is fun to say uh and really the proposer Builder separation proposers are people who are proposing a block that's ether stickers dressing correct me if I'm wrong but proposers and ethers acres are largely synonymous um and then before that are the block Builders so instead of the ethers takers again which we want the supply chain of blocked of the ethereum blockchain to be maximally accessible to the average retail individual so we've separated the role of building a block from the ethers takers and the block Builders just to just compete by submitting bids to ether stakers as to which block to uh to propose and so the proposers select the highest bid block because they want to be paid the most amount of ether and and all of the the very computationally intensive and high like high high resource constraining role of building a block putting all the transactions in the correct order running all the computation to make make sure you're maximizing Mev all of that is done by a very specialized entity that's hard to compete with but they just bid for Block inclusion by Ether stakers and I think Dom what you're saying is that through the process of uh proposer Builder separation and then the also the earlier step of transaction bundling there is a pseudo-oracle process that is able to be contained step by step by step that ultimately becomes converged onto the actual block Builder and block proposer and because of the each transaction inside of a block has a small amount of value associated with it all of that gets aggregated into some sort of Oracle that gets passed along to the block proposer and the ethereum in blockchain actually can ingest that information and use that as an oracle that was my best explanation at this yeah so what happens is that enshrine PBS basically takes the bids and formalizes the notion of a bid in the beacon chain so the beacon chain is aware of these values so there's one value one bit per block it could be 10 if it could be one if could be 0.1 if whatever now the question is how do we know that this value that is on the beacon chain is real that it reflects reality now there's two things that could happen one thing that could happen is that the value is like artificially high like someone says okay I have a bid of a thousand if when there really isn't a thousand Eve and you know this is something that you can do today like I can create a transaction from myself to myself you know as as a proposer and I put a 1 000 if kind of tip and you know it's kind of a Noah because I'm spending 1 000 each but then I re I immediately receive it as the as the proposal and the recipient of the tip and what the burn does is that it makes it real in the sense that you're no longer incentivized to kind of cheat by artificially uh inflating the Oracle but then there's this other thing that you want to prevent is people artificially putting a low value of the of the bid of the burn and the way that you do that is you invoke the attesters so anyone can observe this bit pool in particular their testers can observe the bit pool and if you pick a value of the bid which is too low which is not the highest bid then the test is that just gonna say B you know your block is just not going to make it on chain and so you lose any opportunity to build a block so basically we're enforcing the correctness of this bid value the fact that it reflects reality as the highest paying bit using the testers and now that we know that this is a true Oracle value that reflects reality we can go ahead and burn it I would say there's another parallel with one five five nine the way that the congestion pricing is now enforced by the protocol itself because we had back in the day we had mining tools that would like they would have side contracts or they would since they're in control of the contents of the block they could put in zero GUI as gas fees and just have free transactions but now with 1559 everyone else is just competing for that space including the block Builder himself so they can they can still have side contracts and say you don't have to put a priority fee but they still have to pay the base fee like someone somewhere in the chain has to pay the base fee so this is the idea the same idea with me if you burn is just to impose impose this contention pricing on everyone including black Builders and proposers so that side contracts are not encouraged and the the shelling point is the protocol mechanism right and this was a this was a big part of uh eip1559 as a topic of conversation there was uh just early thought experiments about actually you could strip out ether from being the native currency of ethereum because miners could just use Fiat payments or stable coins as the currency of account and eip1559 just completely eliminated that by actually enshrining ether as the enforced unit of currency to pay for to pay for uh transactions in ethereum Block space and Dom what you're saying is that this just now because of this mechanism that we have this it's pseudo-oracle if you will to understand the measure of Mev we can extend that functionality to enforcing economic activity to also be known and Quantified and ver and verified on chain and so the Ryan and I like to put these systems into nation state government um uh in in gestation State um uh law perspective sometimes and like governments love like want all economic activity to be um in the light right there's all there's like black market activity there's like side dealings there's untaxable uh economic activity and uh or not untaxable but untaxed economic activity Black Market activity um in every single in every single part of the world and same thing with ethereum in this particular world where Mev people can Route Around the protocol and just do some back alley dealing to get blocks included and but now Dom what you're saying is that with this mechanism we have a way to actually ethereum the protocol has a way to actually measure the economic activity that's being expressed and to put that into an article and say you must pay at least this amount to have your block included is that am I on track here yes David you just reframed it and so now I'm looking at Dom and Justin I'm seeing IRS agents right here trying to tax all the transactions here I mean there's an element that's a great metaphor because there's definitely an element that that that's true the protocol wants all of these black market off-chain sort of activities um enshrined inside of the protocol so it can be kind of measured and and so that the carrot and the stick incentive mechanisms that that govern and make ethereum work can actually be activated so so bankless listener I know we've talked about a lot of things but I I just want to um put a few ideas in your mind here right because we're deep in the protocol uh research field of things right you know EIP 1559 okay that is the the protocol the uh change the upgrade to ethereum that started burning ethereum and a solved helped solve the congestion issue the basal level of blocks based demand now we have a more efficient mechanism for partitioning that out we created this Oracle so block space ethereum Becomes self-aware of how much block space is demanded and how much it's consuming this does the same thing with contention and remember contention is that desire to be the number one transaction so we are talking about at the highest level something on the order of importance of eip1559 and if you were here um I think bankless talked about EIP 1559 about like for two years before it happened that's how much some people would say too much that's how excited we were about it because it enshrined if it solved the auction mechanism it made uh more money they were all of these fantastic properties and so I want to get us to that's the context though that's why that's how big this is that's how important uh this is I want to get back to like defining smoothing and a redistribution of this Mev in a bit more detail so so remember our bird analogy okay so uh we're talking about rather than throw large hunks of bread out to all the birds and watching them fight as you know fun as that is if you're a torture you know individual as a child we get to be much more egalitarian and fair and we get to parcel all of that that hunk of bread into all of these pieces and smooth it out across all of the birds okay can you talk to us about the security benefits of this Justin right so it feels nice the birds all get fed and everyone's equal that feels nice but there's actually I know you guys are uh protocol researchers so you care most not necessarily about the birds that's important but you care about that the health of the network you care about the upside benefit the positive expected value so give us the case why does smoothing actually achieve greater uh Economic Security for ethereum Justin right okay let's let's try and keep this analogy we care about the health of the flock um now the first thing that um it does to kind of give everyone an equal amount is that there's no more fighting right everyone gets a fair share no more fighting the other Advantage is that you remove the lottery aspect and so there isn't winners and losers and it turns out that on ethereum today almost every validator is a loser and what do I mean by that I mean that the the median reward that you get is much significantly lower than the average reward and the reason is that every once in a while there's this mega block that comes in so the highest Mev block so far has been around a thousand Eve and so that there's one person a thousand eth yes it was almost a thousand each what did they do to get that they were just lucky they they you know they bought a lottery ticket by you know being a validator and every once in a while we have this massive jackpot and so this one validator he has like a a huge amount of APR whatever it is like a thousand percent or ten thousand percent the entire month every bread here and then um everyone else who didn't get a cut of that 1000 if is is a loser and it's just like when you're playing Lottery right you everyone spends one dollar buying the lottery ticket and almost everyone loses the one dollar but then there's this one guy who just happens to win you know a hundred million dollars and so right now we're all losers and it we're gonna we're risking a situation where with Bitcoin mining so there's this incredible statistic with Bitcoin mining is that if you buy a Bitcoin mining rig and you run it for five years continuously plugged in more likely than not this mining rig will never produce a block so we will never earn Bitcoin and so Bitcoin miners are economically forced to join mining pools otherwise you know they they're just playing a lottery they're just gambling it's Force centralization it's for centralization and the same thing is happening with ethereum to a low extent but it's still happening and so if we can give everyone the same APR the same average APR then we're kind of allowing solo validators to to enjoy this this average API without having to join a pool yeah to really drive this point home I would say that I would say bring back the concept of mvv spikes and you can think of let's say it spikes over the the length of 10th blocks so that first block is one e then it's 5e then 10e then 15E then it goes back down five to ten ten five one the overlapping length of 10 blocks if you're a solo validators with your 32 eat you have like one in five six hundred thousand however many validators there are that's your odds of opposing your block and then times 10 which is still very low but if you're a staking pool that has 30 of the stake then you're gonna get on average three out of those ten blocks so that Mev is gonna more more likely than not going to the pool so if you're a rational actor do you want this variance with this near guarantee of having none of this 10 block Spike or do you want to join this pool and be exposed proportionally to those spikes so this is what we want to remove to get to a world where controlling X percent of the stake it gets you X percent of all Rewards nearly guaranteed Dom that's a great Point Justin have you coined the the phrase to describe this I see this in our notes probably coming in uh rug pool protection so not rug pull but a rug pool what is what is a pool that rugs or a rug pool and how does smoothing protect us against that right so this is a third way in which mev's moving can improve the security of things on ethereum and The Rock pool is a portmanteau of rug pulling a staking pool um and the way that a staking pool can get rug pulled is by operators so imagine a staking pool like like Lido or like rocket pool you have operators you know you know people can can come forward as an operator and when they come forward they have collateral in the case of Lido it's reputational collateral it's also legal collateral legal liability in the case of Rocket pool you don't have this reputation or this legal liability you can combine anonymously but you need to put in financial Capital you need to put in 4E for ate for whatever it is now let's imagine that a Navy Spike comes in an enormous you know a metric ton of bread comes in and this metric ton is worth more than your collateral then what are you going to do you you're going to pick the metric ton and you're going to forego your little collateral which is your little baguette um and so really staking pools are in this dangerous and precarious situation whereby when whenever a massive Spike comes in they could get rug pulled um and so when you do Mev smoothing you are actually making it much much easier to build decentralized staking pools so this is also really important for staking pools as a whole so rocket pool the way rocketpool works now with their their most recent upgrade you can spin up a validator a rocket pool uh validator with only a ether and then you allow 24 ether from other people's ether to come into your to your validator and then that's how our eth is minted the idea is that you can actually take your if you have 32 ether because you're a solo Saker you can actually split that ether up into four rocket pull notes but that actually gives you a four times larger net to cast to capture the potential 1000 ether block that comes in and so this is actually an uh like an exploit attack on something like a collateralized taking as a service provider like rocket pool where somebody can just explicitly come in spin up as many rocket pool mini nose as possible and then cast of why isn't impossible with the intention of rug pooling whenever possible um but now with Mev smoothing this is a protection against that mechanism so this is also an economic upgrade for collateralized staking providers correct exactly right okay so what I'm hearing from both you guys and the benefit of um smoothing the security benefit of Mev smoothing is basically decentralization rather than the birds pooling together in these clusters of birds and becoming like super bird organisms and colluding with each other to get the hunks of bread um being the bigger bird to fight the littler yeah or rather than being the bigger bird with you know the claws and the teeth to fight and trample over the the little birds we want all of the solo staking little birds to get their share we want to keep the ethereum network decentralized we want to be a collusion cabal resistant uh protocol for all the birds out there so decentralization that is the big win here in Mev smoothing in order to get to Mev smoothing of course we have to have um proposer Builder separation so PBS included and then an accent or as an Oracle and we're able to identify the Mev and now we're able to partition it across everybody so I think maybe we've captured that uh you guys feel free to add but but let me tee up kind of the next question so now don't we have to decide don't we get to decide okay who gets the pieces of bread is it a particular set of these birds is it the ducks or do the seagulls get some too or how about the swans they're very pretty which of the birds in our flock and you know you guys are protocol designers so you want to protect the health of the flock not just the individual birds so who gets the pieces of bread that we're partitioning out and I think that gets into this third part which is uh burn redistributing all of the block rewards again it's a highly parallel with one five five nine the way the mental model for blockchains that we had before 1559 was you pay gas fees this is how much I want to pay to get my transaction in the block naturally that goes to the minor that was the status quo and then 1559 kind of changed that into like the miner is getting paid with the block reward the gas fees is a result of the blockchain providing like a value so that value really should go to the blockchain it should not go to the minor because that was we challenged the status quo and then this is what we're gonna do with PBS and Mev burn is today the the natural result whether we use math boost or not the natural result is always going to be that proposers get Mev because at the end of the day they have a monopoly over the content of the blog and whether the extract MPV themselves or have a side contract with the block Builder they're gonna pick the highest bidder always and get this value and we have to challenge this notion that proposers are entitled to this value because really it's still valued as being generated by the ethereum ecosystem the ethereum economy on chain and everything and it goes back to what Ryan was saying earlier that me and Justin are like Arya RRS agent taxing the economy there's like two two points on that is that one is like it is kind of like attacks but we want to do it in a credibly neutral fashion like just like 1559 we could take the base fee and instead of burn it send it to the ethereum foundation and promise to use that for public good but we're we're building a permissionless trustless system so we can't rely on having to trust like the tax authorities the same way the US has to trust the IRS to and do properly to redistribute this Revenue to public goods and everything because we're building a network State on ethereum and this tax the credibly the most credibly neutral way to do it is simply burn it and redistribute it across all etholder and make the ether asset more scarce to secure increased security of the blockchain okay so I want to make sure I'm understanding this and by the way Dom when you said proposers right some people will be thrown off by that um that is the same as validators is that correct yes because the way I see it the validator has to to responsibility today is to attest like voting on what they believe the current head of the chain is and it's it's all set up so that it converges to one blockchain and their second responsibility is once in a while they will be responsible for proposing a block that other validators were going to attest to so in the context of block building and mov we use proposers so so proposers equals validators sort of the same thing those those who State those who run a validator okay so so picture this uh I'm not I'm I'm I refuse to be pulled away from the bird analogy here so we have a flock of birds there is one subset of those birds who are actually in the pond the rest of those birds aren't around aren't in the pond okay the birds inside of the pond those are the birds that are proposers those are the ones that are validating those are the ones that are staking and so you guys as the caretakers of of the flock you want to make sure that the entire flock is healthy and supported and decentralized and so you're saying well there are there are kind of two categories of birds we could give this reward to this uh you know this the hunk of bread one is could we we could just give it to the birds in the pond those that are staking essentially or in other categories we could give it to all of the birds in the entire flock whether in the pond staking or an invalidator or whether they're outside on the edges of the pond you know somewhere in the kind of the you know the woods somewhere else the entire flock and yourself that are still sitting on the eggs yeah they're doing all the work in the background maybe they don't they don't know that they need some bread too like they totally need some bread and so we care about the health of the overall flock here and so what higher decided yes all the birds we love them what was decided by protocol uh Engineers um in EIP 1559 was we're not just going to give it to those who are staking okay that would be the equivalent of a transaction fee if you paid kind of the each reward in a transaction fee we're going to give it to the entire flock and the way you give it to in the entire flock in ethereum the entire network of birds is you burn it why because that decreases the supply for anyone who holds eth so essentially you're giving kind of like a dividend almost like a burned dividend to like all of the birds in in the form of reducing total eat Supply and so you're saying Dom that the choice of Mev burn Nami V smoothing is effectively not to give the Mev just to the birds that are lucky enough to be in the pool and validating and proposing blocks but you're giving it to the entire flock how by burning it is that is that an accurate or have we stretched this analogy far too far Don I think it's fair to say like the economic activity with the value extracted from all the economic activity in a way it belongs to no one and it belongs to everyone and there's a caveat on that it's like good Mev versus toxic Mev like in the case of toxic MAV like getting sandwiched your transaction like this is obviously value that's being extracted to one user so ideally we want to get rid of that and have the user keep that value by getting a good price which is something we could get into later with the Mev rebates but in the case of like Arbitrage between decks and decentralized exchanges this is value that was generated by many many people so we can't really give that value back to these individual people so the next best thing is just to burn it and give it to no one and give it to everyone and to be clear you're just burning all of it you can't because you can't tell the good versus the bads you just burn it all neutrally yes but there are other proposal proposals to get rid of toxic maybe like encrypted mempools but that would still keep the good Mev like being the first in the block to Arbitrage all these decentralized exchanges and that would still be Mev that gets burned and given back to everyone the end game is that um Mev that originates from a given user goes back to the user basically users have sovereignty over the Mev and there isn't the infrastructure right now to do the rebates to do the refunds but this is coming in a matter of months because multiple companies are working on it and then once you've removed this toxic muv and you've kind of rebated it back to the user or the access Mev the latent Mev from Arbitrage this is what we're talking about this is what we're going to burn learning about crypto is hard until now introducing metamask learn an open

way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free so I've got uh Hill Dobby's Dune board up a great Dune board for understanding ether and ether stakers and right now we've got 15.7 of the supply of ether that is staked to the Network and I think that the philosophical reason as to why Mev burn is good is simply answered by the supply of people who are holding ether so if only 15.7 percent of all the ether is staked that means the supply of ether that's unstaked is roughly six and a half times larger than the staked eth so when we instead of giving ether the Mev burn to uh to Ether stakers and instead we burn it we are implicitly giving it to all ether holders that's a supply of ether that is six and a half times larger than the supply of ether that is staked also the people doing The Ether staking are predominantly ether whales more than the rest of the ether so the people that are owning the remaining 85 percent of all ether is everyone else uh what Justin called the users the transactors and so the mere function of Mev burn is doing the thing that ethereum has always been philosophically aligned with which is maximally enabling the widest and wide the widest participant the most marginal person in the whole entire supply chain and that is The Ether holder so you as an ether holder are the person that can benefit from all of this robust supply chain and that is the most accessible part of this of the ethereum technological stack because if even if ether staking which is the complexity of this has been like extremely reduced down to its to its near theoretical minimum buying and holding ether is always going to be easier than that and so Mev burn maximally enables the mirror ether holder the mere pleb of the world who can just hold some ease I mean most the flock isn't in the pond is basically what you're saying and so it's really cool to be able to like secure the ethereum network by what being a validator is a super class of this but just by buying eth effectively you are securing the network aren't you that's a that's a pretty big dream for protocol Engineers I'd imagine because as you were saying David what could be more decentralized than the actual distribution of eth is one of the most decentralized things we actually have uh in this entire ecosystem and Justin I introduced you as a crypto economic meme Lord when the value of the ethereum supply chain blockchain does get ultimately funneled to just the etholder what would you say that this does to the legitimacy of ether the asset right so um it turns out there's multiple economic benefits that come from burning uh burning burning the eve and you know we could maybe start go go through them one one by one um one of them is that it actually makes uh a film run smoother it makes the economic efficiency of ethereum go go up and what do I mean by this is that we have this uh consensus engine which is securing ethereum and basically we we need less fuel for to to to to run it so right now the way that we've designed the consensus engine is that with with issuance alone you can secure a firm so anything on top of that any additional fuel Beyond issuance is is wasteful um and so right now we're kind of overpaying for Economic Security and so we have the opportunity with MV burn to run this economic engine more efficiently another very important thing is economic bandwidth there is a possibility that you know for example we're entering a bull run and there's going to be lots and lots of MVP lots and lots of transaction fees now what will happen in that in that instance what will happen is that the the rewards to becoming a validator will go up and more more validators will come in and that will suck all the if towards staking towards securing the the base chain and there won't be much if that is available as economic bandwidth to be used as collateral by applications now I believe that ethereum needs very very large amounts of pristine raw if as collateral for applications for example for decentralized stable coins we want to have trillions of dollars of decentralized stable coins and we don't want all the if to be sucked out for for staking because that's not the most utilitarian the most useful way of allocating ether another very important thing is around economic sustainability so right now the the sustainability of e for the asset hinders on one single business model which is congestion fees and there is a possibility that this business model will get eroded or jeopardized over time and the reason is that congestion only happens if there's more demand than there is Supply but we live in an exponential world with technology right we live in a world where Supply grows exponentially there's this equivalent of most lawful bandwidth which is called Nielsen's law Nielsen's law says that every year consumer bandwidth Grows by 50 percent and so if we have this exponential growth of demand of sorry of block space Supply that we we might essentially have infinite Supply and the congestion fees will go to zero whereas contention is something that's kind of always there it's latent it's it derives from these Market inefficiencies that can be arbitraged out and so now we have these two business models if one of them fails it's maybe okay because the other business model comes in that's really fascinating that business model idea um Justin because you know one thing we've we've tried to reinforce on Bank lists and people are trying to understand blockchains is what products do blockchains produce we always say this block blockchain cell blocks that's the product that they actually sell blockchains sell blocks yeah and we've compared it to sort of like apple right so the value of an iPhone is worth more than sort of a you know a commodity phone you could see that in the profit margin so I've you know Apple sells really good um uh phones and so they're able to charge a premium that's why there's a premium on ethereum block space what's also interesting is this idea of a second business model here if you notice that a company like apple their first business models they sell the phone they sell the hardware they make a thousand dollars a phone that's fantastic they also have other business models one of which is like app store 30 tax on everything and that's their second model kicking in and you're saying you're implying something similar to ethereum of course a little bit different not the same mechanics but it's a first business model is congest second business model is contention and you're kind of able to to sell both of those uh products to the highest bidder that's a really cool way to look at the uh the economics of this thing that that we're building to understand back to what is the value of what is the fair market value of eth which is what the market is trying to figure out this is primary information that goes into those valuation mechanisms I just wanted to make that point I think you had a you know another comment on this as well about the benefits right I mean we can try and and and quantify you know what are the benefits of adding this second business model running in parallel with the first business model and the the way that we can quantify that is by just asking ourselves you know how much more burn would we have had we had Mev burn and um the answer is on the order of 250 000 uh if per year and that's during the current conditions kind of the the bear market conditions wow but actually the the story gets even better because remember how I was saying that by burning the Mev you actually have a more efficient consensus so that that means that you're issuing less you have to issue less to pay for security because the more validators come in the more issuance there is and that is a roughly 200 000 if improvement over the status quo so we we have two benefits to Mev burn the first one is that you know we'll be burning on the order of 250 000 each per year and on top of that we'll be saving you know 200 if that we wouldn't be uh printing that we wouldn't be issuing so it roughly speaking it's a half a million Eve per year optimization that we have that we have as an option so Mev burn is a half a million per year optimization yes okay so I've got ultrasound.money uh that website is up made by Justin Drake here so the man right in front of me uh the merge happened 230 days ago uh and we have burned 135 000 ether I am famous on Bank list for being terrible at math but I think that means we are roughly two-thirds through the year so if I multiply 135 000 by 1.33 we get to 180 000 ether that is burned under an e ip1559 Paradigm post merge and so you're saying that Mev burn is going to burn an additional quarter million on top of that yes the net Supply will decrease by an another quarter million so it will roughly uh double the speed at which the the the the supply would go down that's only including the burn but then if you include the the savings from issuance is it will actually triple the speed at which the supply has gone down and the reason is that the the issuance you know there's a a saving of roughly 200 000 if per year so if we had had Mev burn right now we not we would have um we would have decreased the supply by roughly 400 000 If instead of only 135 000 if wait can you explain the mechanism of we actually have to issue less ether maybe I missed that part can you can you explain that right so there's two rewards for the validators the first one is issuance and the other one is Mev and so the higher dmev the more of an incentive there is for validators to come in but the more validators there are the more issuance there is because the total amount of issuance grows with the square root of the number of validators so if we remove Mev from the equation we only have the number of validators that is required to secure the chain and no more there's no wastage from a issuance standpoint so so the net effect of Mev burn will actually be a transfer of wealth from ether stakers to Ether holders and so there will be a lesser incentive to stake ether because the yields to e-staker will eat staking will actually go down but everyone knows there's a reciprocal relationship to yields and principal value the idea is that the yields to each staking will go down it will fall probably down to the rate of ether issuance the yield from ether issuance and therefore these uh supply of e-stakers will go down but that's because we're going to burn more ether So in theory the reciprocal relationship of principle to interest interest goes down principle goes up and what is principle other than the value of ether is that that's my understanding is that correct so there's actually some some subtle things going on and one of the the very common question that I get is is Mev burn to the detriment of stakers right because we're removing one of the incentives to become a Staker and so you'd think that maybe be your APR as a stake it will go down now my response to that is that no is actually not only is to to not the detriment but it's to the benefit of stakers but I need to kind of make my case so in an efficient market um the the rewards for staking will tend to the cost of money what do I mean by that when you're staking you have various costs you know you need to run a node you need to pay for the bandwidth you need to pay for the electricity but you also need to pay for What's called the opportunity cost of if right because you're you're taking this eve and you're locking it in a black box and you could be locking it in a different black box for example you could be putting it in D5 yield somewhere and getting some some percentage and so there's this this concept of the opportunity cost of money and by far the biggest cost when you're staking is the opportunity cost of money now let's say that the opportunity cost of money is two percent well what will happen is that organically the staking yields will tend towards two percent in the competitive market and the reason is that the margins go to zero now whether or not there is Mev burn you know the the the rewards will tend towards the cost of money over over time as as an equilibrium so from a if the nominated standpoint you get the exact same percent so if you have a two percent cost of money you should expect that every validator gets two percent of 32e which is 0.64 if regardless of whether there is the burn but now let's think from a USD denominated standpoint right because the burn increases the scarcity of Eve it it it it it fuels this value in the in the price of Eve and so the price of each should go up and so as a Staker you're actually making more returns from a USD denominator standpoint now the other thing worth mentioning is that for the average metadata as I mentioned we're all kind of losers and there's a few jackpot winners and so not not only are we increasing the the returns from a USD perspective but we're also moving the the mean up to to to to to sorry moving the median up to the to the average which increases rewards for everyone and there's this additional thing which I mentioned is that if you're participating in the pool then you won't get rug pulled and so again that will increase uh your your APR okay so like Raleigh intuitively we're taking away yields from ether stakers and we're burning it giving it to Ether holders yet Justin is still saying that the yields are going to stay the same and the way that you are the mechanism that you're saying that this is happening is that the incentive to stake is actually going to decrease and so people will unstake because they're actually getting some value of The Ether burn anyways by not staking by just being an ether holder and so then the issue is the yield that you get from staking will actually increase because this is what happens when people unstake their ether yields go up and so you're saying that fewer people will stake but yields will stay the same and so maybe if we're going from like 30 of ether staked to just 20 of ether staked yields are still going to be the same but it okay so it's a it's a net loss to stakers as like a system but individual stakers are still getting the same yields that they are always that they already were prior is that correct yeah that's correct so as a system there's less if that goes towards rewarding all of these these these stakers but from an individual standpoint it's the same but one thing worth mentioning is that you know usually when you're running a staking business you think in U.S dollar terms so if you're coinbase or if you're lighter or whatever you're going to take a fee which is you've you know kind of USD denominated and it's possible that the increase in Eve price is going to more than compensate than the the loss of ether that you're going to collect and so even for services like like Kraken and coinbase and Lido it is to their benefit likely from a USD denominator standpoint okay Justin so I I want to ask you a question you put out some numbers there I'm trying to assess the magnitude of um the the impact that this could have right and putting on the investor cap because every time we have Justin Drake in the podcast this time uh aided by Dom I learned something new about ethereum and this asset that I hold and I bet a lot of bankless folks listening will be learning something about eth today and we're learning that there is this new business model that is going to start burning eth a new furnace to um like the eth burning scheme that is going to be added with Mev smoothing and Mev Burn Right In addition to EIP um 1559 and since we actually conducted the merge and we migrated to proof of stake and issued that we received the issuance reduction from proof of work to proof of stake and uh the net impact of EIP and the move to proof of stake we have burnt ethereum is ultrasound up to a total of about a hundred and twenty thousand eth right and that happened of course last September 2022. if we had Mev smoothing and Mev burn in place since September 2022 let's say fap mechanism was on as well we had not only the first furnace but the second furnace how much do you estimate how much eth would we have burnt because I I heard you say something in the number of 450 000 per year and so I'm kind of doing the math and and that that seems like it's about like 3x the amount of issuance decrease so this second furnace I'm trying to gauge the order of magnitude is maybe like a 3X increase in Supply or a decrease in in Supply give us that number again so what do you think if we're 120 since um you know a September of this year how much would we have been if we had the second furnace activated do you think right so since the the merge 229 days ago according to Ultrasound that money the supply has reduced by 136 000 Eve now if we had had me V Byrne the supply would have decreased by roughly three times faster so we would be right now at minus 400 000 if and the reason is that this there's two things going on on the one hand we would be activating this this new fairness which would burn on the order of 250 000 if per year but this is very volatile because it depends on the conditions of the market this would be assuming kind of the last few months of conditions which has been a bear market so it's kind of a conservative assessment but then there's this other thing that kicks in which is that we would be potentially reducing the total amount of Eve staked and thereby reducing the total amount of issuance and thereby making it also easier for the supply to go down simply because we're not printing as much we're not issuing as much and so that would kind of add on top of the burn and net net you know roughly speaking we're talking about a 3X speed up in this in in the speed at which the eve Supply goes down so let me translate that into um some annualized percentage numbers so since the merge uh Justin we have um been about kind of an annualized Supply reduction of 0.179 percent how with Mev burn would that would be like 3x that number something along those lines right so roughly um minus 0.5 percent annualized okay so this is another burn mechanism which is going to make eth more deflationary so I I look at that with kind of my investor hat um one question I have for you though is um is it bad for eth to get too deflationary like are you guys a little bit worried as a kind of IRS agents and kind of the you know the the protocol researchers here that what if we make eth2 ultrasound what if it becomes too uh deflationary is that a concern at all right so I guess there's two answers here like one is that the the deflation eventually ends so what happens is that there is this equilibrium where eventually you know the supply is is constant so for Bitcoin right there's this equilibrium on the upside the Bitcoin Supply will grow roughly for the next Century but the BTC Supply will inflate and then eventually it will reach 21 million for if it will be the opposite for the next Century it will go down and then eventually it will it will reach an equilibrium what this final equilibrium is depends on economic activity and also as to whether or not we enable um the um the Mev burn but you know it's it's going to be something between 50 million and 100 million if so the the total supply of ether roughly speaking ballpark figures should decrease by a factor of two over the The Next Century and then eventually we we reach this equilibrium but the other thing worth mentioning I guess is you know what does it mean to be money and what are the various uses of money and the way that I think about it is that there's there's basically two types of money and maybe we should be using different words because it's confusing to be using the same words so on the one hand we have currency currency is this money that flows in the system it comes from the word current and it's used as a museum of exchange and you know you would you want your currency to be non-volatile to be stable and to be very easy to to to to move around and um the way that I think we will build currency on ethereum is through decentralized stable coins so you're going to put e fast collateral and you're going to stabilize if kind of create the synthetic asset this this debt and so on the one hand you know we have this currency which is a debt asset and it's kind of good if this debt asset is um is it goes down in value over time because if you're if you if you have a a loan for example on your house like the if if the the value of the asset keeps on going up and up and up it makes it more and more difficult to repay your loan and you might default on your on your house so you kind of want these these debt assets these these currencies to kind of go down in value and that lubricates the economy on the other hand you have a different type of money you have collateral assets things like gold for example or things like property these are used as collateral against which you can take a loan or gains which you can draw currency and here is the opposite mechanism you want the value of your collateral assets to go up over time and the reason is that this reduces the risk of default right so if you go on maker you deposit if you draw some die and the value of your if goes down then you're at risk of being liquidated but if the value of your if kind of as a trend goes up and up over time then that makes it the perfect collateral asset and my thesis is that ether is the collateral asset the collateral money for the inset of value and it has two main use cases on the one hand it's a collateral asset for staking and it secures ethereum as a settlement layer as a platform but the other very important use case is that it's economic bandwidth it's collateral it's money that is used by application that is consumed to create things like decentralized stable coins that will be the currency for this this internet of value that we're creating I would like to add a little illustration to that like with the idea that your property is collateral value like let's say you take a loan against your property against your house and if you want the loan to be inflationary and easier to repay over time because that allows you to for example improve your property and increase the increase the value of your property to unlock more bandwidth to let you take a bigger loan and keep improving it it's like a feedback loop and it's very simplified but it's the same thing should happen with D5 and ethereum as collateral so let's say you take stable coin a stable coin loan with your ether as collateral and then your stable coin loan lets you go in D5 and do Arbitrage or do all sorts of things and that gives you value and also that's increased economic activity on ethereum on the the broad ethereum economy and which generates mbv because whatever you do it all the more economic activity more Mev there is which burns more eth due to MAV burn which increased the value of her collateral so there's the same feedback loop happening where it's very lucrative to just hold ease as collateral and the the lesser the incentive to stake we don't we don't have to go through a liquid sticking that has additional risk both for yourself and the broader system if everything relies on one liquid sticking operation so I guess in the answer to the question of like can eth B2 deflationary your answer to that Dom and Justin is uh no it really can I mean the more deflationary it is it makes it a worse currency but a better store value a better money if you will a better better uh richer source of economic bandwidth it actually expands the economic bandwidth so I think maybe the um that question is almost wrong it comes at the question from the wrong perspective of what eth is trying to do it's not trying to be a currency a general currency it's trying to be a store of value monetary instrument for uh the entire a crypto ecosystem and the entire Internet it's an important distinction I think it's also important to zoom out and view the ethereum economy from a systems perspective um Justin here likes to say that perhaps the killer app of ethereum blocks base is stable coins and so we are seeing a very intrinsic relationship between ethereum and stable coins and Fiat inflationary units of account so this is the idea that we have this uh this yin and yang this deflation and inflation and the deflationary asset will naturally be chosen by economic agents to be the collateral to be borrowed against by inflationary assets and uh the the idea the whole idea that address in incepted in my brain way back when I think and yeah in the ultrasound money episode itself the idea of sci-fi economics where we have these Financial positions in aggregate degens will get liquidated they'll put ether into Ave they'll pull too many stable coins out they'll get liquidated but in aggregate ether will be the collateral these stable coins will be the borrowing unit of account and the economic zone of ethereum will have Tailwinds that no other economic zone in the in the world will have because of the deflation of ether in contrast juxtaposed by the inflation of everyone's unit of account and so just the the economic investability the downstream wealth effects that that creates around defy and the the rest of the ethereum economy are going to produce some sort of motor on the ethereum economy that no other economy has and so that's just the the very bullish Vision I have here for the ethereum economy just in any Reflections on that yeah I agree and um there are some very strong Network effects around this idea of monetary premium so how how do we achieve monetary premium we achieve it by creating shelling points we could achieve it by somehow convincing society that one specific asset is special right Society has successfully deemed a gold to be a special asset and that has given it monetary premium on top of its raw utilitarian value now why do I talk about monetary premium I talk about it because it is absolutely necessary to get to this point where we have trillions of dollars of decentralized stable coins right now we have centralized stable coins and they're on the order of a hundred billion dollars and my thesis is that centralized stable coins are not going to scale very well to trillions of dollars and the reason is that if you have a a centralized stable coin you're going to need to spread out those trillions of dollars over multiple banking partners and you just need One banking partner to fall through and then that leads to a haircut and that leads to loss of confidence in your system so yes Teva was able to scale to roughly a hundred billion dollars will it scale to a trillion dollars I don't know on the other hand decentralized stable coins are meant to be Rock Solid and if we can find a way to scale them to trillions of dollars that will really help ethereum reach its ultimate Vision but how do we get trillions of dollars of decentralized stable coins well we're going to need trillions of dollars of pristine collateral and the only way that we get there is if we somehow create the shutting point that ether is money for the internet and there's various things that are you know important shutting points in the context of money one which is absolutely critical is economic security like how many billions of dollars are currently securing your blockchain what is the cost of attack to do a censorship attack or to revert a finalized checkpoints Etc and already today ethereum is the most secure blockchain by that metric by a factor of four um and um the other very important thing is this idea again of economic bandwidth and as Dom said we have this positive feedback loop going on because the more economic background we have the more decentralized stable coins we have the more economic activity we have the stronger the shutting points become of scarcity and security and so yeah there is this very strong bold case that there is going to be in my opinion one asset that's going to win the the beauty contest basically of being the most attractive asset and right now E30 asset is the number one you know Contender to winning this beauty contest bitcoiners look out watch out for that one I think we've uh I think we've long moved past Bitcoin but I guess we still have to move past in market cap um Dom I want to throw this quick question to you just to make sure we check this box uh 4844 how does Mev burn and 4844 interact how do these things relate to each other it gets a bit tricky at this point but the way 4844 is going to work is by splitting the two markets markets for execution and the market for data and execution is going to be the same so there's still going to be mvv happening at layer one as these whales and large institutions have to settle value in exchange on dexes on layer one because currently it's still the most secure layer and in my opinion it's going to stay the most secure layer even if there's layer two are going to become more decentralized and more secure over time you're still going to want this fallback to layer 1 execution which if for many reasons it's going to keep being congested and unscalable so there's still going to be a lot of activity and conjunction fees on layer one while a lot of stuff happens at Layer Two which uses data which with the 4844 and dank sharding is going to be much much cheaper so this is the the idea that data is very easy to scale at layer one and it's gonna bring down the the congestion pricing relating to data but the way with the way it works with Mev and Layer Two is like depends on how the layer 2 is set up because one of them like optimism can capture congestion and Mev by having like one sequencer or many sequencers each taking turns at that batching data to layer one and they can capture that Mev at Layer Two but the the way it can it can work plausibly is by having what Justin coined as based Roll-Ups where the sequencing is completely permissionless at layer one where so there's still going to be some competition between many layer one Builders to create the best layer with two block to post on layer one so that's gonna not only bring more liveness to the layer 2 roll-up but it's also going to bring back the mvv2 layer one all the economic activity happening at Layer Two is going to generate layer 1 Mev which with Mev burn is going to end up being burned Justin at the very beginning of this podcast you you were using the metaphor of um just regular old gasoline that powers cars but then you have highly refined jet fuel that powers Jets I want to throw um throw a version of this metaphor into the hat and see if you like it uh so we have the ethereum economic engine 99 of the the thrust gets powered by the combustion engine and regular old gasoline but that one percent of the contention uh slot the the contention side of this uh of this engine is actually a supercharger and the way that a supercharger works is that it's a fan that's connected to the combustion engine so the combustion engines crankshaft is connected to a fan belt which spins a compression fan that compresses oxygen and then throws that into the combustion engine and that allows for a more efficient burning of gas and so you got the the normal the normal Honda Civic that's got the combustion engine but then you've got the supercharger on top of it which just makes sure that the uh the the gasoline is Juiced up to the max I'm throwing that metaphor your way so even if you like it yeah I I I love it so basically you you're taking this really high octane high density Fuel and you're combining it with this you know oxygen which is compressed and then you're pushing the two together and you're you're running this extremely sophisticated engine which is performance critical Mission critical ultra low latency you know Mev game is is a is kind of a game where every millisecond counts and you have the you know P armies of phds and and you know very sophisticated players uh coming in now one of the things to continue on this this metaphor that you bring up is the exhaust um so in in ethereum we have um basically cell pressure um which is taxes so in Bitcoin land the cell pressure comes from having to buy electricity and buy mining rig but in context of of staking it's taxes and you can kind of think of that as as kind of pollution or like a negative externality that you want to try and minimize and it turns out that Meg burn in addition to being this roughly half a million each per year optimization is also a tax optimization which dramatically reduces the cell pressure of we're talking about efficient state taxes here we're talking about normal taxes now yeah exactly yes and maybe the best analogy is with uh stocks so there's this one weird trick with stocks which is that if a company has a billion dollars let's say you're Apple you have two options to redistribute this value to the shareholders option one you can issue dividends to give a billion dollars of dividends across all the shareholders but what happens is that these Dividends are treated as income tax now in many jurisdictions income tax is let's say 50 just as a ballpark figure and so you have cell pressure of half a billion dollars but there's this other thing that you can do which is you can do a share buyback if you do a share buyback this one billion dollars basically translates in the total supply of the shares going down and the price of each share going up by by a commensurate amount and now your text and capital gains tax and in many jurisdictions capital gains tax is significantly lower than than income tax so for example in the UK capital gains tax is roughly 20 and income tax is roughly 50 percent and so we have this roughly speaking 2.5 X Tax optimization which will decrease the cell pressure um the first cell pressure that the stakers have when they're participating uh in in the system so if we have you know 250 um thousand if per year of Mev today well roughly half of that is going to be cell pressure so 125 000 if is going to be sold but but if we instead kind of funnel everything in capital gains tax then there's only going to be 20 so there's only going to be um you know 50 000 if of forced cell pressure another hidden benefit another byproduct of this um Justin Don this has been uh super helpful for the bankless community just a few lightning round questions uh for us okay so we're talking about Futures here and as we know it took a very long time before we started talking about uh eip1559 before to actually shipped into production when is this coming roundabout I know there's not a fork where it's like it's then the next hard Fork but just rough range are we talking like is this like two years out is it three years out uh sooner than that what do you think Justin and Dom I would say it's under three to four kind of maybe five-year time frame and one of the The Meta points that I want to bring up here is you know why does it take so long for us to to do these things and you know is and I I guess one one of the answer here is around the the policy that we have as a community this implicit policy right so bitcoiners as a policy have this idea of Maximum osification and I think for ethereum we have this idea of continuous innovation and Improvement and that kind of um expressed in this minimum viable issuance policy which could be restated as maximum viable scarcity so when ethereum launched you know the the best that we knew how to do in terms of securing the chain was to issue five if per block and then we realized that five beef block is way too much we can reduce it to two if a block or three if the block and then we realize we could reduce even further to two for block and then we realized we could do this really fancy optimization called proof of stake and now it's only a quarter of an eighth per block and then we realize that there's this other thing that we can do which is erp1559 which it burns you know which so far has burned 3.1 million if since eap1559 was launched which is a massive optimization and now we're talking about yet another thing that we've unlocked if you had asked me a year ago you know is there any further improvements to reframe I said I'm I'm not sure but actually you know we kind of discovered this new thing just through research and Innovation and it makes sense to integrate it in our roadmap because it's part of this maximum viable scarcity uh policy that that the community has adopted and if you were to ask me okay is there something else maybe in the pipeline um I would say yes there is something else maybe even Beyond uh Mev brand and it's this idea of capping the active validator set so right now in theory what could happen is that almost all Eve could come and become stakers and that would lead to on the order of 2 million Eve per year of of issuance but if we cap the total amount of active validators for example to 33 million if then we would also de facto be capping the total amount of issuance to roughly 1 million each per year so that is kind of a further potential Improvement going down this this road of minimum uh uh variable issuance and maximum viable scarcity yeah that that's right I mean that that has been the social contract of ethereum all along is what is the monetary policy it's minimum viable issuance like uh and so all of these improvements contribute towards that well thanks for thanks for giving that kind of like timeline estimate so we're talking about this is a more distant Improvement You Know PBS some other protocol changes have to happen this might come into play three to five years down the road I remember when I started learning about EIP 1559 and that was in I believe 2019 took about two and a half years for that idea to actually get executed and deployed this might take that end a little bit longer to get out there but is is super exciting nonetheless I learned a lot what do birds and oil and digital money all have in common I hope you learned that in the episode as well Dom and Justin thank you so much it's been great to have you thank you guys thank you guys thankless nation of course we just had two big brain protocol researchers uh on the episode today so you might have some questions about some of the terms that we bandied about uh Mev what is that exactly fortunately bankless has done an In-Depth series on Mev we will include a link to the episode you need to go look at in the show notes Here Also if uh you were thrown off by the question from David uh to Dom about eip4844 and you're like what does that mean we have episodes about that too so catch that in the show notes uh of course gotta also refer you to the classic ultrasound money Chronicles this is a series of episodes uh Justin came on for and I think this was um you know 2021 or so uh and we will include a link to that when we were first talking about this concept of etha's ultrasound money this episode it feels like was just an extension of that episode that we recorded uh two years ago my how time flies also need to remind you none of this of course has been Financial advice we have no idea what the future price of eth is all crypto is risky but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bank list Journey thanks a lot foreign [Music]
