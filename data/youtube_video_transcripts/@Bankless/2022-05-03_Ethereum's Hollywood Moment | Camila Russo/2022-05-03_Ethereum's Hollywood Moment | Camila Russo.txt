congratulations you are hearing the genesis of ethereum's hollywood moment we still have a couple more years before it hits mainstream but you know as soon as it does as soon as that movie comes out i don't think we can say we're early anymore bankless nation welcome to another episode of state of the nation guys we got to tell you some really cool news ethereum is going to hollywood we're getting a hollywood treatment david and we've got cami russo who is producing a movie with the team that produced ridley scott movies aliens gladiator stuff like this blade runner and they're now producing a movie about ethereum david uh what did we talk about today oh god we talked about all of the details around how this movie is getting made who's funding it because the answer could be you tease her on that later in the show and also just where it's going to place ethereum in global consciousness this is not a documentary uh there are plenty of documentaries about crypto of varying quality on things like netflix and other sources this is not that this is something that is a drama there are actual characters that are going to be cast actual actors uh this is going to be i'm pretty sure many people are familiar with the social network for facebook this is going to be like that there's a lot of drama about ethereum at the beginning of its whole genesis of the whole entire thing tons of drama and so this movie is going to be covering that with that dramatized angle and you know a lot of people need an angle like this to really understand crypto they're not going to go down the rabbit holes they're going to wait for some movie to come onto netflix to explain it to them in the best way that they can which is with stories and so we talk about all of these things we talk about the nfts that go with this movie and how you too can be a director of this movie as well if you are so inclined uh cammie russo again chief s at the defiant has done just a bang-up job uh getting the story of ethereum first through her book and now through a movie out into mainstream consciousness so we have brought her on to talk all about the ethereum's hollywood moment this is crazy this is great i remember watching the the social network in theaters and hearing about like kind of the facebook story and seeing all of that go go mainstream and i think ethereum could be slated for an event like that right like people are actually in the months to come actually going to have to be making casting decisions on who plays charles hodkinson okay who's gonna play vitalik in this movie right the scriptwriters are going to have to decide what are the main themes of the ethereum story and who do we cast as the heroes and the villains and where's the conflict and god i can't wait it's so amazing i don't think they're gonna have any problem finding drama ryan there's gonna be a lot of drama absolutely absolutely so it's gonna be great guys anyway uh really big before we get in though want to talk about opolis a little bit so this is for the self-sovereign worker particularly if you're in the u.s look the new freelancer that works for web3 is probably working for a dow maybe many different dows working for ownership tokens potentially rather than just pay and working for themselves but where do they get their health care benefits that is the question and david opolis i think has the answer tell us a bit about opolis what do they do yeah yeah if you are scared about leaving your your comfy salary job in the world of trad fire web 2 but you are compelled by the web3 vision but you have i don't know maybe you have the family that you need to insure or just you like your stable income opolis which is a doubt is helping people bridge the gap between working in the tradfi world the normie world and working in your brand new spiffy job in web3 they are making this transition easier for you they give you your health care benefits because it is a collective they also manage your your payroll and if you want to you can get paid in crypto very regularly and if you are ready to take the opolis challenge they will give you 1 000 work tokens the tokens for opolis and a thousand bank tokens as well if you sign up with opolis by may 25th 2022 there is a link in the show notes to get started bankless dot cc slash opolis o p o l i s capital o at the start uh and that will get you going in the world of web3 highly recommended guys go go check it out if you need these services uh david got to ask you the question i ask you before every state of the nation and what is the state of the nation today ryan the state of the nation is we are producing we're going to make a movie and it's actually a we uh if you feel like you have something to contribute to the movie you have a path forward to do that there is a part of the show we talk about all these details tokens that you can mint nfts they're available on openc but they also give you utility access like basically a backstage pass or perhaps uh you get to watch the movie be filmed you get to go to the premiere if you get these particular nfts uh and so we're all gonna make a movie together ryan uh if you are an nft owner so there is uh a waves waves of minting the first two has already happened the third is coming uh again all these details are about to be in the show but we're gonna we're gonna make a movie together ryan and i will have to say as soon as this movie hits mainstream as soon as this movie hits like you know premieres in 2024-ish whenever it does come out i don't think we get to say that we're early anymore i think that's the last moment where like you can't really say that we're early uh so guys like congratulations you are hearing the genesis of ethereum's hollywood moment we still have a couple more years before it hits mainstream but you know as soon as it does as soon as that movie comes out i don't think we can say we're early anymore absolutely especially if this is a smash hit if it has a mainstream moment the way the social network does and if the team behind ridley scott is putting together someone from the ethereum community knows the story like cami rousseau is putting it together and we're like the community's funding it i think we got a real good shot so it is still early right now but it won't be when this movie comes out i i think there might be some alpha opportunity on some of these nfts uh have no idea what you know price performance but like what's the value of a backstage pass to uh an incredible like hollywood produced uh mainstream movie i don't know but i guess we'll find out in the months to come so stay tuned for more details on that yeah one last tip of the hats of cami before we get into the show she has done a great job making sure this movie gets produced in a way that aligns with ethereum ethos aligns with the ethos of the industry so thank you kami for for helping do that and leading the charge for ethereum into the mainstream and so let's go ahead and get right into it that our conversation with cammy russo of the defiant of the infinite machine book and now the infinite machine the movie right after we get to

happy to introduce cami russo you all know her as the chief s of the defiant the author of the infinite machine book but now also the executive director to infinite machine the movie cami welcome to bankless thank you so much for having me guys very excited cammie this is really really exciting is ethereum about to get it's like social network moment everyone knows the social network movie that really put a bunch of drama behind the story of facebook uh is that what's about to happen to ethereum i i really hope so like the the way that me and the other producers have been thinking about the movie of the infinite machine from the start is that we're trying to um make it to be the social network of crypto so the first kind of mainstream hollywood film about crypto and i mean that would be kind of my ultimate goal and dream uh fingers crossed that it happens but at least we're assembling kind of uh a great team to to make that a reality so this uh is a lot of firsts as far as i know we've had there are movies out there on netflix that are like documentaries of the crypto industry uh there's like the bitcoin uh the gold the gold i can't remember the name but there's one about bitcoin charlie tram and eric voorhees were in it but we haven't had a drama yet and we haven't had anything about ethereum uh and so with the the infinite machine movie we're getting both a drama with like you know actual actors rather than just a documentary uh and then also it's about ethereum uh and so ethereum's getting its first like hollywood moment uh and it's all going to be based on your book is that correct yeah that's right so um so the infinite machine was the first book about ethereum and when i wrote it my main goal with it was to make it very approachable to a mainstream audience so i made sure to break every kind of complicated concept down so that you know anyone could pick it up and and just read an entertaining story that was about people and uh and that was relatable you know it's a group of people with a big vision um big ideals kind of following this dream facing challenges overcoming these challenges so beyond kind of the tech and blockchain and all that it's a story about the humans behind the tech um so i i hope that kind of can translate into a great um a great film and that's the idea also of dramatizing it you know making it more approachable to the mainstream um that you know that's something that maybe documentaries have a harder time doing because they're more you know they're they're appealing more to the kind of rational side of uh of things of of like of a watching experience uh but a dramatized film has a greater chance of just like appealing to the emotional side of things um and i think you know for many of us that's what's exciting about about crypto you know it's not so much kind of the rationality of it and like how exactly blockchains work but it's more kind of the um the ideals of it like decentralization openness permissionlessness um and yeah hopefully this movie can really capture that it's it's it's the ideals of it and this comes at a perfect time i think like crypto in general comes at a a perfect time right to start addressing these these ideal ideals into wider society uh and you mentioned like the the drama of the thing because there are these real people with with these really interesting stories there's a lot of characters in the infinite machine and in the uh the ethereum story uh and cami i have your your fantastic book on my bookshelf right behind me like it's great it's a fantastic book and i'm curious what that looks like to actually convert this and turn it into a script because we've we've just been talking about drama like do you have to inject a little bit of additional drama into the script in order to uh turn it into something that's that's ready for the for for the big screen what does that look like how much does it deviate from the actual book and what does the script writing process look like that's that's a great question and it's something that i'm kind of dying to find out the answer to myself like this is a first for me like i've never this is the first book i've written i've never produced a movie before um i haven't been involved in like writing a like a movie script um so so we'll see like we're uh we're going to be working with the team at scot-free and in writing the script um they have a a writer picked out who will uh work on this and um yeah i'm excited to work with him and um and see kind of what his thoughts are because uh honestly like i i imagine the book will have to be distilled you know to just like the the core kind of couple of storylines um i know that from kind of initial conversations with the other producers uh the most important thing is to have like a hero and a villain obviously the hero will be vitalik uh so the villain probably um charles hoskinson and maybe there's two villains maybe it's like gavin and charles i'd imagine uh so wow i think to answer your question around no there will not need to be any new drama injected there's enough drama in the story i just i guess i'm wondering if you're gonna double down on those things and like a hero and villain for any story like the social network had that right so um famously you've got mark zuckerberg cast as the hero in that movie and ironically the winklevoss twins are like part of the the villain cadre and now the winklevoss twins are like hugely supportive of crypto and they'll tell you that like um that the social network wasn't entirely true and all sorts of things but like that's what made that movie so good and i i guess we get to do a similar thing for the treatment of ethereum story yeah it's it's so funny you're totally right how it's it's um it's funny how roles changed for uh for mark zuckerberg and the winklevi uh with bitcoin billionaires like that was completely reversed like they were the heroes and yeah and mark zuckerberg was kind of the villain there so but yeah i think we'll we'll see that treatment of course like you know i came um you know my my approach to this book it was very much from a journalistic standpoint just like making sure everything was 100 accurate uh very well researched um i i just made sure that you know everything was kind of airtight and i'll make sure that that the movie follows those same guidelines because you know i i would hate for this to fall into kind of lean too heavily on like dramatizing and uh and playing on those tensions that it starts to kind of uh you know the thing is like i i'll make sure that it's it's still accurate even if we we need to kind of lean on those like like more like tension and drama at banquets we love to use the metaphor going into the frontier and that's not just with crypto economics that's not just with code but now with you with youcam you're journeying into the frontier of making movies and so while no one i think in the crypto industry has really made a movie before crypto does have the ability to kind of redo everything without having to take prior knowledge about how this should be done so cami i'm really excited to see uh what movie producer cami can get done with with the movie industry and especially for ethereum and just to kind of tie off the context setting for for the movie when will it start like will it start in like 2014 like do you know how the movie starts and like what time frames it will cover no again like the script like is just is starting to take shape um so you know the the book starts like way like i don't know i don't it gets back to like vitalik's childhood so but like the action itself starts like around 2012 when metallic like is first kind of learning about bitcoin um i'd love for the movie to get into that context as well so i think it's just necessary to understand where kind of the idea of ethereum uh came from you know the fact that vitalik was like very much into the vidcon community and like bitcoin 2.0 so hopefully kind of that that'll get portrayed there as well kind of vitalik going on on this kind of world tour of bitcoin projects um so if if that kind of gets folded in then yeah it should be around kind of 2013 era um but you know my book does cover a lot of ground like it does start in kind of 2012 and it it really goes to like 2018 i think maybe i i even got a bit of 2019 no i don't think so no 2018 in there but like definitely was able to get like d5 into the final chapters like nfts so i don't know like i i really hope to like jam all that stuff in there some somehow i don't know how how that'll work but i don't know we'll see well i think if you uh left a room for a sequel i think the ethereum community would would love ah we'd love this movie and then we also want the next one too right yeah ethereum two the merge uh so part of the the how big this uh story is is uh related to the production company scot free productions can you talk about uh why that production company is such a big deal and what other movies they made and how that relationship between you and scott free productions uh was established yeah so i'm i'm like still a little bit kind of pinching myself uh that this is happening um so a little bit of kind of the backstory is that um so my my book was published in in 2020 um and then uh soon after that i was approached by a couple of um production studios to buy the rights of my book to make a movie and one of them was versus entertainment which is a production company based in spain and i decided to go with them because they were the the most kind of committed to actually making the movie happen like my my agent at the time told me a lot of production companies kind of buy the option just to like have the option but actually you know never end up making these these uh movies um but versus was like really kind of committed and they'd read the book like i don't know a bunch of times and they they were like actually like uh one of the producers um has a crypto hedge fund so they're like really into it um and he said okay they they're gonna be with them will have the best chance of actually seeing this movie and um and alejandro miranda of the head of versus entertainment he had this relationship uh with with scot-free and so you know like i said like our goal from the start was to make this into a big hollywood mainstream film um and to do that we knew we needed a um a hollywood production company uh to co-produce a movie with us so yeah that's why he's you know in the last few months he was like out in l.a just like taking meetings pitching the movie um and and yeah and scott free kind of loved it um i you know we were lucky that one of the producers there had read my book loved it and she was like she was like the one who um was like pushing for for their project to get done and and yeah we we signed the agreement a couple of weeks ago and so the big deal uh behind this is that um scot-free is the production company of ridley scott and uh sir ridley scott uh he has this kind of grand title um has produced like one like some of the most successful movies out there like he um produced a gladiator uh he would produce blade runner uh alien um like recently um house of gooty just like you can go down the list and it's like blockbuster after blockbuster um it's it's insane and it's just like the type of movie you know like blade runner you know kind of like sci-fi alien you know um i just think it's such a good fit uh for the infinite machine so extremely excited about that so so kami let's talk about uh the timeline for this so um like how does how long does it take to make a movie extremely long unfortunately we'll have to be very patient um but yeah it takes about two years so we'll probably see this i know right uh yeah uh 2024 um so yeah we'll have to be very patient i think time though flies in crypto like so much is happening that you know it'll be around in no time we'll be like oh my god yeah it's already you know streaming um are you guys gonna like time this for like the next bull run the next major like is that even it's probably gonna be a factor somewhere yeah i think so well i mean i i think like it'll just you know happen to to work out maybe like if this was anything like the the last kind of bear on bull market maybe it it it like all works out um but no i like i i can't imagine uh just like how things i've seen how things kind of work in hollywood uh land and everything is super kind of bureaucratic and slow and yeah it's like another kind of timeline than crypto so yeah i i can't imagine timing and anything because like they all work and move at their own pace so i i get that there's a lot left to be done with the actual production of this movie but would you know like when this movie is released how we would watch it is this going to be something that we all like go grab our popcorn and go to the movie theater to actually watch this or is this coming out on like hbo or netflix any details around that so like distribution deals are still kind of being worked out um but i think the the goal is to have this be out on like actual kind of live um like movie theaters and also have like a streaming a partner with this so still tvd on on what that is um this is like not not my kind of area but i understand that scott free has like its previous kind of agreement with specific uh streaming companies so yeah i mean hopefully it'll be both like you'll be able to stream it somewhere and go watch it in the movie theater so part of the very unique aspect of this particular movie of this particular story of course when crypto gets into anything it starts to change things up and the way that this movie is getting funded is a little bit different than uh movies previously so we want to talk about that in a second and also we put together just a fun little tweet thread about uh casting if we had the ability to cast the movie uh we bank was put a little bit of tweet threads together about comparison some uh celebrity doppelgangers with some core ethereum characters so we want to show that a little bit and all that is coming up in the second half of the show right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible grow and

infinite machine it's uh coming to a theater near you it'll take a couple years uh and uh but when it comes it's gonna mean big things i think this is gonna be a major narrative maybe this is ethereum breaking into the mainstream in a way it hasn't previously and cami wanted to help you out a little bit because i know you're going to have a lot of decisions to make with respect to the heroes the villains who plays what role i don't know if you've considered some of the cast of characters and who could play what but we have put together a little thread uh on bankless with some propositions of our own and i think the community's having a lot of fun with this uh this is the first one so i okay so first of all hudson jameson he's an ethereum former ethereum core developer i don't actually know if he's in the infinite machine but maybe he makes a cameo in the movie we don't know why not and our pick for hudson jameson was haley joel osment i can't believe that's the kid from sixth sense by the way he's grown right up grown up already that's insane yeah uh we have some others too this for a um as a young steve buscemi i don't know if we're going to scammy yeah sorry yeah i don't know if we're going to be right be able to turn him back in time but what other ones we have david uh yeah paul giamatti yeah gosh i'm i'm gonna show my characters it's not being from hollywood but uh again viewers or viewers on youtube will recognize him as one of the co-founders taylor gehring uh we got nicholas braun who i don't know who that actor is as tim bako but that's just this is great yeah just right on yeah and then martin starr as vlad zamfir vlad was really hard to find someone for this but but the martin star works out very very well uh and then uh of course we if we can go all the way down to vitalik uh perfectly cast as jason moma uh i think i think it's quite appropriate the metallic one's gonna be the hardest to find cammy i know i don't i don't envy the uh the group that's making those decisions people keep saying the the wrong i agree i think that'd be hilarious the rock for vitalik yeah um somebody i mean tom brady is another good good one for vitalik they're already kind of like twitter buddies so [Laughter] okay cammy let's get into how this movie is getting funded uh because there's a cool story about the the bottom-up funding of this whole uh program which is actually a way or if somebody i don't know is in the web 3 world and they really love ethereum and they perhaps also just have experience in this world they can get involved uh with this these whole nfcs can you explain this the nft aspect of this movie and how it's helped uh fund the the production of this movie yeah okay so the the nfd aspect is is pretty key uh in in the whole kind of production so um okay so one of the reasons i i went with versus is because they offered me an executive production role um and so that meant that i you know was able to have a say in how the movie is made and fund it and so when we were having initial discussions on you know like okay how do we fundraise for this um i thought you know like this is a movie this is the first movie about ethereum it should be funded with the ethereum community using ethereum technology um like we like what what kind of film would it be if it if it's just about ethereum but like funded in completely kind of traditional way um so that's why we started thinking about okay like what would an nft project um about the infinite machine look like and um and yeah so we decided to create an nft collection for the infinite machine and use that as a vehicle to fundraise as much of the budget of the film as we could and so so far we've sold 40 percent of the collection collection is 10 499 nfts uh commemorating the block number for eap1559 um and and so we have a 60 of the collection still left to sell in a third minute and the date is uh tbd uh but uh soon hopefully um and and yeah so far we've raised over a million about like 50k in secondary trading volume but i think like the initial two sales were really about um rewarding uh our like core initial community that were kind of like the first to come on board and kind of believe in the project and be excited about the project even before the the ridley scott announcement was made um and then like this third mint will be really focused about kind of okay like fundraising um and going for that yeah 16 to even like 20 million gold um is kind of what they're aiming for um so so so yeah um if if this kind of works out i really hope we can fund all of it uh with nfcs in the ethereum community um that would definitely be a first kind of the the first hollywood film uh funded with nfts um and i really do believe the ethereum community can can make it happen uh to take ethereum to the mainstream um yeah do you think there's any opportunities for like any utility on top of these nfts as well like so if you buy an nft like maybe there's an opportunity for like uh advanced showing or like uh you know i not asking you to make any promises but it'd be really cool to meet jason moma if i had an nft that's all i'm saying well actually i love that you asked that because that's exactly the utility these nfts have so um so the the nfts besides being these these like really beautiful works of art uh celebrating ethereum um they do have utility uh part of their utility is they they have these kind of easter eggs attached to them uh which will be revealed after the third mid um and around the 60 of nfts have these uh like awards um and they include it being an extra in the film um so you know if you get kind of an nfc with an extra ticket you can really make a cameo in the infinite machine movie um other rewards include having your name appear in the credits uh being invited to the movie premiere um and visiting one of the shooting locations uh so you know i i really kind of like to call these nfts like a backstage pass into production because they really kind of give you a chance of being a part of the movie itself and that's kind of one one side of things and then the other the other utility to this is that um we want these nft holders to uh in kind of in the coming months to control adele um like a movie dao or like a content creation dao so right now around the 10 of all sales are going to a community treasury um and nft holders will be able to control this treasury and then decide you know what they want to use these funds for hopefully to support other kind of um content productions that are helping uh bring ethereum build they bring decentralization and you know crypto to the mainstream just like the infinite machine movie is and so who are some of the artists behind the art of because there's so many different uh like versions of the ethereum logo and they're all spliced together who were the artists that uh created the the some of these nfts and and what's their role in this whole story yeah so um i love the the kind of the story of the artists uh behind the fitted machine collec collection um so how this happened was that when we were thinking about uh okay like what this uh what these nfcs would be um i said you know like this is about ethereum uh it should be the ethereum logo and i decided to reach out to one of the the guys who was involved in creating the original ethereum logo and i said oh it'd be cool if he was the one to design these nfts but it turned out that um that jani was leading this kind of cuban artist community and so speaking with him i was like wait like what if instead of you designing the logos why don't we bring these cuban artists into the mix and have them design it and then we just like opened it up to just like any um artists from hopefully just like mainly emerging countries where nfts and crypto are really having a life-changing impact um because i think you know like a lot of the the headlines and the attention in the nft space goes to artists who are already kind of in in um [Music] in you know in in main kind of tech hubs you know they're they're in in europe or they're in the us and maybe yeah like nfts have given them like a platform and and help them kind of monetize their work but for someone in in cuba and venezuela like this is like just like life-changing money um and speaking with with with johnny and with gladys who helped curate these artists like she's um the the curator for this collection she's a professor at the university of havana like she's in cuba um and it's just amazing speaking with her is just like the how like how huge an impact um just like the the nft uh space has had on these artists so um i wanted to kind of make um give all these artists up a platform uh with the infinite machine uh collection and so that's that's what we did um i'm glad it's helped curate 36 different artists from cuba venezuela like bolivia they're starting from india um and and they're the ones kind of behind all of these different logos and this is a just a great way to showcase to the world what ethereum can do not just with helping produce a movie but also with the funding and the community effort so it seems to be this the first major ethereum hollywood movie is also built with ethereum just ethos and vibes so cami thank you for making sure that that is a part of the the whole story of the production of this thing i'm also seeing from the website that uh the nfts have a role in this movie this content creation dao i think you were referring to and the dao itself is actually an executive producer in the movie is that right and can you go into the details behind that is there like a legal structure here or is this just more of a a social layer commitment where the dao is an executive director to the movie uh i mean we'll have to potentially have like a legal framework behind it at some point that that isn't in place at the moment like the dao has informally been been created but it's it's kind of the the intention and part of the road map that um you know like the the community treasury treasury is already there so uh that that'll be kind of that's the seed of this doll that's being formed and yeah like the the the plan is to uh give this dow an executive producer role in the movie uh which means that nft holders will be represented um as the movie is made and so it's still kind of we still need to define um how exactly um you know those decisions are made um i you know we were we were talking about maybe using a structure similar to what git coin does where um there are delegates who can maybe represent nft holders in in kind of the the dow um so that's that's still kind of been being worked on but uh the plan is definitely to give nft holders a direct say on how the movie gets made amazing amazing can we just one meta question for for you and not to defiant what what does this moment represent for the defiant uh because give defines fantastic news source in in the world of crypto and d5 but now also being very related to the ethereum's first hollywood production movie uh how does this change what you think the defiant is and how do you think it'll change the divine going forward into the future well that's a good question um i don't know that this changes the defiant uh directly um so so yeah like i'm of course like at the the the lead of both of these projects um but well well kind of i'm yeah at the center of the infinite machine movie and collection and kind of leading the defiant um beyond that like i don't see them influencing each other very much like we've we've done things where um like in in the past means uh the defined subscribers uh get kind of special kind of whitelist spots or you know we give kind of the defiant community um you know like perks related to uh the infinite machine movie so that's a way to kind of feed into each other's communities and of course like uh that they defined we cover very much very closely what happens uh with the infinite machine movie um but you know i think having this um this experience of um of of building a kind of nft community uh that will become a dao uh like having these experience with these kind of tokens um it it just like it helps me understand a a different a different type of community building um and and that'll uh you know that'll help me kind of with the defiant as well but it will be a more kind of i think indirect influence all right cami uh thanks so much for spending some time with us i've you just one last cl question before we close so let's fast forward it's 2024. and the movie is uh premiering and uh what would be i guess sort of a premiere of this movie and impact of this movie that um you'd be really excited about so like what's what's sort of a thing metric that you think of in your mind as wow if we hit this it would be beyond successful beyond my wildest dreams let's talk about like the ultimate success criteria for the infinite machine movie how big could this go and what do you what are you looking for oh my god that's that's so tough um [Music] i think broadly like i i would really want this to to just be a mainstream film you know that uh you know anyone but people outside of crypto of our kind of usual like bubble is watching and enjoying so um obviously like a uh an incredible dream would be like is some like having the movie win like an award or something but like more more like every day kind of like like seeing like getting on a plane and like seeing somebody else like watching um the infinite machine next to me you know just like having it be kind of seeping into just like mainstream um and and hopefully just like having like contributing to people actually uh using uh this technology you know like if people who are watching uh this this movie and then like go and and and google uh ethereum and download their metamask um you know create a non-custodial wallet uh that would i think that that to me would be kind of the ultimate kind of sign of access success so before beyond like making a an entertaining blockbuster film that would be amazing uh but ultimate success would be influencing people's behavior and checking this out exploring and actually starting to use this tech that would be amazing as well and cami thanks for all your work and putting it into both the book and and now the movie and bringing ethereum the ethereum story to to more people i think those who've spent some time in crypto like looking at ethereum we're all blown away by how incredible uh the ecosystem is and even like individuals like vitalik like uh to me he is sort of a once-in-a-generation type of person and not enough people know who he is of course everyone in crypto knows who he is but like no one outside of crypto and this is um you know to me anyway one of the defining people um in our in our generation and of our time and i think his story should be propagated far and wide so um i could absolutely succeed see this being a blockbuster success when it comes out i know you've got a lot of work between now and then to uh to go through so uh we'd love to have you back on bank list to give us updates along the way and particularly after you're done casting we want to see where that is awesome i would love them no and you know what i i think you're you're absolutely right like i think um vitalik should be that mark zuckerberg kind of a character or personality everyone should know about him he's you know minus the evil side yeah yeah no but like in the like level of like recognition you know totally uh so yeah and we just started seeing that like the time magazine hit him on the cover of time was like you know a milestone uh you know a movie there's lots of things so it's it's gonna be great mckamey thanks for stopping by we appreciate it i appreciate it thank you for having me of course uh bankless nation uh we will keep you updated along the way as the
