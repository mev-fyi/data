[Music] welcome to layer zero player zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community crypto is built by code but it's composed by keep people and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer 0 focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm speaking with griff greene who has a fascinating story of a journey through crypto and i think the the story really uh starts in many many places but it starts with griff uh living off of the grid and choosing to use gold to store his value in order to live a bankless life before bitcoin was even a thing or a bitcoin had entered his life griff was off the grid being kind of a a hippie communal type guy kind of traveling the world that really got turned off by some aspects about society so he just yeted himself out of society traveled the world got rid of all his belongings put everything in a backpack and started using gold to store his value and then of course found his way into the world of bitcoin and then ethereum later on griff has the most fascinating story about the dow as somebody who had front row seats of the the dao the 2016 dao we spend uh at least the second half the whole entire second half of the episode is going through the story of the dao and that's actually the first time i've heard that story in such granular detail um so that really was just the the absolute highlight of this interview in my opinion i had a fantastic time like speaking with griffin getting to know him a little bit more so without further ado let's go ahead and get right into the interview with griff green but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uniswop ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped dao apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost 3 billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dal no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof-of-stake is upon us proof-of-stake systems like ethereum terra and solana allow the industry to move away from the hot loud and wasteful proof-of-work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators and that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized individuals must play their part in crypto network validation and that is what lydo is here to do lido makes  accessible to everyone at the click of a button by delegating your stake to lydo's network of nodes you can access the yield offered by proof of sake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards do you have 32 eth and want to stake it to ethereum but running a node sounds intimidating or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eath with others so you can access staking yields lido offers a solution for both simply go to lido.fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the lido validating network lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol so if you want to stake your eath tara or soul and get liquidity on your steak go to lydo.fi to get started hey griff how's it going hey ah fantastically man how are you fantastic also fantastic always fantastic it's a fun always a fun time to be in crypto so the last time we talked was in colorado after mcon and i have a little uh a funny story to tell you about it because i was talking to you asking you a little bit about your background in your life uh and then i went on a plane ride to new york and i started listening to matt lysing's book about ethereum and then he talks about like the parts of the dow hack and talks about like this this guy griff green that was part part of this the the you know the damage control for the dow hack like wait griff green i was just talking to that guy in colorado now he's like in the subject matter of this book yeah matt matt did a that had a lot of fun with that book for sure is it was uh it wasn't as accurate as some of the other books that are coming out on ethereum it was definitely like oh hey let's make let's have this be like more adventurous and more fun but uh yeah it was it was it was fun it was fun talking with him over the years too he's been writing that for a while yeah it was just fun from from my perspective about like oh i'm going to this uh convention at a meta cartel convention and then i'm also just meeting the people that these kind of sci-fi stories about ethereum are being written about and it's it's crazy like how much like literature has been made so quickly about this industry and then all like it's also like still happening right the stories are still unfolding at the same time oh yeah so much man and yeah it's a you know theorem's been around for a long time surprisingly there's been a lot of chaos a lot of adventures and i have to say i've been in a lot of them a lot of these like crazy crazy times so and that's definitely the some of the stories i want to um get told on on the show today but but i think uh in order to tell those stories we have to just go all the way back and hear a little bit about um griff green so griff who were you as a kid what were you interested when you were growing up what captured your attention and and how did griff green come to be griff green uh let's see as a kid i mean i was just a normal kid my mom was like a waitress my dad was correctional officer uh actually my dad was my stepdad i met my real dad when i was like 12 and i i ended up having about six parents right and so that was really fun having this like family of families so many grandparents so many socks at christmas you know and i i was uh i i i mean i we can zoom through it you know i used to coach my little brothers and sisters basketball teams and i was really into basketball and ended up getting uh a chemical engineering degree the university of washington uh griff is really tall by the way for listeners that don't know that he's a pretty tall guy yeah i mean i'm not that tall guy for sure he's got me by by a mile but yeah i'm okay it's fun on the screen right to come out of the screen and meet everybody in person and be like who's tall who's short it's a it's a fun game like who's in tall dow who's in short dao oh man that might be a fun game i've been trying to poke the crypto twitter sphere to start creating tall dow in short dial but i don't know actually where short thou starts like where would you think short thou should start i don't know man that's shorter than me no okay so the the we'll keep on zooming through your background but you said you you had like six parents six like uh people taking care of you uh because a lot of the times i've heard you talk you have very communal vibes about you um definitely yeah do you think are those two things connected you think maybe maybe i'm definitely a sharon he's caring kind of guy but uh i don't know probably i i definitely like the family vibe and you know it's just but it's the same thing it's like divorced parents and stuff so it wasn't all communal it was it wasn't wasn't one set of one family appearance of sex yeah yeah exactly the tribal polyamorous like no it was just more more muggly than that you know pretty normal lifestyle um yeah and i don't know i don't feel like there's too much interesting things i grew up in spokane which is uh like part near in washington state near idaho you know nothing wild there i went to lived in seattle for like eight years and where actually seattle did you live uh in north seattle uh all over north seattle i went to uw for four years so i was in the youth district in lake city and uh yeah just all over maple leaf yep green lake yeah yeah just dancing around that's where my family is is maple leaf yeah oh really wow do you know pattaya uh payatai cuisine it's like a an apartment building on 90th and lake city way hmm i definitely have driven right past it a bajillion times but no i don't know it there's a strip there's a strip club there called oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's still there yeah passed by ricks and i drive up to my dad's house nice yeah exactly right well there's uh that apartment building right across the street i lived there for like two years okay yep yep yep yeah no we're we're from the same part of the woods man nice nice yeah i love seattle um actually i i um i cut i'm like i'm really more of a community organizer in the theorem space and i cut my teeth with the save our sonics there's this like remember of course yeah seattle supersonics so yep i was a huge sonics fan like out of this world sonic's fan all i had a whole room like uh when i was a chemical engineer and i like moved up to a decent like i shared a house with another kimmy and we got like a really nice party house for a little bit and uh i had a whole room dedicated to the sonics it was just wall-to-wall sonic's gear right and i had a i would carry a gary payton rookie card in my pocket everywhere i go and like cut out the the only days i didn't wear sonic's gear was the days after they'd lose a game because i was in mourning you know it was like i had all these traditions built around it my whole life purpose was basically to get courtside seats uh of the sonics and and then uh they were bought by a basket by like this guy in oklahoma city who said he wanted to keep them there but also before he bought the team he was like i'm bringing a team to oklahoma you know so everyone knew that it was a scam he he sold off all the good players and then got a bunch of rookies and stuff and good draft picks like kevin durant and russell russ brooke and then uh like because the team sucked he was like oh well hey either we get a new arena or we move because this is how it works and uh and so for two years i was like general of the fans working to keep the team in town so this is like my political movement you know and uh it i was already kind of an austrian economist like i i kind of came from that side of of the scene uh hated the banks hated all the like all of the um all the taxes and these sorts of things that would that were i don't know challenging to like individu individual freedom and uh i kind of like put some of those values on hold so i could try to like get taxes for an arena and uh and then we actually were about to win there was this court case that we that we levied where they we had paid for uh some improvements to key arena which they were playing basketball in at the time and uh they had a 15-year contract that had a closet that's like special purpose like they have to stay in seattle and play games in that arena uh according to this contract for 15 years and only been 13 years so it's a pretty clear-cut case and the and we held a huge rally like that i that i organized it was like 3 000 person rally in front of key arena and you know i had to get the permits and all that crap uh and gary payton and sean kemp were there you know and it was like it was basically this huge it was a huge thing and then the day the judge was going to give their ruling that was going to like keep the team there for two more years and it would have basically forced the guy into selling the team because we had rallied support against him all over the place uh the mayor held a press conference right before the ruling and said actually and we're just going to sign away the team and uh they're going to give us like 60 million dollars and that's it yeah and it was like i had worked you know two years every ounce of time that i had was dedicated to this uh i was championing this cause and then with one stroke of a pin some politician just said i it you know uh i swear on this oh absolutely yeah is that your is that your um uh blizzard work nerfing the warlock spell that created is that your mo moment for you absolutely i i was i basically lost it you know and it's of course you know the worst things that happen to you are always the best things that happen to you you know if if we would have succeeded and kept the sonics in town i probably would just be an overweight chemical engineer like with courtside seats just you know sitting in a cubicle hack building power plants for the man right uh but instead i was like all this i asked to be laid off in 20 in 2008 when all the layoffs were coming right when when was the whole sonic story when did that happen again i should not have a lot of my friends a lot of my friends were at that rally by the way oh yeah yeah that's so cool yeah we were in middle school at the time yeah i guess the sonics would have happened in 2009 and then uh that would have been like summer of 2009 i think and then uh the layoffs happened at the end of 2009 so it's like a few months later and that already kind of like it was just like in my mind like i don't want to do this anymore there's also some stuff with the chemical engineering i'm a pretty ethical um i'm a hippie straight up right and i had to design uh an aeration basin for the pollution that was coming out of this aluminum smelter and like i so i was working for a power plant company that was doing mostly natural gas power plants and also some renewable energy power plants and i felt fine with that because natural gas is basically a waste product you know they often just burn it after so drilling for oil so it feels like you're taking garbage and turning in electricity people can use i felt okay with that and super clean uh but this specific power plant that i was designing and and working on was fueling an aluminum smelter it was my job to take the pollution from the aluminum smelter and you know make it prepared well enough for the ocean the problem is prep the pollution for the rest of the world the secret to chemical engineering a dirty little secret the the solution to pollution is dilution so the real question was how much sea water do i pump into our pollution before you just dump it out into the ocean yeah can we turn it can we turn it into not waste by diluting it with a lot of things that isn't waste yeah i mean it's still poison but you know hey at least it's diluted so it's like oh um and so i actually was you know there's a lot of um buffers there's a lot of interesting things with ocean water it's not like clear cut if you bring in this ocean water how will the pollution react with the ocean water and and so i kind of cheated a little bit and i made the the specification a little conservative on what the ph would be the regulations in abu dhabi were horrible and it was like the ocean was a ph of 8.4 and the the pollution coming out the regulations said it had to be a ph of six and that's that's a logarithmic scale so that's like the the pollution can be 300 times more acidic than the ocean water itself that's not cool you know like a little and so i cheated and i was trying i had like one calc over here and then the calc that was the official calc that would like say hey look an engineer said this would give out these results and i kind of just like tweaked it so that the ph would be about seven which is rainwater and totally great but then the sea water pumps were so big that it didn't really wasn't very cost effective and my boss basically told me to redo the calf and fix it because it's not right like that's just not real right and i was like ah and so i should have said at the time if you know i was i was a lot younger than i am now i just said i actually don't feel good about this and he just makes someone else do it but instead i fixed it and you know did the math right and then now there's a pipe in abu dhabi that's like little fish are swimming in front of and going ah it burns and then you know and so uh that plus the sonics i was just like i'm done with chemi i'm done with all this chemical engineering stuff i just want to like sell everything i own and become a hippie right yeah so society just turned you just got turned off by society from the left and the right totally totally it's just like this is i wanted to exit the banks exit the american system and the american way of materialism and and the classic things and just so i just sold everything i own i bought a pop-top van and uh drove around the states for a little bit had a great time uh went to burning man for the first time this was 2011. and uh because i was doing a lot of stuff i had started a little moving company and i i was doing all sorts of random you know under the table basically started craigslist businesses right all over the place just gig work you were just like doing a bunch of different things to scrape some dollars together just so you could keep on doing what you're doing right yeah yeah exactly and i was living off savings you know i was a chemical engineer i never really bought a lot of things i i was always pretty cheap and uh and also i was buying i was storing all of my value in gold and silver and eventually i avoided even having a bank account and so i just had gold silver bars and i would go and go to a there's northwest territorial mint which doesn't exist anymore but down in tacoma so i just make a run down to tacoma buy a bunch of gold and silver and then like you know that's where i would put my money that was your bank account yeah and i was doing that be when i was a chemical engineer too so before you and before crypto was even a thing so you were had had gone bankless before bitcoin hadn't even mined its first block yeah definitely and then when i heard about bitcoin well no i still had a bank account i probably went bankless in 2011. like i had no bank account and maybe even 2010 somewhere in that time i didn't have a bank account and i didn't have a bank account for years actually what motivated because that's a big pain in the butt like i want to break up with my bank just as much as like ryan does and as much as i say that i do on on the podcast but like also i still need to like you know pay rent and stuff stuff like that so like where did the mo it just like not having a bank account would be like really cumbersome i would imagine where did the motivation come to just like ax your bank account i you know at the time it was like occupy wall street was going on there's a lot of things and and really this idea of uh banks being the root of all evil you know like could we have war without banks fun payrolling it you know the whole banking system being this uh being something i didn't want to support i didn't want my energy to be part of that world you know i i just wanted to escape and i was living in a van right i was uh totally off the grid i didn't i wouldn't do any i was doing craigslist deals back and forth you know and just playing the the playing the free market without governments and banks that was like where i wanted to be so i made that reality right so you weren't you weren't a gold bug you didn't really believe in gold like going up in price you were literally just using it as a tool yeah i mean i i did i was a gold bug of sorts but i really was just like the fiat like you the federal reserve note is garbage so what can i keep my value in you know gold or and that's the thing buying and selling stuff on craigslist that i thought was a good deal that i could like you know hold on to smaller things and enlarge things and then put it back on and try to make some money here and there uh improve the craigslist ads basically you know so i i would store my capital in things that i thought were good investments that were not part of like not amazon stock but you know whatever i could uh yeah and so it just and then stuff original nft flipping yeah a little bit yeah you're trading physical goods on craigslist and the way that people are flipping nfts on openc right now yeah 100 i said nfts on opencs so much better oh my god you know you don't have to go talk with someone and cash and then they're probably like they're half the time they're a scammer and just a time waster i think it's crazy how much of your uh pre-crypto life actually resembles what crypto life is nowadays i think that's really funny and and that's how i got into it right like i saw a trace mayor video when bitcoin was five dollars and then i was like oh this is so cool you know uh i can't believe they made it money outside of the banking system i want to see this nerd money you know um but then it was like to get it you had to wire money to somewhere in japan mount gox right mt gox and i just i was like no i'm not going to do that how's that even not that cool since yeah and it's just wiring i don't want to talk to the banks that they don't exist in my world right right so but then eventually one of my buddies figured out how to get bitcoin from coinbase up uh this is in 2013 and at that time i had left the states completely i sold my van and i started traveling went to went to south america uh in ecuador and i love latin america and i uh fell in love with that area of the world and then came back to the states went to burning man again that's 2012. then i went to asia i went to india for a few months went to kumbamela the largest gathering of humans every time it happens every 12 years a hundred million people oh the bathrooms were gross man oh wow like a tin roof like kind of cubicle thing with just smearing a little bit oh no oh it was yeah it was it was atrocious but interesting for sure kind of like a spiritual burning man where uh there's uh yeah there anyway i can keep going and then there's uh then i went to thailand and while i was in thailand my buddy i was just talking to my buddy he's like yeah he was buying drugs on silk road right and uh he told me he could he was using bitcoin at oh my god dude i want some right i had some gold and silver stored with another friend in this in the states and he would sell it and then wire me money and that's that's how i was traveling okay so because you had a bank account no i didn't have a bank account he would wire me money i'd pick it up at a at a like uh western union or whatever unions yeah yeah some places and uh and then and he would sell the gold and silver for me usually he'd just buy it from me and then sell it a little later whenever he felt like it and then so i he's actually gave my friend three grand worth of gold and silver just about 50 50. and then my buddy sent me three grand of bitcoin and i instantly turned that bitcoin into half bitcoin half litecoin name coin purecoin prime coin a terra coin feather coin you know everything that was on uh on btc btc-e right uh which was the exchange i was holding my bitcoin on and this is like oh this was right after this is uh the cyprus riots you know and there was this uh in april 2013 bitcoin i was watching bitcoin and it had gone up from you know 50 to about 250 and then crashed down to 50 and right at the crash uh is when i made the trade and so i was able to buy bitcoin at about like somewhere it was i bought it a few times at around 50 uh 58 was the lowest price i got and most of it was around 90 the average price was about 80. and so i had like three grand at 80 dollars and then while i was eventually i went back to the states and i got a girlfriend in la and so then i was living in west hollywood i learned to become a thai masseuse in thailand and so that was what my profession was going to be i figured and so i was giving thai massages in beverly hills i had a like a nice a clientele that liked me as a bear right i had like i passed my card to this one guy and then he passed it to a bunch of friends and it was like all these gay guys in beverly hills and that was like my big my big money so i was getting paid like 200 of massage to go in and like you know it was a little awkward sometimes i'm sure i'm sure there's definitely i'm sure there's stories inside of stories inside of stories yeah we can keep it we can keep it pg we don't need to go there yeah that's that's fine so when you traded your gold for bitcoin what was the motivation on that was it that it's literally a digital form of gold so it's like the ux for you and your life is better or was it more speculation it was like i think this thing could go up in price a little bit of both but mostly speculation i mean it had just crashed from 250 to 50 and and i had seen it when it was five dollars so i had a good feeling about it to say that okay okay and uh but the idea the and the promise was there uh but honestly it didn't work for what i wanted to do because eventually i had to even interact i had to get a bank account bitcoin actually made me get a bank account it's so brutal i know isn't that sad right so sad this is this is why we talk about why we need d5 but that's the subject for a different day yeah i mean this is 2013 2014 d5 was a gleam in vitalik's eye to say the least sure so uh i mean ethereum didn't even exist in fact it was an interesting time you know i i was so bitcoin i was in west hollywood and bitcoin went from you know a hundred dollars to a thousand dollars and it blew my mind because i turned three grand into 24 grand mostly litecoin money was like where the big profit was yeah i bought litecoin at two dollars and fifty cents and it went to forty two dollars right and so it's just mind boggling and i so i turned three grand into 24 grand and i'm like i could live off this for a year like well what is this stuff you know i'm gonna stop massaging massaging and just research bitcoin and i'm a chemical engineer i have a technical background i'm not a dev uh but i would but i'm a community organizer and with some technical understanding so i can like a dove in and then the deeper i went the more value aligned i found myself and at the time bitcoin was a mix of all there was no blockchain no one talked about blockchain they just talked about bitcoin and all the ethereum people were in bitcoin you know right because there wasn't ethereum at that time right yeah there was no ethereum there was no there there was uh master coin was coming up nxt was coming up there were these other like 2.0 coins what they're called uh vitalik called these uh swiss army knife coins right like it's where bitcoin is like a knife all these other coins came out like were swiss army knives where they did a bunch of things um but no one had yet cracked train completeness yet no and a lot of people i you know there were a lot of forks of other of bitcoin too they were just i mean dogecoin honestly was like my favorite community by far uh there was lots of fun stuff going on and people had high vibes everywhere else it was so much money money money money but there were pockets of the bitcoin community which turned into the theorem community honestly that we're talking about the revolutionary aspects of how you can use this currency to and and currency creation in itself to actually like change the way we coordinate as a society and that's where i just was like yes yes yes we can do you know here we can start doing things so this moment in your life to me seems like the the counter moment to you tapping out of society after the sonics and the oa crisis and and also the the whole like uh nuclear power plant thing or not maybe not nuclear um uh yeah it is like this so like the one ejected you from so you chose to eject yourself from society now with discovering the ethos behind bitcoin you're like oh this like i want to go into this society i'm like i'm ready to get back into the world of of the the world is that a fair description absolutely i wouldn't say get back into that world but get back get into the crypto world right yeah exactly into the crypto world i'm like how do i do it right and actually uh i never i have very little faith in the educational system and certain i always thought certifications were but uh because i'm like i want to get into crypto how do i do it i took i made two choices uh number one i broke up with my girlfriend because she was jealous of bitcoin i was given too much attention i was obsessed with bitcoin and she wanted my attention and i was just like i love you but i can't i'm obsessed i'm a man possessed right wow and i think there are any uh crypto wives or crypto girlfriends listening to this might absolutely buy uh empathize with that yeah yeah i i feel bad but it wasn't gonna happen so i i broke up with her and went to ecuador and was like is that really is is that really the reason it was like you just couldn't stop focusing about bitcoin and it just drove a wedge in the relationship a hundred percent i i mean before i was giving her a lot more attention i would go and massage for two to four hours a day max and we would hang out you know there's lots of quality time i mean there was like you know love languages right like quality time words of affirmation acts of service you know all these things and uh i didn't have the time to do quality time and so that that i don't want to say it was only because of that there's of course it's always a very complex thing but in the end uh she wanted to be in la and i didn't see like a lot of value in being on la while i'm focusing all the time on bitcoin and i saw a lot of opportunity to bring bitcoin to ecuador right and i was like i'm going to bring bitcoin to ecuador i'm going to uh and and i'm going to get a master's degree in digital currencies those are like the two that was the path that i chose to take for the next period of time and so i went to ecuador i started knocking i i started just making meetups with a few other people that were into crypto there i chose ecuador number one because i loved ecuador it was my favorite place in my travels and uh number two they use the us dollars and they have a five percent tax on any money that leaves the country so i'll be honest and like well this is an opportunity right because we have payment rails that the government can't meter and it seems like easy money like let's just get it let's get a bitcoin community here people once people trust it people will use it because there's a five percent reason to use it right right uh and so business itself yeah exactly i i didn't know exactly how or what but i knew i i just needed to meet like-minded people and build something and so i met like-minded people and uh was was while i was getting this master's degree and ended up like finding out that ecuador had their own plans for a digital currency of like a phone currency a dumb phone currency also i found out that it was just really hard to talk to ecuadorians about like this kind of tech uh i would go i had some success like early on it was like wow no one has they're just like kind of afraid of technology they didn't trust technology right uh and so i would actually go to well where are the tech people i go to colleges and actually just knock on doors of computer science classrooms and say hey i want to give everyone in here a little bit of bitcoin and tell them about it and i i did this seven times and four out of the seven times they let me in and i would just like you know interrupt their class which maybe it says something about the educational opportunities in ecuador i don't know like um and then i would just like give a little bit of bitcoin to a few people and then tell them to pass it on right and then so everyone is sending each other bitcoin in the classroom i tell them about blockchain.info and show them how to save create a wallet and save their save their 17 words i think it was at the time you know and uh everything was all the standards have changed at this point uh yeah and it was a lot of fun and i loved it but then eventually you know it was clear that ecuador was going to make bitcoin illegal and the jails in ecuador they don't feed you so i was like you know i think i'm gonna bail on this idea and uh and just continue my crypto journey elsewhere so i went to burning man as i do every year and just kind of bumming around in the states that decided to live in a van in the states again actually u-haul and at this point where are you conversing with other crypto people uh online right on reddit it's all on reddit reddit what was the community there like was there like reoccurring names that you would that you would like conversation andreas antonopoulos videos were like my crack i mean i couldn't get enough i've probably watched every andreas antonov's video that existed uh i had a i had a master's program so there were the people in that program and the teachers and and all that yeah that master's program who was giving a master's in digital currency university of nicosia what's that what's that literally cryptocurrency or or yeah digital currency so i have a math i have the first master's degree in digital currencies that ever existed first degree in digital currencies that ever existed is that program still running yeah yeah still running still going strong andreas antonopoulos was part of it and teaches the first course it's like a mooc online that anyone can take so what was actually like the course matter because there wasn't it was in 2013 or 14 there wasn't really much to talk about at the time other than just like yeah how about blockchain works right yeah totally i i i would say that it was more of a international finance degree okay and business degree than it was you know i learned about how international finance works the you know the fed federal reserve system like like moving money around you know uh all these different like what do nation states do how do they move money around in so and there was there was some crypto stuff yeah i mean i definitely like uh my first project was uh well later i wrote a white paper for a bike sharing economy mostly based on the bitshares protocol and and their terminology there it was like decentralized autonomous corporations right and there were you know there was like little projects like that and and uh and a lot of international banking laws and legal stuff that you learn about but honestly so different now yeah yeah yeah it has to be while you were in tinkering around with did you come across roon christensen you know i i got to meet roon uh bef like while the dow was happening but i didn't actually got get to talk to roon during those days now okay okay uh but roone told me that uh later on like because he was in seattle a lot and i was in seattle a lot during the dow days and he was like why are you guys using 16 decimals that is the dumbest idea ever you're ruining the standard everyone should use 18 and he had a couple other things about the dow and we had we had like a nice a nice exchange maybe argument maybe argument about design choices uh so that was really fun so yeah so so this is a 2013-2014 when did ethereum arrive across your feed of your life yeah so this is the the master's degree was 2014 2015 2016. it was a two-year degree and uh i came about you know when i first heard of ethereum i thought it was vaporware that was kind of the resounding opinion of the internet and i didn't know any of the ether ethereum crew so what was the the alternative blockchains that were in bitcoin what was the what was the vibe like way back then about like non-bitcoin things like was there bitcoin max no yeah really no i mean there was a little bit but that came from uh that that was like was it block stream you know block stream really created that and before ethereum existed it was if bitcoin was much more idealistic there was still hope that we would change the block size you know that was and that was a debate that started really probably even before i heard about it in like 2014 2015 it was probably there the whole time just like people expecting it would happen uh and and then blockstream who was paying all the devs and you know putting throwing money around uh decided that it wasn't good for lightning network and their other investments and said no and used a lot of cultural tools to overtake the bitcoin ecosystem in my opinion and and uh really pushed the the small blocks uh ideas which anyone who wanted to use bitcoin for anything cooler than a store of value could see that that's a dumb idea but uh you know i guess it's i in the end it works out fine i think the bitcoin crew and the push during that time i felt very sad you know and and and disgruntled because i i saw the potential of using bitcoin as a as a as the layer of you know revolution of an evolution of how we can coordinate as a society around like these public goods is now the terminology but like just around like basically republican governments with economies which is what i was always really stoked about that what these tools could do and uh yeah and so i was i was pretty sad about that approach at the time but now i feel did you blame the right way did you blame block stream yeah totally i i feel like i mean they're they're by far the largest voice uh pushing that direction and uh you know it was block stream and what was man i'm losing all these names and terms it's been so long thalius or the the basically the guy the moderator of the subreddit rbtc right and our bitcoin yeah and he is also the moderator of a few other things like that guy uh was censoring everybody and it got it just got really ugly you know and uh but you know before i got into etherium before that all started kicking off because i wrote so in my master's degree there was a task to write a will contract using the bitcoin blockchain right and so i was like oh cool can i use ethereum instead i had so i let's back up a little bit so i wrote this uh i wrote this bike sharing economy white paper and it was really cool the idea was like uh it was called bicycles in kind for everyone uh bik 4e but the 4 was silent so his bike right and uh it would be like a currency that would be printed and vested inside a bicycle whenever you would donate it to the network so you would bring you go and get a network uh get the bike and you would steward the bike but the idea was the bike was owned by the the dac because that was the terminology of the time the dao would own all the bikes and if you were the first bike within like a hundred mile radius you'd get this bonus of extra tokens that would be held in the bike right and then you know as more bikes were in that area then the bonus would decrease and it was this like basically printing money to create a bike sharing network international bike sharing network in cities around the world was the design which i think we are definitely now i mean there are like electric scooters electric bikes all over cities all over the world nowadays it's just that they're run by corporations not decentralized corporations exactly and it'd be so cool and i think that eventually we will see that reality where these things are owned by uh dows and not corporations but uh that you know bridging meat space and crypto space is harder than it sounds so extremely hard it hasn't happened yet but uh i made that by it was the sharing economy was really interesting to me and using that as a gateway to like own the collective ownership by communities without governments which is which is always what i've been focusing on and uh i sent that vid i made a video explaining the white paper for my class and i sent that to slockit which when i googled sharing economy you know bitcoin it's my money google because at the time crypto was barely a term uh slock it was the number one thing that was coming up and this was way before the dow or anything in fact zlaka had just had a website when you google stuff uh back then there wasn't much you know when i i was reading all of the media i could read all of the media because there just wasn't that many people talking about this right and uh so slaka came up on my radar and i basically would email them every couple weeks and say i will work for free i want to i want to support you guys in this mission like pick me up i'm getting a master's degree i'm doing this eventually christoph jens who was a pretty huge member of the the early ethereum community he uh he would he saw my video i was like this guy's funny okay cool uh and then like let me work for free and i was effectively their first employee so it was like slockit the three founders and me eventually left harris joined and this is 2015 and that was my first experience with ethereum and realizing ethereum was a real thing before that and everyone like if you were just a casual reddit user ethereum was vaporware it will never really work it was never a thing they don't have any prototypes they don't have anything you can use you know and and that was the resounding idea they did a crowd sale and it's a ponzi right so that's why i asked about like the culture around like non-bitcoin coins and it's weird to hear you say that uh there was no such thing as bitcoin maximalism all these other coins were out there were generally accepted but then this ethereum came around the ethereum thing came around and it was vaporware how did why why do you think people thought it was vaporware at genesis because people because ethereum raised money and they didn't do what you would call now a fair launch right usually most people just uh would launch the token that was the prevailing it was the mere fact of the fact that they actually just had a raise and they sold the time yeah okay yeah they raised a bunch of money and then you know now they have that money and they're working on stuff sure they are right let's see where why aren't you launching something where's the you know where's the genesis block blah blah blah and so for years that was the understanding or maybe a year and a half and then like they started deploying things and and you could use it and then it's like okay this isn't vaporware this is interesting uh there was also some design choices man that i didn't agree with with ethereum you know it's like there's no checksum in the address right the change one i don't know what that means in every other crypto uh the last few digits of the address is a checksum it actually the last few digits will tell you if the address is a valid address okay so like if you change one character in a bitcoin address every wallet could tell you that is an invalid address as in like there are no private keys that are associated with that address yeah because uh or it's more like this address is following an invalid format so it can't be real right because there's these extra i don't know if it's like four or seven characters or whatever at the end of the address that are derived from the rest of the address and so okay and credit cards are like this every credit card has a checksum and that's how your when you type it in online they know that that is like a valid you know credit card number uh and so this is not existent in ethereum right and it's just like why and why are there so few characters you know and like there's just weird choices you know there were weird choices and people at the time when they were talking about these choices it's just like why are you doing it what about the rest of crypto what we learned and what we determined you know where's the hd wallets where are these things so uh yeah it was easy to hate on ethereum early on but then i got into the community and wow it was so lovey-dovey so i i had that will contract right i had to write a will contract and because i had started working for socket it's like how would i do it in ethereum instead of bitcoin is that okay professor right and he's like yeah sure give it a try and he didn't know anything about ethereum and he thought that was cool and this project was supposed to take like a week and it was it was a huge project i did in four hours on ethereum and i don't know how to code so like i mean i took a coding class in college but i'm fresh and and so i was like whoa ethereum is better and uh and while everyone else is like grueling away on this project i'm like i'm done and and so then i actually made a blog post for slockit that was like hey how to make how i made a will contract on ethereum and it was basically my homework assignment but it's like i'll make it a blog post and hang out with the theorem community and everyone was so nice my my expectation was like i'm going to post this and i'm going to get a bunch of people telling me how shitty it is and how dumb i am and uh because that's the crypto community yep but in the ethereum community it was just all love like oh that's a really nice try oh that's so cool that's how you that's that's cute you know a little bit of that oh that's cute but then yeah yeah but then absa alex anderson who works for the ethereum foundation took the time to show to and it was really nice about like here's a way that you could reduce the number of lines of code like because that's really important when you're coding in solidity with less surface area of attacks and stuff like that or i don't remember what he said but he was so nice about it and he improved it and i'm like where am i yeah is this crypto this isn't crypto this isn't even the internet this is some rainbow fairyland with unicorns jumping around like it doesn't make any sense and i was sold right away i was sold on ethereum and i'm like this is the right but first off it's easy to work on a non-developer i'm a technical person but a non-developer could come in and actually make something that has utility and and everyone's like encouraging me it was blew my mind with the other like cryptos that were out there and like you talked about how like they were this homework assignment was meant for bitcoin but but also in theory you could build anything on any other crypto as somebody who like watched the development of the uh communities of all crypto communities as they kind of came up and about how did the crypto communities change over time and then and then can you also just unpack even more the differences between the ethereum community that was created versus like the litecoin community and the bitcoin community that came around in the early days i think the biggest difference is the money the focus on money and i think the the number one thing that built of such a beautiful culture in ethereum was having rf trader and our ethereum yeah having that separation really allowed ethereum culture to develop in such an organic natural lovey-dovey way where that like you know when you when you think about money it just brings you into that scarcity mindset and you have this like remember go up you know only up i don't know you know it's it's this you know it doesn't really come combined well with like hey let's advance society together positives and games yeah yeah you know funding public goods you know coordination tools like that these two people these two groups of of things like what's great is you could go and have both it's not like it's oh this person is all about that and this person's all about money no it's like when you want to talk about the money and you're ready for that vibe then you go there and it's like oh yeah number go up cool cool cool but when you want to talk about like hey how are we going to make the world a better place our ethereum is there and no other crypto community had that right i don't know who made that innovation but in my opinion it's one of the most important things that happened in ethereum history from what i remember uh eath trader uh was created because our ethereum banned price talk and so it wasn't a uh we're gonna have these two communities build be built up simultaneously it was like well a lot of people wanted to talk prices and like all the developers of ethereum like uh vitalik were like i don't want to talk about prices i want to talk about ethereum so they made they banned price talking on our ethereum and then as a result people like all right well we're going to go to our eth trader and talk about prices over there that's how i remember it happening that's great yeah because i wasn't part of the ethereum community really i just started working for an ethereum company right so that was be before my ethereum time other other crypto communities but dogecoin was great i love doge doge going with the tip bot and like you know bringing the jamaican bobsled team to the olympics and and the doge nascar it was also not about money right it was about like jokes and vibes yeah and and those were the two uh reddit communities i liked hanging out in yeah bitshares was interesting but like i don't know it didn't it didn't have the right vibes i also liked monero i liked the privacy focus like i thought that was interesting you know uh but the rest of the communities like namecoin litecoin uh all of those things it was they were lame and then bitcoin was all b just slowly became all about number go up like all the interesting conversations eventually moved from big there was stuff that i would go to our bitcoin for they all moved to our ethereum and it was a very natural progression for me to just like i just looked at our bitcoin less and our ethereum more and eventually i barely looked at our bitcoin do you think if our ethereum and the ethereum community kind of like sucked that side of bitcoin away or do you think bitcoin the our bitcoin number go up vibe pushed the builders out of bitcoin or maybe a little bit of both uh definitely both you know it's really hard not to be consumed by your holdings or biased by your whole insurance right so everyone had bitcoin so everyone cared about people bitcoin like no one no one didn't care about that right because everyone has you couldn't not own bitcoin yeah right yeah if you cared about crypt i mean yeah you really couldn't because pretty much that's how you get the money to an exchange that's how you would for most people bitcoin is the fia and still to this day it's the fiat on-ramp and off-ramp you know bitcoin has the the network the global network where you can buy and sell it whether it's peer-to-peer or more with exchanges in every exchange period you know i don't know any fiat exchange that doesn't have bitcoin right right that would be wild right i'm sure it'll come soon if it's not already there but at that time not even close i think bitcoin network dominance was well above 95 percent right for market cap for most of that time hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation with griff thus far in the second half of the show this is where we get into all of the story of the dao so stay tuned for that strap in it is an absolute wild one but first before we get there a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange i've been a customer of gemiini since i first got into crypto in 2017 and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets including many of the hot defy tokens and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid die markets gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4 interest on 26 various crypto assets if you're tired of paying fees in defy where you don't want to worry about defy exploits but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets gemini earn is the product for you another product i'm stoked to get my hands on is the gemini crypto back credit card which gives you three percent cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset when i get my gemini credit card i'm going to make sure that i get my cash back in east so whenever i buy something i get a little bit of eth bonus back to me at the same time you can open up a free account in under three minutes at gemiini.com go bank list and if you trade more than a hundred dollars within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free 15 bitcoin bonus check them out at gemini.com go bankless the ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on ethereum which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets ave version 2 has a ton of cool features that makes using the ave protocol even more powerful with ave you can leverage the full power of d5 money legos yield and composability all in one application on ave there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 usdc against my portfolio of a number of different defy tokens in eth i'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option but i could choose the stable interest rate option if i wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently v2 also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets trade them on unit swap and then deposit them back into ave with ave users can do this in one seamless transaction saving you time and gas costs check out the power of ave ave.com that's dot com huh so how did you how did you become tell the story of getting even more just integrated with the ethereum community well it was all through the dow right so i was a community organizer and that's what i said i would do for slacking like i like doing community organization you know i i'm good with people and i have a hug a troll approach you know when someone's trolling it's like oh thank you for the feedback yeah that's so nice thank you thank you for the troll nice man thank you appreciate that yeah kill him with love exactly with sincerity because i'm not talking to the troll i'm talking to everyone who's in the chat room you know and it's always good to have that perspective and and so if the troll says something interesting but with a negative tone people might agree with the troll so you have to be like well that's a valid concern for the people who aren't trolls that actually agree with the point that was poorly spoken right and so then it's like well you know these are the stuff that i learned also just from trying to keep the sonics in seattle surprisingly and then we built one hell of a community i'm also an educator i was a coach i was a math tutor i was all these things so uh you know i created a down ninja course right and you know at the time the erc20 standard was barely standard and i like the first question in the down intercourse is like what does approve do you know which is like basic knowledge now but at the time i got wild answers you know um and so we we would we had everyone who would it was basically a test or an essay type assignment and we graded the homework and different people became down ninjas you know and dude all those down ninjas are rock stars in the ethereum community today right the guy behind true blocks you know jordi bellina who ended up who does so much and all these all these uh og ethereum people it's amazing and uh same with the people in socket that well in the dow chat room that like became like insiders in the dow and kind of in the middle layer uh because i would my community management style is more of a fractal nature it's like well let's create a group of people who are doing community management and i give them inside information like oh hey here's the blog post that socket's going to publish while it's in a google doc like what do you guys think they go in and edit it for us you know and they would for them they're getting inside information for us they're editing our blog posts and giving us important feedback and you know and and then they they would feel like they're in the know and they could be good community management 24 7. so we had a group of like fit uh by the end of it we had a group of about 50 people that were kind of like on the inside you know coastal and taylor from my ether wall my crypto and my ether wallet now and uh yeah and so like we just you know slock it had such a sexy product it was the dao it was the first dao and we were going to build a universal sharing network uh which i helped develop a lot of the ideas around you know and it was like this idea that we could build a network where autonomous entities or anybody could actually post uh requests for f uh you know for buying and selling things or sharing things renting things and it was kind of like craigslist for anything everywhere and uh it was going to be so cool you could just go to a locker outside of someone's house or maybe on a corner that a few people would rent and it'd have a lock that you'd send ethereum to by some ethereum currency and and then the lock would maybe you'd send like maybe there's a power drill in it and there's a lock the lock requests fifty dollars right so you send fifty dollars to the lock and then you get the power drill and then you actually bring the power drill back to some dude who sits on his porch you know hanging out these times and he checks to make sure it's okay puts it back in the in the locker he gets a dollar and you get you know 47 dollars back you paid two dollars to use the drill and and then in this way we can have a sharing economy and we can better utilize scarce resources and right and like manage things and to the point where maybe you have a drone that comes and opens the lock for you you know and the the drone collects money and the drone becomes its own autonomous economic agent and maybe it's owned by a drone dow and people invest in the drone down the drones are going around providing value in fact we had a hackathon in 2015 i think it was the end of 2015 where with this idea and the person who won it created a solar panel that would charge phones right and then it would collect money and when it had collected enough money it would put up an ad on the universal sharing network that would say hey connect another solar panel and then it would check its voltage to see if the solar panel is working and on there and then when the volt when that's correct the solar panel could would release the escrow and the person who added the solar panel will get paid they could add batteries and solar panels and and it would just charge things and they and then you know eventually the solar panel would grow and grow until all of humanity is just working on the solar panel and gets to see the light when the solar panel has a need you know no but uh this is dystopian this is the the part of the ethereum culture that i actually kind of miss um i i came into 20 into theorem 2017 and a lot um by that time like icos had already been like decently tainted but a lot of like the models for icos were crazy stuff like that where like we can have just these global networks we can put cryptocurrency inside of drones and they can deliver goods if you need a drill you can just go find the nearest drill and borrow it rather than going and buying another one and then having that be a private good rather than a public good and then like it really got people's like imaginations going with like what happens when we have like these global networks that also have money involved with them like i actually kind of really missed that era about ethereum again sadly like a lot of these crazy futuristic ideas about what ethereum could do ended up being turning into like a white paper and an ico and then a failure of an actual product to launch but i really miss that because you don't really see these crazy ideological like use cases like what you just discussed in ethereum land anymore i i kind of miss that and i feel like the dow caused a lot of those problems unfortunately you know like because the dow wasn't an ico the dow was a huge raise right we raised 150 million dollars which was way more than we intended and uh like like we thought well christopher christoph thought it was going to be five to ten i thought it would be like 30 but obviously 150 was a lot more than all of that and uh and then when we had the hack there was over 200 million dollars in it at the time because ether had gone up so much right and and then everyone used that as an excuse to do icos because dolls aren't safe you know slock it didn't get any money we raised 150 million dollars and we didn't get anything we were then going to have to request money from the dow to do the universal sharing network and it was really hard there were lots of problems with that what was the relationship between slocate and the dow slockett was a service provider okay so we worked like you know for free basically to develop the dow and then we were going to ask funding from it and the dow was going to be like a sort of a collective organization that would fund various projects not just ours so the idea was that like schlocket would build the code for the dow and then once the dow was up and running you would ask for like hey because we helped build this thing can you guys pay us not not retroactively we actually wanted to build the so the dao served as our governing body so we wanted to be an international the universal sharing network we wanted to be like you know and not part of any nation state right we want to be governed by the by property of the dow okay yeah and so we wanted the dow to be we were choosing the dao as our jurisdiction which lived on the ethereum blockchain as the main jurisdiction and not in any specific jurisdiction because what if someone puts weed in the locker you know you know oh god forbid you know and then what are we supposed to do and so we just kind of circumvent this and of course now legal thought is very different but to circumvent this we thought oh let's just create a dao and everyone wants a dao anyway and actually at the time it was always called people a lot of people were calling it d-a-o but i'm a big fan of the daodejing and i pushed really hard to frame it as the dao you know and called dao's downs which i feel like very successful at now everyone is just a doubt right you were the reason why we went from d.a.o to to dao i definitely made a huge push huge push at the time it was kind of there were people doing both right uh and and even the dacs were also acceptable terminology so then i pushed and i think the dow because of its success became oh it's doused right right uh and because i was pushing hard and i you know had some fights not fights but discussions with stefan and and uh kristoff about this to get it to be down but i was like the doubt aching man we we got it we got it through and we'll we'll put a pin in that uh but i won't i do want to say one other little thing on that though because the dow was not supposed to be its name it was supposed to vote on its name once it had good governance so i did not know that yeah it was a placeholder name because the dow should name itself right but it probably wouldn't have worked out it probably would have always been the tao okay wait so i wouldn't actually like go into the story intentionally so when was the first time like the dow came into your into your brain like when did you first run into the dao or the concept of it when we were diving into the universal sharing network we needed it we needed a solution for the jurisdiction and we kind of always thought that we would have a dow but we didn't know exactly how to play it at first it was going to be the socket dao and we were going to have our own entity there and then it was better we figured oh it'd be better if the dao was a separate entity and we were a service provider working for the dow and now pays us and that was that was so it came from slokket like we early on i i don't know if the plan was always to have the dow but it it didn't come in my radar for after until working for them for like a couple months okay so who whose idea was the dao probably christoph yance and like he's probably the main brain behind it okay and so he was the guy that like just triggered it triggered the idea to be in other people's brains as well and eventually people were like okay let's do this how did that story happen do you know well yeah i mean at the time dao's were a major use case of ethereum that was always like that was that was ethereum is a place where you could build taos you know and and so the the idea was there uh but also dallas were very very different from what we consider dallas to be now right because right now dowser like uh a token gated discord and like snapshot vote what did people consider dao's to be back then yeah you know i i think people thought of dao's more focused on having their own economy a little bit you know that would be their own their own token system and a way to collectively govern things and what i don't think it's changed so much but uh i feel like it was less focused on core as a corporate entity and more focused on an economic entity at the time right people i think like i actually think back to like decentralized uber where like uber but as code on ethereum that's a dow decentralized airbnb like that's a dow uh that that's kind of like again like a decentralized drone network that delivers goods if it's if it's operated by like smart contracts on ethereum that drone network is a dow uh that's kind of how i i remember it way back when yeah i mean i feel like there was just like you know there wasn't as much there weren't doubts so it was kind of like a lot of people saying everything could be a dow or this could be a dollar that could be a dollar so it was very dispersed but you know the idea behind the dao was like all right there's going to be all these other littler dows but what if we had like a dow that managed the daos and that yeah that was the idea that became like the dao yeah part of the the dao and one of the names of the dao that was going to come up was called the genesis down because the idea was the dao could break into lots of smaller doubts it would naturally do that because anyone who disagreed with the dow vote could take their money and make a child down and then this so if people if like a proposal to come out for uh some like decentralized uber uh or golem golem was going to propose to the dao and people voted no like the mass voted no people that voted yes could just make a child down and split and take their funds and make a golem a dow you know a golem dao that would be separate but a child out of the dao right where people would burn their dow tokens for the ether that's in the dow and then it would go into this sub down they would do golem and so it was kind of this way that we would just like make here's the self-replicating dow contract where everyone just proposes to the dao if they get it they're part of the big club if they don't then they probably just create their own sub-dial and really anyone could start a startup in the dao ecosystem were people talking about conversations as the dao as like a new government or like a new like large organization yeah yeah that's uh that's that's the direction that i still believe dallas will take i actually saw a tweet by my my one of my heroes michael sargon uh that was like i wonder if dao's will if if dowse to court will be what uh uh corporation will be to corporations as democracies were to monarchies and then i feel like well actually doubts will be to democracies what democracies will be to demo to monarchies and i really i really do believe that it's i feel like we have this opportunity to like change the way we coordinate around you know things that governments do which is provide public goods you know i don't even understand why we have to pay taxes that that whole idea is broken to me if a government is creating value they should just be rewarded for that value we shouldn't need taxes we shouldn't need sacrifice through nonprofits we should be able to create economic models that reward value creation when it's happening if people really believe that there's value being created and and i feel like we're at the precipice of that we're so close right so when the the dow happened and people were like you know aping in it was like one of the first big apes on ethereum were people understanding that kind of like prospect of what the dao was or yeah that was like oh this could be like the new like global order i don't know about global order but for the most part it was like there was high vibes super high vibes in the community a lot of interest and it was it felt like a risk-free investment i mean in the end it collected 14 of all ether in existence right right so 14 of the you know all ether ended up in the dow because it was like well if it doesn't work out i can split the dow and get my ether back so it's like i can be part of this super cool club at almost no risk were there were there people talking about like uh uh were there exploits or hacks or bugs at this point in ethereum or where like the contracts was like not sophisticated enough there was there there were there were of course small bugs and and things but not things of there was never anything near the scale right all that was there was the ethereum multisig that's the only thing repeated contract that had a lot of value behind it it's nothing there's nothing else right so like no one really thought about like oh if i put my money in this contract it could get exploited that wasn't like a thought that people had solidity was eight months old [Laughter] so no no there was we started the whole smart contract auditing like idea yeah we actually got an audit but it was from a normal tech company that said hey yeah there might be rounding errors you know that's like that was all we got so there was no there were no smart contract otters they didn't exist we were buddy buddy with all the people who wrote solidity you know left terrace and kristoff were major parts of that and uh who are our lead devs and then uh you know christian wright wiesner like we talked to him all the time and he he invented solidity don't listen to gavin wood christian wright wiesner invented solidity and uh and was maintaining it so the everyone the vitalik reviewed our code you know it doesn't get better than that right so yeah yeah but there and and the dow hack was not a simple thing right it was very complex right the dow hack contracts were larger than the dow contracts it was multiple contracts that are exchanging money between each other and exploiting this weird little bug that's in a subcontract over here really complicated stuff so it's hard to spy yeah so it was completely unprecedented not only it was there were two unprecedented things the dow receiving a ton of money and then like people actually learning like oh these things can be exploited in ways that we had no idea i mean people knew it could be exploited but the the ways were not known right you know and that and that was actually what happened when we raised so much money the dow curators the subgroup of the dow that would allow people you had to propose to the curators and get white listed before you could propose to the dao they actually said like moratorium uh it's too big to fail we have to we can't let anyone propose to the dow until we talk about this a little bit more right and then uh but you could still split the dow which is where the bug was right so uh people would split so so the bug was basically oh i'm going to split the down which is like the equivalent of rage quitting these days and you split the dow and effectively you say oh yeah here's my dow tokens to burn okay give me the ether ah just kidding right okay here's my dow tokens to burn give me the ether i'm just kidding it's like putting the quarter down a vending machine with a string tied around the string pulling it back back pulling it back uh pulling it back 40 times in a transaction and then the transaction just fails but you end up with all the ether and so uh but then so the hacker did it and stole about four percent of all ethernet sorry do you want to set that up better yeah like i actually i just kind of want to go through the progression a little bit uh do were you watching like when the dow got minted where where were where were you when that happened yeah one i mean i was i was in i was in seattle i think uh right when we launched the the the token generation event token generation inventory is that what they called it i think we called it the i think we called it token creation i think we called it the token creation event um but and again why why did you guys do it because it wasn't just because you you wanted the dow to function with slack it right it was it was more like what was the motivation behind the dow was it just about like an experiment or like the vision or what what's up we we were excited for dows on ethereum we were excited for to play with these experimental tools for sure i mean the did you have a plan and did you have a plan like okay now that the dial is minted like here's the next steps or like that was the oh yeah yeah oh yeah i mean our first steps were to to okay launch the dow and then propose the universal sharing network to the deck right okay best best laid plans but but it wasn't about like all right like i'm gonna be the leader of the dow the the metaphorical ceo okay it was just just not mint the dow and then have slacked be a part of it our whole legal strategy was that we were not the dow okay and kristoff didn't have any doubt tokens right and no one really no one else on the team had dow tokens either right right yeah in known wallets yeah yeah exactly right uh i i mean i did i was i wasn't worried about these things i was kind of irreverent to that but uh but yeah so we we we intended the dow to be a pure down and that was definitely the idealistic like motivation but at the same time we had a business model that could back it up right right and so the the idea was like to basically give the gift of the dow to the broader ethereum community it's like hey here's this thing we made you guys go build it also yeah here's lock it yeah exactly okay here here's this thing we made and we built the community right i mean we had one of the largest slacks in crypto by far everything was on slack at that time yeah everyone has moved away from that yeah yeah oh for a while it was chaos there was people using riot there are people using everything you key base and then now we've all settled back on discord it feels feels good to be all in the same time uh but anyway so so you guys meant the dow some money starts coming in how fast did money start coming in oh man a bunch of money came in the first few days and then it was like a slow trickle until the last so there was a 28 day period and the first 14 days were uh supposed to be like one ether for 100 dow tokens and and they were but then there was actually a miscalculation on an off by one error and the 15th day also had the price of one dow token for one for or sorry uh one ether for 100 tokens and so it was almost like oh you get an extra day of cheap dow tokens which was a huge was it a bonding curve or something how did the price change it was the step curve yeah and so then uh and that's why we had it off by one error because it's like okay and then it'll step to uh point 1.05 ether for 100 tokens 1.1 ether but the first step was just to one ether it was like oh damn it we didn't totally miss that and then uh in the code you know uh and so we just basically there was this extra day where dow tokens were cheap which just allowed way a bunch of extra fomo and i think we raised somewhere around you know 100 million dollars at that point you know uh in that first round and then the next 50 million dollars over the next 15 to 15 days where it was stepping up uh yeah and then we had a 150 million dollars in the dow and right before the end you know did you like your pants i was stoked i was having a blast i didn't do that i i'm not a developer you know left terrace and kristoff were  their pants okay kristoff actually physically vomited oh my god there's a hundred million dollars in the down he was at a dinner and he had to leave the table and he went and puked because he was so nervous about the code you know i mean a hundred million dollars in code where the language is eight months old you know and he wrote it you know and it's like him and left terrace wrote this left terrace was a little bit more chill about it kristoff was you know sweating bullets right and i was having a great time like all the community the vibes were so high you know like yeah we're all high-fiving digital high-fives you know it's like this is insane this is going to be huge but then at the very end there was uh you know the cura their vlad zamfir even goon sareer avalanche now and this guy dino marks came out this thing called the moratorium and it was like hey like we is too the dao is too big to fail basically uh we have to like like stop and rethink things the design could have these improvements and maybe since there's 14 of all ethernet existence and we plan on doing proof of stake later we should just like you know try to figure out how to upgrade the dow and make some improvements to it before we go and so that's what slaka was spending most of their time on like mitigating this thing and being like hey like our first proposal was hey let's like increase the security of the dow let's have 24 7 surveillance and and and like uh do better audits and all this stuff and uh we were trying to get whitelisted to you know collect some funding to do that and uh that's when i found out it's actually really hard to get money out of a dow uh you have to you have to design the dow so it's easier to get money out of them because people don't want to spend their money on things it's really easy just to say no to spending money right so collectively collectively never pay exactly right and that's that's like the collective like yes of course but uh you know spending money on security i don't know right and and i mean there's nothing that that proposal would have done anyway though because maybe two weeks after the dow was launched and had a lot of money in it and we're like scrambling to figure out how to deal with this moratorium uh there was a revision to the docks of solidity that was like oh yeah we have this call function before all these lines of code ah there's a reentrancy bug we need to put the call function after all the lines of uh of of code and so and then we had chris and we're like oh crap you know we don't do that in our in our code base so went went to christian and went to other people and like is this going to cause any problems and lots of people looked down they're like no no no we've made this blog post that was like hey there's a bug but the doll is safe oh god oh god uh stefan really got it for that one man do you think do you think that was the post that alerted that would be the future attacker to the fact that there was an exploit there yeah probably could have been i mean who knows uh who knows because no one knows who the dow hacker is although there are rumors of course of various people that it could be but no one knows for sure and i don't think anyone will unless the person actually says yeah it was me because you know it's it's a hard thing to prove different rumors have it like oh well this wallet was associated to this poloniex account and it looks like somehow eventually it paid the gas here so maybe it's connected to this person or that person but it's like well maybe they just sold crypto to some random dude right right so it's hard to say and do you think the the dow hacker was a member of the dao probably they had to be because they had to have dow tokens so i mean they could have bought it they could have bought it in the exchange though i mean i'm the thing is everyone was a member of the dao there was ethereum was the dao at that right if you didn't weren't you you you didn't hold ethereum off in exchange you know like and ethereum and the dow were like almost anonymous absolutely i mean our dial curator list was like the ethereum foundation you know it was like oh the who's who because christoph jens was like you know he was a the core tester for all the clients so you'd make sure that the clients were in sync for all the launches up into that point before he starts lock it with his brother and and brought in stuff and stefan used to be the community manager for ethereum and it was like this is this was the core you know a huge heart and soul of ethereum was slocus so right and the ethereum was all about like coordination technologies right so it seems to be like all right like now that we have this ethereum thing let's do the coordination thing so it seems like from the perspective of the early days of ethereum it's like all right like we just now we make a down now that's what we do like we made we made the blockchain now we make the dow of course yeah yeah exactly the ethereum blockchain was for dallas it was for coordination so that was the thing how can you not and it's a risk-free investment right what can go wrong yeah what could go wrong when uh after the dow started collecting like way more money than it was ever expected did like the game plan change or like what changed as a result of that what changed is the expectations of being able to get a decent chunk of change from the dow i mean we were looking for just a small amount of money to get started as a startup but crypto numbers are just audacious is what we discovered so um i mean i flew to germany i had never met most of the socket team at that point and i flew flew to germany well i flew first i flew to london to be with stefan for a week and then went to midvida this small town where christoph yentz and his seven kids and like stuff and his brother with his with 11 kids you know like this time this yeah it was a while it was fun having dinner with the families you know uh and that's where i was when the dow hack happened it was like at christoph's mom's house um you know and uh so how did that notification come into your brain how did you hear that the dao was getting something something was up with the dow well a community member was sending links because we were in uh in in europe so i woke up at like don't know 6 30 in the morning or something and uh but people in the us were already awake and they had seen something on either skin and they're like hey is there a bug on etherscan and there's this guy mo and he sent me that link and i was like looking at him like oh oh i don't think this is a bug on ether scan because it's on mist as well you know i missed it was the ethereum wallet at the time i remember it i remember that and so then i send that i i'm like yo kristoff i'm like demon dialing everyone until i get a hold of uh christoph's brother simon who's a founder of ethereum as well he's the only he was the first person other person to wake up and like you gotta get a hold of kristoff and everyone else you know and we're i mean we're alerting everybody that we can uh to look at this because it was it was at least yeah i mean i basically got to sound the alarm right that it was real and then what did you think was happening did you just like oh somebody is stealing money from the dell or like what what did you what would you did you suspect i mean because we could we could see it it was like a split the split functions were being called so it's like okay this i don't know exactly what's happening but you know at first it was like is someone splitting the dow with that much money right but then it was every every other block this function was being called so it was like oh no this is just weird with the same person and so we could yeah we knew pretty quickly it was a hack i mean minutes right so like what when there was no hacks before the dow how did you guys even know what to do like what was the what was the game plan asked metallic i mean that was the thing we didn't know what to do but we knew we had to say i i mean i knew we had to say something to the community so uh but we can't just say something like hey we're hacked we're you know we have to give them something to do something they can do to help so the idea was that we could slow down the network we could spam the network as a community and slow down the hacker while we look at other strategies so i wrote this like little post in the slack it's like at everyone this is not a drill the dow is being attacked uh here's what you can do to help us slow down the attacker all the all the geniuses in ethereum are on this right now looking at the looking at it seeing what we can do and and then now go and probably within an hour or two after i made that post vitalik was already talking about a hard fork being the best solution he figures it out like that yeah yeah totally it was like yeah i mean in the end you know vitalik is the shelling point right metallic is the decider and it's like well if he is on board that's a then that's what we're going to do and and it was the only solution i mean before the hack was even over that that was the plan uh basically or that was the the the strongest opinion and then it was like well what else can we do because hard forks at the time hard forks were unheard of right unheard of no one does that yeah well they're still there right yeah oh well so well ethereum had it had it hard forked yet uh i mean it had it had upgraded to uh from from homestead to like from frontier to homestead okay right so it had it had had its first like upgraded planned hard fork but you're saying this is like gonna be the first unplanned like contentious hard fork this is a contentious hard fork this is like hey let's make an irregular state transition and hack the hacker hard fork right and and and what made that possible was that when the dow is split the money goes into a child dial which then has its own creation phase where uh it can raise money from other dow token holders for 28 days and so and then and then from those 28 days the money would then be released and then the person would have to call a split out function to move it to another place another address and that would take five sorry that would take seven days so there was 35 days where the money was guaranteed to be in this one address that is such a crazy property of this story because uh you know basically the way that that works is that if you wanted to exit your money from the dow you had to have a 28 day waiting period which saved the whole entire operation the fact that that was true saved perhaps all of ethereum honestly yeah like there's a potential world where like without that property about the dow like the dow hack would have been successful and correct me if i'm wrong but like you we wouldn't have been able to hard fork ethereum if the ether got out of the dow got out of the contracts and then intermingled with the rest of the economy because you can't hard fork away at that point in time yeah because then they send it to exchanges they send it to different things they're getting away without their anymore and we don't want to take from other people we want to hack the hacker and it's not even for saving the dow and the dow token holders hey they were investing in something that was risky right whether they knew it or not it was the truth so it's about hey we're going to go to proof of stake this guy clearly has ill intent for the community do we want someone with with ill intent to hold four percent of all either in existence you know right because he only stole a third of it actually that the my so then i i split up split off with uh other down ninjas basically to form the first it was the robin hood group and we stole the rest of the money so dow hacker took 50 million dollars we took 100 million dollars right and we're we hacked the rest of the dallas so no one else could actually we strategically waited until someone else started hacking the dow but we had already been playing like war games and had amassed massive capital so that every one transaction that we have to dial with we have so many dow tokens that it's not a quarter it's like a stack of thousand dollar bills you know that we're sticking into the coin machine and pulling out with the string you know while everyone else is using quarters so we just you know we just dominated the the dow wars right it was it was like you guys were hacking the money first because you guys were the white hats right yeah and we had all the money right so we actually waited till someone else we we made sure that we hacked second um for two reasons one was kind of like legal like you know like oh we're we're not choosing to hack the doubt we're doing it on necessity to protect right and then the other reason was honestly i i wanted it to be messy you know like if the if the dow uh hack was simple then maybe the hard fork doesn't happen because oh it's just this address there's lots of solutions right but then when it's like oh there's like and there ended up being about 10 dow hackers right so that's messy there's lots of money all over the place and and in the end we we were able to hack all of the small there were major dow wars it was crazy man like it was like and it was almost like the matrix at the time you know where you're looking at the blockchain and like waiting for watching the ones and zeros yeah yeah and you're like the byte code and it's like okay go go go go go you know and and then it was it was insane man those are insane times and what an experience yeah we ended up being able to hack all of the small other hackers we there was this other money aside that was called the extra balance and we were able to request the extra balance into the dow and then make a proposal to actually spend that money into and to buy dow tokens in all the sub dials besides the big one to give us 51 percent majority in all of the white house 51 majority and all the other child dials that had hacked the dao and then uh take over their dolls and take the money out of them god and yeah it was it was it was nuts but we we uh you know right before the hard fork we we actually also bought dow tokens in the dark down and but then the hard fork happened and we thought well the hard work happened you know ether worked like we knew etc would exist but we thought it had no value why would it ever have value because you know like everyone who has ether has etc right they would just dump it no one cares about etc and then then we started hearing these rumors and like and so we could have kept taking actions to actually stop the dark dow uh on the etc chain and do like this kind of um basically a game of stalemate where we threaten to hack the the the dark dow so he can never make a proposal to pull money out he always has to keep splitting into a child down into a child down into a child now and we just try to each hack the child dials continuously you just greet each other you just grieve them until the end of time yeah every 35 days and that was the biggest argument for why we had to hard fork because otherwise every 35 days we would have to hack the dark dow to you know stop them from pulling out the money so we just every 35 days there would be dow wars like okay you'd mark it on the calendar and that's that was going to be our job you know for the rest so we had to yeah i mean you think there's enough spam on the ethereum network already you know so so so it was a clear argument had the hard fork but then after the hard fork we thought ethereum classic was dead so we didn't end up you know executing the plans that we need to execute to stop the dark dial from splitting and so they the dark dial had already split but uh by the time we we found out ether classic was going to be a thing like people started there was like this undercurrent of like um people trying to buy ether classic tokens from large ethereum holders for a penny uh all over the place right and uh it turns out that was probably someone related to barry silbert who runs the dcg because barry silbert was like the biggest ethereum classic maxi that ever existed and he also owned a large part of poloniex and so polonius went you know after a while polonius listed ether classic as on their exchange and you know uh and and barry silbert's making these tweets like i will never hold the uh etc is the only altcoin that i will ever hold you know and so all these bitcoin maxis ended up rallying around this idea that you know ether classic is a way to destroy ethereum right enemy of my enemy is my friend yeah yeah in in that like well and also this like uh social approach so this is another thing that happened right after the dial hack everything was pretty chill in the dow slack but three days after the dow hack there was a mass flood of like internet trolls and we couldn't control the community anymore it was a social attack and we found out later that it was likely this group from bitcoin that was called um the dragon's den which was like uh this under underground like troll army that would be unleashed on different projects when and and of course we were targeted after the hack as a as a you know a way to fight you know to promote bitcoin maximism probably by block stream which is probably why i have something against blockchain but so so uh that that was i felt like this etc is like kind of a continuation of this like how the this opportunity from bitcoin maxis to use the dow as a way to destroy ethereum and to use etc as a way to like basically undercut the legitimacy of ethereum saying like hey you know immutability is important like etc is the is the real ethereum and and all that that whole story so when the hard fork was everyone it seemed that everyone just fell in line with the hard fork idea when how when how was the hard fork actually scheduled was it scheduled for just like the day before the hacker was able to get their money out like when did the heart forecast two days two days two days before yeah yeah just just like like 32 days yeah 33 days after the after the hard after the hack and then how did the dow actually like unwind after that what what the it was a state transition and so the what what state did it change and how did that change the properties of the dao and then how how did the dao progress forward after that so that yeah it was a an irregular state transition is a technical term a lot of people think it was like a rollback like the down never happened but if you go on the blockchain all those things happen it was just on this block i think it was like 1 million 900 020 twenty thousand right uh there was this irregular state transition that basically any uh any contract that matched the byte code of the dow uh all of the funds that were in it were taken and then uh given and put in this withdrawal contract so all of the child dows which there were well over 70 uh child dows split dows that had money in it and the dark down and all the white hat dials and the dao itself which had like just a few ways of ether right all of that was taken and put into the the withdrawal contract and anyone with dow tokens could then withdraw their their money from the withdrawal contract but it's not that clean that's the thing so uh i was i basically self-appointed myself to take the cleanup mission right because there are all sorts of edge cases the people who had those the child dow money right they didn't have dow tokens they had child dow tokens so they couldn't get their money out of the dow they had to get their money out of this you know out of their own down and so they could go to etc and run some dow transactions make a proposal get the etc out that they split but they couldn't get the ether so we had to make a small contract for every dow child dow so they could get ether and basically there was a clawback function in the in the withdrawal contract and me vitalik and vlad zamfir and a few other people i think six other people were on the the new curator multisig which then could claw back money from the dow contract uh and make sure that uh but just money that uh there were no dow tokens for right right uh so and then and so that was a process of just human verification and that's why it needed to be a multi-sig yeah yeah like okay so if there's no dow tokens to claim the money that's sent to this contract that's in this contract then that money would be stuck so there must be somebodies so then this multi-sig has to can figure out all the edge cases and the other edge case was the people that put uh money into that last half of the dow rays so then those people would uh they they paid more than one ether for every hundred dow tokens so there's the extra balance people but they actually had a token that they could use then to claim money so nick johnson who does ens boki puba and and then us we we made sure that there was a um we audited an extra balance withdrawal contract and actually one you know funny story uh i don't know if no alexi from turbo geth he was uh he was one of the biggest trolls during the dow diet days biggest trolls and i i hated this guy but i hugged him you know but i hated him uh for sure and then he uh he didn't you know he ended up splitting the dow i got i made i had a lot of respect for him when i found out that he was trolling the dow he was pissed at the way the doubt was organized and structured and then he he walked the walk he actually split his money from the dial way before the hack but then he didn't get the dow money out of his foot dial in time so then his money was taken with the rest of the child downs and then he stepped it up and saved the day for everyone he was like our number one dev in this like uh edge case scenario and eventually went from being like the most hated troll at least from slokken and the crew because he's always really smart and really making it hard talking a lot you know when smart people talk a lot of it's haunted and so so then he he ended up being like our biggest ally in making all the contracts and doing really making really smart um solutions for a lot of these problems that we were having of how do we give my people the money back and was there and there was there was still money in that contract or did all of the ether got claimed no there's so much money dude there's hundreds of millions of dollars that's still unclean from the dow although now dow tokens are have newest numismatic value right so actually numismatic like like an old coin you know okay yeah i'm sure for sure like again yeah it's an artifact that is backed by ether but there's a there's a dow museum that actually uh has a unit of kind of a fork of unit swap i mean it uses unit swap but a fork at the front end because the dow token wasn't an erc20 token so it has like it doesn't work well with unit swap but it uh it has enough stuff to use the unit swap if you change the front end and and the stuff so he made like a down museum and an actual market price for dow tokens is like well over twice what they're worth if you go and try to actually claim the ether wow i didn't know that dao tokens actually had a market value uh but yeah it's probably because it's off the radar due to the uncompliant erc20 token standard that has yeah and and side tokens too you know so the old die i think that's going to have numismatic value is sure i didn't sell anything oh yeah no i i i still have seven psi oh yeah baby yeah that stuck size the only thing i'm as bullish on as ether nice yeah i do i think that's a good that's a good call and and like for dow tokens i needed dow tokens because uh they would eventually i would need to pass votes in the debt people would send dow tokens to the dao you know and and then but we could try to get them out and then like refund their money you know and so for two years i was cleaning up all the mistakes people were making in the withdrawal process and making sure that like people could get their money back well mostly through giveth and the give us slack and and helping out there so uh zooming all the way out what did you learn oh from the dow i mean well smart contract development is pretty serious business always cap you know uh now i'm working in this token engineering commons right and token engineering is is a really nascent field of study and there's a lot of lessons from the dow in that kind of thing it's like controlling the configuration space right like what is possible with your system make sure you know and can test what is possible like you saw the fey uh explosion right where they raised a billion dollars but then you know that made their governance token you know one of the top tokens in crypto for a brand new project like come on and then instant dump and just destruction of the peg and everything went out of control if they would have just controlled the configuration space they wouldn't have that issue like they i'm sure they tested to raise you know a hundred million dollars or something uh but they didn't test to raise a billion so right uh these these sorts of things also you know the biggest lesson was immutability is a cultural like idea and concept at that time everyone thought immutability was a natural right principle of blockchain like it's a technical property yeah but no it's a cultural value and uh in the end like it's it's one that's held dearly but not as dearly as others right so the community rules all in crypto and that's why we call it the layer zero podcast and because it's people all the way down and so when we talk about immutability as like a cultural icon i always start these shows off by saying cypherpunks know that the code they write creates social systems um is because it's well the buck stops at the humans that run the code so it's really important to talk to the humans that run the code and economics is a social science it's not a hard science this is this this is this is just the reality of things and i feel like uh and this is one of the things we're doing with the token engineering commons too it's like you know we gotta we gotta make sure we have conflict resolution we have to make sure that we have like good community building because that is what this is all about we're building communities that have an economic underpinning but we're building communities so how what do communities need well griff this was a fantastic story and i think this is a great place to end it but you also want to tell the listeners a little bit about more in detail about what you're up to with uh with giveth and and all that action going on over there and also just where people can find you on twitter and stuff like that sure yeah uh i mean man there's a lot of stories you know there's a party multi-sig hack that the white hat group did uh like let me just give like the next like four years yeah really quick yeah because you know that was true sounds like we're gonna have to do this again yeah i mean there was a year later well we started the dow we made a mini me contract we we did a bunch of like white hat actions for different icos that failed and then there was the big one which was the parody multisig hack where we rescued 210 million dollars and like scared the hell out of the ethereum foundation for a little bit but they um and then and then gave it all back to everybody and and then there was the next rarity multisig hack where they they just froze all their money and and then you know there's a lot of efforts to support uh open source block explorers and scaling solutions that were all done through giveth and giveth has been a fixture of the ethereum community for a long time especially in 2018 because we've been running off of donation since the beginning uh it was basically the white hat group started giveth after the dow and it was the place where people went to claim their dow tokens and understand like all the basically customer support for the dow and then also also like a charity platform and the idea of giveth and and what i've been working on to this day since the dow is really focused on how do we replace or how do we build a third way to fund public goods right now we have governments and nonprofits nonprofits rely on sacrifice and donations and it's just poor poor a poor incentive structure to say the least right and governments rely on taxes which effectively is sacrifice in in the use of force and they have a monopoly every over every public goods vertical when a bureaucrat collects their salary you know they get it whether they make good decisions or bad decisions there's no it's another poorly designed incentive layer right we can do better and the problem with public goods and the value that governments and non-profits provide is that they're providing non-excludable value there's no customers there's no way to create a business model but you can create an economic model and cryptocurrencies have done this all for for for a decade you know uh bitcoin is basically an open global payment system anyone in the world can create a bitcoin address and receive currency from peer-to-peer there's no cost don't get me wrong there's also like to send currency you have to pay a little bit and stuff but this is a public good anyone can create an ethereum that can create a bitcoin address or an ethereum address and there's no there's no uh cost to that and there's no it's it's non-excludable anyone can do it and it's non-rivalrous it's public good and it's funded through economic means we're printing money to fund the create the development of the network and so i think that we can take that into meat space and give its approach is to start with the non-profits these are the communities that are really doing it so we have to educate them they're the ones creating public goods in a in a bottom-up bottom-up way and so let's cherish them let's make it easy for them to raise money in crypto so with giveth we you can just go on if you have a favorite non-profit they log in with their google account and they collect uh they get an ethereum address and then they can start raising money like they would on kickstarter or or indiegogo or gofundme same same process with one difference they use ethereum you know that's it and then uh our goal is to then like hey once they've raised a thousand dollars say hey did you know google can steal your money maybe you should download metamask right just like one step and then we create a slippery slope and we're about to launch a give token the give token which will be used for governance over the platform and the idea is that every time you donate to one of these projects you'll actually earn give tokens in return so and it but it's not earned like you can it's more like a tax-deductible donation you still donate and you'll just get reimbursed a little bit of your donation into this governance token which then allows you to have uh you know governance rights over the platform we'll use a conviction voting and gardens which is a really cool thing that i probably don't have time to go into uh but then that will govern the give economy and uh but also you'll be able to use the give tokens eventually to stake behind these projects and so you lock your give tokens behind a project then they will get more give backs their donors all when someone donates to a give project on give it all the money goes to the charity all of it there's no like we don't take a cut but then we also give give tokens for the next five years we will be giving away a million give tokens every two weeks to donors on the platform and uh if up to 75 of the donation so it's always a donation you're not you're always losing money when you donate that's that's still true but we're going to reimburse us up to 75 of it and then with those tokens they can stake behind projects and the projects that have more give tokens staked and locked for longer time will end up getting the donors will get more give tokens than projects that don't have any give tokens everyone will get give backs who donates to verified projects but uh the staking will allocate more give backs to different projects so we have this curation mechanism the goal of giveth and this ecosystem is to replace the government service the 501c3 government service with an economy right and so the but the real dream is that when there's enough give tokens staked behind one of these projects we will actually use those tokens to initialize a bonding curve which i'm not going to go into so much but it's super cool because you can create a micro economy with this bonding curve where you can have accurate price discovery for low liquidity markets and but anyway you end up with uh printing money for this charity you just give them free tokens and then the people who were staking gift tokens they also get a bunch of tokens everyone makes money because of magic internet money sorry but it's true and uh they may all make money on paper all those tokens have to be vested so they don't like have a run on the bonding curve but then this project who maybe they started out they didn't know anything about ethereum they just logged in with google but as they advanced in their education and in their success in the give give system they eventually end up with their own economy and with their own economy they can start rewarding themselves and their community for the value that they're being created and they can be rewarded and invested into right if you every time a project with a bonding curve we'll end up with uh with with a donation the donation still goes 100 to the charity but the give backs will go into the bonding curve create project tokens increasing the price of the project token and then those project tokens will go to the donor the donor effectively becomes partially invested in the future economy of this ecosystem and people could just come in and speculate on the future donations of this charity and they could just buy and invest in that economy and have an upside by supporting this charity because now there's a bonding curve there's an economy behind it and so and this has always been the dream of giveth was to somehow create this system where non-profits come in and they educate and skill up and eventually end up with their own economy and so now we have that roadmap in place and we're just about to execute it super excited about that that's awesome it sounds like what it is is like a flywheel in a box it's like yeah hey bring your bring your non-profit like we are your flywheel just plug in this flywheel and here you go yeah total no totally and and here's the you know it might take years for you to get you know educated enough to be able to hold your own keys and and understand that people don't have to sacrifice to support you as a non-profit like there's a lot of like relearning like your labor has value that idea is like the hardest part of this whole process just like real just like getting people to appreciate the value that they're they're creating by you know their nonprofit work uh but so that's the that's the giveth approach and that's like the kind of indirect let's like slippery slope nonprofits into economies but then there's the direct like let's just build public goods focused economies and that's the common stack approach so we have our pilot project with the token engineering commons and this is will be the first public goods focused economy that's like explicit this is what we're doing and this is all we're doing and the goal is to create micro economies to compete to provide public services so instead of having a government with monopoly over every public goods vertical we create a repeatable pattern where anyone can effectively create a public good startup they can receive investment and basically follow the normal venture capital model but instead of their venture capital model requiring customers their venture capital model is built on an economic system where they are providing public goods as the output but competing with donations for the input so instead of it being like it's more like okay i want to help orphans i want to you know provide i want to support food bank i could donate or i could invest in this economy and get governance rights over how the funds are spent it's way more transparent it's you know i can be part of a community and have upside and this is this is the framing where it's like it's not about creating like a successful business it's about being better than donations and actually that's a very low bar so it doesn't even have to be profitable even if people lose money in this system it's still better than donations right so it's a and and the dream is that you would have these startups startup economies that could actually provide public services and if they're not doing a good job someone else could spin up a startup to compete with them and now instead of having a monopoly over building roads instead of having a monopoly over providing public safety public health public anything you have competing people who care the same people who are working for public services for governments and non-profits the same people that have the same knowledge but now they have a better incentive system they have an aligned they have an opportunity to succeed is it just like putting the power of of competitive markets behind behind non-profits that's pretty much the bridge that's being built here that's the that's exactly the dream free market economies as opposed to free market businesses instead of having the economy that all the businesses are competing in in a free market where you know the federal reserve just decides to change interest rates whenever they want yeah it's a free market you know uh but it's it's the economy so the economy you could start thinking of it as an economy right and these are all other economies but their focus and their intention they're a purpose-driven economy and their purpose is what is exciting for people you know i mean just think about all the people who are get they they get excited about a non-profit cause and they work and they volunteer and they support and eventually they get burned out because they're competent they can go work in the free market and like actually make good money have a nice house have like all the all the joys of society that that when they're working for the non-profit they're like oh man i wish i had like ac right but i can't afford it because i'm like you know helping orphans all day eventually i guess i'll go get a job and sell out what if you could sell what if you didn't have to sell out what if the value that was being created was appreciated what if we had systems that gave a right that's that's the dream and you know i'm probably not going to do it wrong i'm a bit of a i'm probably going to do it wrong i'm a bit of a joker but you know we're pushing and at the very least we're inspiring and well we definitely know that we learn in this industry from experiments everything everything is an experiment until one of the experiments turns into a success and then it's no longer an experiment so grif i i admire your passion and your commitment to public goods and i find that what you are doing is very in line with the community around ethereum at large so thank you for coming on layer zero and telling us your story today yeah thanks man and and if anyone wants to play with that second side there are these uh parameter parties we're doing this collaborative economics thing so go follow te commons on twitter t-e-c-m-n-s and t-e-c we'll put it in the show notes nice yeah and there's these parameter parties it's like you know economies have always been designed by people in the back room don't get me wrong i love ethereum but who voted on a 32 ether right right like but it's just it's not it's not a thing because economies are for smart people to design right but i think that's what monarchies said about democracy right like you know so i think that we can end this economic monarchy idea and actually start allowing for a collaborative design of economies and we're doing that for the first time in the token engineering commons you can design a bonding curve complicated conviction voting thing and we'll and we will everyone can anyone can submit a design and then we can collectively and iteratively fork it and improve it so it'll be super cool and if you want like a real token engineering learning opportunity it's happening right now in the t discord for the next three weeks so super cool opportunity there's your there's your call to action so uh thanks listeners you heard him griff thanks for coming on my man hey thanks thanks for letting me rant of course cheers hey we hope you enjoyed the video
