you've launched a licensing marketplace essentially and i want you guys to really clarify what this is it's being used by coinbase right now coinbase is producing a three-part trilogy they are casting board apes and they are using your licensing marketplace to connect with order holders who want to license their ape to coinbase yeah we partnered with coinbase and the team and their agency invisible north to provide the technology that would allow board ape holders to submit their apes through a casting call and through our technology to be in the film the technology that we provided verifies that they only ate within the wallet that they have and that they get to create a name and a backstory for for their a and then we took those licensing agreements put them on chain and created two different licensing agreements tied to nfts that one goes to the licensee which would be coinbase and one goes to the license or which would be the ape holder that was selected
