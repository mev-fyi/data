all right guys we are back talking about releases today david let's start here the ens airdrop this is the big one maybe airdrop of the year i don't know if that's too much but it feels that way because yeah yeah because if it's like like how many people actually receive this for one but also the market cap of this thing has been absolutely extraordinary we had the ens guys on earlier this week so take a listen to that podcast and and take a look look at that show if you want all of the details but uh what happened here david we this is by the way our alpha alert so anytime a really cool thing happens like this an airdrop or something else we send it out to bankless premium members so they get notified but what was this airdrop what happened this week yeah so this has been a long time coming and no one really knew that the esteem was going to do an airdrop but if you had been paying attention to ens you would understand that the mission and culture and values of ens was to eventually have this thing managed by the community uh and so i remember talking to brantley milligan forever ago when uh they were talking when ens was really getting uh bootstrapped and talking about like oh so ens sells domains in eth but ens does not want to be a company ens wants to be a public utility and the reason why they have to sell domains is because of an anti-sibling mechanism if you don't but if you don't actually have to pay money for these things somebody will just claim all of them so they were selling ens names generating a treasury and now this protocol the name space of ethereum is now this public good and that doesn't that specifically should not be managed by two people or team of people but instead should be managed by the broader a community of people that are stakeholders and so this is just the perfect marriage between what we've all been talking about with dows and tokens and a public utility on ethereum uh so if you have an ens name uh that happened before the snapshot the snapshot wasn't too long ago just a couple weeks ago you can go claim your ens tokens uh there's a hundred million tokens they're currently trading for about 60 60 uh the average airdrop recipient got between like maybe 100 to 300 tokens or so which is a pretty healthy amount uh and there's a few a few formulas with how your uh your token amount was calculated the longer that you've had your ens name the the more tokens you get the longer you've renewed it for the more tokens you get if you've actually registered your ens name to an actual ethereum address you get even double double that all that information is in the state of the nation that we did with the ens team but this is this is really foundational ryan and i actually think that this is even more foundational than uniswap uh because ens is something deeper and closer and more related to ethereum the protocol itself than uniswap is they're both in the app layer but ethereum is really or but ens is really about the namespace of ethereum uh so i think that a lot of people wanted to compare ens to something like godaddy where you can register websites it's even bigger than that it's ens is actually comparison to dns where like the dot coms of the world and that is another uh dns is another global public good that has to be managed by this private company instead ens is now uh being managed by the people that are using it and so the ens dow is now being handed over to everyone that has a dot e eth address so we are all now managers of this open public good system yeah so like something like godaddy is just an app on top of of dns right it's not dns itself and and so reminding folks what this dot eth address is it's basically just a human readable name for you're an ethere your ethereum address and recall an ethereum address okay one model of that is as a bank account so we talk about so often it's just like your self-sovereign bank account but more than a wallet more than a bank account more than a vault it's also your self-sovereign identity and it's becoming more like a passport every every single day so we talked with brantley and nick about the ability to sign on with ethereum i think these addresses are going to become increasingly important to individual identity in this whole web 3 world right so you're storing your nfts you're storing your tokens inside of your uh ether address if i want to send um some etu david or some tokens here an nft to you it's very easy i know you have david hoffman.etha could just do that very easily rather than this like um public public key with all of these like characters um so very cool stuff you know one thing that blew my mind though is the price on this thing yes okay so like i know you know nick and brantley weren't the ones to talk prize but let's see you and i talk price here for a second because this really surprised me all right so like here's the market cap of this thing and this is uh not fully diluted market cap this is just like i guess market cap that is unlocked up in supply but here we are in coin market cap and we hit 1.3 billion dollars um some highs of probably over seven billion dollars in fully diluted market cap for this i think the peak was eight billion dollars yeah it peaked out at two dollars yeah why do you understand like what like so why is this thing valuable to people right so like if you sign the constitution to get your drop which i did um it's basically like a not it's kind of a non-profit right you have governance rights in this thing you've been given a responsibility why do you think people are valuing it at six seven eight billion dollars i i definitely want to answer that question but i want to answer that question at the very end because it'll be easier to to explain that um and so some of the dynamics just to fill listeners in about what what happened here is like the ens token got air dropped then there was a bunch of shenanigans with the uniswap uh contract because everyone who didn't have enos wanted to buy it but there were zero liquidity at the very start and so if you were watching the uniswap like it would go like for a moment ens one ens token was worth 577 thousand a hundred thousand dollars and so like for a brief moment in time everyone was like a billionaire just by this weird proximate be there being like no liquidity in uniswap eventually liquidity came in the market settled and that's where we started some action to see some actual price discovery started around 20 to 30 uh which is again a two to three billion dollar valuation and then it zoomed up to 80 dollars per token and now it's currently clocking in at just below sixty dollars a token but some really astonishing like imagine just like releasing your thing and like it immediately it had no valuation enos had no public valuation it was managed by brantley by nick these guys that were just people eight people just stewards of this thing not taking profit and like not doing this for revenue just managing this open protocol and then boom the token launches and it comes out at clocking in at a max of eight billion dollars that's absolutely insane and so like to unpack what this thing actually is what ens actually is ens is a public goods it is a public good for ethereum the namespace of ethereum if you could go back one tweet right into my tweet the namespace of ethereum is a public good what do we call all of us because you can't we like uh ryan there's ryan uh here and then there's also ryan selkis we can't have two ryans one of them has got to be ryan s uh adams and one of them's got to be ryan s selkiss right like we need two you hear that ryan sulcus there can't be two of us can't be two of us two different names one of us is going down you can't have con conflicting names because we need to actually point two things only one entity per name so that is called what is called a name space where we label all of the entities that exist in ethereum and with the ethereum name system we actually get to put in human readable names around these very complicated public addresses and so the ens is a public name space around ethereum the system for collectively deciding how we name things and this actually lends itself to how blockchains work ens is a consensus system it's a consensus for all identifying how we name all the things just like how a blockchain comes to consensus ens is a public goods that comes to consensus about how we name all the things so just like ethereum itself ens is a public good that needs to be protected from free riders and this is the magic of ethereum this is why this gets me so excited ethereum as a protocol like you said a network of networks ethereum as a protocol is finally able to price in public goods in ways that we've never seen before so like clean water clean air the free market doesn't do a very good job of like pricing in those for those free resources ens is a resource and a system that is now establishing a market value which is somewhere between four and eight billion dollars right now and just how like proof of sake and proof of work is the protection around blockchains the value of the ens token is the protection around the ethereum name system uh and so ethereum is unlocking the free market to actually finally price a public utility and so brian to answer your question about why this is so valuable it's because we don't know how valuable this thing is we have never been able to price public goods like this and so like and then like the the the bullish side of that is like oh my god we don't know how to price these things like the last thing i learned that we didn't know how to price was ether and like the this guy's the limit on that one the other the bear case is that these are public goods like it's actually really hard to like monetize public goods that's actually why they're called public goods so maybe they're not worth that much this is going to be a grand experiment about finally pricing in some public goods for the first time ever and i i think the price action is really going to be emblematic of how well ethereum can finally price these things that have always been left out of the market and ultimately cause a lot of human suffering but that's a topic for a different day yeah there's a you had a lot to say about that there's a lot there i mean one thing one point that brantley makes is this yeah you were not dropped airdropped free money you were airdropped responsibility that's another way to look at it um i think the ultimate question of what you're saying is like the question of how to price a public good whether right now six billion dollars is overpriced or whether six billion dollars is is underpriced is ultimately decided by individuals who own ens tokens all right and so you tweeted this out raise your hand if you're holding your ens drop i choose to bear this responsibility so the question to everyone who just received this of which there are like 150 000 more or about 150 000 or so etherdresses that were eligible to receive this is what you're gonna do it's worth six billion dollars you probably made thousands of dollars on this i know people have made tens of thousands of dollars easily on this airdrop so what are you gonna do you gonna sell it are you gonna hold and if you're gonna hold are you gonna bear the responsibility of voting but it's awfully tempting to sell at these prices is it not and so what are people doing they're not selling right that's why price is going up a lot of people have decided that it's worth holding on to this thing could be more valuable in the future they want to participate in this network at any cost and so they're not selling but i've actually been pretty surprised at where supply and demand have kind of met with the valuation of this thing and to your point like nobody knows how to price it okay but like i feel like some things in crypto are definitely overpriced right now i just honestly i don't know whether ens is overpriced or underpriced like it's a legitimate project this is not smoke and mirrors this could be insanely valuable uh like team is fantastic the distribution seems to be and they distribute it to all a whole bunch of eath bulls who have done well on ethan so they're going to be some of the last people to sell but like is it worth 6 billion i legitimately don't know so let me ask you the question did you sell or did you hold david uh so my two e s names that i have uh trestlestate.eat and davidhoffendotty those private keys are in seattle so i am holding okay yeah i know i can't care it's all hypothetical yeah but i actually i have actually bought some in addition to that as well and so i've actually doubled what my airdrop uh is worth by buying some uh and i think i'm going to be holding that for for a good long while uh and like it's also really something that's really if you're paying attention to the crypto twitter sphere something that's also emerges there's a big like culture around ens right now and i i i think it's just this very emergent property of everyone being really really excited about ens so like these memes are coming out and in the same vein that we saw memes about like chain link and all these other memes there's a there's a holding culture around ens right now which is like pretty damn cool that we're gonna have we are going to have two moments of zen at the end of this podcast it's so good and they are absolutely phenomenal there are two songs about ens and enns dao they are actually catchy and i i hope you guys stay tuned to the very end so you guys can can listen to that oh yeah how can you not ena stands for everyone not selling i guess right that's the meme here can i can i get you in on a little bit more hope you and ryan yeah yeah well you're gonna you're gonna crank me up on more you know more ens hopefully okay convince me so i i have a claim to now david um part of me thinks that this is a bit overvalued my friend i love ens as a project it's fantastic i'm incredibly bullish but why should i hold at these prices how many funds do you think have purchased or invested in in ens vcu funds zero zero funds zero hedge funds it's all people no one's gonna dump on me no one there's no one to dump on you it's all people all the way down there's the only people that got the ens tokens were people that were using the ens system or were part of the ens team which was like you know building the ens system uh so yeah there's no one to dump on you like that's except my friends except your friends my friends your friends right and so like this is don't jump on we can we can pump this thing to the moon if we all agree to not sell this is how this works i think it's a great project and look guys this is just another reminder to you of the value of using these protocols we've been saying this for the past like two and a half years okay use these protocols there's like we're not just saying there's you'll be rewarded as and you'll learn a new skill and there'll be some educational rewards and it'll enrich your life no you get free money like why are you not using these protocols okay like when we say you're getting rewarded you're literally getting airdropped money okay tokens value responsibility as well but these things have have value so we we published an airdrop guide about two and a half weeks ago now it had 25 different opportunities this was number 16 guys so that that went to bankless premium members that's another reason you should subscribe i feel like we're uh we're shilling the bankless premium but like look what's the roi on that you spend 22 dollars a week and you get a few thousand dollars a month yeah sorry a week it would still be worth it though yeah yeah i did see a fantastic uh there was i think we put a meme on the weekly roll up a number of uh like a month or two ago about uh somebody's daughter wearing one of the crypto the cipher punk t-shirts in middle school yeah that person's daughter got the ens drop no a middle schooler got a twenty thousand dollar ens drop we changed her life andrew yang just got it andrew yang got it we gotta go welcome we gotta go help andrew yang claim his airdrop we should put it in his address and see how much he got actually but anyway guys airdrop season really fun i think this is the airdrop of the year there's some great ones this year dydx but nah i don't know this is really fun from a distribution perspective hey we hope
