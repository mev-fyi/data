if the eye stabs you you can either like try not to do that or you could be like oh wow we have a real stabby AI on our hands we should maybe we should unplug once you find out an AI is particularly stabby is there something you can do there's basically two things the most obvious one is you say well you have any on our hands the wood under some conditions initiative takeover and hopefully that is fuel for like a let's pause for a while there's a second thing you can try and do which you need to be much more careful about here's a situation where the eye would stab me let's just train it not to do that that doesn't feel like a solution the latent threat yeah it's still kind of Savvy underneath and I kind of just want to remind people all of these possible solutions we have like one-ish years to implement them
