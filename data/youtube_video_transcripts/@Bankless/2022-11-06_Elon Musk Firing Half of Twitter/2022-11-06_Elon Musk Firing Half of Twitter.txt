Elon Musk is finally in charge of Twitter he's fired agrawal the former CEO he's fired the previous Chief Financial officers he's fired the head of legal he's fired the general counsel he's fired so many more other people and like I hinted as you're talking fired me okay but in addition to that Elon Musk has reportedly brought in over 50 Tesla Engineers really into Twitter to bring Tesla's Talent into Twitter talent and I think that what he's thinking is that like you know if you work at Tesla you perform that is the expectation same thing with SpaceX and that's so I think the vibe is that like Elon thinks all the Twitter Engineers are just like lazy and they've just been like lazing around for the past like years and years and years so he wants to bring his like you know super military engine here's people he's like super this is what private Equity always does right they'll acquire and then they'll like fire all of management and bring in their people to run things he's kind of doing a private Equity play here right yeah it kind of sounds like that
