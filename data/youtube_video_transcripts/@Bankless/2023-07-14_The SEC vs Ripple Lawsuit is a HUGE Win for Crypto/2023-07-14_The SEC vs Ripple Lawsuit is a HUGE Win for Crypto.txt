a U.S court has ruled that xrp the asset is not a security in the words of the judge Ripple sales of xrp do not constitute an offer of investment contracts xrp not a security this is absolutely huge because if xrp isn't a security then nothing in crypto is a security now that's a little bit hyperbolic of course it's possible to tokenize a thing that is a security and issue a security on chain but what it does mean is the sec's overreach their regulation by enforcement their allegations that coinbase is an illegal Securities Exchange their court filings indicating that Solana that file coin that Matic that atom that cardano that all of these are securities well how can they be Securities if xrp isn't how can eth be a security if xrp isn't this is important precedent that was just set in I think puts against her back on his heels it's a setback for Gensler and for anyone in the SEC who thinks that this regulation by enforcement activity can continue it's a check on their power and all of this came about of course from a multi-year court case between Ripple which is the company that originated xrp and the SEC we haven't talked about it much because it's been on the back burner for so long but now here it is this is a tweet from Bill Hughes he is a crypto lawyer he says this the SEC versus Ripple in brief here's what you need to know Ripple putting xrp on exchanges for trading and funding their operation with those sales is not an investment contract and therefore not a security that's what the court said also Ripple paying people in xrp is not an investment contract and therefore not a security an xrp is not a security in and of itself even when offered through a Securities transaction so this turn of phrase investment contract xrp is not an investment contract when it's on an exchange change if you pay people with it or even when it's offered through a Securities transaction that's what the Court ruled however the court did say that Ripple's original selling of xrp directly pursuant to contracts was an investment contract and thus the security so originally xrp was a security and became not a security at some point in time Bill also says I'd be shocked if the SEC doesn't immediately appeal this to the second court because of course this is a big setback for the SEC I also agree with Adam Cochran's take here he says overall this is a huge win xrp is one of the more centralized foundations with the key figurehead who has had standard sales by exchanges and formal distribution programs if those aren't Securities nearly nothing sold via exchange is we also have some weigh-in from politicians this is representative Tom emmer majority whip he's been on Bank list before the Ripple case is Monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract did you hear that SEC the token is separate and distinct from the investment contract it may or may not be part of now he says let's make this law wants to take this court precedent and make it law generally applicable representative Richie Torres on the Democrat side also weighs in on all of this with an attack against the SEC saying the SEC is acting like an overzealous traffic cop arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret it prefers to communicate by enforcement rather than by rules or guidance but that's no way to regulate digital assets I'm calling for an investigation of the SEC so some heat from that as well some of the major exchanges including coinbase also issued within hours coinbase will be re-enabling trading for xrp on the xrp network they say I I suppose they feel safe in doing this given that the U.S court system has ruled that xrp is no longer a security so that's what just happened I'll uh end with my take here which is this doesn't really matter what you think of xrp the asset or Ripple the company I personally think xrp is an overvalued project riding on some Vapor writing on a passionate some might say a silly community and I never thought I'd be saying this all right thank you xrp you stopped Gary gensler's Onslaught against crypto because if xrp isn't a security then almost nothing is I'll end it there we're going to discuss this in more detail on Bank lists in the coming days I'm sure there's some things I missed here this is breaking news as I said there's questions of whether Gensler in the SEC can appeal this uh there's questions like is it clear skies ahead for security regulations in the U.S I imagine there's some subtleties there I imagine there's still some work we have to do we'll get to all of those details in fact later today I'm recording with Mike selig he's a crypto lawyer and we're going to explore this in some more detail but today for now on the roll up this morning we get to celebrate this win and I can't believe I'm saying this but thank you xrp bankless Nation it is the second Friday of July and it is time for of course the weekly roll up I have Anthony sassano from the daily guay with me for the second week in a row while David is up exploring some mountains uh and we got some topics to cover this week Anthony how are you doing this morning I'm very good I'm very bullish today actually wait you woke up bullish that's the thing you say on The Daily way right like so what what constitutes Anthony waking up bullish versus all of the other days of the year I think I wake up bullish every day to be honest um what the price is doing I just wake up and you know I do my usual check Twitter routine and I'm just like you know what I love this industry so much I'm so bullish so you still have faith in this industry you haven't given up on crypto no no no I mean look crypto to me is a broad term right um I obviously Focus mostly on ethereum but no I mean everything that I'm seeing in the ethereum ecosystem just every day it's it's just crazy I I honestly can't keep up with it anymore it's just there's too much well guys if you want that bullish energy injected straight into your uh veins this is the place to get it this is the weekly roll-up where we cover everything going on that you need to know about crypto a few topics of the week uh number one we're gonna talk about this new Marketplace for doxing crypto addresses is everyone in crypto about to get doxed some controversy surrounding a new Bounty program that rewards people for doxing crypto addresses we're going to get into that also the Google Play Store they just did an about face on their policy in a good way now nfts are unbanned they are allowed we're going to discuss that as well Ave is about to launch its new stable coin as well it's called go and is this the stable coin we've been waiting for or is there another Anthony I want to pick your brain on that as always you got to make sure you like subscribe rate and review if you're on YouTube subscribe if you are listening to this on a podcast player somewhere give us a rate and review and let's Propel this thing to the top of the chart so much to cover in markets this week Anthony but before we do a quick shout out we are going to the permissionless conference that is the bankless nation David and myself that is coming up on uh September 11th through the 13th so we're almost all the way through summer in the U.S and uh it's time to book your ticket guys and I think the bear Market is the best time to go to a conference this is an opportunity to uh to network to meet all of the settlers who stayed during crypto Winters and to find your bear Market buddy as David and I like to say uh a fire lineup there's 120 speakers we're expecting 6 000 attendees 1500 different crypto projects and it's all in Austin if you're a bankless citizen you get a 30 discount there's a link in the show notes to go do that all right uh Anthony let's get to the markets thanks to Kraken Pro for showing us these charts today bitcoin price we're about flat since the last time you and I talked about this about 30k on the week any takes on bitcoin this week I think I mean similar takes to last week right where I basically said that I thought that the market was trading just purely based on narrative that ETF narrative and I didn't expect any wild moves from here because of that because it doesn't seem to be any new money coming in and I think that's basically been playing out over the past week but it's only been a week right you know next week we could be we could go up 10 for you know that's the volatility in crypto so yeah I think just more of the same really over the last week well uh eth is more of the same as well kind of down a little bit but pretty much flat I'm just going to call it flat 1880 at the time we were recording this which means of course the eve to bitcoin ratio is flat the good news here is a crypto market cap is over a trillion dollars I don't know about you Anthony but that's kind of a meme number for me are we above a trillion or below a trillion of course um there are a lot of tokens in this market cap that maybe should be worth a lot less but it feels good to be above a trillion we are at 1.3 trillion on the week um well if there's nothing going on in the short run or at least not much we're waiting for the the next price action I want to zoom out a little bit and I want to talk to you about three things in this market section one is bonds the second is staking in ultrasound money and the third is real world assets uh so let's start by talking a little bit about the bond market and I want to do almost like a tale of two Bond markets here because we've got the Fiat bond market and then we have the crypto bond market and the ethereum bond market and I think there's a an analogy that fits that spans across both of them that I want to implant in listener's head and get your thoughts on here um first of all when people say bonds a lot of times it just sounds like this obscure Financial instrument but what is a bond actual really a bond is just a form of debt So when you buy a U.S bond that would be a treasury something to that effect you're essentially lending money to the US government uh in the same way when you buy a liquid staking token we call these lsds or when you stake your eth you are lending ethereum the ethereum protocol some money so that's why we call staking eat or staked eth a bod essentially it's an ethereum Bond I don't know if you've seen this um this infographic Anthony at any point in time but this is what the global bond market looks like and I'm going to describe some of this for listeners who are listening on the podcast um this is all of the Sovereign bonds it's about a 60 trillion dollar market so these are all of the bonds that nation states issue so call these nation-state bonds if you will um and 60 trillion worth of that you know 51 trillion is the US actually these numbers are a little bit larger so it's maybe this is 70 to 80 trillion 20 trillion or so is China and you can see all of the other nation states encompassing this pie that's the size of the Sovereign bond market so I want to contrast the nation-state bond market which is about 60 to 70 trillion dollars or so to the network State bond market which is only about 70 billion right now and of course uh ether the asset the bond composes the the vast majority of that about 40 billion or so and then we've got Solana we've got cardano we've got some other um chains here of course so we've got a tale of two Bond markets and I I was reading this report from Pantera earlier this week Anthony about the U.S bond market and Pantera's perspective they're obviously they've been in crypto for a very long time but their perspective is that the US is totally screwing up its bond market like turning it into a complete Elite Ponzi scheme and one way you can see that is this metric called the real fed funds rate okay so the real fed funds rate so what you can see on this chart is the Fed funds rate is basically the interest rate set by the FED uh that's sort of in yellow that's this yellow line here and then you see CPI so core CPI that is consumer price index that is the measure of a measure of inflation is this dotted line everywhere where you see kind of red the shading pattern of red that's where the FED funds rate is below the core CPI rate it's basically like you're buying a U.S Bond a sovereign bond in order to get a yield say yield of like five percent but CPI but inflation is like eight percent in which case how much are you making in real returns in real fed funds rate well negative three percent so you're kind of losing money on that and it's very interesting you see like post uh 2008 the um you know the great financial the financial crisis here um it's been read basically ever since and up into it it hit a high point I believe the lowest point of the Year negative 6.3 that's the lowest in the last 50 years that the real return on um on bonds have been on essentially is fed funds rate which is pretty crazy so you can start to see the the case that this Sovereign bond market is not actually producing a real rate of return I want to pause here because next we're going to contrast that with what's going on in in crypto I'm able to take a peek at the the ethereum bond market in some detail um but what's your take on this Anthony like who in the world is buying bonds right now mm-hmm so I mean I I gotta preface this and say obviously I'm not an expert on on this kind of stuff uh definitely uh more of an observer but it seems to me that the the covert I guess response in covert generally has distorted a lot of this because you can see it in in the chart right it seems to have distorted a lot of this and and also post 2008 um as you were pointing out how it was a race was so low for so long but then you can see that they were kind of trickling back up and then covert happened and then back down again right and it's it's kind of funny how similar a lot of these charts look with covert like there was the covert dump I guess initially in stocks right and and crypto and then we we went we went up after that um and because you know the rates were basically at Rock Bottom again and then the rates started going up and everyone got scared and and I guess like uh risk on um assets kind of went down uh but yeah just generally um when you're talking about like buying bonds and getting that real return I think that if you weren't in a bond and just in cash obviously and that's not cash in like an interest bearing account or something like that um you're losing even worse off yeah exactly yeah so it's kind of like yes you might be losing like whatever it was point three percent um but you're much better off still doing that than just leaving cash lying around but at the same time you know it's all about the appetite of investors right like buying a sovereign Bond especially the US bond is like the least riskiest thing you can do because you have the full weight of the US government behind that right like you literally it's the you're buying into the US government essentially so um it's it's considered the least riskiest thing you can buy uh but at the same time like is it really like worth not taking on a little bit of extra risk to just get much more return potentially with your dollars right with with some risk assets such as a BTC or an eth right or or even a gold which is done comparatively well so yeah it certainly begs the question is like who is buying the bonds right over over these other things well what's interesting is part of the answer to that question is um in a take away Banks so central banks are buying their own bonds that's why Pantera is calling this kind of like a Ponzi scheme so central banks own about 50 of the Sovereign bonds uh that are out there that's what quantitative easing is so many of these uh modern um you know Central Bank policies actually do is they buy Bonds on the open market so that has kind of a distorting effect as well but it's really interesting when you start to look at real returns which is okay what's the yield of the underlying Bond but like you have to look at um the yield minus inflation right that gives you your real return now let's contrast that to ethereum which I think is is kind of interesting here so remember ethereum is very much like steak ethers like a bond you are lending ether to the protocol of ethereum and Anthony when you were saying the risk-free rate it's kind of the lowest risk type of um you know financial asset you can you can have as owning U.S bonds or U.S treasuries staked eat is the lowest like the the highest allele yield it's almost like the risk-free rate of ether as an asset right you can't deposit your ether anywhere else and expect to receive a return of any size at lower risk so it almost represents the risk-free rate here which is kind of cool and the contrast here is this to me looks a lot um I'd call it healthier but because you don't have the the money printer um the algorithm doing open market operations and purchasing staked eth like LSD tokens in the open market that's what central banks do it's completely transparent so you can see it kind of block by block there aren't arbitrary decision makers who are adjusting the dials up or down it just kind of follows um the the the algorithm and if you look at kind of I guess maybe the comparison is uh the real rate of return and since um you know since the merge the real rate of return has been what like something between four and six or the actual rate of the nominal rate of return has been about between four and six percent uh and then if you take the um the burn uh there then you have to kind of like add that so you're at like the burn since the merge has been Point um three percent and so the real rate of return looks far more attractive on a staked eth versus Sovereign bonds versus something like a a U.S treasury and I just think this contrast is so Stark and so interesting and does beg the question of like if you are looking at any sort of time Horizon you have some extra Capital you're looking at a time rise and it's longer than like a year let's say why would you hold these um Sovereign instruments that are bleeding effectively like your real rate of return is going down when you can own it asset like ether uh where I mean it's a it's a positive rate of return now people say but that's each denominated right it's not like you know real money um you know but I I don't know I kind of go back to like look over the longer time Horizon one eighth is one eighth what are your thoughts on this in this uh comparison in General Anthony yeah so I mean there's there's generally a lot of things I could say about this I maybe the denomination thing is somewhere somewhere good to start so yeah when people say oh but it's eighth and it's not US dollars so it's completely different the the way I think about stability generally is that as you said 1 8 equals one-eighth one US dollar equals one US dollar you know one AUD because one AUD um but the thing is is that like it's stable relative to itself so if you start comparing a US dollar to your grocery bills well over the last two years the US dollar hasn't been very stable compared to your your grocery shop right your grocery shop has gone up because there has been inflation and and because of um uh just prices generally going up because the supply chain constraints and all those sorts of stuff that happened because of covert and the same is true for any asset you can compare any asset to any other asset and that's where we come to things like stores of value like where do you store your wealth in order to protect yourself in the in the most kind of like I guess risk-free or riskless way um so that you're not taking on a massive amount of risk like investing in a brand new company that has a five percent chance of succeeding or something like that and traditionally it has been obviously the strongest currency USD which is the world Reserve currency or it has been gold for a very long time and then over I guess like the last I I I want to say 10 years but probably less than that in terms of bit BTC and being considered stores of value now you can say five to ten years I guess um it's been those assets right where people say well you know I can store the my wealth in these crypto assets I mean I do it you do it like we store our wealth in eighth and then we stake to eat of course as well to get that return and you were mentioning how it's a real return so when you stake urethra there are really I guess three parts to it you get a new eighth issuance um that gets paid out to you as a reward you get the egg bet that gets paid out as fees as a reward as well um anything that's not burned of course and you get Mev related payments to if you're running the Mev boost software which most people do I think it's up to like 95 of validators are are kind of talking to that software so that the um the later two parts the the the unburnt fees and the Mev that is not new issued eight that is existing eighth that already exists in the ethereum economy that is paid by users to do whatever on the network the only new eat that is issued is on that um consensus layer side rewards which is the the new eat that he's printed but the thing is is that we're burning more Ethan is issued and we've been doing this for quite a while now especially since the merge which means that the net result as you mentioned is that since the merge we are at negative uh point three percent uh inflation rate or issuance rate for eth the the net rate um and on top of that it is much harder to print new eth than it is to burn it because you have to basically outrun the burn so even if the the burn is really low even if gas fees are quite low and the burn isn't actually um you know at at extra at um uh high amounts it doesn't matter because you're still burning um almost the same if not the same as what's being issued so the issuance isn't actually increasing from that it just basically stays flat and that's what we've seen um at periods of time you can actually see this on the chart for the last few weeks we remained relatively flat with increasing slightly but then we started burning more heat again over the last I think couple of weeks or so um you can see uh yeah over the last 30 days you can actually see how it worked out here um and then we're just going straight back down because it's much easier to burn eat than it is uh to issue it now of course issuance changes as more easy stake there's more issued um but still I I feel like the more they get staked the more um the more activity is happening on the network because people are using that stake to eat for different things like restaking such so that the fees will probably level that out um and yeah all that just culminates in such a nice real yield on your staked teeth and a very very attractive asset as a store of value totally so you woke up bullish Anthony I woke up foolish on staked eth like it's just incred incredible you got to look at the real return here and the real return of an asset like ether when it's staked when it's bonded is just uh incredible um I I want to ask you another question because people listening to this section might also get kind of bullish and they have some eth and they're like okay guys I I still haven't pulled the trigger I still haven't staked my eth uh where should I stake it how do you think about that question Anthony so there are a lot of different options in terms of staking eth including by the way all of these liquid staking uh you know tokens and options as well so bankless just put out a post about this and there's a slew of new ones um uh Prisma swell um origin ether Diva there's tons of them I can't even keep up with all of the new e-staking protocols that are essentially innovating on the the bond market by making some of these um some of the staked eth liquid and that's really interesting but for for the average listener thinking about how to stake they could put their ether into an exchange for example a centralized location and stake that way they could use a staking protocol one of these new ones or some of the established ones like rocket pool or Lido or something like that or they can solo stake um what's your take on that like what advice do you generally give yeah I mean the thing is is that like there's a bunch of different questions that you should be asking yourself uh before putting your money into any of these things or before putting your eighth into any of these things I think the number one question is like how how old is the protocol because security of the protocol and its smile contracts should always be top of mind because the newer protocol is going to be less secure than something that's older that's been around for a while that has been be able to be battle tested so that should be top of mind for everyone like a like particularly these new ones you're just a little bit like oh they don't have a Lindy like be careful exactly I'd be more careful with them than say something like a rocker pool or a lighter that's been around for quite a while now I would definitely be more careful with the newer ones that's not to say that they're insecure or that they're going to get hacked or anything but you need to be aware of that risk especially when using newer protocols and of course older protocols can still have bugs in them but it becomes you know less and less of a of a um possibility or probability as as time goes on um but on top of that I would also say depending on what kind of size you're staking for these lsts if you're planning on selling on secondary Market when you want to exit this position you should really uh be aware of what the liquidity is like for these lsts because some of them especially the newer ones aren't going to have that much liquidity to start off with so if you're putting in a substantial amount into these things you may not be able to exit with the same amount you put in because you'll cause some kind of price slippage because you've got you're just trying to sell too much at once or something like that so that's something to consider um other things to consider obviously uh are you putting Ethan to something that he's decentralized or is going to be decentralized or are you staking with a centralized service are you sticking with the dominant player a lot of people say well you know you shouldn't stick with Lido because they already have a very large market share you should stick with one of these other players and I I definitely agree with that but at the same time you do have to consider these other questions that I brought up especially around security and liquidity and things like that and also the models of these things as well depending where you are in the world the there are two different ways that these tokens these lsts can operate they can either be rebasing um or they can be or they can pay you out um extra tokens as as rewards so it rebases uh or it can pay out um or sorry all the the token price uh sorry the token value increases with the rewards and that could have tax implications for you you could owe tax on that um or you could owe tax on the rebasing one it just depends on where you are so that's another question to ask as well so there are a lot of considerations here um but generally I would run through all of those things before staking with anything really um and then when comes to Solace taking there are really just considerations with Solace taking of of a different nature because with someone's thinking you're running the software um if you're you know if you're buying an LST you're not running the software you're just buying the token someone else is running it but as a soil sticker you are running all the software you are managing all the hardware there is a lot more that goes into it in in that respect you have all this most of the same questions uh around um around the things I just brought up but you also have to worry about uptime you have to worry about making sure that you are are upgrading when there's an upgrade like when there's an ethereum Network upgrade upgrading your clients if there's a bug how much work is this because I know I I know you do this with solo sticking so yeah um all right so per month how much time you spending kind of babysitting it uh zero now um honestly once it's set up and going uh and you know you don't have like I guess any hardware issues where something breaks for some reason uh generally it's zero and as I said unless there's like a network upgrade that you need to upgrade your software for uh or there's kind of a bug or something because you can set it up in a way where the the thing that you're the um the the instance that you're running so I run Linux you can set it up so that automatically updates itself and then automatically reboots to install those updates so you literally can be completely hands off and it it it really just depends as well because something could go wrong like your internet going off or something then you have to diagnose it right or or some other thing or something becomes corrupted but if everything's running fine then yeah the maintenance is is is is generally pretty low uh but yeah people people have different reasons for being actively actively maintaining it some people want to optimize it as much as possible in order to kind of like Get like near that 100 sent up time or something like that so if you're not too worried about that and you're okay with 99 then yeah it's pretty much like hands off most of the time do you know the the thing that scares uh me or a lot of people I think about this is just like the idea of losing your private Keys like locking yourself out yeah I was gonna I was gonna mention that how much of a concern is that like so a lot of people listening of course to bankless will um have taken custody of their own keys and the wallet like metamask or a ledger or something like that right and that you have to know a little bit what you're doing before you go do that right if if I'm advising say my parents or something I'm just like yeah dad keep the money on coinbase like it's you know it's fine and until you learn how to do private Key Management how much more technical do you need to be in order to Safe Safeguard your keys in a Solo staking type setup so the keys themselves it's no more involved than just uh like doing a self-custody kind of setup with a ledger Hardware wallet or a good Plus or something like that or even just uh securing a kilometer mask seed right um that's it's basically the same approach where it becomes a little bit more complex is that you have these validator keys that are on the I guess like machine that you have your validators on now if that machine becomes compromised so some say someone hacks into it they can't access your eth because they don't have your your private key and they don't have your your seed phrase but what they can do and vitalik has spoken about this they can do like a a thing where they slash you they get you slashed right they want to be malicious they don't make any money from this but if they want to be malicious and get you slashed they could literally run your validator keys with their validator right on there on their software um and then do something that gets you slashed um now that I don't think is a huge concern to be honest I don't think it's something that the everyday person needs to be worried about especially the incentives for some to do that it would just be because they hate you like they're not yeah they're just burning yourself down it's like arson yeah but pretty much yeah so it definitely the incentive is not there to do this at kind of like a scale unless you like really hate someone or you really want to Target someone and the bigger players I mean you would think they that they do generally but you would think they have a better secure setup than than just the smaller players because some people will have a have something that they've set up and haven't secured it properly but yeah I mean for for someone to go in there and get you purposely slashed they'd have to hate you or something this is no benefit for them to do that other other than that well uh very cool anyway lots of options for for you to look into if you're looking at uh at staking your eth and uh you know some some ramifications but more options is is always better here um I guess in contrast to what I was just talking about about like no one buying uh bonds here's a here's a headline from coindesk tokenized U.S treasury surpassed 600 million as crypto investors capture Trad fi yield so we are actually increasing in in crypto the tokenization of these treasuries and these Sovereign bonds like U.S uh treasuries past 600 million dollars is the latest number what are your thoughts on like tokenized treasuries and real world assets on chain do you have a general perspective on this trend yeah I mean this is the bridge right this is the Bridge from from D5 to Trad fire I think that we've had real world assets be incredibly successful on ethereum in the form of stable coins for for very many years now I mean people forget that stable coins are real world assets usdt uh the first at scale stable coin uh that's that's absolutely massive it's been around for a very long time and that is a real world asset has real world USD in a bank account that backs up the usdt same with usdc and now what we're doing is we're taking all these other assets and we're saying hey we can bring these on chain as well and then everyone around the world can get exposure to these things yes they're kyc Ed and AML and things like that as well but I mean I don't think that's necessarily something to to worry about or necessarily a bad thing I think that that is just the way the old world operates and what the way they will continue to operate for various different reasons but yeah I mean I I've talked about real world assets generally for quite a while now and I said that they were going to be a a main theme uh in this bear Market especially but also in the bull market because at the end of the day everyone in crypto likes to call stocks like Boomer things but I mean the young people still love stocks like it's not like the only people buying stocks are boomers uh and at the end of the day a lot of young people uh even if they're not buying stocks directly they're buying it through their 401k or their retirement accounts right so at the end of the day stocks are like they're going to be popular people are going to want exposure to it honestly I would probably be more inclined to buy stocks if I could buy them using crypto rails than traditional rails be so much more convenient than using like my you know Schwab account or Fidelity or whatever else it's just better better infrastructure mm-hmm exactly so yeah just overall very bullish on on real world assets well I mean to your point earlier like um you know I I was disparaging I guess treasuries and Sovereign bonds but um they are better instruments from a real return perspective than just holding the dollar relative to inflation and so when we have treasuries that are yielding like four to five you know percent uh and if you could tokenize them and hold them on chain I'd rather hold up four five percent yielding treasury than uh usdc if that was tokenized it'd be really cool if Circle or if someone was able to come out with a product around this where we just erc20 a sized uh a treasury or a money market of some type of course the um the difficulty here is regulatory uh headwinds that that you face and trying to do anything with tokenized Securities but this was the interesting report I um I saw this week uh which is the Bank of America is actually very bullish on real world assets which is very interesting and they say the expected value of tokenized asset markets could reach 16 trillion dollars by 2030. that's in seven years that's ten percent of global GDP I do think that real world assets are something like the Bank of Americas of the world like the banks can kind of understand they both understand and probably can support it and appreciate it because it's the same um Financial instrumentation that they use it's just on a new set of rails on a new platform that's much more programmable so I'll include a link to this report in the in the show notes you can go check that out see what the banks are saying about tokenized assets the last thing I just want to touch with you in the markets section here Anthony is um correlation here we spent a long period of time I think in you know 2021 and 2022 with Bitcoin and other crypto assets being very correlated with uh the S P 500 so we just you're talking about like stocks as Boomer instruments we were trading just like those Boomer instruments in crypto and this like punched a hole in the narrative that I think crypto folks particularly the Bitcoin Community has been preaching which is um Bitcoin is a non-correlated asset it's kind of like gold it's not correlated to you know fed rates and what stock price does and all of these things but for a very long period of time we were pretty correlated with stocks uh now that correlation has actually dropped so we're back from something like um a high of 0.76 correlation to about 0.1 correlation so um is this nature healing or do you have any takes on this I've maintained for a while that even though these correlations are like this that crypto likes to do its own thing right crypto seems to follow its own Cycles where it doesn't necessarily follow stocks uh up or down I mean right now I mean stocks have been going wild for for a little while now and crypto seems relatively flat compared to them even though I think eathy's up uh almost 2x since the start of the year or something like that right and BTC as well but generally you know everyone's looking at stocks right now being like Oh my God every day you know stocks are going higher the S P 500 is going to hit new all-time high soon all these all these sorts of stuff you know a lot of these other tech stocks that got just obliterated uh last year are coming coming roaring back and I look at that I'm like yeah okay that's true but at the same time like I don't think that there is that much correlation between stocks and crypto because you and I think that the recent correlation was an anomaly you can see the rest of the the time period here where correlations weren't that um weren't that that High um and I think if you look back at what happened last cycle the S P 500 was going was was going up and hitting new all-time highs uh for like I think a total of maybe at least 12 months um before crypto started really moving so it seems that the stock market was going to go up before crypto anyway uh it's kind of a leading indicator I guess for a number of different reasons I think the two main reasons are that um crypto is more risk on generally than than stocks uh even if you consider Bitcoin and ether to be low risk assets the majority of the world does not think that right they still think that BTC and eth are highly speculative and very volatile which they are but to be fair there's been a lot of tech stocks that were more volatile than Ethan BTC in this last cycle which is which is funny um and I think the second reason is that uh generally what you what you kind of see in crypto Market Cycles is like this four-year cycle right that seems to follow the Bitcoin Harmony and I I think that we're still respecting that I think that maybe this might be the last time we respect that because there's going to be a lot more Trad fire involvement in in not in crypto than it has previously been as we talked about last week with the BlackRock stuff and things like that um so yeah that's that's the kind of second reason uh that that four-year cycle and that four-year cycle points to next year being a really positive year because the Harvard news next year and it's kind of it's it's right on smack bang four years since the last bull market so at the start of the last bull market so yeah it it kind of seems to be following that still for better or worse I think this chart too when you look at the long term is the case that you made last week for a kind of ignoring macro in crypto and that like yeah aside from I guess events in 2021 and 2022 crypto as an asset class hasn't been correlated to the SMP it has not been very correlated to macro and so if that's the case this chart is showing what we think it start showing then why not just ignore all of it uh which uh maybe that could help listeners filter out some noise in their minds when they think about uh how to invest we got a lot more to talk about though Anthony including crypto doxing what happens when we have a new Marketplace for buying and selling information about any blockchain wallet address anonymously by a smart contract also there's a new developer report out uh and uh some developers are leaving I want to talk to you about that and see if you think that that is uh material and lastly the Google Play Store just had an epic unbanding of nfts and maybe there are some people to thank for that we'll talk about that too but before we do we're going to get to the sponsors that made this possible including our number one recommended exchange Kraken go check

web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web free space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web3 onboarded like game 7 for web free gaming and buy bit for tvl and liquidity and on-ramp so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides Milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle okay the question in my mind is everyone in crypto about to get doxxed Anthony let's talk about Arkham this is a tweet thread that a um a project called Arkham released announcing the world's first on-chain intelligence exchange you can buy and sell information on the owner of any blockchain wallet address anonymously via Smart contract you can see by the the screenshot and the image of their their interface they have created an exchange of these bounties so if you want to identify a particular hedge fund or if you want to identify the owner of a particular ether address there are bounties for all of these data sets and I guess say a community of sleuthors can go through and de-anonymize identify who the owners of these addresses are and there's lots of tools to do this of course um I think the government has their pulse on a lot of these tools and probably actively uses them in various prosecution types of cases but what's your take on what Arkham has released and by the way they've been active for a while so this isn't necessarily a new project I think it's getting a bit more play because they're doing something with a token but this whole idea of a Marketplace a bounty system to de-anonymize crypto addresses like is everyone about to get doxed and what does that mean yeah so I mean I think generally people should understand that uh ethereum and Bitcoin I guess is the two largest change and most chains out there are not Anonymous they're pseudonymous right because everything is already public on The Ledger uh now if you if you look at it from that lens what Arkham is doing here is they're basically just monetizing that fact right they're monetizing the fact that all that information is out there all that information is ready to be uh consumed and and sorted and organized but we just need to provide an incentive for people to do that and you mentioned that government have already been doing this they do chain analysis is not uh quiet or not I guess like secretive about the fact that they work with governments on this and chain analysis has been doing work for a very long time now I would I would wager that they have probably every single address on the chain doxed at this point they probably know everything about about ethereum and Bitcoin at this point just because they've been doing it for so long and they do have big government clients for things like anti-money laundering and they have big exchange clients too I believe so they have a database you're contending with I mean addresses out there and then like identifiable names not maybe not all of them but say like 98 percent I mean I would assume like that chain analysis is already de-anonymized or or kind of like tagged everything just because that is their job to do that right their job is to categorize and sort everything out for one reason or another maybe they haven't got like names attached to these things like I put people's names but they have sorted it organized and you could quickly just search it up like if you search an address on it it'll probably be tied with certain things and categorized in a certain way to make it easier to to filter through um uh and just because that's their their main kind of like business right that's what they do and they have government clients they have other clients out there that that request this information but at the end of the day like I can't be mad at chain analysis I can't be mad at Arkham because it's really a failure on our our half to allow this to happen right we allowed non-private blockchains to proliferate and people have been going on about privacy for a long time now saying you know we need privacy by default because our privacy by default means that everyone is protected and there is no need to worry about these sorts of things but because we don't have that now you have Arkham coming along and saying well there's a business case here right there is a business case that we can slap a token on it and we can monetize this and we can do like bounties on things and obviously it's it's highly immoral it's not something that I consider to be a good thing it's not something that I consider to be morally right but but at the end of the day um you know we're building open permissionless systems morals don't factor in at that point because the permissionless system and open system will let you do whatever you want because and it's decentralized too right so it'll let you do whatever you want um and and I think people grapple with that sometimes because their morals don't match the technology and I think people have to understand that that's what we've created and if you want it to improve build better privacy tools that protect people I know that obviously there was tornado cash and then they got sanctioned right so we did build a better tool and then the US government came along and said no you can't use that anymore because of uh of North Korea really and that just makes it worse because it's like okay well every day people want to protect themselves but now they can't because the US government has said that we're not going to allow you to use this tool anymore so that's why I'm saying it needs to be by default it doesn't have to it can't just be an app it has to be the entire chain is always private no one can see what you're doing um and I think maybe ethereum gets there eventually but it's more likely an L2 will do it before the ethereum L1 will do it and at the same time it's not like we're going to be able to make everything that has already happened private it just it would start from from that period of time onwards uh so yeah there are a bunch of different kind of things here I think people have struggled to Grapple with uh that they they probably assumed that no one would build something like this or that they were okay but at the end of the day everything you do on chain is completely visible to literally everyone in the world and if you didn't know that now you know and this power is no longer in the hands of just big governments it could be in the hands of of just about everybody um Scott Lewis takes the counter this um Arkham intelligence is techno fascism of of course it's backed by Sam Sam Altman founded company the guy's building a dark and terrible future for Humanity we all get to choose whether we resist or submit so calling kind of what Arkham is doing uh basically evil I think your point is a bit broader than that in that well if Arkham doesn't Didn't Do It um like morality aside or ethics aside for Arkham specifically somebody else would have and so it's incumbent on us as a community to actually solve this I'm I'm wondering if you see any um I guess upside to Arkham coming it's like does it make us now think seriously about privacy and tell you if like people are getting doxxed all of the time I guess one negative effect is they might use crypto less if if the you know the average person listening to this knew that all of their on-chain activity was you know fully fully transparent and could be revealed at any moment by some tool like like Arkham publicly not just to governments of the world but just publicly they might stop using our on-chain systems right I guess on the the flip side of that though is that starts to create market value and actually solving the Privacy problem maybe we start to get serious about privacy by default do you think this works out in our favor of the long run mm-hmm yeah so I mean I'll say first that I do agree with with Scott here I mean I'm not in any way trying to defend Arkham and what they're what they're doing I do believe that it is uh definitely immoral and something that I don't want to see exist but at the same time like before Arc I mean you can literally dox most people with just eat a scan because most people are not doing sophisticated hiding of their addresses and their funds they're doing probably the bare minimum and the bare minimum is maybe sending coins to an exchange like washing it through an exchange to a new address do you know how easy that is to track still like it's not it's not difficult to track that but that's what people are doing as the band as as the bare minimum so generally like uh it's already kind of like happening it's already been happening and people can follow etherscan and and docs these things I mean Scott uh Scott uh Zach xbt does this a lot right he uses etherscan and similar tools to follow the funds of scammers and grifters with pretty great success it's not good like so what if we have privacy by default though Anthony we lose that don't we we do but we gain a lot more I believe um I I believe we we gain obviously privacy just generally but we get we gain the fact that people already have I guess like privacy privacy from just everyone in the world or everyday people uh in the traditional Finance system really most of the time like the people that see your transactions are I guess like the financial system itself and the people running the infrastructure but it's not like everyone can see like it's not like everyone can see what I'm doing on my bank account for example right there is a kind of wall between those two things whereas with crypto there's no wall there is literally everyone can see what you're doing doesn't matter if it's a government doesn't matter if it's uh you know your neighbor and that is definitely a problem and to your point I think that this problem coming to the surface a lot more will spur on more of this activity but there already has been a lot of this activity and there already is a very promising Layer Two called Aztec Network being built out that is going to be private by by default and they're building what they call calling an encryption blockchain where basically everything on there is encrypted and private so it's already happening but yeah I can see that over the long term this could definitely spur a lot more research and a lot more development into this space just by virtue of people being aware of that because I don't as I said I don't think a lot of people are aware of the fact that anyone with etherscan can with pretty great um I guess like odds docks all of your addresses if they wanted to yeah and one thing that I'll add to this is I don't see um ethereum mean that adding privacy by default anytime soon on the layer one right we will probably have Smart contracts that do sort of mixing type things tornado cash style we'll have layer twos that add privacy by default as a feature but layer one will not be like mainnet will not be privacy by default I haven't seen any Pursuits in that direction um all right let's talk about another report that uh that came out this week which is a developer report from Electric Capital Anthony it's uh looking like some some of the devs are leaving actually so we are down 22 in Dev activity and contribution from about a year ago should we be alarmed by this I mean it depends where they they're down from right it depends what ecosystem I guess they're down from because if you're measuring from June of last year then you're measuring basically the depths of the bear Market the second half of last year right where where everything was was blowing up so many things are blowing up and you had FTX blop and all of these narratives that were formed in the bull market especially around these kind of like uh layer ones right that that went crazy during the bull market we came off of that so are these developers basically leaving from those ecosystems because they only got involved because there was money flowing there was developer incentives things like that I think that's more likely the the reason because it actually isn't that um hard of a fall only losing 22 percent when we went when we um basically went through a brutal bear Market but we're much higher than we were from the last uh bear Market uh we where you can see here on on the chart um and as I said I feel like most of the developers probably left from the ecosystems that have just stunted in growth right have just stopped growing altogether whereas ethereum and the layer 2's kept growing right so I I wouldn't imagine that a lot of those were from there but but just like users there are tourist developers right there are people who only come during the good times and then they're like oh well I'm pivoting to AI now right so I think there's a lot of that going on too yeah I agree with that take my take is it's healthy and if you look at this chart which is actually 2015 up until now and number of monthly developers if you if you were to view this chart in log rather than linear I'm sure this looks similar to 2019 in 2020 22 drop off is probably about what we needed at this point in time um this was pretty big this week Google Play changing their policy and allowing nfts in apps and games the reason I love this Anthony is because I also think it puts pressure on Apple uh to do the same and so we have of course these um these app stores uh apple and uh Android and Google um they could be Gatekeepers to what sort of wallets that are issued inside of the mobile ecosystem or what what sort of nft games we have and this is Android saying hey we're opening up we are going to enable um nfts in apps and games we're not going to charge an additional fee and I think this puts pressure on Apple to do the same any other takes on this yeah I agree with you on that I think I'm I'm well aware of the fact that people like know about this duopoly right between Google um and apple when it comes to app stores and how they have it can exert some pretty big control over things and people want to break that as well they want to basically create a maybe a new ecosystem that is outside of Apple and Google but I think what people Miss is that not only is creating a new ecosystem for mobile incredibly difficult and there have been multiple big companies like Microsoft that have failed to do this you not only need to do the software on uh you're also kind of need to do the hardware and doing the hardware is even harder than doing the software side of things so when you take all that into consideration it's much better for us to focus our effort on basically not forcing but encouraging forcefully uh Google and apple to allow these things to exist right to allow these things to exist on their respective app stores because bootstrapping a whole new ecosystem is a pretty I would say impossible task I I don't think it's something that should be be pursued and I know that Solana had an initiative recently with Solana phone to do this I I said it then and I'll say it now I don't think that's really going to go anywhere um I don't think anyone's going to buy a Solana phone over an iPhone just so that they can use a new ecosystem uh and and kind of like get access to apps they wouldn't be able to get access to on on the Google Play Store App Store the vast majority of people 99.99 of people do not care about that so let's not service the Micro Niche kind of thing of crypto let's service the rest of the world and as I said I think our energy is better spent making sure that we can get these apps approved and enabled on these uh these existing app stores Anthony not bullish on the Solana phone but that didn't stop Anatoly from tickings it would take 100 percent credit for shifting multi-trillion dollar Titans of Industries so making the case that because crypto provided another option no no that's that's that's a that's a that's a very bold rate yeah yeah there's very little adoption right now of uh Solana mobile but um anyway you know cheering them on this is a this is a good this is definitely a good um step forward for for crypto and something we need having the apple or the Google Store Open up so let's see the same from Apple uh Anthony we've got a lot to talk about coming up next including ave's new stable coin he's about to hit the market is this the one we've been waiting for uh brand new ZK evm hits the mark as part of Layer Two summer there's a lot going on in Layer Two world I want to talk to you about also Brazil with a um Central Bank digital currency on ethereum I saw something about this I want to dig into it some more and the UK they are turning crypto friendly what does that mean for us guys we'll be back with all of that but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible

the first is this consensus is launching a layer 2 on mainenet this is an alpha release right now it's a ZK evm it's called Linea Anthony what do you know know about this what consensus is building is this just another layer to you joining the ranks and like welcome uh great to have you or is there anything special about this particular layer too um It's relatively new so I haven't dug into it too much myself and I haven't seen much uh much about it uh uh uh recently but yeah I mean it's another ZK AVM joining the ranks yeah obviously as you said from consensus consensus have been around for quite a while now the developers of products such as metamask and inferior that that everyone uses pretty much so yeah they have a a track record of launching products and maintaining them for long periods of time so I'm curious to see where they go with this because I think that the generalized L2 Market is becoming very saturated very quickly at this point it seems like we have more block space than apps at this point a good problem to have I guess yeah definitely but it does begin to feel like what we saw with like the L ones right where there were so many of these l1s launching they all looked pretty much the same they had their own claim to fame but at the end of the day people just wanted more block space right they wanted those cheaper fees and and not not wanted to pay ethereum mainnet fees but I'm still excited for it I'm still excited to see these things Blossom and and basically play it out in the market you know battle it out see which ones people actually want to use and which ones Can Survive and Thrive and which ones just go by the wayside yeah that's just it I love the competition I think it's going to level us all up and here's another competitor that's entered The Fray from mantle Network this is a layer two developed by bit Dao their thing is they're going to use eigenlayer as the data availability layer so fees will be super cheap maybe this allows them to optimize on user experience you know really fast smart contract wallets a low cost um the news this week was they are launching a eco-fund mantle bit hours from from mantle of uh 200 million dollars investing in the mantle ecosystem and what I think is interesting thing about this is um this comes from bit Dao if you've followed bit Dao Anthony but they maintain one of the largest treasuries on-chained community treasuries of any Dow including 500 million dollars worth of eth uh two billion dollar total treasury a lot of those are mantle tokens but 500 million in each that's quite the war chest to be investing into this uh layer too so another competitor throws a tat in the ring and um I think it's kind of cool um lastly git coin is releasing a public goods Layer Two as well a public goods layer too what's going to be different about this one yeah so so these are the kind of things I guess I get a bit more excited about because they're specializing right they're not just trying to be another generalized L2 they're actually specializing and in bitcoin's case they're specializing on public goods this has been their bread and butter since day one right they've been doing this for quite a while now and the way I'm kind of envisioning this is that you want to have an ecosystem that develops around public goods but you don't want it to be necessarily fragmented right you want to be able to have it in kind of uh I guess for lack of a better term centralized place where people can kind of interact with all these different public goods applications they can do payments on this chain they can have like some light defy you'll have a uni swap on there because people will obviously want to swap tokens when they're doing these sorts of things but having it all in the one place and having these protocols be able to integrate with each other and cooperate with each other in a really close-knit way and being aligned to grow the public goods Network together I think is just speaking to get coins core values and what they've been trying to do for a long time and also something that I I'm incredibly bullish on because it differentiates itself from the competition right from from the pack um and as I said I I don't necessarily think it's trying to compete with the other l2s either it's more of a compliment it's like hey you know you want to do some public good stuff instead of having to go to you know all these other different ecosystems you can just go to public goods Network and here you go you can find your your home on there you can find uh cool things to do find really cool things to fund and um and and douse to join and things like that and I really do think that probably the biggest thing that's going to come out of this is that there's going to be a network of people that join the public goods Network and basically uh become the governors of many different protocols out there and they call the public goods Network their home but they're governing apps on arbitrary and optimism and and you know polygon all these other chains and they come home to public goods Network that's their Hub where they kind of coordinate and and and do all this stuff so yeah I'm pretty excited about it too worried all about fragmentation with all of these different liters like we kind of just get too fragmented can't keep up there's no one single source for kind of state and we just become views I I think I worry about fragmentation not on the technical or kind of economical side but more on on the social side of things where humans will generally stick to something longer than they should a lot of the time um you know especially if it's something that they've founded or if they're very close to we've all had this experience so we hold the crypto token down way too long because we uh we you know we can't cut our losses so to speak so I think that from a technical point of view interoperabilities is pretty much solved with these bridges that we have now and same with the economic side of things we can just Bridge assets between change relatively easily but on us on the social side of things what's going to happen is that you're going to have these l2s that exist for quite a while because they're going to have a massive war chest from issuing tokens things like that and they they'll be like these l1s they're basically zombies but the social capital is still there because people are still getting paid they don't want to cut their losses on it because they're like this is a cushy job right it's like dying corporations it's the same thing like they're around there's money coming in um and then they just stick around for way too long so I worry about that but at the same time I think over the longer term it fixes itself anyway as we've seen with the layer ones over the longer term everyone just comes home to roost on ethereum you know they they go they they abandon these other layer ones they come home to ethereum and ethereum gross then it becomes a better ecosystem because of it so I think with the l2s it's going to be the same thing there's going to be a bunch of them that don't work out they just exist as zombies and then the people from there eventually will come to the to the other l2s that are succeeding and kind of like you know migrate it's like it's like the the countries around the world you migrate from a country that you believe doesn't have an economic future for yourself to one that does it I think it's a similar kind of thing but you usually wait too long to do that a lot of the time this is like an immediate threat obviously a war in the real life is an immediate threat and you move but if it's a slow burn you tend to wait longer because you're kind of like stuck in that ecosystem for one reason or another so I think that's what I worry about the most but not the technical economical stuff that's much easier to solve than social stuff yeah that's a great point and to your point you and I were just laughing uh before the show began on the Kraken charge the top gaining tokens this week or things like kin uh you know p-o-w-r right these tokens that are still around and you wonder um like it seems like tokens and crypto can never die and it's probably for the reason you just said they'll just be around forever they might not grow and they might have this one weird breakout day where suddenly they're up 30 percent um but they just don't fully collapse to zero do they no no and I I it's kind of funny because you can always find at least one there's always one I don't know why a person who's still holding a bag of an old True Believer I I remember in the bull market towards the end someone was Shilling feathercoin in my Twitter replies feather coin is from like 2013 or 20 like a serious belief coin yeah yeah someone's serious being like Oh the team's coming back they're gonna reinvent the thing and I'm like wow what is going on yeah I you know you can't um can't destroy the faith of uh human beings I guess sometimes Okay so we've got the uh a new stable coin from Ave it's called go this has been talked about for a while this is a proposal on the governance of form of Ave to actually launch this thing goes in algorithmic stable coin so you can exactly a dollar worth of tokens when there's a dollar worth of um you know cryptocurrency and cement it against a diversified set of assets that are in Ave to me this is very similar to die I don't know what your take is on it but um high level question is it Go time I mean is this the decentralized stable coin we've been waiting for what are your thoughts on this I have uh a lot of thoughts on decentralized stable coins generally and I guess the tldr of my thoughts is that I don't think we're ever going to have one that actually works at scale um because when you think about it and I was talking about stability earlier in in the episode right where I was basically saying you're measuring stability against something else if you have a decentralized stable coin that is pegged to Fiat I mean it's in my mind it's not decentralized really because you're pegging it to a centralized asset right even if it's only backed by Ethan even if it's got no governance attached to it and it's like completely just existing on ethereum uh as in a decentralized state it's still pegged to the US dollar so when if that's the case and if you're collateralizing it to Mint it you're limited as well in terms of scale by the collateral so you're limited if even if you're just using eighth you're limited by each market cap and that's the upper limit the real limit is much lower than that because obviously not all of the eighth is going to go back in your your stable coin right even if it's an LST for example but as soon as you do lsts it doesn't become decentralized anymore like if you're backing with stf that's not a decentralized asset anymore SDA decentralized with with Lido so if you're just using eight as the example here your ceiling for how much you can issue is very very low it's it's super low compared to the eight marker I would say you could get to 10 billion or something 10 or 20 billion so that's not not where near enough to service the whole world right as a decentralized stable coin okay so if we run along that path well then how do we make it bigger well we make each market cap bigger okay how big this eats market cap have to be well it probably has to be 100 trillion plus dollars in order to issue enough of this in which case eth becomes the stable coin exactly exactly where I was going with it in which case it becomes the stable coin so in my mind these things are good in like little kind of Niche areas and maybe just for the crypto economy to play around with and use but the end state of of a decentralized stable coin really is just eighth eighth is going to be the decentralized stable coin if it succeeds if it gets to a large enough market cap because as I said it's it's stable to itself but then if it becomes stable relative to everything else in your life your expenses your groceries bills whatever then why wouldn't you use eth as money people use things as money when they're stable relative to what they're trying to purchase with it just like people in hyperinflationary countries they want to purchase USD because USD is way more stable than their currency right so it's going to come to a point where eth is way more stable than their currency uh and probably in far into the future at this point but you purchase that and then you just use eth as your decentralized stablecoin so your take is you like you like go it's cool but um yeah to assume it'll have more success than something like die is you know probably overstating it it's it's going to be sort of a niche stable coin for crypto enthusiasts not nearly as scalable as something like a usdc or a tether at this point and um you're pessimistic on the overall ability for us to get a true decentralized stable coin out there and so be it base stable coin yeah yeah like something that's pegged to to fear and I think that's realized I think that's what history has shown so far so we'll see if uh ego can be different um kind of cool to see some Innovation here uh eigenlayer has just reopened as well so the LSD restaking cap has been increased from 9600 to 30 000 staked if um Anthony you're gonna restake anytime soon are you gonna wait on this one so I don't hold any lsts because I am a solid Staker and a rocker pool nerd operator so node operators in rocketpool don't get the re they um basically um just obviously uh there's a there's a kind of pull I'm not gonna explain the whole rocket pull protocol but they the the note operators don't get the re the re is given to the people that are putting eth in a deposit pool which matches The Rocker pool node operators as a node operator right yes essentially yeah yeah that's that's probably the correct terminology there so for me I don't have any lsts because Solo's taking rocketball I don't um own stf or anything you've got this by some Anthony just buy some to stay I I could I could but right now right now outside of farming in potential possible airdrop which is what I think a lot of people are doing right now I don't see the point because there's nothing really live yet for eigenlayer it's literally just deposit These funds here um and they're doing this as a bootstrapping mechanism obviously you can't have things go live using restaked eth if there is no eat that's been restaked right so that's what they're doing here but they are going to have like native restaking as well as they've listed here where you can change your withdrawal credentials from your solo validator to eigenlayer I'll probably do that when there's something that's actually live rather than this because I'm not interested in farming any potential airdrop or anything like that um and it is as I've mentioned before anything new is always risky so I definitely take that very seriously especially when it comes to my staked eat I'm very protective of my steaks that's why that's all I say but um yeah I I actually think this is a really cool way of bootstrapping right just getting raising that TBR cap doing a guarded launch and then eventually launching their products like the eigen data availability layer which you mentioned before which I think is one of their first products and then harnessing what's already been stake to your or restate and and using that to secure these things yeah I I agree so if you want to be on the frontier of course you can uh put some eth in there but I definitely don't feel like you should be pressured into that there are risks associated with it um I don't know if you've been following this but vitalik did a Twitter spaces um and here's a quote from a coin Telegraph article vitalik buterin says ordinals have revived Bitcoin Builder culture on uh Bitcoin he said um later he praised ordinals and the brc20 token standard he said ordinals are starting to bring back a culture of actually doing things feels like there's some real pushback to the laser eye movement which is good I think he was talking to uh Udi Ruth Heimer and and also um uh Eric uh who are I think well known um Bitcoin revolutionaries let's say in the coming Bitcoin is almost having a cultural revolution type of moment where there's sort of this this Builder Community that's starting and then there's the laser-eyed maximalists who don't want to do any of that do you have any weigh-ins here do you think uh Bitcoin cultures is getting any better do you pay any attention to this I pay a bit of attention to it I think it is definitely I guess the most interesting thing to happen in Bitcoin in a while which says a lot considering that ethereum was doing this in 2015. um so like doing tokens and nfts which is basically what ordinals are I will say that I actually side with the laser eye Maxes in this case um and this is something I usually say yes oh I think Bitcoin I think Bitcoin doesn't need any of this I don't think Bitcoin should be doing nfts I don't think Bitcoin should be doing tokens because it is literally just a budget store a dollar store ethereum it's not doing anything better than ethereum so so wild bitcoiners are going to hate you for that on both sides no yeah I think so but like why are you compromising on what makes Bitcoin special to do things that you can just do on ethereum and even other chains that already have existed for quite a while and people say oh because bitcoin's more secure you know it's got a lot of capital there we can harness that and there's a different culture I get that but at the same time like I in my mind Bitcoin is no longer what it used to be Bitcoin has changed now right fundamentally so I think people are going to look at that and be like okay well Bitcoin is not this unchanging thing that we can kind of store our value in and be certain that it's going to be very similar if not the same in 10 years as it is today you're not going to know what bitcoin's like in 10 years because this functionality was actually introduced on accident with the Taproot upgrade no one as far as I know knew that this was possible using Taproot so if something can be introduced via accident like this what's to say it's not going to happen again so for me it basically adds a cloud of uncertainty to a Bitcoin that didn't exist before so that's why and that's and I think that's the argument that the laser ride maximalists make even though I mean I disagree with them on pretty much everything else I think they're right in that Bitcoin should not be going down this path because at best it becomes a dollar store version of ethereum right it has like building on bitcoin is just like you know TI 83 calculator it's just like you can get your computer it's just like shitty ethereum so like why go down that path at all but at the same time like for the laser ad Maxwells you can't really stop it can you no you can't you open all of the the tweets and the kind of the vitriol and the you know Jihad you you wage internally it's not going to stop Builders from building on bitcoin if this is a permissionless protocol and they have the ability to do it yeah no I definitely agree and I I don't fault anyone for building on there and and I I do agree with the type that it revives some kind of Builder culture on bitcoin I don't think a lot to be honest I think that there's there was a short-term kind of maybe three months or so of it going kind of crazy because it was this new thing everyone loves the new things right um and then it seems to us tape it off a bit but at the same time as I said like it fundamentally changes what Bitcoin is in my mind Bitcoin is no longer what it what it used to be um and I think that there are a lot of people in the Bitcoin Community not just the laser eye people but generally bitcoiners um that don't like this that feel like Bitcoin has has changed too much and if these changes continue and if it keeps changing I don't know what that's going to look like is there going to be another civil war is there going to be another split between the bitcoiners right like Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin in 2017 I'm not sure there's something happening it's uh it's certainly if nothing else it's uh entertaining to see what's going on yeah yeah definitely vitalik weighing in is interesting uh just to conclude the story we talked about from last week so the winklevosses were saying they would would sue Barry if he didn't return all the the hundreds of millions the 640 million he owes and uh indeed they did Sue Barry uh silbert and dcg of course uh the statement from dcg group is that this is yet another public publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame and responsibility from himself in Gemini uh we haven't done anything wrong etc etc back and forth back and forth as you'd expect Anthony so that's where that is um also this was interesting this week the former SEC chair Jay Clayton thinks that we should get a spot Bitcoin ETF um his reason was this he said when the SEC approved a few pictures based ETF they said let's look at the future Market we see their surveillance we see the Protections in that market for the investor that are sufficient we don't see them in the spot market so we're going to make that distinction he said there should be no distinction if you're going to approve the Bitcoin Futures ETF which has been approved then the SEC should also approve a Bitcoin spot ETF I still think we're going to get a Bitcoin spot ETF this year uh I I mentioned that a couple of years ago but I sort of confirmed this um fantastic podcast with a kind of an ETF expert at um at Bloomberg and he went through sort of all of the various scenarios he tracks all of the different ETFs for approval there are like 77 different crypto ETFs in some state of either denial or approval and he thinks that this year could be the year and if not this year into January for a couple of reasons one there's this grayscale court case where uh gbdc and grayscale are essentially suing the SEC saying hey we should be allowed to convert our trust into an ETF type structure this is you know there's no reason for you not to approve that so that's going through the court system some legal analysts are saying a a verdict could be delivered by September obviously that would be a big game game changer and then of course you've got BlackRock uh coming in here and Fidelity and some of the others continuing to apply pressure on Gary Gensler and the SEC so I feel like he's got to bend I feel like politically he's got to give something and so that's why I think a a Bitcoin ETF is going to happen this year so I know we've talked about that a little bit the last thing I want to get to though is London and the UK becoming a place maybe for American crypto refugees the prime minister of London uh Rishi sunak he seems to really like crypto Anthony do you have any takes on like jurisdictional Arbitrage and it always seems like some place around the world is either cooling or warming up to crypto and right now the UK seems to be warming up to crypto do you think we'll get some crypto projects over there some favorable regulations and crypto natives may be moving in that direction yeah I mean I think so if the U.S continues down this path right of just being hostile to crypto it will just naturally happen I think that the UK generally from what I've seen is trying to reinvigorate their economy after leaving the EU which seems to have turned out to be not that great of a decision uh so they seem to be trying to yeah reinvigorate their economy grow their economy and it seems that I mean Rishi seems a lot younger than the politicians we're used to especially in the US right so he maybe have a favorable outlook on crypto because he probably understands it better just from from a fundamentals point of view so I think yeah he seems to be pushing it uh the yeah the UK seems to be putting in those regular regulatory guard trials that regulatory Clarity that the US doesn't have that should logically attract a bunch of teams but as we're talking about before about switching costs right and how people can stay in one place for way longer than they need to and they don't cut their losses I think the same thing's going to happen I think there's going to be a lot of us-based crypto teams that are just going to stay put because they'll be like no things will change you know just give it a couple years we'll get more regulatory Clarity and we'll probably end up just seeing that existing people that live in London or the UK will probably just start crypto businesses there that maybe otherwise wouldn't of because they have more clarity now on on that front yes and hopefully this this puts pressure on other jurisdictions and maybe the US in particular to become a bit more crypto friendly so that is definitely the book is for that um this caught my eye as well Anthony I don't know if you've followed this at all but a pilot project of Brazil is a central bank digital currency apparently it was deployed to ethereum I believe the uh the Tweet thread here says um of course the Central Bank digital currency Brazil's currency it can be Frozen at any time you'd sort of expect that for any nation state deploying a central bank digital currency to have the ability to freeze various transactions or block various transactions I'm not super surprised at that but I'm deploying this on a public network and again this is probably just a prototype it's just a pilot it's just a test do you think that ethereum will be the recipient of Central Bank digital currencies of erc20s is it a net gainer in a world where central banks all have their own digital currency or do you think most central banks will not deploy on a public blockchain they'll you know kind of trade their own blockchain digital apparatus the way uh China is doing yeah so I I think with the Brazil one he had what they want to do is create a private Fork of ethereum sort of like an intranet for their cbdc right um so in that world where let's say all the central banks around the world do that I could imagine ethereum as that interoperability layer right as that internet to the Internet so to speak so that's where I see ethereum playing a big role where they'll probably use the lc20 token standard just because it's widely accepted and then it'll be easy to interoperate between these different kind of ledgers these private ledgers and the public ledger so that's where I see the meeting at the same time I'm not exactly very bullish on cbdc's for the reasons you outlined obviously the massive centralized control that they exert but at the same time people will say that they're not bullish on these things and they don't want them to exist but currently both USD C and usdt have the same freeze function in them at any time Circle or tether can freeze Assets in any address right they have the power to do that and yet they can buy market caps are over 100 billion dollars worth and they're the biggest stable coins right um in crypto so when looking at it through that lens I really do wonder what the uptake on cbdcs is going to be like like is the population just going to use them because they're way more convenient than the existing system are they going to become popular because of that the government's going to obviously and the banks themselves are obviously going to inject a lot of liquidity into it to to to get that liquidity Network effect so I think that's inevitable that we get these things I think it's inevitable that these things are pretty dystopian and they're probably not going to be great for for society um but in terms of where ethereum fits yeah they'll use the ethereum technology because it's just there it's open source for them to use it's free for them to use I wouldn't blame the ethereum ecosystem or like or anyone for like working on ethereum enabling this which I've seen some people do which I just find bizarre but yeah I've seen I've seen especially the the Bitcoin Maximus they said that they it's vitalik's fault that the the Brazilian Central Bank digital currency exists because he invent ethereum okay let's take that Bitcoins exactly yeah exactly so um you know it's it's a silly reasoning there but yeah I think they'll choose ethereum technology because it's just the standard right and they'll choose the erc20 token standard as well for the same reasons and then it'll just all interoperate with the ethereum public Ledger which is being my thesis for ethereum for a long time that it's going to be the sediment layer for all types of value it doesn't matter if it's a cbdc or otherwise it's going to exist as that layer and that's where ethereum as a network benefits well we've got more to talk about Anthony uh coming up I want to pick your brain on what D5 protocols you are looking at this is a question from the nation actually addressed to you also the entire world it feels like thinks crypto's a scam is there anything we can do to change that I want to pick your brain on that as well but before we do that gotta

description below here's a question from the nation this week uh Sasol mentions that's you of course Anthony uh Sasol mentions newer D5 protocols that he's been looking into which ones does he mean and what makes them new and Innovative compared to the Blue Chip D5 protocols this is J miles looking for some Anthony sassano Alpha here what D5 Protocols are you looking at or maybe if that's too specific what sort of Trends are interesting at this point in time yes so generally the the trends I would say are things like oracleless Protocols are protocols that just do not have oracles involved in them at all like a unisop style protocol for example UNICEF doesn't use articles uh it works without them which is which is pretty cool so that's one thing I'm paying a lot of attention to there is a company that I invested in recently that's launching I think they launched they're launching today actually called Azure Finance which are doing an oracle-less Landing protocol so essentially trying to disrupt the RVs and compounds of the world and trying to do that without oracles and with very um a kind of like minimal governance and things like that uh or basically no governance for for a lot of things so that that kind of trend there I'm paying close attention to because if we can make protocols work without oracles that removes a centralization vector not to say that that our oracles are bad and we definitely need them for a lot of things um they're definitely real world assets we would that we can't really remove it in that kind of realm from what I've seen but that's one Trend that I'm paying very very close attention to another one is New amm Designs so I know that unisoft V4 just got announced and that's a pretty broad design but uh and a pretty pretty exciting design but there are other protocols being built right now and I I don't think I can I can name any of them off my head right now I think a few of them are in in stealth but and basically designing amms in a very different way to what we what we're used to they're building them from the ground up in order to be fully generalized and modular to give the liquidity provider as much control over the you know the liquidity as possible so that to me like has been done in various ways obviously Unison V3 did it with concentrated liquidity now they have V4 with their hooks um which they're basically trying to modularize it even further but some of the protocols are other protocols I've been looking at are taking it even further than that basically and making it so generalized that it just provides a lot more value to the liquidity provider itself so those are some of the the things that I'm paying um close attention to in generally as well like I guess you could call these D5 protocols but I call them stake Phi so things like eigenlayer of course with restaking and newer LST protocols that maybe you're trying to do something a bit different than the older ones those sorts of things I'm interested in as well uh and and yeah that's what that's basically in the kind of defy sphere what I'm what I'm looking at right now yeah those are had some good takes I'm a plus one on on kind of the Oracle list protocols we did an episode with Dan ellitzer from nascent on the on oracleless protocols that uh folks should go check out as well more money Legos to build here really that's what it comes down to a lot more defy Innovation needs to happen here's another question about account abstraction there's been a lot of talk late last year about account abstraction the beginning of this one around the subject but things seem to have cooled down how needed is account abstraction what are some projects working on this front can you remind us what account abstraction is and then um Telus has there been any movement lately on it or has it cooled down yeah um so basically account abstraction refers to this ability to create these ethereum wallets that basically have superpowers right so essentially they're sometimes referred to as things like a smart contract wallets um where basically you can have controls in place like whitelists directly on the wallet itself so not so you can have white lists on like your metamask wallet for example right but with a smart contract well you could have it inbuilt into your actual public private key pair itself uh as a smart contract I mean that's a crude analogy because smart contracts don't have have kind of like private Keys here but um from that kind of perspective that's how how it would work and you could have like spending limits things like that you could do things like um uh multiple kind of uh I guess like string together transactions as well so that you can do an approve and swap in one transaction instead of having to approve a token for Swap and then click swap to do it so in two different transactions that I think is very powerful for people because how many times have we all gone to UNI Swap and we've been like I have to approve this token and then I can swap it right so it's just it's better on the ux side of things um but in terms of like how much talk there's been look there there's a lot of development happening in the background but just by the very nature of what this is and how it's not really a speculative thing you're not going to hear much about it unless you're actually looking for for news and updates on it because it is stuff that's happening in the background it's at the infrastructure layer but it is not infrastructure in the sense of a layer 2 or a layer one it's more of like the middleware kind of protocols that you don't hear too much about like for example there is um the graph and chain link as well that are out there but those things have have tokens right so you do hear about them sometimes whereas account abstraction things like the wallet connects and Argent working on these things and people just working on standards they don't have tokens attached to them so there's no speculative attention and generally they don't have much marketing because it's just infrastructure that's being built in the background for now so there is still a lot of stuff happening but what you'll see is a slow rollout to these different wallets because it is a change on the user-facing stuff so to change things for users especially their wallet experience you need to be slow and methodical with that you need to make sure that the users aren't scared if you change something on them that's why something like metamask is slow is so slow to change and they recently did a UI update actually and I looked at it and I was like oh okay this is this is new and I looked at I'm okay here's this this and this but then that's me as a pro user imagine someone that's completely new um using metamask for like a couple months and then it changes on them so when it comes to wallets and integrating with account abstraction they have to be very careful they have to definitely do it as a gradual roll out a slow roll out so that's probably why you're not hearing too much about it and generally when you hear something talked about a lot in in like maybe a couple month period it's because people are releasing all these new things that they've been working on and they're doing it at like major events such as Eve Denver as a kind of marketing tool so to speak but generally most of the time you won't hear about these things unless you're actively looking looking for it be on the lookout though for these improved to account abstraction while it's smart contract wallets is is sort of what you'll see and the experience if we get this right should be very much like fintech so we're all kind of the gas fees and all the multiple steps and transactions uh it should feel very seamless so I don't know I think we're probably a year away a year to like three years from this go like getting really good in polished but the infrastructure is starting to be built um some takes this week here's one I take about the Fink effect here um post BlackRock Forbes of course Larry think and BlackRock came out in favor of crypto in Bitcoin um this this poster says Bitcoin suddenly has become Greener helps third world countries and it's not being used by baddies anymore you love to see it and the post links a whole bunch of Articles everything you need to know about Bitcoin in the environment how Bitcoin helps civilians escape the one Sudan Bitcoin Network to reduce more emissions then it's energy sources produce all right the idea here is is of course once big finance and Big Wall Street gets on it Larry think that the BlackRock CEO nothing could be bigger then mysteriously the narrative in mainstream media begins to turn pro-crypto is there anything to this what do you think I mean yeah I guess like Lex is probably cherry picking here to be honest at the same time like but and and to to call something a trend I think you have to have longer than maybe like a few weeks of data but there is something to Media organizations changing their tune based on different Trends right because at the end of the day they're for-profit organizations they don't want to be going against something that's going to you know lose their money or lose them clicks or things like that uh so so yeah they're definitely going to to probably align themselves more closely with these things and at the end of the day they could be doing this as well as a way just to ride another trend of the public having a more favorable view but in reality they don't carry the weight they're just going to publish whatever gets them the most click so I don't know I don't have very much faith in mainstream media that's for sure yes uh do you do one wonders but it's more by algorithms at this point and whether you know this is kind of new ideas being created um okay so one other um take this week I want to ask you about so this was actually somewhat controversial um I said this it's embarrassing that even my crypto friends use venmo not crypto to split a dinner we and we have to change that this cycle we can't guilt people into it um we have to make crypto wallets so useful they're irresistible it's that idea of account abstraction that we were just talking about it's like where's the crypto wallet where like we can I don't care about paying at Starbucks necessarily because that requires like something like a Starbucks point of sale type system all right I'm just talking about you're you're with a bunch of crypto natives right and you just had a dinner and you're gonna go um split the bill or something like that and it's a peer-to-peer transaction and I find myself still using fintech tools for that still using venmo and I wish that wasn't the case here's part of the maybe the the controversy DC investor says it's possible small P2P payments like this are not a value prop of public blockchains in most Societies in fact I'd argue they are not even though the narrative was popular for a long time starting with Bitcoin he's basically saying actually P2P isn't the use case that uh crypto is focused on it should be the more kind of the large you know like store of value would be more of a use case uh for instance or you know collateralized loans or something like that and and P2P microtransactions will be one of the last things we solve I get that but I still want my account abstraction crypto wallet like why am I still banked here I want to be bankless Anthony what's your take on this I think really I agree with DC in the short term and disagree in the long term I think P2P payments are a value prop of of blockchains generally but at the same time we're just way too early still um that doesn't exist a wallet right now that would be able to do this right in a in a cheap way in an efficient way um and also at the end of the day the reason we have dollars in a bank account still we have money in a bank account is because crypto is not integrated with many real world things you can't pay a lot of things uh in crypto right so when that changes it'll be people will have crypto on hand right for everyday expenses and they'll be able to do that venmo payment at dinner or that you know venmo like payment at dinner so I think it really just comes down to building out that infrastructure getting it more integrated with the real world and then eventually we hit the Tipping Point where people are like oh well you know why would I use this old world money when I can use this new world money so to speak right um and yeah it's going to take a while it's definitely more of an end stage crypto adoption thing rather than an early stage and it's going to require a lot of work to get there that's why I said I disagree so I agree with DC investor in the short term disagree uh long term I know people have you know sometimes say well it's been like 15 years since bitcoin's been out and we still don't have P2P payments it's like yeah because Bitcoin isn't suited for it right ethereum layer 1 is not suited for it ethereum layer 2's are just getting started now um stable coins uh you know in terms of being used for uh uh at scale on ethereum they're not that old right um and the infrastructure obviously is getting better all the time but at the end of the day we're still super early I think we're we're still way too early for the world that that you want Ryan unfortunately but it's a world that I want as well but I think it'll come with time that's cool and you know I you're talking about like you know it's been it's been 15 years right why don't we have this you know what we do have though and this is sort of um I I was reminded by this after I had tweeted it's actually the a project manager at PayPal product manager at PayPal um he he sent me after this he DM me and he's like yo you know we could do this crypto thing in venmo and he just sent me .005 eth in venmo as if this say like yo we got this like we can do this too and um he has a you know dot eth name so this is somebody who's uh clearly crypto pilled inside the company at PayPal and venmo building this out and so it was kind of cool in my venmo app in fintech to receive some eth and of course like it's an IOU um but I uh for eth right it's Cassie it's not fully bankless so it's not the full vision but we have gotten to this stage in 15 years and venmo and PayPal have I don't know hundreds of millions 400 million or something um customers worldwide that's absolutely massive progress that we're able to do this and recently I think was within the last six to 12 months venmo has also enabled the ability to withdraw to a bank list non-custodial address which is a big step so now we also have an off ramp from these systems anyway I was uh we were sending money back and forth and um I'm at the stage where I'm trying to get uh AML kyc of course in order to send him back the money on his uh on his bank list address and I'm almost there um but look man that's progress that's very cool the the original I don't know back in 2013 or back when you started getting into uh Bitcoin Anthony imagine being able to buy a crypto native asset in a fintech tool and send that to a friend even if it's fully custodians like that is progress and you know I think I think we're getting there we're just in this weird interim phase mm-hmm yeah it definitely is progress I mean as you said it is custodial so it's like the easy way of doing this so to speak because you can just run a ledger in the background and there's no need to do on-chain transactions for this so it's just it's like a centralized exchange right um yeah well yeah essentially it's a side chains with you which isn't necessarily a bad thing but yeah I guess the dream that you were referencing in your other tweet was the fully bankless non-custodial payments we'll be we'll get there we'll get there eventually but yeah I still think it's it's too early unfortunately I don't want to be doing this podcast with you in like five to ten years and still not there yet all right like we gotta yeah yeah I want this to move um all right well a last question I have for you this week as we uh bring this to a wrap is um another question I put out on Twitter the world thinks crypto is a scam how do we change that perception uh what's your take on this Anthony sasano um this idea that crypto is a scam obviously you and I disagree most listeners will also disagree but um the world thinks it is how we change that so I really think it's a it's perception at the end of the day right like there are so many scams in the world that aren't perceived as scams because they are marketed in such a way that convinces the general populace that they are not a scam and you could stretch the definition of scam to meet a lot of different criteria right but there are certain things that people say are scams like so let's say uh student loans in the US they're predatory uh you know they have high interest rates they lock people in for a very long time and people can some people consider them a scam right but then there are other things that uh may may also look like a scam but no one's calling it a scam because they've been able to successfully Market themselves as not a scam and I think when it comes to crypto we both believe it's not a scam and we and we obviously there are scams in crypto but so how do we change that perception and I think that it's a very a tough task to do because there is no centralized marketing for or crypto right there is no crypto Overlord that says this is the way we're going to Market crypto to the masses at the end of the day it's a very disjointed ecosystem uh very decentralized ecosystem that has different uh sectors towards some people will never you know pay attention to uh certain assets but pay attention to other ones or pay attention to certain sectors and not other ones some people will spend all their time at nfts but not look at defy at all for example right um and and let's say you're in nfts and you get rugged a bunch of times you're like you're going to throw up your hands and be like oh my God crypto's all a scam you know screw this right so I think it is just a perception thing at the end of the day so how do we change that perception I don't have a good answer to that and I was reading through the replies and I'm like it's kind of funny reading the replies I was thinking the whole time I'm like there are so many different replies that it speaks to exactly what I was saying that because there is no Central Overlord dictating The Narrative or dictating the marketing you're going to get all these different replies that imply different things and there's not going to be a a kind of like correct answer here out so I don't have a good answer for this but I think that people should read through the replies on your Tweet to get the different answers and get the different perspectives here uh but generally if if you kind of held the guns in my head and said like okay you have to answer this you have to have a take on this I would say let's just keep building right let's just keep building okay Building Products people want to use that actually provide value and eventually if we build things that enough people use and it it shouldn't change that perception and change the narrative in the the minds of the masses um but uh but yeah even in that world it may not right it may not be a thing it may it may not happen for a lot longer after we do that but yeah we'll have to see how that plays out so we just need the builders to build and then we just need some time and your other messages hey scam is in the eye of the beholder right well yeah I mean it is though because like there are legit scams in crypto that people don't think are scams and I'm like this is literally a scam dude like it's pretty obviously a scam and they're like no it's not it's not a scam I can't tell time sometimes in crypto I feel like we overuse the term scam and other times I feel like we don't use it enough other times I'm like well no we should call these things out uh so I I just don't even know how I feel about that but um yeah it's uh it's interesting we definitely have a narrative problem right now but of course we will when prices are down uh let's get to the meme of the week here this is a tweet from uh spreck crypto Company announcement translation guide uh in one column today is my last day I'm excited to spend more time with family working on new projects what that really means is I'm quitting because of massive fraud and looming legal actions here's another one what it means if you're looking for the translation we are excited to announce our expansion too insert island nation state what that really means is we are under investigation by the cftc uh we are excited to announce our expansion to the UK that really means this we are under investigation by the SEC I love this all right what decentralization actually means Founders and investors are ready to dump their tokens on you wow that is um uh I think a um you know a negative take of course but uh well that's where we are in the market cycle so I found this funny that's your meme of the week this week um Anthony the daily way keeps on popping out videos I'm gonna give you a
