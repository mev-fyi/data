vitalik did a Twitter spaces says ordinals have revived Bitcoin Builder culture he praised ordinals and the brc20 token standard Bitcoin doesn't need any of this because it is literally just a dollar store ethereum it's not doing anything better than ethereum I think pointers are going to hate you for that on both sides sorry yeah I think so but like why are you compromising on what makes Bitcoin special I think people are going to look at that and be like Bitcoin is not this unchanging thing that we can kind of store our value in and be certain that it's going to be very similar if not the same in 10 years as it is today
