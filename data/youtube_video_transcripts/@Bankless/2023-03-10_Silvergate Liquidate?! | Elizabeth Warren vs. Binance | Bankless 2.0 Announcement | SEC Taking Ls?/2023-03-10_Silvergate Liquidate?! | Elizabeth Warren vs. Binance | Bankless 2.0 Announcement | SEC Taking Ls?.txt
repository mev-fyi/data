zero of the machinskyness we gotta work on this all right markets what are the markets this week Bitcoin Bitcoin down it's a it's a sad week and we're going to talk about why shortly okay uh started the week at 23 500 down 8.7 percent oof uh down to twenty one thousand five did the FED do this is this why the FED did this one yeah the FED did yes we were like uh I'm not some sort of Market Guru but my sentiments were like bully bully bully and then the FED came it was like No No Bully no you can't have that not this week not yet not yet you tell me Powell doesn't care that eat Denver was going on and he was just strike us down anyway he's not coming off the high of each Denver and he's just like pushing down crypto prices can you do that to us we were just having way too much fun out there he's like that is an illegal amount of fun so I'm going to raise rates that's what happened how about youth price also sad uh started the week at 16.50 down 7.3 to where we are now at 15.25. well you know what we had what did we have three four good weeks in a row we had a good we had a good attempt it was it was fun while we were well it lasted now we're back down to Goblin Town down we go this isn't goblet this isn't Goblin well like what is Goblin Town tea right now this phase of the market uh I mean if we get down to 1200 maybe below 1300 I will say we are have a Bitcoin uh no ether price 1200 not 12 000. okay oh God if we're at 12 000.99 circle we did something wrong uh yeah right so this is maybe this is the run up to like 1700 that ether had and like whatever Bitcoin got to 25 000. um maybe that was the mid the year high maybe look man maybe it's the same people it's still the same people that are in so like if you were holding three weeks ago you're holding last week you're holding the week before you're still holding now I feel like this is the same crowd it's not like yeah yeah right A minor run up and we're like oh krypto's back that has not happened yet anyway so we're just grabbing with the same people in the market uh and I'm not surprised I think this is just part of the build Market that we're in this is a here's my take is that um I'm always I'm the purple Bowl we're both permeables here uh I think that there's like regulatory fud that keeps on hammering oh yeah and crypto is scared of that and it's always been scared of regulatory flood like regulatory flood comes in crypto dumps and it dumps for like a day or a week but it never is sustained it's always a short-term blip my bold case is that that is also true of this uh Rising interest rate fears is like yeah crypto's like oh no interest rates still not over yet and then we'll like we're right we're ready to move on from all of the shenanigans and so it's gonna we're gonna keep on taking these blows but they're not systemic blows they are short-term blows and so so long as the blows keep on coming the prices are are going to be suppressed as soon as they stop coming Ryan I think it's bullish so like there's yeah Chris bernitski put out the sweet not too long goes like it's a Bitcoin is a beach ball that's trying to like rise to the surface as soon as the fed and soon as Elizabeth Warren goes away that ball is poking right up but right now they're doing a pretty good job of pushing it down but it's like beach ball underwater underwater excuse me yeah the beach ball is underwater yeah and so crypto wants to rise it just keeps getting pummeled but the the point is that equilibrium is that crypto wants to rise it needs external forces to keep it suppressed that's my take right now good take good take I I support that take David I made that one up just now how about the Bitcoin Ethan price what do you think uh we are up 1.5 on the week above 0.07 for the first time in a while we are at .071 I want to thank Kraken for providing these incredible charts this is all by way of Kraken Pro and let me remind you Kraken was a crypto exchange and a crypto platform that did not fail you mm-hmm in 2022 these are one of the good guys one of the ogs that been with us from the beginning doing things the right way uh and uh putting out some great charts yeah history like go back to go back a year from and now on the weekly roll up like go to a 2021 weekly roll up and see just Ryan floundering on the charts sorry right and now look at him now look at me now Look at how good these charts I got candles I got uh ratios at the end man that's just great yeah I got the sole Bitcoin uh ratio if I want that how's that doing oh it's down still not great it's still not great no I don't but I like to keep it there just for fun because I can uh crypto market cap are we above a trillion well yeah but not by much we are at 1.02 trillion just starting to get holding it there yeah below a trillion is starting to feel embarrassed it's starting to feel not Goblin Town Goblin Town for me is like yes yeah I don't think we got down to 600 million 800 million's Goblin Town what did we do let's let's look at it I think we got down to seven High the high 700 million what do I have to do Max see this is not a nice um charts let me see their charts are not charts I can't see it here yeah you're oh actually whatever I've given up on this chart Kraken can you guys do a total crypto market cap chart please crack in please um let's get into some market news okay so we alluded to this but here's a Reuters headline the FED Pals preview the fed's Powell previous tougher rate hike path starting soon um here's a quote from Fed chair Powell who controls all things Marcus of course we know is he is um the god the god dollars and Powell is the word of high priest how is the post yeah uh the the pope um nothing about the data suggests to me that we've tightened too much indeed it's just that we still have work to do it's getting uh getting hawkish on the rate hikes there it's hard to make the case that we've with that we've over tightened means we need to continue to tighten that's what he said there was a I saw this clip David I want to play it for you I don't know if you've seen this but this was a Warren versus Powell on this very point and as we get into this clip oh busy Powell is saying hey we need to fix inflation here's how we have to do it you you keep tightening until inflation is fixed and Warren is saying but what about a recession what about the jobs what about my voters right so uh let's play this I want to get your reaction to this you ready I haven't seen this okay putting two million people out of work is just part of the cost and they just have to bear it well they will will working people be better off if if we just walk away from our jobs and and inflation remains five six percent let me ask you about what happens if you do this since the end of World War II there have been 12 times in which the unemployment rate has increased by one percentage Point within one year exactly what you're aiming to do right now how many of those times did the U.S economy avoid falling into a recession you know it's it's not as black and white as it varies written a book on this and there's been 12 times that we've been a one point increase in the unemployed in the unemployment rate in a year that's exactly what your fed report has put out is the projection and the plan based on how you're going to keep raising these interest rates how many times did the economy fail to fall into a recession after doing that out of 12 times I think the number is zero I think the number is zero that's exactly right so there you go she's like trying to do a Checkmate on on on Powell gotcha we're gonna lose jobs you're gonna send us into a recession and Powell's responses inflation is worse inflation is also not good for American citizens nor workers nor there's two million people it erodes and and Warren is saying but you're going to cause a recession this way what's interesting and then he says yeah you're right and she's like gotcha and he's like you idiot read a book like I I feel for him because he's like trying to explain himself but she won't let him and when I see this clip I just see like this is the politician playing the politician game yes and it's so cringe man it's so cringe let's remember that politicians are definitely influencers and they are happy to throw anyone under the bus including Central Bankers right uh if it if it scores them influencer clout points right this is this is the the state trying to politicize the money this is the the fact that obviously this is working because we just played the clip like it was just that's the exchange but I do think that there is a pressure from Congress coming to Powell saying you can't cause a recession but Pal's going like well what are you guys going to do about inflation right what's interesting to me David is Congress doesn't they don't have answers to what we're going to do about inflation in fact I would argue that a lot of the consumer CPI inflation is actually not Powell's fault you guys know we are not Powell simps at Banquets right there's a lot of things that Central Bankers do that are not awesome for like all sorts of things right they definitely have their their hands on the money printer but you know who else does fiscal policy right Congress our executive branch they can also print money and they did a lot of that fiscal spending during during only print money that is I've been to the right chart I think you can say Central Bankers are largely responsible for massive wealth inequality Masset asset price inflation since like the bailouts of 2008 it's been up since like policies in the beginning but I don't think you can point to them and say Hey you are the sole reason for the last two to three years of CPI inflation you can't you have to take responsibility for fiscal policy and the fact that countries are overspending relative to the tax earnings and you so you have to either increase taxes or you have to not spend as much and there is no accountability on Congress to actually do so I feel like they're kind of throwing Powell under the bus and I can't believe I'm defending battle right now but I said the same things like wow I'm on Powell's side on this Elizabeth versus Powell debate oh my gosh uh anyway like what what does this mean for crypto look battles back and forth um it means that fiscal policy and the money printer will continue to like Gober like I I think no matter what I think some of that's going to come from Congress some of that's going to come from Central Bankers right and political influence of aggregate Congressional members is significantly more than what the FED can probably withstand probably and no one wants to pay like we don't want to swallow the difficult medicine we don't want to get off the morphine trip we don't want to reduce our quality of life because that's ultimately what this means it's like do we want to pay back our debts do we want to increase interest rates well we all need to stop start consuming less we all need to start being more efficient we all need to stop having this extravagant American lifestyle that we're used to over the last 50 years and no one wants to hear that especially not the Boomers let's talk about that um what about the debt here read the suite out uh the US now has a record 16.5 trillion in household debt a record 11.9 trillion in mortgages a record 1.6 trillion in auto loans a record 986 billion in credit card debt this is what I was talking about this is the extravagant lifestyle we're beyond our means as a country we have been for my entire life all of probably all these listeners entires lives total Mortgage Debt is on double the 2006 Peak right before the 2008 crash meanwhile 30 of Americans have more credit card debt than savings with balances rising at the fastest Pace since 1999. this is what all while mortgages rates just hit 7.1 percent and credit card debt hit a record 25 we are fighting inflation with debt this cannot end well wow that's a long tweet yeah okay but by the way how oftu like how long can tweets be now oh my gosh like you can keep going it's not only what oh yeah you can they're almost Limitless dude Limitless tweets I don't know if I like that but yeah we're inflating if inflation is the name of the game these days got inflate tweets yeah inflating our tweets the Twitter money printer keeps uh going forward stable coin check-in let's talk about crypto markets for a second though um usdt is on the rise it's the highest level in 15 months that is of course tether David why is tether going up this has got to be as a result of outflows from busd right so busd going down USD going up right that's got to be the conclusion here I think that's what's happening yeah um tether's gain came mostly at the expense of busd after the Pax announcement we talked about that last week announcing they were halting new minting of busd and it's grown 5.3 billion to a total of 71 billion dollars in tether which um is tether fully backed we think so kind of mostly I don't know that's not that's not tether's product brother tether's products is being an awful offshore stable coin that's right and that's what busd was maybe filling part of and tether is just going to take that so the U.S system has no ability to go find hunt down tether um can they do that I mean this is outside of the the bounds of U.S jurisdiction right but the US does have jurisdiction over some other things we're going to talk about that when we come back David what are we cover next Silver Gate liquidate it's the only true words I'll say about that uh Elizabeth Warren Returns versus binance and the SEC taking an L perhaps two is the tide turning against uh the SEC and we'll probably talk about some youth Denver chatter as well among other things also of course beyond all of that the biggest news of the week bankless 2.0 you know that's coming so we're going to get to all that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that makes this show possible especially Kraken our strategic sponsor for 2023 who supplies this Market section of the

crypto Bank silvergate announces a voluntary liquidation David why would you voluntarily liquidate What's Happening Here uh you would voluntarily liquidate when things look so bad that you don't see any viable paths forward and so crypto friendly silvergate Bank of course has said that is going to unwind its assets and wind down operations of silvergate Capital Corporation a quote from silvergate in light of recent industry and Regulatory developments silver it believes that an orderly wind down of Bank operations in a voluntary voluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward the banks wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits so that's good news all deposits will be fully overpaid according to the liquidation plan the company did not say how it plans to resolve claims against its businesses um silvergate is a crypto bank is one of the two main banks for serving crypto companies along with new york-based Signature Bank is the other main one um just as a size comparison silvergate had over 11 billion dollars in assets compared with uh 114 billion dollars at signature I didn't know that so signature that's much bigger yeah okay the FDIC was in Urgent talks with silvergate to find ways to save the crypto friendly Bank from shutdown uh FDIC examiners arrived at the firm's headquarters last week and have been since reviewing the firm's books and Records the department is evaluating compliance with all Financial laws as well as safety and soundness obligations and is working close with relevant Federal counterparts so I think there's probably a big question out there is like was it silvergate's fault or was it external forces that have caused this um I don't will have to find out I don't know if there's any reason to suspect silvergate of anything but I guess we're going to find out either way what do you have a take on this round well a lot of people in crypto are saying that this is basically a run on the bank sure perpetrated by people in power those regulators and politicians going on the megaphone and saying like the operation choke point sorts of sorts of measures people like Elizabeth Warren for example broadcasting this and saying withdrawal withdraw funds from these crypto banks these crypto companies and I would say the broader point is like remember guys we live in a fractional Reserve banking system right that means any Bank whether it's Wells Fargo Bank of them any Commercial Bank that that you use operates on faith operates it's on faith and so if there was a run on the bank and you decided to withdraw all of us decide to withdraw all of our money at once that's it we can't all get it it doesn't exist guys it doesn't existence that's how the system works yes it's a figment of our imagination it's all kind of on The Ledger and it all works as long as everyone trusts it and the FDIC has a you know 250k guarantee in all of these things so there is some element David where um yes they probably were sloppy in areas is kind of my my take right now based on the evidence I've seen yes silvery gate could have done additional AML kyc in places um they could have had some you know tighter uh risk policies but I don't think it this is not an FTX type situation right I don't think that there was anything incredibly nefarious going on at least the evidence hasn't uh borne that out yet but what I do know is there has absolutely been a run on this bank and perpetuated in in some in some cases by regulatory Congressional influencers who are pushing silvergate towards the edge and to that extent I mean I would say that is extremely irresponsible right just just to start this from from the beginning of like a run on the bank is a fear and emotion based phenomenon from all Bank from all customers clients depositors of that bank and so if there is this run on the bank that's happening and the reason why silvergate is shutting down is because there's just so much net outflow out of the bank because everyone is fearful that silvergate is going under and that fear perpetuates right like turns into a mind virus we have to ask ourselves why did that fear happen in the first place yeah what what's what is the the patient zero or the the trigger of that fear do you have an answer for me Ryan I mean I I think obviously the entire Market is incredibly jittery coming off of um FTX um I'm not sure who exactly the patient zero is or what um I do know that uh the White House is making some comments on the back of this this is the presser secretary at the White House in recent weeks banking Regulators have released guidelines and how Banks should protect themselves from risks associated with crypto as you know this is a president that is repeatedly called on Congress to take action to protect everyday Americans from the risk posed by digital assets and he will continue to do so the risk by digital assets so that's what's being thrown under the bus here is uh is crypto it's digital assets this is Senate Banking Committee friend of banks I might say sherard Brown saying as the impact of ftx's collapse continues to Ripple outward today we are seeing what can happen when a bank is over reliant on a risky volatile sector like cryptocurrencies so whatever is happening David whether this is a bank run and kind of silvergate is somewhat a victim in the situation or whether silvergate did some things that were irresponsible and they're not a victim they are responsible we do know that that politicians are definitely ready and eager to throw crypto under the bus and throw crypto banking under the bus and to me this is just like the continuation of the operation choke point we've been talking about for the last like since the beginning of this year right yeah this is such a nefarious line uh as the impact of ftx's collapse continue to Ripple outwards today we are seeing what can happen when a bank is over rely on risky volatile sector like cryptocurrencies FTX was not cryptocurrencies FTX was a bank that was pushed offshore and in the and with all of those quality products that drove people into FTX not enabled to be held held onshore by onshore Banks this was on a cryptocurrencies problem as we know as we've reported on Bank list for quarters now every single defy app in the crypto World held up completely solvently FTX which is a bank which was ignored by the SEC and all of the onshore regulated entities were hamstrung by onshore regulation and so the Ft FTX incident explodes comes back to hit this is a banking crisis this is it happens that there are crypto rails it is a banking crisis that is the the center of this the public opinion The public's not going to understand the details maybe people in the crypto Community will but like they're going to paint this as a problem with crypto I mean Sherrod Brown continues I've been concerned that when Banks get involved in crypto it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price when Banks get involved in crypto what do you think that means they're going to continue to choke the banking sector from touching this whole asset class of crypto that's very disturbing to me David we have a Elizabeth Warren tweet here what does this say oh boy my favorite uh Elizabeth Warren says as the bank of choice for crypto silvergates bank's failure is disappointing but predictable I warned of silvergate's risky if not illegal activity and identified severe due diligence failures now customers must be made whole and Regulators should step up against crypto risk so in my mind Ryan I'm just saying regulators putting undue burdens upon the crypto banking sector and then as a result of those burdens and perhaps you know also other things FTX and interest rates but also as a result of what Elizabeth Warren is doing here in this tweet putting undue burdens upon the crypto banking sector then the big crypto banking sector fails and then she's like I told you so even though she's part of the problem that caused it to not be a well-service industry in the first place remember Tyler Cowan's caution uh he wrote an editorial about this came out our podcast he was like Hey I'm most worried that regulators and those in Congress will backlash far too far and yes there was problems with FTX but you're really going to try to choke United States citizens U.S citizens from this entire asset class I worry about that that's what's going on I think Nick Carter had a fantastic take here on celery gate he said this about silvergate about the situation we're just talking about the politicians are now telling us that because a single Bank peaking at 16 billion in assets that's silvergate wound down in an orderly manner making depositors whole no one lost money here David no deposit or lost money affecting no one but shareholders causing no knock-on effects that crypto firms must be shut out of the banking system right those holding Equity the shareholders of silvergate lost in this that's how it should be that's how this works it's a risk asset holding Equity is a risk asset that the the company is going to go bankrupt of course so in that sort of situation Equity holders get liquidated no one that deposited funds in silvergate has lost anything so like a bank wound down in a correct and orderly fashion and Elizabeth Warren is like grave dancing yeah is that is that what's going on I think so I mean Nick Carter Nick goes on and says they cry out safety and soundness will will chipping away at the foundation and then act Vindicated when the structure starts to crumble I think that's what's going on here um yeah here's another thing yeah so this is a take from Mike from blockworks Liz Warren has a 67 million dollar net worth even though her salary is 285 000 per year either she saved 100 of her earnings for 235 years or she's making money another way I love this why do you love this well this just calls into question the legitimacy of what she's doing right she's an influencer who is talking against other people's bags our bags are crypto bags and then she's uh what Mike is implying here is making money in ways that we don't understand and so as an influencer of the State uh he is calling into question the legitimacy of where she has made her money I think that's a good thing to call into question yeah I get it I think if if and if people think that that's below the belt I think that what Elizabeth Warren is doing is I don't necessarily think it's below the belt I do worry a little bit about the kind of the just because someone's wealthy doesn't mean they made it in like nefarious ways and we don't know the source of of her wealth but um yeah I 67 million dollars brother it's a lot that's a lot of wealth um let's talk about this Finance under scrutiny as well that is happening this week this is a letter sent yesterday by well Senator Warren I guess this is the senator Warren episode Senator Warren is the main character this week Van Hollen and Marshall to binance and binance us it's absolutely devastating this this tweet says they are flat out accusing binance of Fraud and money laundering this is not good for CZ have you read this letter what's the tldr D here David yeah basically well it's a pretty damning accusation of CZ and binance's operations basically saying that binance has uh knowingly enabled money laundering reduced kyc compliance checks allows allowed for higher and higher limits of non-kyc accounts in order to trade on binance in order to just like make Revenue right like that's that's their business model uh It also says that accuses them of creating binance us as like the compliant uh distraction uh so that your binance itself could grow larger offshore and do all of its perhaps elicit ways of you know generating Revenue that part's true right we all saw it that's probably true yeah um another thing is like I wouldn't necessarily rush to the defense of binance here um I think uh also we know that CZ and Justin Sun are buddies and we know that Justin's son uh ex used his uh ownership over poloniex remember that one article Justin's son was like just pass any kyc check always pass never fail always pass doesn't matter remember that that's the story that came out right and so like though they're they're very close with each other this is kind of I I don't really think anyone's really going to rush to the defense of Finance here uh so it's tough you know it's tough well so is this the big that's different than fraud is that the big charge here that they were bypassing AML kyc yeah basically they were negligently enabling like money laundering and illicit use of binance whether or not they were the ones actually doing it is a different story I don't know if that's what this is charging them but yeah this is the Wall Street Journal breaking some things about binance too what does this say uh this says text from crypto giant binance reveals plan to elude U.S authorities so this was uh messages revealed from CZ and binance Leadership saying hey we're totally going to do our best to circumnavigate evade U.S regulations we're going to spin up binance U.S in order to like prop that up and have that be like the fall the you know the subject of their scrutiny and their that thing is going to be totally compliant but Meanwhile we're going to do all the Shady stuff in the back um and this but apparently that has been explicitly made in text form and leaked to the Wall Street Journal so what's the take here then are are we back to like okay uh is this all true are the are the Regulators right are they right in stamping out this entire industry from the United States because it's only full of scammers is that what binance is doing here what do you say to this I say this is all just so tiring man what part of it I got I got I got nothing it's like damn it it's like we need to have regulation but our Regulators are being shitty at it like it's there's it's a double-edged sword bad people on both sides yes this is like no one's got it right dude I just I don't it's like I don't we don't know enough to to know if what CC's doing I do know he's smarter than SBF um oh that's for sure um just don't know and how how would we know it's a centralized exchange we just don't know it's it's it's by Nature it's trust based but we do know that no one is talking here about like okay Central centralized exchanges are failing us in a variety of ways here's how we could Shore up the regulation for centralized exchanges right and by the way isn't it cool American citizen that crypto has also provided a self-sovereign option called decentralized Finance which you can audit on chain we never have to question whether it's a fraud we never have to question whether it's fully backed or has reserves as proof of reserves built in they're not pointing people in that direction they're saying the whole crypto thing is a fraud is a scam right they're not engaging with the members of the crypto Community who are like yeah we hate fdx2 and SPF and by the way we've been saying that for a long period of time that like um we're worried about centralized exchange as a as an attack Vector um you know they're not engaging with us at That level so it doesn't feel collaborative so yeah I I share your frustration I don't like but they've got us in the spot where they can just point to like five to ten scams last year in crypto bad things that happen and say look I told you I like Elizabeth I was right I was right I predicted this I told you this was going to happen it's a difficult situation yeah I'll put on my uh libertarian free market anti-state hat uh and say that binance has banked more people than any with his technology and his crypto rails and binance smart training for that matter has banked more people using crypto technology than any nation state has ever done ever with a cbdc or any of their Legacy Traditional Financial system so I'm sure there's nothing I'm sure there's a lot of skeletons in the closet of binance I'm sure there's money laundering happening I'm sure CZ is aware of it probably I don't know any of this stuff but like I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff that pisses off the state but like my Eric Voorhees raw human perspective is that binance is unequivocally a net positive for the world in terms of banking the unbanked and allowing Financial Freedom to proliferate um that's my take I think there's a way for Regulators in Congress to cooperate with the finances of the world rather than just attacking them trying to stamp this thing out of existence uh David this is somewhat related to SEC snubbed as Voyager wins Court approval for the sale to binance it's a voyager that defunct I guess crypto Bank crypto lending and borrowing platform is us trying to sell to finance us and is that going through uh well it looks like it the Voyager is the one that lent out that unsecured 660 million dollar loan to three hours Capital which I'm assuming they haven't gotten back that's safe safe to say uh but approval was granted by United States bankruptcy judge Michael Willis whale Wiles uh which came four days after arguments presented by Voyager in the United States Securities Exchange Commission were processed by that judge judge says this can proceed uh and so this is actually really good news for anyone who's lost um money on Voyager this article is claiming that if you have a voyager customer an impacted Voyager customer you are going to get back approximately 73 percent wow absolutely 73 which is a very precise number for saying the word approximately um so that's great news that's great news that is great um definitely this judge's decision comes over a week after 97 of the 61 300 Voyager account holders found uh were voted in favor of the current binance U.S restructuring plan according to a February 28 filing that's pretty cool that's what shareholders want it sounds like um grayscale versus the SEC David this next story is I think a win if you were asking yourself in in the last uh two stories we were talking about like where are the checks and balances here uh how do how do we stop this type of activity I think the court system is one possible solution to that so this is um judges that are skeptical of the sec's argument in the grayscale versus Bitcoin ETF hearing can you tell us about that David yeah so this is a core that has reviewed the facts and circumstances of the grayscale Bitcoin ETF uh application uh we want the grayscale trust the gbdt trust to fold into elegantly and cleanly a Bitcoin ETF a spot Market Bitcoin ETF we have we have a Bitcoin Futures Market ETF why not a Bitcoin spot Market why do we want that we want that Ryan because right now the gbtc asset trades at a 45 discount to actual gbtc and so of all the Bitcoins that are in the gbtc trust locked in there one way can't come out for they are worth only 55 of their actual real value because uh no one there's not enough demand for gbtc partly because of the whole like grayscale three arrows Capital like Loop so retail is getting screwed basically yeah so there is uh like how much is the grayscale pptc trust let me go look that up real quick and so as a result of that discount there is a 4 billion dollar our Gap and what that means is that gbtc owners collectively are short for a billion dollars there's four billion dollars of wealth that could be created if the SEC allowed for a spot Market Bitcoin ETF out of grayscale they could make four billion dollars just appear out of thin air if they did this and so the judge is like hey SEC why aren't you doing that uh which is a really good question why aren't you protecting investors right this is like the the second judge facilitating Capital markets yeah you know the whole Vision on your website you can make four billion dollars why aren't you doing it for retail the people that you're supposed to protect uh this is the second judge saying this who's skeptical of the sec's decision to approve the Futures ETF but not the spot one not the one that we all want the SEC hasn't offered any information that the petitioners are wrong uh the judge says SEC has to explain why they're wrong yes they do thank you some accountability ability David you and I could say it all day crypto Twitter can say it all day a judge is requiring them to answer that question and that is a nice check and balance that's a product of our system and I'm glad that we have it right now Gary genser is like uh well um well so you know how uh office hours with Care office hour yeah turn it into an influencer video Gary yeah so uh that's what's going on there and maybe some hope for the future there of some of this power gets checked by the court system David what do we have coming up next come actually have an onslaught of coinbase news all of it good thank God so there's like four things that we're going to talk about all related to coinbase uh tornado cash 2.0 pulls a jiu jitsu move against privacy haters we're going to talk all about that uh we got you in a swap wallet we got our eth supply and most importantly Ryan the biggest news of the week which is bankless 2.0 so all those details and more coming right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make Bank list 2.0 possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 unit swap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts how many total airdrops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed air drops that you can get and it also does poapps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop so plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop and we are back but first watch this sick promo video for bankless 2.0 it's loading [Music] um that's great I love that that keeps me on repeat here it is bankless.com thankless tuna though it's here it's our new website uh we have fully migrated from sub stack at this point we're listening to it uh we are doing this so that we can start being much more of a crypto native Media company and uh you know what's cool about this David is I'm not sure we entirely know what that means all right the the point is we can find out we're gonna explore our own Frontier we have our own Frontier now are we gonna front run the opportunity here we're a front running opportunity yeah bankless is going from just like you know being all web 2E uh to we I think we have one of the best platforms to experiment and innovate and iterate about web three things natively because now we have our own settlement this is our settlement this is our home this is this is our home on the internet on this protocol that we call home uh everyone's welcome uh what are we doing here we're obviously we're posting the podcast ass this roll up that you're listening to will appear here we're posting our articles everything we write we have this thing called a daily brief if you only listen to bankless and you don't consume it in your inbox every day you have to start consuming it that way as well the Daily Brief it's a guide to crypto for every day we're posting that here there is a fantastic ability to search for different guides David if you want you can tag your interests tag your interests if you want Guide to Investing all of our how to's if you want to get into kind of opinion pieces guide to arbitrim guide to optimism guide to polygon it's all here on the website uh the crypto native features all right we had the hardest time in fact substack would never integrate this for us which is our previous platform just paying via crypto right so people would be like uh I'm trying to like sign up for Bank list but you're making me pay with a credit card and we're like oh well there's this separate link we can send it to you it's manuals it was ever really connected right and so um now it's all connected now it's all seamless now it all works you can pay by crypto that's just a simple thing but you can also we're going to add the ability to log in with ethereum right of course so you can access this function we're adding podcast nfts to the post um we're going to do some other things that I can't speak about right now but that are coming soon that we are super excited about and bullish on and in general we just want to grow this movement and grow this community in crypto native ways and push forward into the frontier so that's what we're up to man yeah that's exactly right and if you look on the far left you have you know home listen read tools four little icons for little tabs to explore different places the number of icons there can grow as we grow the number of products and tools and things to do on bankless.com um there's also native poapp minting so yeah this is we we have built the best native in in the browser in the website poapp minting apparatus that I think exists and so there is a PO app to Mint for those that are already bankless subscribers we sadly can't open it up to everyone because we can't like spam attack poapp uh or allow poapp to be spam attacked but if you are already a bankless subscriber including free subscribers uh you can go mint the inaugural ship poapp because we are a ship we are sailing west we're going to a new world ship season uh so go mint that poapp that's a big call to action uh go go do that banklist.com guys uh thank you thank you for all the support thank you for everything for bearing with us here thank you for listening to all the ads that helped finance the building of this uh website it's important we got to build our settlement so uh that's how we're doing it anyway so much more we could talk about David speaking of bankless content and Cool Stuff um you've got some eth Denver video a whole series that will make you feel like you went to East Denver and hung out with David and listened into all the conversations that he was having except for that one conversation last week with the lawyer where you talked about Lido not that one all the other ones though inside joke guys all the good ones to bring back to the nation yeah well so what is this give us the highlights so this is part one of two parts uh every other time I've done this and this has been a recurring theme of like what I do when I go to conferences is I interview people and I bring back um interviews like 20 minute bite size interviews so you can feel like you were there this is I did that twice right two times I eat Denver this is so this is part one this is at the axelr interoperability conference which was like a who's who of interoperability yeah so I was trying to uh Builders yeah all the builders I was trying to understand like all right because like there's ethereum layer twos and layer threes here there's Cosmos people there's the axillar team there's like all of the people doing like Omni chain and layer zero and all that kind of stuff like what is the theme of this conference like clearly it's interoperability I when I was writing about this for the newsletter this is also going to turn into a newsletter on the bank listens that are coming out uh today so you will already have that in your inboxes the theme Ryan is like literally everything that's not the ethereum layer 1 or Bitcoin that was the theme of this conference anyways uh so like Layer Two content uh eigenlayer content Cosmos content uh axillary content so that's part one uh part two is me and Luke uh running around with microphone at a shelling point and East Denver just it's randomly uh Ninja interviewing people we got Kevin owaki and Simona pop from shelling point we got Jessie from base uh we got Victor bunin from coinbase cloud we got Lisa from Aztec uh so many different interviews of people actually at ether that is part two that is coming soon TM absolute Chad of a production team that is pushing this content out within one week post East Denver they helped me film it they helped me get the audio they're processing oh tip of the hat to the to the bankless pod squad tip of the Hat absolutely and of course you can go find all of that content right now at bankless.com banklist.com say it again bankless.com coinbase is doing some things too not just Bank list that's been building coinbase has been building some things today we introduce wallet as a service what is wallet as a service this is a coinbase offering now that makes it seamlessly seamless to onboard users to web3 what is this David yeah so it's an API uh wallet inside of an API I never really thought that was possible which allows companies to create and deploy fully customizable on-chain wallets so users can create access and restore mainly their wallets with authentication as simple as a username and password without needing to worry about seed phrases so they have built a way to allow I'm assuming the rest of web 2 to easily spin up a wallet on demand on notice and like I think the most obvious use case that I'm going just going to imagine off the top of my head Ryan is like you know the digital Collectibles and Instagram yeah what percentage of Instagram users have a wallet Z not zero because there's some but less than one percent yeah less than one less than 0.1 percent I would say so say nft creators who are now able to promote and share their nfts on Instagram that is a feature that is all throughout Instagram now say one of their fans wants to buy that nft does nfan does not have a wallet well Instagram could just ping the coinbase wall API and be like serve this serve this because they want to buy that nft and they could buy that NFC with Trad payment rails like with stripe or whatever and all of a sudden there's a wallet inside of Instagram that is uh accessible by the Instagram authentication Service that's already built in I think that's really weird that's yes non-custodial this is multi-party computation technology to make this non-custodial it can be non-custodial and it can also be custodial it's customizable for both it is really the wall infrastructure that we need to be able to push wallets into every single corner of the internet this is insanely this just makes crypto adoption so easy it lowers the barrier for getting a wallet down to at the absolute we got stripe for crypto wallets uh they also coinbase has also acquired One River digital management now we just um released our episode with Eric Peters he's the CIO of One River he is kind of the institutional crypto guy I mean all the kind of the billionaires with with a lot of money respect Eric Peters and coinbase has now acquired their company is I guess a bridge to institutional investors increasing that all right do you have any other takes on that uh it's just they're doing everything man they're going in every single Direction at once it's pretty cool um including the direction of public relations and I think repairing crypto's image their brand image I know David you wanted uh you wanted us to take a look at this uh this commercial I think this is this is just good content so we're gonna watch this watching this commercial they don't even pay us for this what is this archaic system mother's maiden name evil wits you're telling me this guy is how things get verified that's my job I'm just saying you shouldn't have to buy ten dollars worth of gum if you just want 79 cents worth the gum why do you get charged your money to take your money from your account and if you're out of money they charge you for being out of money what an overseas transfer takes five days business days why what do they use a zeppelin I deposit the check Monday but Monday was a bank holiday why is this the way it is a burnt holiday this system makes no sense this makes no sense who designed this system man really the best we can do hello though we deserve better [Music] it's it's a coinbase ad obviously it is the best PR one minute of PR for the crypto industry as a haul that I've ever seen it's it's it's basically the bank list it's basically Banks suck yeah and we can do better Finance let's use crypto to update it yes that is the message and it's a much better message right I feel like than the 2022 message that crypto was sending which was come here to get really rich right and because you're gonna come get yield yeah and because we have like social boosting nfts right which yeah sure but this is the message this is the long-term message uh we also um are coming out with a podcast with Brian Armstrong so we just talked to him earlier this week I think it's a good kind of recap on everything that crypto is doing you know we spend a lot of time on on regulatory in this episode David and I think that's because that's where crypto is right now that episode comes out Monday but if you are a citizen of the bankless nation that means you are a premium subscriber you should have access to that episode right about now Early Access on banklist.com there you go that's what we were waiting for uh David some cool news with the tornado cash which is a an illegal and not crypto privacy anonymizer it's on the facts it's not illegal it's just illegal for us okay it is it is an agnostic neutral piece of technology it's just illegal for you and me and what are they doing uh so well this isn't anything to do with tornado cash specifically this is not the tornado cash team this is a mean solomoni announcing privacy pools v0 which he is calling the sequel to tornado cash uh also similarly branded as tornado cash uh I think the tldr is it's tornado cash and this additional fun little mechanism that lets you prove the specific anonymity set what does that mean you can prove that you are not a tornado cache user who is of a certain address as in your uh you can achieve privacy versus with this brand new tools without being associated with any other specific address that you determine AKA one on the ofaxing so you can you can prove that you are not and are not interacting with an address on the ofac sanction list so let's say uh you know the ofak finson identifies this particular set of addresses this is North Korea um this is a well-known terrorist group these people are are Bad actors you can prove your innocence essentially using this this tool now and so this should like defang all of the reasons right that the code itself and let's remind people the tornado cash code itself the smart contract on chain if you live in the US ofac fincen the U.S has made it illegal for you to have on-chain privacy because they're saying you might be one of these Bad actors but now you can prove your innocence so doesn't this David defang the whole like I guess um front right uh offensive saying yeah this is because terrorists and criminals and it takes away the whole entire premise of making the tornado cash Mark contracts illegal in the first place there you go yeah your move your move I think amazing stuff I mean everybody people who are listening to bankless know I have like infinite respect for I mean he's the guy that will go toe-to-toe with the with Goliath uh in a heartbeat without this he's a [ __ ] disturber man yeah he really oh he's a sewer of Chaos in the best of ways like chaotic the embodiment of chaotic good um I hope he deploys it on base on base on base chain yeah privacy pulls on base actually fun I'm sure uh coinbase compliance and legal has really appreciated that you just said that David uh well permissionless code you know they made they made their chain permissionless they know what they want to end up for let's see let's see how it goes I mean we want a free permissionless open internet so let's push that boundary if you want to learn more yeah privacypools.com is the place to go there we go all right also banklist.com also after afterbanklist.com yeah make that your next visit uniswap labs they introduced a mobile wallet David you and I got a chance to sit down with Cal who is kind of the lead product design of this wall it's pretty cool I really liked it it's Apple has blocked them from launching in the app store right now but it is available on test flight unfortunately we don't have an access code for you uh in order to get that you had to be listening to the conversation we had earlier this week and there were about 100 of them but here's David he's showing off he's showing off his 48 and 87 cents and a crypto coven that well that's that's worth something and the the access code itself is worth something because uh it'd be pretty cool to use this wallet um I don't know I'm pretty bullish on the future of this I really like the design it's nice and clean I think uniswab is dedicated towards iterating on it a lot of cool things in store and bullish wallets in general wallet innovation in general certainly uh moving on to Rocket pool is set to launch their eight ether mini pools okay how does rocketpool work you have the node operator who spins up a node in the decentralized rocket pool Network they need to put up a bond to make sure that they don't do anything funky with the other people who come and deposit ether into their node so what you do you put in 16 ether one half of what it takes to spin up a node other people backfill that with 16 more ether and boom you have a rocket pull mini node and 16 are ether is minted and distributed into the wild that is a capital intensive way to produce a staked East token and while that is the capital intensivity is how we get uh decentralization and security it is still Capital intensive uh rocketpool has created this system called mini pools which actually lowers the collateral requirement down to eight so instead of putting up a 16 Each Bond you put an eight eth Bond and instead of that being a one to one ratio of your ether to other people's ether it is a one two three ratio where you put in a ether and then 24 ether comes in to create three different rocker pool mini nodes and so the capital efficiency of RPL doubles and then also if you are a node operator you increase the amount of fees that you charge the people who use your node to stake as well so you if you are a node operator you're getting more yield and the total supply of our eth goes up this is a very long awaited upgrade from the rockpool community uh by rocketpool uh it's actually not launched yet it's it's coming it's in uh no later than early April which is one month away so that's pretty very hyping very hype this is rocket Pokemon getting more Capital efficient which is bullish and also our eth is now on Euler which is a lending and borrowing Marketplace a permissionless lending and borrowing Marketplace similar I guess to Ave and compound it's cool to see liquid staking derivatives saturating all of our defy lending platforms yeah our friends at coinbase staking and others liquid staking tokens around would requests that you call them liquid taking tokens not liquids taking derivatives because derivatives have a very specific legal mean somebody's gonna slap me yeah but no worries uh disclaimer uh sorry they are derivatives though for real though sure okay semantics yeah disclaimer bankless holds a bunch of RPL and we also run rocketpool mini nodes uh and then Ryan and I are also Angel Investors into Euler and [ __ ] certainly poly Market tweeting out here David looks like someone knows something about the arbitrim airdrop what is this what is this graph we're looking at Poly Market is a predictions Market that allows people to gamble about the probability of future events and the theory behind prediction markets is that if one or a very low number of people know something that they can sway the entire Market because they can make a gamble so if they know that the arbitrum airdrop is coming by March 31st they would go to this poly Market Market and they would bet that on the knowledge that they have and so as of recently the probability that an arbitrarm airdrop comes by March 31st on poly Market has moved to greater than 50 percent chance uh and so the implication here is that someone knows something and has taken a bet on that market I took this tweet into the arbitrum our telegram with the orbitrum team Ryan I was like hey you guys you guys wouldn't you know drop a token without scheduling a live stream with us first right and they were like like uh they didn't say anything they didn't say it they said you never know but you'll be first to know when we do if we do that kind of thing right yeah exactly yeah as we'd expect so here's something that uh is not news but it's perhaps news we don't know yeah another another rumor David another room for perpetuating thank you Ryan more rumors of rumors Cosmos governance they gave the green light to Interchange security I remember um Zaki telling us a little bit about this when we had them on the episode for the cosmos thesis if you want to hear about that you can go listen to that episode in the archive at where David where can they go find that um bankless.com bankless.com go there right now yes anyway uh they're actually doing it so what does this mean what is interchange security right so uh Cosmos is the app chain mesh network uh Vision it is basically the ethereum layer 2 layer 3 Vision without the layer one so if you take out if you only have networks like connected to other networks and you don't have these single shared security model of ethereum that's Cosmos um it's a mess it's a mesh uh Cosmos has given the green light to Interchange security that is Cosmos becoming more like ethereum so they are starting to enshrine Cosmos Hub as the Central Security provider for the rest of all app chains that opt into that security which is kind of like the ethereum L2 thesis and so Adam is starting to fill these shoes that ether is for ethereum that's in token it's a cosmos yes exactly and so like when I was talking to Sunny uh agarwald about this forever ago he's like yeah the cosmos and ethereum long term conclusion of that design pattern is actually the same pattern they have just started at different paths arbitrum excuse me not arbitrum Cosmos I got an arborstone token on my mind uh Cosmos has uh opted in to prioritize the app chain mesh Network Vision First shared security later ethereum did the shared security layer one first also ether's money first and now is now moving into layer twos and layer threes the conclusion is the same uh this is as the ethereum layer 2 layer three a super chain hyper hyper scaling Vision starts to unfold Cosmos is also doing uh shared security and atoms as the reserve asset of Cosmos if the market wants it and I think this means if you're launching an app chain on Cosmos rather than bootstrap your own validator set you just get to hire the atom holders as mercenaries for a fee right you hire a gas fee perhaps they're mercenaries use that use their military instead but you got to pay them because they're mercenaries so that that's uh cool to see and I think is value accrual related to Adam the token at least it should be on the fundamentals yeah let's talk about another token that started this whole crypto thing off it's called Bitcoin token Bitcoin bitcoin's a token you just offended every single Bitcoin Maxi listens about this it's a token guys they're all tokens no no no it's a coin I say bitcoin's a token what is the difference between a token and a coin a token is a asset that is issued on top of another blockchain a coin is the asset that is the native currency for the crypto economic system ether Bitcoin is a coin uh uni token any erc20 token is a token coins are innately related to blockchains you can't you can't have a crypto system you cannot make a blockchain without creating an economic security model and so therefore every single you know crypto economic system has to have the you know the economic part the security part which is the coin the the currency the gas ether Bitcoin yeah I feel like this is a simple answer if you win this round David Hoffman you win you got that that was that was a good answer uh maybe I was teeing you up for that fantastic answer in it we just wanted to teach a quick lesson all right this is roll kit saying you can now run a sovereign roll-up on bitcoin wait a second I didn't know Bitcoin could have a roll-up is that possible what is this apparently it's been possible for a very long time just no development we just figured that out right now yeah okay so Sovereign ropes on bitcoin uh now a thing this is a tweet out of a roll kit Dev uh a modular framework for Roll-Ups uh and so this is a toolkit to produce Sovereign Roll-Ups on bitcoin okay uh why are we emphasizing The Sovereign word uh a sovereign roll-up is different from a side chain which is a chain that just what is a side chain actually it's just like another known validator set yeah its own validator said that like checkpoints to a different blockchain kind of doesn't have to yeah this checkpoint to itself a sovereign chain a sovereign roll-up is a roll-up that uses that puts all of its data on a dominant chain a bigger chain and all of the data that it puts onto that chain can be used to reconstruct the roll-up state so it is much more trustless than a side chain so Bitcoin has advanced in the layer 2 trustless layer 2 phase well Beyond Liquid God all the asshats at liquid I hope they're just embarrassed I know they're not though can we call this give me give me the case for why we can call this a roll-up I understand it's a are you saying it's a sovereign roll-up but is it really a roll-up and this is um a tweet where uh that that I'm going to read where I think somebody was asking Eric wall that question let me pull it up this is Mahalo asking Eric Walt commenting on his tweet being excited about this uh and Mahalo says that is not a roll-up though there are no fraud ZK proofs you're not actually doing the fraud ZK proof on the layer one you're just doing the the data layer the data storage on the layer one which does that make it a roll-up David or is this something else I'm going to answer your question with a really annoying response uh as EK roll-up doesn't have ZK proofs Ryan what do you mean as EK row does not use ZK knowledge proofs no fraud or ZK proofs I'm gonna I'm I'm quoting Mahalo here so okay sure validity proofs is what uh a ZK roll-up actually uses Denver and I did not actually this one that that little bit of knowledge came from starkware sessions um well look there's advantages to being a conference or yeah uh uh this is gonna break my brain to try and explain this is one of those I have to like go back to basics about like okay how does it work again oh yeah this works like that uh I don't know I asked me Hollow Ryan I think we lose something here and I'm not sure what 100 as far as settlement assurances I don't think that this is quite the same as a as a ZK roll up or a um optimistic roll up on ethereum because it's not doing the fraud and validity proving on the layer one but I'm not sure like from a user perspective what we've lost here what security guarantees settlement guarantees we've lost I'm going to let you be the Negative Nancy of Bitcoin of this episode I'm going to say I am just happy that the pendulum in the Bitcoin ecosystem has moved very quickly we've been having these conversations yes exactly that this is happening yeah the fundamentalists Maxis are losing their control over the Bitcoin narrative and the builders and innovators and optimists of the Bitcoin ecosystem are getting pigeonholes to finally grasp onto and take back Bitcoin from the the cryptobloodites of the world that's it build back Bitcoin yes take it back yes maybe this happening maybe the builders are are coming taking it back yeah no I I I'm not going to be um bearish on that I'm actually very bullish that these types of conversations are happening I was just wondering like what the difference is so we'll flag that maybe I'll ask Mahalo or somebody else who could tell me uh it's not some magical cool new roll up that's any better than you can do on a smart Contracting layer that's for sure yes and I think it might but it's it's it's something it's something something good for Bitcoin it's good for very bullish about this yes uh Yuka labs this is also maybe good for Bitcoin eucalabs just made 16.5 million in the first Bitcoin nft auction what is this David uh so they have created a set of nfts on the Bitcoin ordinals protocol uh they did this funny funky little auction mechanism where they took in Bitcoin deposits from people as and then took in their bids for what those Bitcoin transfers would be and then they said okay and then we they did the auction in there and then they returned all the extra Bitcoins that people lost um and so 16.5 million dollars in revenue for yoga labs for their 288 nfts uh that they minted uh the top bids were seven Bitcoin and four Bitcoin which was insane uh and they made 16.5 million dollars in 24 hours were people upset at uh how extremely upset because of the auction mechanism basically they were their own I don't even know what to call it custodian so people would say they would say hey send us your Bitcoin and your bid amount and then we will run this auction in our like private black box closed environment and then we will determine the winners and spit back out all the money to the auction Loop oh it's completely back terrible that is not decentralized nor credibly neutral at all that hence the limitations of a blockchain that doesn't have a native smart Contracting layer on it yes it's very not bankless whatsoever the auction mechanism itself but that actually mechanism is bad and broken yeah I mean I don't think they did anything bad or anything but the point is is that like well we don't know do we this is this here's Casey's tweet which is extremely spicy dear yoga Labs uh this Originals uh Twitter account that he's retweeting is correct actions like this prove that for some entities and for people once a [ __ ] coiner always a [ __ ] coiner if I personally Casey rodimore ever see you Luca Labs The Entity [ __ ] around with degenerate [ __ ] like this again I will wash my hands of you forever encourage others including those close to me to do the same get after you highly regarded moron's Casey Voldemort wow he's he's I had him on Bank list with Eric Wall he's exactly this is the creator of the ordinals protocol bro yeah and he is really pissed that they're using it in this way well I don't think he really cares about like them being bad he thinks that they are setting a precedent for spammers and attackers like see any any bad person who sees this model is like oh I can just like copy what Yuga Labs did and people will send me their Bitcoins and I'll tell them I'll just you know give back the losers but then I'll just run off with it it does set a bad precedence you know what I um I wasn't on that episode of Casey but I listened to it I really like this guy I respect this guy is it a new class of Bitcoin Builders and look at him taking a stand against uh like faulty auction mechanics he's got like the spicy sharp edges that bitcoiners have and he's also got this like Builder it's like it's a new character Arc of bitcoiner you're totally right I like it um and of course a whole bunch of Bitcoin fundamentalists hate him for even doing certainly yeah but I'd have never aligned with the fundamentalists uh ever uh okay so here is the update of block space Bitcoin block space fees uh uh because of the ordinals Bitcoin block space demand was up for four weeks in a row it then became down for two weeks in a row and that was last week in the last 10 days or so it is up very big I'm pretty sure that Spike at the very far end has got to be this uh yoga Labs ordinals demand um but uh the power shifting back into the favor of ordinals are here to stay uh so we'll see how this pendulum shifts left and right but we had some very big weeks in Bitcoin block space demand in the last week or so I like it I love this this is so fun yeah it's been a while since Bitcoin put a big smile on my face but like yeah it's doing really cool stuff I'm enjoying this Arc I I'm loving the pluralism coming out of Bitcoin I like this new season of Bitcoin yeah 2023 season is great yeah good job creators of the show thankless listeners like I never thought this was possible they just had to do stuff yeah they had to enable Builders man this is uh Amazon news that hit crypto this week Amazon nfts will be tied to real world assets tokens are possible Amazon stepping into the nft world it sounds like yeah we're not exactly sure what this means what do you make of this do we have any details um I don't have too many details they are working uh here's a statement for instance people would be able to purchase a fashion oriented nft tied to a pair of jeans so I think this is real world uh high value physical items paired with an nft uh how they managed to do that I don't know um uh it's not clear what's going on here uh but it is clear that something's happening um my take here is that someone is advising Amazon on what to do and how to do it or maybe do you think there's a small Skunk Works team working inside of Amazon that are like bankless listeners and are that are hearing this if there is definitely and hit us in Telegram and someone hit us up give us some details so that we know more about this yeah but not break any ndas of course of course of course not yeah it's cool I'm not a journalist or thesis driven Media company that's right on this at all yeah that's right bankless.com we keep secrets Let's find let's let's uh monitor that as we get new news David multi-coin Capital their hedge fund lost 91 percent in 2022 that was last year of course um big loss is this a big loss or is this just like the average crypto investors portfolio what's your take here it is a big loss it's certainly worse than the average crypto person's portfolio uh I've no I've been known to be a multi-coin disagreeer at the very least uh I was initially like uh ready to like grave dance but then at this then I like looked at my portfolio I was like well okay I'm not down 91.4 not not nearly that bad but you can like 2022 was a bad year yes multi-coin had very significant exposure to both I'm assuming FTX I think uh rumors on that one oh they absolutely confirmed David they lost a lot of funds oh yeah they had money in Netflix yeah right the old-fashioned they got scammed by SBF I had a ton of exposure to Solana um and so you he's like yes multi-coin Capital down 91.4 that looks pretty damn bad that sucks they should have sold more obviously uh but also reminder like 2022 was a very bad year and they were probably up decently big in 2021. so yeah yeah they were do you remember Ryan's to fly very high you fall very fast Ryan sulcus's end of the year report multi multi-coin were like the big winners of 2021. uh yeah I I would just like to talk to some of the multi-coin LPS and investors because like it's really the real signal here is like are they happy and I would like to hear more about that I've heard my rumors uh I've heard that people are upset um I haven't heard anything more beyond that yeah there's also uh rumors should we get we shouldn't say any more rumors huh rumors we got slapped last week but you know when hedge fund uh Founders sell the top as well it tends to leave at bad taste in everyone's mouth bad taste and also calling this thing don't take a zoom call and a Ferrari don't do that that's not a roommate did happen by the way that is confirmed yeah yeah it's um it is I think odd sometimes when people hear the term hedge fund which is supposed to hedge you against risk and they see a 91.4 loss it's really not how these funds operate in crypto they're more like just liquid um right VC firms almost I don't operate a hedge fund I don't intend on operating a hedge fund uh I think if you are up some bajillion percentage points and it is at some point it's your duty to hit the sell button is it I wish I could take my advice I don't do that personally I never hit so yeah well you're not you're not operating a hedge fund you're operating a media business true David what's this story this is crazy I think this is a follow-up to our story last week right yeah so last week a judge ruled that rocket ship upward chart and money bags emojis are can be construed at as Financial advice a second judge has ruled that the shruggy Emoji completely nullifies all previous emotions this is great news yeah so you can just say whatever you want and then you end your Tweet with a shrug wow no Financial advice yeah that's all you have to do that's a disclaimer so a shrug can be a financial disclaimer not Financial advice at least this is according to the rug dot mirror.xyz I'm getting the sense that Ryan did not get bugged this week no it's not it almost got me and then I clicked it this time yeah all right this is a pretty good one so uh I mean I think that's a I think if you can I think this is actually a pretty good this is a fantastic Fair it is a fair take I think that if a rocket emoji means you're you're pumping your bags and you are soliciting or it's Financial advice then a shrug Emoji should mean you are not doing those things yeah so there's that Meme out there where uh is like uh the the crypto investor just tells his friend uh you know totally buy this hook and it's gonna make us rich yeah I don't know though you always finish up with IDK though so that you don't ruin their life that's what they're strugging about oh that's great all right I don't know though perfect uh we have a new disclaimer actually at the end of the Bagless podcast we'll just replace it with it I don't know though uh thank you the rug for uh bringing a little levity to the situation here uh what's this invest in music welcome to invest in music fans become collectors that's cool sounds cool what is it yeah this is a brand new podcast new podcast on the scene for people who want to consume more podcasts than what banklist can offer you ill although that's probably a surprise if you are into the world of Music nfcs this is a podcast out of Cooper Turley and so if you want to keep up with the world of music nfts and the growing economy that relates to investing in and sharing web 3 music and other things of that nature invest in music is the new podcast for you so that's a good idea very cool um all right uh on the raises this week there have been a bunch but here's the one notable one ethereum layer two scroll which is a ZK evm Layer Two reaches 1.8 billion in valuation in their new funding round that's it's a that's a big valuation for a bear Market evaluation yes that's right they raised 50 million dollars so 50 million dollars in the bank at a 1.8 billion evaluation and disclaimer Ryan and I are Angel Investors into school you said in the bank what bank do you think they use hopefully it's not silvergate signature oh who knows I mean that that was the metaphorical Bank especially with usdc yeah when we invested in scroll we saw uscc when is um when is our language going to adapt to like uh rather than say in the bank or like I still catch myself I say we got money in the bank or like I'll write you a check and I'm not literally writing writing a check anymore right right it'll take some time to kind of catch up oh I I think we still use the words it just mean it starts to mean something different okay okay yeah it land it just landed in my account because you sent it five seconds ago yeah that feels a lot better and and I didn't have to wait jobs this week of course we got companies raising that means we got companies hiring big one to point out this week bankless is hiring of course but I want to point this one out immutable why wants a protocol blockchain engineer this is Layer Two uh very technical yeah fantastic uh work in gaming gaming infrastructure gaming platform go check this out there's a whole bunch more jobs I could list uh but I won't right now uh go check that out of the banklist.palot.com job sport David what do we got coming up next coming up next we got questions from the nation as well as the hot takes of the week as well as the meme of the week as well as what Ryan and David are bullish on we'll probably chatter about some East Denver stuff as well for those that want to stick around after all the news and just hear about uh what East Denver was like so all of that and more coming up as soon as you talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users

and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free question from sea Yogi this week from the bankless Discord here it is is there some economic or technical reason that chains cannot use a stablecoin as the native token for gas I know Tara did but that was a unique setup which didn't work yes it didn't why is there no chain using a fully collateralized stablecoin as gas and providing non-inflationary staking rewards based on these for Block space seems like a good idea interesting question yeah I really love some of these questions that really illustrate to me where the question asker is on their Journey Down the crypto Rabbit Hole this person is at like the very like starting to get into some like really technical like level questions like why I can't place disable coins for gas yes it's a good place thinking of novel ideas here right yeah um uh asking why can't we do this it's like a great way to learn uh okay so great question uh why can't we use a stable coin for gas Tara did uh and so they they said is there some economic or technical reason and the answer is yes both um going back to when we were talking about tokens versus coins Ryan uh we need ether the coin of ethereum to be the gas uh why do we need that well because in proof of work so this also applies to bitcoin you need ether and Bitcoin to have value so because they are the things that economically secure systems uh the outside world calls the crypto industry like blockchain these are blockchains a blockchain is actually just one part of a grander system of technologies that combine together create what we know as like Bitcoin or ethereum the way that vitalik and I've been using this language have called these things crypto economic systems and so it's a semblance of cryptography I blockchain for data a database and economics you must have a native currency of a crypto economic system to be self-sufficient and independent and autonomous because that's what secures the thing that's what secures the thing miners don't mind Bitcoin unless Bitcoin has value uh stakers don't stake ether unless stakers have value where does that value come from it comes from the enshrined relationship between the economics of buying block space from Bitcoin and buying box block space from ethereum using the native currency if you don't have that relationship between block space demand and currency of the chain then why does that currency exist at all that that has to be intrinsic that relationship must occur that has to be and therefore on the ethereum layer one we cannot use Die For example to pay for gas because we must enshrine the value of ether so that is the economic reason also in eip1559 this made this formal so before EIP 1559 people we're talking about like oh you can just like pay miners you know OTC you can like venmo them to process your transactions and that could have worked and actually actually still is true for Bitcoin actually Bitcoin is actually not in trying miners can put uh things into the blockchain for you know zero Bitcoins if you pay them in the pocket so that's still a thing for Bitcoin uh in eip1559 and formally enshrined ether as the native currency of ethereum so you can't Route Around ether ether must be burnt in order to make a transaction on ethereum so that is the technical reason that you can do this now what's cool is that that is true of the ethereum layer one that is not true of layer twos you can use any token that you choose on a layer 2 to pay for gas however that layer 2 must pay for ether for layer 1 block space but any layer 2 could use a sable coin or any other type of asset for that matter as gas coinbase coinbase chain all they would be violating Securities laws could tokenize the coin security and the coin Equity turn that into a token on base and that could be the gas token for base that's not what's happening I just made that up by the way that radical possibility make way more sense in my opinion like Securities lost aside that would be like a much more aligned kind of ecosystem that would be very very bullish for the coin asset except for the fact of violating Securities laws that part would be bearish yes now Okay so tell me about by the way that was a I think that was a great answer a couple things this triggered for me but like tell me about um this new account abstraction ability where through a smart contract wallet I actually don't have to pay for my ethereum gas fee with ether token uh is is that a thing that's happening is that part of what you meant by kind of the technical reason you can't uh okay uh now we're now on to New Horizons now we're talking about wallet design and account abstraction what account abstraction does is that say you've got a brand new wallet and you throw 25 usdc in there there's zero Ethan there so you don't have any ether to pay for gas and you would like to send that 25 uscc and outbound or do something with it or deposit and to pull together but you don't got any gas yeah wouldn't it be nice it would be nice wouldn't it be nice yeah so with account abstraction you can have a different wallet to pay your gas fee and so you actually never have to have ether inside of your wallet and you can still do crypto and defy things someone else on your behalf pays for your gas but that person is still paying for gas yeah this the economic rules of you must use ether still apply to someone somewhere but with account abstraction you can change who's responsible for those rules could pay for it the smart contract wallet could kind of provide some reason to pay for it all of those things you know uh that was a great answer do you know that the other thing that kind of reminded me of is when we were talking about yeah in Bitcoin this is still an unsolved problem that somebody could go in a telegram group and and send someone money out of bound in order to reward them for um you know processing their transaction in like first before everyone else this is the problem of any Mev minor extractable value and we could call it minor extractable value in the case of Bitcoin all this kind of throws to me is like with Bitcoin doing this ordinals thing and with uh blocks case demand going up my God they're gonna have to go solve all of the same problems that ethereum has had to solve over the past three to four years including challenges with their monetary policy like and enshrining Bitcoin as the asset for Block space and also including like issuance and like right they're going to have to follow this exact same path and solve it whether they know it or not why because if your block space is demanded in the same way that ethereums is then you're going to face the same challenges that ethereum did it's a it's hilarious to me like in a good way like oh that's like that's sweet you're growing up they're doing it you're doing it um yeah anyway they'll figure it out I'm sure okay so that brings us to the take of the week which because you've said that I'd like to skip to the last take of the week and we can go to the other ones first uh this one from uh from uh Wang Zhong Ayan thank sorry for butchering your name apologies uh who treats out ethereum culture and technology is influencing Bitcoin culture and Technology now for people that have been around for a last bear Market Nick Carter says this I believe hazu also says this that or previously said this is that ethereum culture is Downstream of Bitcoin culture in that Bitcoin bitcoiners Bitcoin is at the spearhead of the crypto movement and everything else is Downstream of Bitcoin including ethereum that was very true uh you and me Ryan being like in Anthony sizano and all the others seeing like eth is money that was us like being Downstream trying to catch up trying to catch up right block space demand security all that kind of stuff I learned about settlement assurances as well as you did from Nick Carter exactly right and so so much of what if there is ethereum today we learn from bitcoiners bitcoiners just stalled out man and now I think the tables have turned and so ordinals all of what you just said just like bitcoiners have to learn about like entraining the value of BDC all that kind of stuff now they have to do all the hard work that ethereum has done over the last five years and they haven't done any of it because the fundamentalists have been in the lead they've had they've had control uh and so like now like now we're finally bullish on bitcoin Builders but it's also now bearish because they now realize how far behind they are in this conversation it's going to require some protocol upgrades and do they have the social air the layers there that can can adapt and sustain them I think they do right it's going to be an uphill battle and a challenge but it's it's definitely cool to see we've got some other takes of the week this is one from Mike dudas Mike dudas is retweeting two of Paul krugman's very old tweets one goes back to January of 2018 where Paul Krugman says cryptocurrency lets you make a trend electronic transactions but so do bank accounts debit cards PayPal venmo all these other methods involving trusting a third party but unless you're buying drugs assassinations that's not really a big deal uh and so kind of disqualifying crypto criminals aren't they so fast forward to his tweet just now so five years later um I've been using venmo for years as Paul krubin but now it won't allow me to make payments I spent a long time in chat with Representatives they told me they can't explain why or fix it the software has taken control Mighty how to turn tables in five years oh Paul you know it sometimes you don't realize it until you happen until it happens to you I mean like Paul Krugman is an economist of course uh he said some pretty anti-crypto things in the past not seeing its utility but until it happens to you the country where you live when the situation that you have in front of you you you actually don't appreciate the value it just always brings me back to my like two mental models of people in the world there's people that see crypto for what it can be in the future and then but therefore believe in it today and then there's people who see it for what it is today and see just like a [ __ ] mess yep those are the two camps I totally agree uh Mark Andreessen this is somewhat related he said this I can't convince you to want freedom but if you do want freedom it can't come to you in the form of a centralized system whether that's communism backdoored cryptography or centrally controlled AI it was a good take you want freedom it can't come built on top of centralized systems love it it cuts so deep for like what we're trying to do here yeah like crypto's here to set you free absolutely David what are you bullish about oh God I am bullish from the bankless nation man are you uh so people who listen to Bankers will know that I'm very very bullish on eth Denver as an event uh because it was the place that I decided that I'm going to just eat myself out of my previous life and do whatever this crypto thing means so I was like alone going off to East Denver with zero friends I just like awkwardly oh my God school picture so I just gave this person my phone like hey can you take a photo of me in front of this sign and here's that photo uh fast forward five years later we're at the first ever bankless Meetup and there's 150 people here and we had to keep it a secret because we knew that it was going to be overwhelmed so shout out to everyone that that came for the bankless Meetup and had the free beer at the brewery it was a fantastic time I enjoyed meeting absolutely everyone uh Ryan I got up on stage grabbed a microphone zero plans whatsoever and just started talking for a little bit and ended up just like thanking all of the HQ team for all the support it's it's cool it's great to have company uh it's dangerous to go alone uh in the fact that 150 people want to show up for the same movement that I saw five years ago it's just incredibly humbling yeah it is it's super humbling this is the the other how it started how it started how it's gone yeah oh yeah in like a positive way it's going pretty well it's awesome today yeah look I'm going to say it again bankless.com Bank list 2.0 I I just want to take a moment because we talked about it already so much um about uh like why we're why we're doing this I think and um the big reason is because it was time to get more freedom uh David and kind of time to set sail yeah at the at a high level I mean sub stack is it's kind of um it's its own platform a bit more that that's the platform we were using for our newsletter and for bankless uh you know premium membership and that sort of thing um it was constraining we couldn't build crypto features on top of it so um we set sail we created our own path we created some more uh White space it's been a tremendous effort um this is just the beginning though that's what excites me the most because now we can start building on top of this platform and I just want to take a minute to thank the entire bankless team that has made this possible in particular I want to thank Jason and James who are our key web uh devs and and front end expert Arts actually brought this to uh to fruition and of course our entire newsletter Team Alpha Team and the pod squad for populating all the content is a fantastic job and I want to thank you bankless listener we appreciate you guys like a lot like the picture that David was just showing earlier um like to have I think I was asking David like oh so how is how is the bankless nation when you meet people from the bankless community how are they in in person are they are they cool like do they have good vibes it was like it's like do they like us yeah it's it's like these are all United people like with a shared set of values and it's so cool they're instant friends right right and we would not be able to kind of launch this and carry this movement forward we really consider ourselves in this whole headless brand of the bankless movement just torch Bears we're just trying to set the path to show the way yeah bankless is for everyone and now we have more resources to do it and we have those resources because you tune in every week onto the show and support us because some subset of you have become bankless citizens and are taking that Journey with you with us and we just appreciate you all it's just uh fantastic so uh thank you thank you to everyone who made this possible this is just the beginning yeah uh we've been wanting a website for a while but we've wanted to also do it right and this is finally a website that we just feel so damn good about and like Ryan said it is just the beginning and meaning that now we have our own vehicle our own ship our own structure to do cool things on top of David did you send me a cool thing I just sent you a cool thing first thing that you can you can already do something bankless Nation on the basis on site which is if you are a uh if you already are subscribed to bank list if you already have given us your email address to receive the newsletter or the podcast or whatever you can go mint a PO app and Ryan's about to show the pill app on the screen because it's ship season because we are sailing wet fast so this is the inaugural poapp for christening if you will the bankless website uh is a ship because we're sailing west uh it's a ship because it's ship season uh and it's just really just about it's the first time I've seen this man I love this yeah shout out to Logan who produced this for us on his birthday by the way sorry for making that request Logan thank you and look we got the black flags at the top you see that it's so good yeah so if you want to Mint the poapp uh you go to bankless.com sign in with the email address that you've already created an account if you have not yet already created account I'm sorry you can't mint the PO app uh because of anti-sibil and spam mechanisms we have to gate it to people who have already given us our email addresses otherwise people will attack the system um go with the poab and celebrate uh sailing Westward we're going west this is awesome all right David let's end here meme of the week what are we looking at this week so this was the toilet paper at East Denver it was a roll of toilet paper was this everywhere are you serious there's quite a lot of places yeah wow this is Sam Beckman freed on toilet paper so if you ever took number two you wiped your butt with Sam Baker and Freed's face did you get the opportunity David or is that a personal question I'll leave that up for the uh the bankless nation to wonder about for the imagination of our imagination please picture that that's been the end that's it guys we got a cool Moment of Zen for you again celebrating the new bank list 2.0 website if you're eliminating it won't really make sense so watch that okay yeah watch YouTube risks and disclaimers guys crypto is risky you could definitely lose what you put in but we're headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey this has not been Financial advice shrug Emoji shrug emoji here we go [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow when the bus moved and I saw that house for the first time in my wildest dreams I never could have imagined something so gorgeous
