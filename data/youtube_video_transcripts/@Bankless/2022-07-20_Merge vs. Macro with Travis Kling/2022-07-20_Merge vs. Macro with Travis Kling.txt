you know i think i feel a little bit like i just heard a long burst of machine gun fire and i'm like looking at myself like you know did i just get hit by anything hey bankless nation we got an exciting state of the nation for you an unstoppable force meets an immovable object we've got two countervailing forces we've got on the one hand the macro markets in the left corner the acro looking pretty bad right now all right macro is still not doing the things we'd like it to do uh looking pretty ugly out there and yet the backdrop in the right corner we have the merge the ethereum merge which is uber bullish for ethy asset for all of crypto in it's already starting to get priced in and uh you can see that in the charts kind of this conflict well in today's episode we will explore this dichotomy the merge versus macro we have travis kling on the podcast who is a fund manager and also an expert on things macro and he's been talking about the merge a lot lately david what are we gonna talk about today yeah uh travis just like you said focus on macro macro expert but also like super aware of crypto and the crypto dynamics he's also one of the these uh there's a growing number of these uh types of bitcoiners uh that used to just be like solely focused in the bitcoin ecosystem that have caught the bug of the merge so like the the deflationary narrative of ether post merge has like captured a few of these people's sound piece the the sound money piece yeah exactly the ultra sound money piece ryan of course so i'm interested in hearing that story but just it's super convenient that we have this macro expert who also understands crypto who also understands the marriage dynamics and so if there's anyone who can tell us which one of these uh who which side of this tug-of-war is going to win i think it's gonna be travis yeah i know who i'm written for in this too definitely over the right corner i think this is a really overall an interesting poll we should put this we'll put this poll out of the bankless twitter account as this episode airs which is stronger and merged yeah which is stronger the merge versus macro place your votes david we should also talk about uh rhino dot phi they are sponsoring this message uh from bankless and these guys used to be called diversify it's a decentralized exchange but they have really changed their product into something i am super excited about i'm gonna show a few things uh and maybe you could explain this to me so what are we looking at what is rhinofi up to these days why did they change their name and what are they doing i think this is like such an appropriate pivot so diversify used to be this uh hyper scalable decentralized exchange on a stark x layer two so super performance uh and highly optimized but lost the composability uh and so diversify has rebranded to rhinophy which is a little bit of a multi-chain multi-layer to aggregator of many different parts of the d5 ecosystem and they're really leaning into usability and ux and trying to just remove all as many different complications of you know blockchain that that they can uh and so they their liquidity is across many many different layer twos you can you can trade you can swap you can invest in liquidity pools do basic stuff like send tokens on layer twos so it's a it's a multi layer two multi-chain uh dashboard portal uh uh war station if you will to do all of your defy things across all of the layer twos yeah that's uh that's pretty awesome i'm actually gonna check that out it feels like they've they've taken the trade function that they've been some so strong on and they just converted that into one app of many right this is like a home screen for all of your defy activity so uh make sure you go sign up for that you can hear more about rhino dot phi we'll include a link in the show notes and also david something about a mystery airdrop that's coming with a chance to win 5k split between 50 wallets so i like the sound of mystery airdrop and you can find out more about that on rhino dot phi once again link in the show notes also we now have video of bankless podcast in spotify so previously video was only available on youtube now they are available in spotify as well so if you want to go check out bankless videos on spotify go to spotify search bankless and you can view them there david what is the state of the nation today my friend uh the state of the nation is cautiously optimistic ryan i think that will resonate with very many many people as we've watched eth just rock it off of the floor like skipped over the 1300s skipped over the 1400 straight into the 1500s and i think that's just you know the the game of chicken is like who's gonna press the buy button first before the merge that game has definitely started to play out and some people are definitely hitting the buy button ahead of the merge i can't really think of any other explanation for that price action uh we have like the clearest dates for the merge of all time uh so you can and you can see that being reflected in the charts the merge being de-risked it's actually going to happen uh in the face of a terrible terrible macro setup uh we have our last podcast with luke was uh named uh the worst macro setup we've seen in 20 plus years uh so we're gonna go ahead and talk to travis about that just in a second guys we're going to get right to the episode with travis but before we do we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building

stake your eath in rocket pool and get our eth in return allowing you to stake your eath and use it in defy at the same time you can get four percent on your eat by staking it with rocket pool but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes setting up your rocketpool node is easier than running a node solo and you only need 16e to get started you get an extra 15 staking commission on the pooled eid that uses your node to stake you also get rpl token rewards on top so if you're bullish e-staking you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1 000 independent node operators it's yield farming but with

ikey guy asset management also recently launched a venture fund we are here to talk about macro and the merge travis how you doing man i'm doing well thanks for having me guys looking forward to this it's great to have you how like how are you feeling about things first of all let's start there get your temperature check it's our first question for everyone because uh we're in the depths of um a bear market so people are calling this are you feeling bearish how are you feeling in general what's your vibe um you know i think i feel a little bit like i just heard a long burst of machine gun fire and i'm like looking at myself like you know did i just get hit by anything um and and not to not to make light of folks that lost a lot of money uh because that that certainly has happened over the last couple months but i've been been doing this for a while now um so you're telling us you were in the bulletproof vest then you're not getting not not not exactly a bulletproof vest but but i just think um you know every couple years this this this this asset class does one of these things where it just wipes a bunch of people out and we just had one of those and historically those mark cyclical bottoms um you know history doesn't repeat it rhymes so there there are nuances to this one uh relative to to prior dumps but uh you know now is definitely not the time to to get uber beared up and and i'm not you know i think we're much closer to a cyclical bottom um and and you know we can argue about the specifics around price or time and the factors uh that go into that which i'm sure we're going to talk about today but no i mean this too shall pass this uh this technology still has a tremendous potential to make the world a better place and it's still my base case this is going to be the best performing asset class over a you know three year five year 10-year probably 20-year time frame so yeah i feel like as long as you don't have margin right which hopefully like lessons were learned previous cycles uh and as long as you didn't lend anything to three hours capital uh you're probably doing okay and maybe you're actually excited about this dip buying opportunity if you have some uh powder dry you have some like stable coins and dollar assets yeah i mean i mean i can't believe this market gave me another shot on goal from 20k btc and 1k eth but that's where we are and and that's a tremendous opportunity we went to triple digits i didn't even think we'd see that again i mean i thought there was a possibility but that's surprising on eth yeah just never say you never say never in crypto that's uh that's a that's a good rule to make sure you stay alive and stay in the game no in the first half of this episode we want to get your measure on the macro markets because everyone has a vantage point on the macro markets and right now in this state of overall confusion just getting more and more perspectives as to where we are in these macro this macro world is definitely super useful but uh just keeping on with crypto just a little bit more there's this debate going on in crypto twitter of uh the bottom the bottom hasn't felt pretty like previous bottoms like it didn't really feel in the same way that other bottoms felt and so some people are saying like oh okay that means the bottom's not in like we haven't felt max pain we still need more liquidations we're not totally done yet uh we're just like there was you know the first wave of liquidations which was throughout capital but then there's more coming uh and that'll be the actual true bottom and then there's other people who are like it doesn't have to like repeat previous history even though that's what people say that that it has to do i'm wondering if you had a perspective on this like are we do we is there more max paying ahead of us or are you in the fan in the camp that no it doesn't have to repeat like every other cycle in history yeah it definitely doesn't have to do anything um yeah i mean bitcoin just because it's been around the longest speaking to that specifically i mean it it can do things it's never done before it has you know recently done things that it has never done before and certainly could continue to do things that it that it hasn't done before i'm i'm not married to any particular view um i think now is an outstanding time to be dollar cost averaging into bitcoin and ethereum um and that's not financial advice none of this is financial advice but uh you know you may not get the bottom dollar um we could go lower from here or or or we could you know the low could already be in but you know if you're just dca over over the coming months here i think you look back on that with uh any kind of medium the long-term time frame and and i'm i'm pretty highly confident that's that's going to look like an outstanding uh decision to have been made so okay so let's roll into the macro markets because that's the place that's giving me a bunch of confusion and i'm sure a bunch of uh confusion for the listeners as well because the market just kind of seems to be stuck between like bearish or bullish as we've kind of already indicated it's bearish because the fed might overshoot and cause a recession or worse uh but it also could be bullish because they're about to pivot and you know turn on the money printer now you could you could be bearish because risk on assets are bad to have in a recession uh or you could still be bullish because even in a recession where are people gonna park all their money like you said crypto's still going to be the best performing asset class of you know 5 10 20 years so like do you feel this like tug of war between bearish or bullish on on macro or is it more clear for you uh it's i think the setup is pretty clear what's gonna happen is is not that clear um you know don't fight the fed has been an adage that's been around for decades uh it's all one trade you know has been around for over two years i think at this point and i think neither of those have been more true than they are today and they they both speak to the same backdrop which is admittedly a pretty creepy backdrop which is central bank actions in the current monetary regime have such an overwhelmingly powerful impact on all asset prices that everything else is pretty much just an afterthought and another kind of adage that that uh i've been saying for a few years now is that bitcoin loves qe and detests qt loves quantitative easing detests quantitative tightening and i think you can expand that out into the crypto ecosystem broadly you know and we're like experiencing the the negative you know side side of that um every central bank on the planet pretty much is is tightening right now um and and trying to to work off the excesses that came about in response to uh the coveted crisis and all asset classes just have a really hard time with that now commodities have performed exceptionally well because of um you know some specific reasons around around the ukraine conflict but it was you know the fourth worst first half for the s p 500 in the last hundred years one of the worst starts for uh the bond market ever um and crypto got tagged there and uh you know to be honest it would have been nice if if if crypto had been able to decouple from that but if you told me on january 1st of this year that the s p was going to have its fourth worst start uh in the last hundred years and then you asked me like what's crypto going to do i mean i definitely would have told you crypto's gonna get smoked um and there's some question to ask yourself about what a reasonable expectation of value accrual for for any crypto is during a central bank tightening cycle but if you just look at tech stocks for example i mean apple you know which is about as good of a of a store of value i think as you can imagine you know apple's down was down 30 off the top tons of other tech stocks are down 50 70 plus percent off the top so it's not just crypto that that is performed poorly and then you know i think on on top of that that macro tightening cycle you had some really bad micro um you know crypto specific type of stuff going on over the last few months and it's been kind of a double whammy uh and now i i think i i think the the setup which seems to be you know i think pretty well understood is that the the fed is aggressively tightening to fight inflation um they just like 75 bips which you know they hadn't done in decades they're going to go 75 dips at least again here next week and they're trying to in my view they're trying to cram as many rate hikes as they can now before we either just slam into a recession or some part of the global financial market breaks to a degree that they're forced to respond to that um and that's not a great uh it's not a great setup but asset prices are a lot about expectations and positioning and rate of change and the expectations are very bearish the positioning is very bearish you're probably seeing a lot of you know percent of you know equity allocation versus cash is like all-time low you know all these different positioning for for traditional um for traditional asset classes all these positioning metrics are completely wiped out people are very very bearish and you don't need much rate of change i think because of where positioning is to get things moving pretty aggressively off the bottom and and it's it's it's a little you know nerve-wracking or uncertain right now because even though i think that setup that i just described i think is like reasonably well understood and there's some amount of consensus around it where it goes from here there's still a high degree of of uncertainty and disagreement around about how long is inflation going to stick around what's going to be the pace of slowing inflation specifically around energy prices and food prices and and shelter prices uh there's definitely disagreement there but um uh and and then i think that the the thing that makes it you know particularly nerve-wracking is that this idea of like the fed tightening until something breaks which is a term that gets thrown around a lot well you know what that actually means is that when something breaks it means that like really hits the fan and prices go down a lot quickly and my base case would be that you know crypto would perform you know quite poorly in that environment um along with equities and and and bonds and you know a bunch of other stuff you know a lot of currencies around yeah that would be a very dollar strengthening type of type of situation and so you know and then it could be over really soon and that would mark the bottom but uh you know you could be in for some some very acute pain in the near term and so so the you know i i i think with this like wind sprinting of the fed back to a neutral rate and you basically get there this month with 75 diffs tightening before the economy falls off of a cliff which it looks like it's already starting to or before something breaks in financial markets it you know that puts them in a position to slow tightening at the september meeting and potentially pause before year end which should be supportive for risk assets supported for crypto and uh and then now the fed funds futures market is pricing in rate cuts by the spring of 2023 the euro dollar futures curve is pricing in cuts in early 2023 so you're already talking about some of the deepest most liquid markets on planet earth that are implying that the feds you know getting quite close to being done here and so i think that's what i mean by at the beginning of this conversation of like be careful about getting too bearish at the bottom here because i think it looks like we're probably closer to to the end of this than than the beginning and then i think the cat's out of the bag in terms of of of financial markets believing that uh nothing on planet earth is going to move faster off the bottom than crypto when the fed moves into that slowing or pausing environment and i don't think that there's never been wider agreement uh on that fact than there is right now that's just nothing like 2018 or 2019 bear markets when the really large majority of the world's capital like had no idea what to think about any of this stuff nothing's going to move faster off the bottom than crypto um i mean we tend to agree with you travis and i want to run you some thoughts by you too as we're trying to triangulate all of this macro stuff dave and myself and i think the bankless community and all of the experts we we talked to you know you know that line you said earlier of don't fight the fed what's ironic to me is like isn't that what bitcoin is doing isn't that the purpose of bitcoin isn't that the purpose of crypto is actually to fight the fed it's actually a bet that the fed is going to keep the money printer hiring uh humming it's actually a bet that uh quantitative easing cannot be stopped ever and we might get cycles of quantitative tiding but we're going to go back to quantitative easing um so we we've had some people on the podcast recently lynn alden luke groman um i've read some posts recently by arthur hayes who i don't know if you caught his post that he put out last week but the basic thesis is that um even while the the fed might be raising interest rates they're going to be put in a position where they're going to have to start the money printer printing again some sort of quantitative easing or something else maybe this time the money printing will go to purchase the bonds of u.s allies like the euro or like um japanese bonds for instance and it could be the case that the fed might be saying on the one side yeah we're you know we're tightening our policy interest rates with the other hand they might be purchasing bonds and like starting up firing up the money printer and adding more to um the us treasury balance sheet essentially and so like to me where i've kind of come to in this this macro journey and trying to triangulate among all of these macro experts is like a bet against crypto is kind of a bet that the fed will stop printing money right it's like if you think the fed is going to print money this decade you have no choice but to be bullish on crypto and just because they're not doing that right now this is just a temporary pause in a long cycle someone say if you look at through history maybe an inevitable cycle of a long-term debt cycle that needs to be unwound and so the only way out of this is to actually print money in this decade and therefore you have to be decade-long bullish on crypto as an asset how do some of these things align with the setup as you posed it and kind of your thinking here uh i agree with a a lot of that um i've never you will never find me public publicly anywhere saying that big bitcoin was like a cpi inflation hedge some monetary inflation heads a monetary inflation hedge it's a non-sovereign hard cap supply global immutable decentralized digital store value i've rattled that off like five 000 times at this point and it's a hedge against central you know you know it's a hedge against irresponsibility from central banks and governments globally and you know another way of saying that is that it loves qen to test qt we're in a qt uh uh cycle right now but uh i you know i i have a high degree of confidence that that that is very temporary the market's telling you that it's temporary uh and that it's closer to being done than than beginning and uh that goes back to my point about you know gonna move the fastest off off the bottom and it's that i think it speaks to to paul tudor jones's moniker for bitcoin being the fastest horse and again you can extrapolate that out i think to to other pockets of the crypto market that in a world where central banks are racing against one another to see who can devalue their currency the fastest uh what are they devaluing against and uh crypto you know i just i just think it's pretty clear to me that that um crypto acts really well over a medium long term time horizon as a a hedge against that it's like it's it's an asset class and a technology that like scoops uh an excess amount of that monetary supply inflation relative to other asset classes and you can you can measure this by you know looking at like m2 money supply versus like you know the s p 500 or nasdaq or real estate or commodities or ferraris or rolexes or uh rare whiskeys or like you can just you know pick an asset class trading cards you can just pick an asset class and i and and you know i just think crypto and you know this this pullback not withstanding but over a more medium term time frame i think it just looks like crypto uh is going to to scoop an excess share of that monetary supply inflation now to to your point about jgbs and and european debt i i don't have much of a view there i think it's it's it's possible i think there's certainly the potential for uh there to be so much stress in the yen or jgbs or the euro or european debt where uh those stress levels get to a point there that the fed does have to react in in some way uh i don't know exactly what that looks like that would be on my list of things in terms of like breaking like you know euros on that list jgb's yen's on that list right like uh overnight short-term funding rates is on that list treasury volatility's on that risk credit spreads is on that list uh those are those are the like skeletons in the closet that you that you want you want to look out for um overall when i look at what the fed can do what they're incentivized to do what they have done historically all of that points to them kicking the can down the road they're incentivized to kick the can down the road they can kick the can down the road um they've they've kicked the can down the road for a long time before um and i i get it you know a lot of people have been talking about the early 1980s talking about volcker you know like jay pal invokes the name of of paul volcker like it's you know george washington or something like that and i get that but like look at debt to gdp where currently look at uh uh uh deficits to gdp look at uh the market value of financial assets to gdp and those three charts tell you that uh we are in an incomparable period of time this is not the early 1980s um and like i just people talk about i know people talk about the 40s i don't i just i'm not so sure you can look too too deeply into that long ago one because of technology but two just because this like don't fight the fed like it's just it that has a stranglehold on this market to a degree that i think has never been present previously so you you take all of that and and i i i like i don't think this is like the end like we're not i don't think this is like the end it it it may be the beginning of the end but i'm not even sure it's like the beginning of the end i think it just looks like an uh there's a pretty good chance i think it's just like another can kick and by the time these things actually come to a head debt to gdp deficit to gdp financial assets to gdp all this this money printing that that uh they've gotten us in this problem it's not going to be boomers problems it's going to be our problem there's they're going to be they're going to be dead and gone and and out the pasture um and but i also don't think that it's like that's not like 2022's business or 23 or 24. i'm not entirely sure it's this decades business so um yeah i would be a little cognizant of being like chicken little the sky is falling you know right this second on for that really big for the really big arc yeah i think that the conversation of what is bitcoin uh has been explored with more scrutiny ever since this like big crash uh and people you know the the simple term that like gave rise to the 2020 through 2021 bull market was that bitcoin was a hedge against inflation because of course it was it was the most obvious we have you have the hard cap versus the money printer these things could not be juxtaposed any any clearer but then post this big 2022 crash people have really just really really questioned that narrative and now people are starting to reframe these things as in the common question was why is bitcoin going down when the fed is fighting inflation when it was supposed to be in an inflation hedge which in my mind is it's actually pretty simple um when you know the federal reserve is fighting inflation they are simultaneously in fighting flash and hedges and and so like my mind has shifted towards bitcoin isn't an inflation hedge it is something that has exposure to the anticipation of inflation like it it predicts inflation and that's why you saw the bulm of the bitcoin bull market start at the depths of covid and run all the way up to the point where the fed started at like raising interest rates off of zero and that and that and they did that because like inflation actually did show up in the market but bitcoin started responding well before inflation actually appeared and so it wasn't it's not actually an inflation hedge it's just this thing that anticipates inflation coming and therefore people buy bitcoin but then there's also like uh takes on bitcoin that it's a liquidity sponge as in it will go up in number the more liquidity there is i'm wondering if you've gone through this introspection period travis and what's come out on the other side as to like what bitcoin actually is in this modern world yeah i i i do agree that that bitcoin has taken the narrative around it the the investment case around it has taken a bit of a hit um i i agree with that the you know it it it didn't act as an inflation hedge but again i never claimed it was going to but but other people did um there's the name yeah yeah um uncorrelated asset that did not work i mean that thing like i mean it's just been it was ticking with tech stocks on the way down right and it's the correlation is still there it's not as high as it was um a couple months ago um and i i i i think the other thing that's that's potentially problematic for the investment case for bitcoin is it's not it's not entirely clear that it's going to at least it hasn't really happened so far of like within the crypto ecosystem sucking all of this capital out of everything else in a price decline because if i look at btc dominance right now and i understand bitcoin dominance has some it's it's a flawed metric because it has stable coins in there but um bitcoin hasn't outperformed by like all all that much relative to a number of other crypto assets in this in this price decline and as we move up off of the bottom or you know whatever this bottoming process looks like i mean you can just see what ebtc has done just over the last like couple weeks off the bottom for for example and so you know i think all of that puts you know i think the bitcoin value proposition the investment case in a a bit of a tight spot here um i i don't think bitcoin maximalists are doing themselves any favors in terms of the way that they're communicating with the market um they uh you know at least right now i think are probably doing more harm than good with some of the the messaging or some of the the quote-unquote marketing of bitcoin that's going on uh that is a bit problematic i think over over a very long you know over like a this decade type of time frame and into the next bitcoin for the last i'd say like 18 months or so bitcoin is pristine collateral has still been the investment case that makes the most sense to me over this like decade plus long period of time and that's just going to take a long time and treasuries are the collateral foundation for the global financial system right now this is a this is a debt-laden global financial system and so you know the u.s dollar is the world reserve currency but treasuries are the collateral foundation for planet earth and um treasuries as an investment instrument when as a collateral instrument i think when you look out over a this decade next decade type of time frame they're challenged and so the world you know is probably looking around to see okay well like what else are we gonna go to and people been having a lot of these conversations lately as well too just in response with the with the the russian sanctions and uh you know what does it actually mean to own gold or own fx reserves in a bank and uh uh you know do you really own those things free and clear that you know that whole conversation um and i think bitcoin is well positioned to over the course of of this decade and into the next start to chip away at um at being pristine collateral uh there's a lot of price volatility uh that's gonna need to to calm down some but you know there's been a lot of price volatility in treasuries over the last six or nine months as well too so it's it's uh it's worth looking at it within that within that backdrop so uh i guess i would i would summarize all of that to say that there is a you know there is a bit of a of a narrative challenge around around bitcoin right now to a higher degree than uh has ever been present in the in the five years that i've been looking at this do you know travis the way i would kind of summarize this is i think there's been a simple misunderstanding and the difference between the words uh inflation hedge and debasement hedge and i would say something like bitcoin i put ether in that category too is not a hedge on inflation never was it's a hedge on debasement and that is what's happening with quantitative easing so we're getting uh increased money supply at the base level this is the money printer go bur meme and um anyway that that that's a case that like the idea of debasement is not something that everyday uh us dollar users see but that is the operating force behind the scenes um but while we're on kind of the macro bear case right and how that might turn around because there are some big headwinds on the macro side of things like things still look bad uh i think you're you're also probably predicting a recession ahead uh as are we as are most people so we'll see some of that but then we also see some self-inflicted wounds in the crypto industry as well and you were alluding to some of those i i wonder if we could just talk about that briefly before we get into the merge because i think that is part of the the context for why crypto is down so bad uh and uh i'm gonna share this uh tweet that you put out recently uh this was um when crazy stuff was happening in crypto as like as as it is but when it when it just started breaking on on june 30th you said i've been doing these uh things for 46 straight months and i've never seen one like this before and um this is a newsletter i i uh think you put out for probably investors in your fund june highlights and it's full of these bullet points with all sorts of chaos celsius going bust three hours capital doing a madoff style likely committed crimes knock-on effects severely damaging most large crypto companies we've got voyager insolvent we got blockfy down bad uh on and on and on it goes can i ask you did this one catch you by surprise what do you think of this self-inflicted wound the crypto industry is kind of given itself uh i think we i think anybody that's heavily involved in this market knew there was risk around centralized borrow lending platforms um i'm not sure if i ever talked about that publicly but i do a monthly private zoom call for all of our lpus and i and in in that context i had been talking about this for like 18 months and i always i always i i refer to it as shadow leverage and and it's shadow leverage because it's opaque right and you you knew that there was some amount of under collateralized or uncollateralized lending that was happening in centralized borrow lending platforms but you didn't know to what degree you didn't know you know what the overall makeup of that of that lending book looked like for any given uh eco you know for any given centralized bar lending platform but you knew that there was some under collateralized and uncollateralized lending that was going on and we had some scares around that in the march 2020 crash uh the ecosystem was a lot smaller back then um but you had some scares you had a couple small blow ups or or guys get into stress but if you look at the price chart the price went up so aggressively off of the bottom that a lot of people ended up getting bailed out because you know your collateral value is rising in value and and um you know we went through a little bit of this in the may 2021 price crash had a little bit of stress there made it out okay but this whole shadow leverage concept and and it's like a daisy chain because the other thing that for people that were i think deeply involved in this market is you you kind of knew that there wasn't a really there wasn't really good communication about like firm a that borrows under collateralized from borrow lending company number one and then like well what did they do with borrow lending company number two and borrow lending company number three and it's like a daisy chain basically right and this is something that people had talked about you know whether it's behind closed doors or publicly people been talking about this for a while and we like i said we almost got bit a couple times and then we got really bit right you got you got really bit and you just had this big you know shadow leverage daisy chain unwind and uh it started with tara luna it metastasized into celsius it crescendoed into this like i said madoff style blow up of three arrows capital that like you know a bunch of these court documents and stuff are coming out now they're just like straight out of a movie right like literally like strange crazier than fiction type of stuff and this is like you know wall street stuff i mean just crazy crazy stuff and then knocking on to blow up or significantly damage virtually every borrow lending business in crypto and multiple exchanges and hundreds of projects and funds and so we got bit we got bit pretty bad there now you know i will say like to sort of like you know pitch the name of this podcast a little bit d5 did pretty fun did pretty damn good through all of this and and the um the sort of like purpose and the the value proposition for d5 you know i think was relatively on display during all of this carnage um but there's no such thing as is under collateralized or uncollateralized lending and d5 uh and if there wasn't any of that that happened with centralized borrow lending platforms then you would have talked about a totally different type of setup it was the under and the on that that caused how nasty the knock-on effect got and uh you know i guess i you know i guess i would just say you know things generally work the way they were supposed to even daryl garluna to be honest with you worked worked the way it was supposed to and [Music] this shadow leverage daisy chain unwind certainly had d5 leverage that was closely intertwined with it but defy was not the cause of that of that unwind and it was the inherent opacity of those centralized bar lending platforms that enabled that under and on collateralized lending that caused that blow up um and you know i think you could imagine a world where crypto or dare i say the entire world uh you can imagine a world where borrow lending happened all of bar lending happened transparency transparently in defy and all borrowing was over collateralized and if you hit your liquidation level due to price declines your collateral was liquidated to save the lender and this is actually you know the that's like the foundational principle for centralized perpetual swaps like perps on centralized exchanges that's how they work um now there's exchange counterparty risk some amount of that with perps but you know i think you sort of with defy you sub out exchange counterparty risk for like maybe like smart contract risk for example um and i don't know it might be wishful thinking to assume that that the opacity of these centralized borrow lending platforms uh is going to go away forever you know these things have a tendency to move in pendulums and right now the pendulum's over here in the fear section and you know it over the history of humanity just has this tendency to swing back the other way and another tweet i had a while ago when i was thinking about all this stuff is like if you looked at the win loss record of greed you know it's just a pretty stunning win loss record so it might be wishful thinking to just assume that the the opacity of the centralized borrow lending market is about to go away forever these things have a tendency to move in pendulums and right now we're over here on the greed pendulum and are on the fear pendulum but greed has like an incredible win-loss record and so it's it's probably a pretty good chance that eventually uh you know things leveraging crypto is tightened for a time it that's already happened significantly um but then eventually it's going to widen back out that's just kind of the nature of these things and like i don't know do i believe that years or decades from now we will achieve the transparency that an entirely defy financial world promises maybe i mean it could happen it would certainly be good for humanity because it prevent these sorts of things from happening again that have been happening for literally thousands of years um and i you know i don't know i would like to work on making that a reality uh but first we gotta stop tripping over our own two feet i think all right yeah the general taker on defy is that it's held up so well because of the over collateralization which is of course true that extra fifty percent collateral that maker dow requires or twenty twenty-five percent that compounded ave requires is just a huge extra buffer versus an under collateralizer or no collateral loan but i i think it's really worth the extra emphasis that it's also the complete lack of transparency that is what allowed contagion with rio's capital because we couldn't see them going to voyager and getting a 700 million uncollateralized loan and also you know gambling with other dows treasuries and you know getting a loan another bajillion dollar loan from here like with that lack of transparency is where so much of this contagion happened and if like a number of these like lending entities like were more cooperative which they wouldn't be because they're competitive their competition with each other if they were more cooperative they would have been able to call each other up and being like hey do you have a billion dollar outstanding loan with zero's capital because they just asked us for one uh and then all of a sudden we would have a little bit more uh clue as to the shenanigans that that three euros capital uh was up to yeah and so i do really think that that transparency aspect of defy uh is the actually the more interesting part rather than the the over collateralization um any takes on that no i i completely agree with that and i don't know if that means that there's going to permanently be uh more communication amongst centralized bar lending platforms um that would that that would be nice um yeah i'm not exactly sure how that's going to shake out like i said i think these things have a tendency to to move in pendulums and we're in a fear pendulum right now but it's like you know the fed's going to cut rates and start juicing qe again not too long and you know bitcoin is going to be knocking on the door of a hundred thousand and eighth is gonna be knocking on the door of ten thousand and you know there's probably gonna be centralized borrow lending desks that are start leaking out under collateralized and uncollateralized lending again and then you know you know i don't know it's like i said there's like a couple thousand years of human history that would that would uh you know tell you to not bet against that so i i feel like every 10 years crypto gets mount gox and so like a new generation gets mount goggs right not your keys not your crypto and so it wasn't an exchange but this time it was a centralized more money provider gave up our crypto and then we got matt cox and we'll probably learn that lesson this generation will be good we'll be good another 10 years go by one per cycle another three arrows capital another you know mount gox and we'll learn it again this is history this is humanity travis uh and speaking of knocking on the door we are knocking on the door of the merge just a few weeks away give it five six seven weeks away so what a trend what a transition what do you like uh so we definitely want to get your take on uh just like again the the tug of war between the macro bearishness versus the merge bullishness and i actually do think i'm going to tease this the the hyper hyper bull case is that macro actually flips bullish around the same time as the merge uh and so there's actually a world where the this tug of war does not actually tug against each other it actually is two two forces going in the same direction the hyper bowl case for the ethereum emerge but first before we get to that very exciting conversation that you definitely want to stick around for uh we want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your trucking account

the podcast that you guys all want to hear travis you recently stated the earth the eth merge is the most significant event-driven catalyst that we have ever seen in crypto can you unpack this statement for for us why is the merge so significant to you yeah sure i was before i jumped on here i listened to diaz podcast like reasonably often but i don't catch every episode and i was sort of like scrolling through your past guess and i think i'm probably like you know uh not nearly the best person to talk about macro and definitely not even close to the best person to talk about the eve merge related to other guests i'm i'm kind of like middle of the road on both of them but um i do spend a lot but you can do both yeah you can do both yeah and also travis i want to kind of hear your story at some point through this because you have not always been bullish on eth as an asset or the merge and i want to hear like maybe even stepping back how you came to the tweet the eth merge is the most significant event-driven catalyst that we've ever seen in crypto um yeah and i guess it's i am i am very active in these markets on a day-to-day basis and have been for years so so i guess maybe that uh uh maybe maybe puts me in a different category than than some of your guests but um uh yeah so we launched the we launched ikigai december of 18 depths of the bear market the large majority of what we have done since then is systematic models driven exposure to bitcoin with the purpose of outperforming just holding bitcoin on a risk-adjusted basis through cycle so like we you know build proprietary statistical models you know we you know try and kind of you know catch the meat of the big up moves and avoid the meat of the big down moves uh you don't have to do that perfectly lord knows we don't do it perfectly if you can do it reasonably well as the months turn into quarters you can kind of start compounding your out performance versus just holding bitcoin that's that's the large majority of what we've done over the last few years we started getting away from that last year and in terms of how our portfolio allocation of the hedge fund looked uh you know one thing that happened is we bought a little bit of salon and it turned into a lot of bit of solana because the price went up a lot to a lesser extent we bought a little bit of ftt and it turned into a lot of ftt because the price went up a lot and our kind of systematic btc portfolio allocation just started shifting some because of of some of those movements so in in the summer of 2021 i started thinking about just the optionality of the different types of activity that were going on on layer one smart contract platforms there wasn't a lot of activity to speak of before d5 summer in 2020 and then now you have this like very tangible use case an entire new sector with many many billions of dollars of of tvl that was locked up and then in summer summer 2021 when nfts took off now all of a sudden you had two use cases so you could you could own ethereum and you got d5 and you also got nfts which to me felt like owning google stock and getting search and youtube or owning facebook and getting whatsapp and instagram and you know i actually you know i think tech stocks the big ones are you know pretty good stores of value if you just look at their charts over a long period of time the ones that have dominant market share positions and i think and i think that that you you ended up with a uh just a lot of like pattern matching there and and that um that just started to change my view on how i was thinking about value accrual for smart contracts in general and uh you know i think that this this and so so so i think sorry and then so i was in fts and then gaming came along metaverse stuff came along and facebook changed their name to meta right around the time that um a lot of this stuff was was you know getting increased traction in the crypto ecosystem and so you you know you started to have some tangibility on these different emerging crypto sectors that you we've never had in in crypto previously and i i think that just kind of changed my view on you know how the market was going to potentially think about value accrual for these uh for these smart contract platforms so travis that's um that's what kind of changed your mind on sort of the the value accrual is really seeing that utility uh they hadn't previously seen like in 2018 ethereum had smart contracts largely had one use case and that was the ico my god look what happened to icos and um you know coin offerings and tokens one thing but now we're seeing utility like d5 and nfts let me ask you specifically about the merge why do you think that is a specific catalyst for ethereum so um is does this kind of blend some of the best that you've seen with like the utility of smart contract plus four platforms with the steady monetary policy of something like bitcoin and i'm not i'm not saying it's exactly like bitcoin because it's not it's its own separate thing but uh 2018 ethereum did not have the monetary policy assurances of 2022 post-merge ethereum but tell us more about this merge catalyst what why is that exciting why is it the biggest catalyst we've ever seen in crypto to me it's the digestibility of it it's the digestibility of of the merge it's you know ethereum is becoming yield generating and deflationary and you know quote unquote esg friendly and you know we can have an entire com separate conversation about about esg but i think we all know that it's it's a it's a behemoth uh factor in in the markets currently in in all markets and the mess that bitcoin found itself in with you know elon doing the about face in in in may of 2012 you know all the esg stuff going on with bitcoin again totally separate conversation about the legitimacy of those arguments that maybe we can just put that to the side for now but esg is something people really focus on so it's just that it's the digestibility of it coupled with uh the the willingness and ability for large pools of institutional capital to buy eth in size and that's just never been present previously like like forever for you know the large majority of of of the history of crypto the vast majority of large pools of historical capital wouldn't touch crypto at all and then around 2020 specifically on the back i think paul tudor jones you had institutional capital that was willing to start nibbling at bitcoin to a degree that had you know a higher degree than it ever been present but now from people that i talk to and from my understandings of what that institutional capital landscape looks like there's just the willingness and ability to bot to buy that that has never been been present previously and so it sets up for um like i said it's like the largest the largest catalyst in in in crypto history and to your point you know i'll i'll i'll give the the bear and the bull case here for e there is a potential for macro to be so shitty that the the merge catalyst is like delayed or sort of wasted um because macros just it's a very bad environment right like if the repo market is blowing up plus or minus a month from when the merge happens like it just may not work all that well but i think the the flip side of that is that you know if the fed teases a slow down at jackson hole at the end of august and then slows down in at the end of september with an indication that they're going to go on pause by year end and then if and in the you know the market is pricing in rate cuts early next year which they already are and traditional asset class fund managers are staring down the barrel of you know three or four months left in the year and they've had quite a shitty year because everything's gotten smoked uh you know the potential to sort of save your year by getting long some eath like that's just a you know that's a pretty compelling setup in my view just from like a market structure perspective and sorry and then one more thing that i'll say because most of that i went on on on jason and and santiago's empire podcast a couple months ago and most of this stuff i i that i just said i said on that podcast but you know you've got cut in half over that period of time uh you know since then and now uh so you're talking about a price level that just a couple weeks ago you know people would you know would have thought never would have happened or would it would have dreamed about so the the positioning around eth is meaningfully more attractive in terms of there's just a lot less money that's that's uh that's currently long it so and i mean you're seeing i mean it's it's gone up 50 in a straight line over the last like week or whatever right so you're starting to see a little bit of that as soon as i mean i think it came out of the i guess the was it the last core devs call that they that that september 19th date i think got got thrown out with a degree and i mean that was i mean put that tweet on a chart and it went up 50 of straight lines since that so right yeah the market definitely seems to be de-risking uh the possibility that the merge will not happen and you know generally speaking of eth positioning i mean i think that we we're all in agreement that the the merge is a huge catalyst catalyst for just a price accrual inside of the crypto industry but also there's this juxtaposition with the the macro markets as well uh and one of my favorite tweeter twitter accounts out there uh ryan sean adams says uh ethereum is about to become the world's only deflationary monetary asset at a time of historic monetary inflation what a contrast i'm wondering what what do you make of this juxtaposition is this something that is like you know the secret handshake of everyone inside of crypto twitter and just crypto in general that we kind of know this juxtaposition or do you think this this contrast of like ether the deflationary asset during a time of super high sovereign debt uh do you think that that contrast will land on people outside of crypto i do i do i do think it will outside of crypto within crypto you know a lot of people got smoked over the last two months and part of the eth btc under performance was uh you know over the last couple months was that it was like the only thing that people were still long uh you know for all the reasons that we just talked about um and people were fire sailing stuff or in some cases you know in a good amount of cases getting liquidated you know liquidations happening into a zero bid environment basically um but you clawed a lot of that back already you know incredibly rapidly and uh you know i just think the entry point for uh institutional capital just looks a lot more attractive here if you can get some of these macro tailwinds like you know if if if if the fed is wind sprinting towards a recession and potentially some kind of of you know market crash type of scenario institutional capital i think is going to have pretty limited interest in getting uh getting long ease in with that kind of backdrop but if you can get some you know a path to a slowdown in tightening or specifically you know the biggest upside risk in in my view for macro is some kind of some kind of credible treaty situation in the ukraine conflict and i i don't mean to to make light of that at all uh because there's you know you know tons of people that are dying and i mean it's just you know it's a really horrific thing so i don't mean to talk about it just in the context of financial markets but but that's the context of what we're talking about here um but if you can get some kind of uh credible treaty there that's gonna that's gonna have this setup of like um commodity prices down they've already come down they've already come off a lot off the high but like commodity prices down uh uh tightening expectations down inflation expectations down equities up crypto up and that would be the backdrop for uh you know i think crypto broadly and e specifically to run tremendously hard if all of that kind of lines up and you end up you end up threat threading the needle there you know i'm not saying it's definitely going to happen but i think that is that is the setup so travis uh let's um let's kind of close this out with our boxing match here of like macro versus the merge here right and so in the left corner we've got we've got macro things looking kind of ugly let's say that persists because as much as you know we'd all like to paint the happy picture of hey you know things are going to get better on the macro front uh and maybe the fed will turn some things around and start money printing and thread the needle that might not happen right we might be set up for like a a longer winter and maybe that's kind of the base case so on on in the left corner we have that macro looking ugly but then on the right corner we have the most significant event-driven catalyst that we've ever seen in crypto which is the merge and eth goes deflationary becomes an internet bond has all of those tailwinds of an esg narrative and deflationary ass in the backdrop of all the the sovereign debt bubble that we're seeing all around us who wins this boxing match right does like each number go up if macro is really bad but like the merge is really good or like does it still get knocked out by the fed i mean that's the rule that we've been told don't fight the fed and here's the youth merge in a boxing match with jerome powell who's gonna win yeah i would not want to be like if you knew let's say you knew the repo market was going to blow up in september i would not want to be long anything cash you'd want to be in all cash it's just the the the rr of of that uh would not be compelling to me to be long um but again i'm like i don't want to come too much from a traders but i don't know i don't know that's like a very traitory way to answer that question a lot of people don't think about their own exposure like that you probably shouldn't because it's a really really hard job uh but if the macro is is bad or you know getting even worse i i do think that ethan is going to kind of struggle to outperform and and the merge catalyst is going to struggle to be realized just from a price performance perspective um because of that of that macro overhang um but there's you know like i said asset prices are about expectations and positioning and rate of change very good here's what i'm getting in summary so like if macro goes well man we are off to the races okay the merge plus macro moon like heads up get ready for it faces will melt uh if macro stays the same and the merge happens maybe looking kind of bullish pretty good yeah maybe the worst news has been priced in if macro gets hit hard if it comes out of that that uh left corner swinging it punches eat in the face we'll punch every single asset in the plate in the face then look at below we're still probably despite the merge headed for triple digit once again then we're going to dunk in the two yes that eventually we're probably going up um travis thanks thanks for that thanks for walking us through that i remember reading some of your stuff from 2017 when you're first falling down the crypto rabbit hole and definitely the token economic side was was the part i recall that really grabbed you so that's cool to return to your roots here and i will say one thing you got the formula down which is like you want to raise in 2021 that year and then deploy in 2022 right so uh that's a good timing on that part my friend as well um travis thanks so much for joining us i feel like we've got some great insight into macro in the backdrop of the merge and uh it sounds like um we're gonna witness the the boxing match in real terms over the over the months to come so looking forward to uh to being there on that risk in disclaimers as travis said none of this was financial advice it never is on bankless crypto is risky is risky the merge is risky macro is risky life is freaking risky okay but with d5 specifically you could lose what you
