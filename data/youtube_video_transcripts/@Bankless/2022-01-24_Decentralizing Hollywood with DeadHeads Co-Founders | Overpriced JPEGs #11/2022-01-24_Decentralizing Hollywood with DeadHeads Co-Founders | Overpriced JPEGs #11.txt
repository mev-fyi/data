[Music] hello everyone welcome to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and many of you know this is loosely speaking intellectual property month here at overpriced jpegs and really what that means is i'm exploring everything about ip how do you monetize it if you're an investor how do you make money on it how is web3 changing the traditional world of intellectual property last week i spoke with john rogers who's really an ip expert and has spent decades thinking about ip and franchise ip in particular go check out that episode if you haven't listened yet and today on the podcast i have the co-founders of the deadheads project deadheads is really i think the first nft project to plant this flag of we're creating decentralized ip specifically in the form of creating a show or an animation studio or our goal is to make movies and tv they talk about in this episode how they were inspired by board apes who of course decentralized their intellectual property in certain ways in a very public way but but these guys planted the flag of like a decentralized production studio and i have to say this is one of the few conversations i've had where it made me want to launch an nft project like it made me want to start an nft project and that might sound weird i i even say this in the episode like you would think me being in this space maybe i want to do an nft project but i know how much work it is and i don't personally i don't have a reason to launch an nft project at this point yet so maybe someday but but not now but these guys i just got excited hearing what they were talking about hearing what they're building how they're approaching it i was like oh [ __ ] like put me in coach i really wanna i wanna be in the game so hopefully you have the same reaction i i hope you find it all as interesting and as exciting as i do if you're building a project and part of that project's mission is to build intellectual property and and by that you really need some sort of narrative or story listen to this episode listen to the way these guys think about it if you're interested in starting a project in general i think it's worth listening to this episode because they talk about what their approach this all was back when they first started so anyhow really enjoyed this conversation one caveat uh jeremy one of the co-founders was based out of el salvador while we were speaking and the internet connection was less than ideal but if it is a little choppy at points or if if there's a little bit of disjointedness to parts of this conversation that is probably why i don't think it'll ruin the convo overall i think there's a lot of nuggets in here and i think it'll hopefully be a pretty enjoyable listening experience but that is my one caveat i apologize if it's a little funky and we do at the very end talk about why jeremy is in el salvador the answer is he's a vagabond because he's not from there he's a vagabond who lives around the world and i asked him about that because i think that's fascinating okay with that here's a word from our sponsors and then it's time for jeremy jensen and tempo co-founders of the deadheads project axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their axes there are and will be many varied gaming experiences for axes many of them having players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources others will have them complete quests defeat bosses and unlock in-depth story lines there are countless unique axes that players can collect with varying body parts and experiences the axi universe is a player-owned economy where the players can truly own buy sell and trade the resources they earn in the game through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem it's a digital nation where people come together globally with their axes to play earn and live join the axi revolution at axioinfinity.com bankless polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with

is a bit of a a month of ip and conversations about ip here at overpriced jpegs and really there could not be a better team to have on to discuss this than these two folks here jeremy jensen and tempo the leaders of the deadheads project whose goal as stated by the team i think and you can correct me if i'm wrong but is really to try and decentralize hollywood so a nice big hairy audacious goal for people who live to the beehag era of like startup thinking and i just can't wait to dive in and really talk more about this project i think it's sometimes misunderstood by the casual observer and i'm hoping that this conversation demystifies that and and really shows people what y'all are doing so welcome to the show thank you so much both of you for being here thank you so much carly for having us my name is jeremy jensen and i'm one of the co-founders of dead heads thank you i said leaders because i really i was stumbled there so thank you co-founders leaders co-founders co-creators leaders co-founders yeah czars of deadheads many names apply um let's just start briefly with with each of your you know kind of quick bios and then i actually want to dive into your stories more as a way to understand how you came to this project but let's start with the the quick bios for for each of you jeremy and tempo thanks so much um i have sort of been in film when i was younger and then i worked in film for a year um i worked around movies like supergirl uh i started show like supergirl and um a ton of movies a lot of indie ones and a lot of larger tv series in essence what i found was when being on set is that it was like a lot of laborers and not a lot of creatives because the decision making was done by like a head studio and a director and it released the buck stopped there anyways this was all about 2016. fast forward this past year and i've been working in marketing for the probably the majority of that time and my friend tempo called me up and set up making ai art um and uh then we saw nfts is a great way to utilize uh the air so we put out these these these entities of this original area yeah and then and then as the space progressed from february we both realized um there was a greater opportunity and uh that opportunity lay in using sort of this model where you could give your ip into the nft and then integrate it into like an animated series uh originally like pokemon was something that we saw you know as being like a great application someone could use an nft we often talk about r2d2 imagine if you could mint r2d2 at the beginning essentially giving the characters up and building the story i'll let some folks expand upon that okay tempo give me your your uh your quick fly over bio yeah okay really quick high level i guess i'll just say sort of my side of of how this all came to be so it all started with uh back in january i called up jeremy to start a business creating artificial intelligence artwork um which is where my background is i've been i've been doing that for the last five years um extremely passionate about that on the technological side and so as we're sort of selling these things as like a traditional e-commerce brand where we actually deliver and ship canvases of ai artwork to our customers we on the on the side jeremy was kind of messaging me about this up and coming thing nfts which were very much not known back then um at least i didn't really know about them back then and so we both sort of started doing a lot of research into it and it was such an easy it was such an easy transition to make considering ai art is already digital in nature and so when we started looking at nfts where we were like [ __ ] like this makes a lot of sense for us to start selling air work as nfts why don't we do a launch um and try it out get our feet wet learn about what this community is about jeremy's been in crypto for a few years now so he's he was kind of already in that group but um one thing led to another ended up getting on open seas homepage for our first launch and we're in touch with the ceo and and cfo of of open c back then because they weren't that big of a company back when we were just starting out was it devin finzer still who was it jer alex you know right alex alex and one another i don't know you've gone too deep into the uh the openc org chart for me [Laughter] really really nice guys and and they had us on the home page uh everything sold out really really quickly and we started realizing the appetite for for digital artwork which we didn't necessarily realize was a thing back then and how powerful nfts are in terms of digital ownership and so we just dove headfirst at that moment which was about march march of this march of la march of twenty march of 2021 one yes twenty twenty twenty forty one yeah and do you want me to sort of get into how dead heads came to be through that well i wanna set the stage for deadheads first so i what i wanna do is set the stage because i wanna be sensitive that there may be audience members for whom this is the first time they're they're really hearing about deadhead so i want to set the stage and then that's and then what i really want to do is like dive deep on how this project happened all of that so i i was saying to jeremy before this before we kicked off here this might be a longer lead into a project than than i usually give but i do think you're doing something unique that warrants maybe a little bit of of context so i want to ask if you agree i'm about to break down what i would call as like the categories of intellectual property you could say and i want to see if you agree with it and then maybe within that explain where you feel like deadheads falls so i think you have this traditional world of intellectual property especially as it pertains like the entertainment world where things are very centralized and you have some studio and you have some set of executives who are centrally controlling a piece of intellectual property and managing it etc etc and i think the closest analog to something like that and this sounds dismissive but i don't mean it that way at all to the web 3 world would be something like what gary vaynerchuk is doing with v friends where he's saying really what this art is in the long term is a collectible and you're trusting me as like a brilliant businessman who's had a lot of success to build something incredible out of this intellectual property and then you'll end up benefiting from it because you're a token holder and you hold this collectible and then there's all sorts of other cool benefits too you get to go to econ et cetera et cetera so it's like a collectible on steroids then i think on the opposite end of the spectrum in web 3 you have something that's very new and that i don't know of good comp you know comps to in the web 2 world which is what you have with like gremplin and cryptodes or you know dom hoffman's blitmaps project which is you know it's totally in the creative commons we retain no copyright no rules have added if you want to use it for nefarious things okay we don't have any control over this thing and that's this very extreme version and then i think you have these middle ground projects that are you that are interesting board apes is one of these where folks have a lot of rights and control over their particular character but they don't necessarily have rights over the project as the whole and there are parameters being placed on the project as a whole around you know you you can't use it for certain super nefarious things and my understanding with y'all is you fall somewhere in that middle category and i think it's worth talking about the nuances there of you versus a board apes for example because i think it's really interesting but does that general read of the environment feel right to y'all and and is that where you would put dead heads yeah so so like you said board apes fall very much on the decentralized ip aspect well retaining rates over the brand itself we're we're incredibly similar to board apes in that respect where any characters or nfts that you own within the deadheads universe you own commercial and non-commercial rates over them you can do whatever you want you can make as much money with them as you want you can sell merchandise with them but you can't you can't market it as an official deadheads brand or you can't put the deadheads branding on it so logo name things like that just as an example that might help people's understanding is one of our collectors is trademarking his specific deadhead with the name sal and is creating an underworld comic book centered around that specific character but what he wouldn't be allowed to do is say that this is a dud hugs comic book or put dead heads on the comic book or anything it's it's a total derivative where he owns full ownership over his specific character he can do whatever he wants with it quick question on that so the benefit to him is he's inspired by this artwork and given that even if it's not officially a deadhead's project given that it obviously has the deadhead's look his bet is you know if he does something really good he'll be able to activate potentially the deadhead's community around this thing that he's doing in a cool way is that is that maybe the calculation that somebody like that would be making exactly yeah and we and we love that too like we we as a brand when someone puts out derivative works we love encouraging it and showing our community and and highlighting what they're doing because that's exactly the whole point of this is is we want our brand or the characters of our brand to sort of percolate throughout the universe in a decentralized way where everyone's coming up with all these different ideas and we're really putting the power back in the hands of the creatives as opposed to in the hands of you know a studio head or in the hands of one specific project creator who he's the only one who can do everything with it okay now finish that second part of your your answer that i interrupted i'll finish and then jeremy you can you can jump in but where we differ from from board apes is with board apes they essentially say go out and do whatever you want with with your ip but what's difficult for a lot of these holders is that you don't necessarily have the resources to create anything with your ip or the time and so having a picture or having this piece of ip doesn't necessarily give you any benefit in the long term because you don't necessarily have the resources or time to do anything with it with dead heads what we're doing is we're trying to sort of we're trying to encourage people that might be on that side of the spectrum to have the reach and to have the ability to very easily and and more hands-off percolate their specific ip through our animated series so that's why we're developing an official animated series movies you know commercials comic books like things like this in our multimedia universe where you can just go and give us access and permission to use your your character and we go and put it in our content so you don't actually have to go out and make a name for yourself you can just give us a license back to use your ip and we'll do that because we're kind of the back engine running running running the uh running the brand so you're trying to have the best of both worlds where you're saying we want to empower individual creators who want to go do something but we also believe that we can create some incredible ip so if you're not yourself some talented incredible creator who's going to go be the next george lucas well then put your faith in us to try and do that because that's not your particular skill yes exactly exactly jeremy did you have something you wanted to try him in with well i just think temple did such a fantastic job explaining it so you in the terms that you're sort of investing in the character and then that gives us the ability to like build out this world and build out all this ip around dead heads uh and then as a result you know your your asset its value so it's tethered to the the quality of our story and and in the longer term i mean one of our visions is to make sure we're including a lot of other projects and using some of our really amazing technology which everybody touched on yet like our our dap and whatnot and um making sure that deadheads has the reach and the capability to sort of give everyone's nft a purpose so we'll definitely get into the technology side because i know that's important to y'all and i've heard you in other interviews talk about how that's that's an area where you really want to innovate i want to stay on this intellectual property that you guys as the creative lab piece a minute so explain a little bit more about what you're doing for folks you have this very short animated series right now talk about that and talk about the relationship between and how it works functionally this relationship between your nft holders and then the show that you currently have and whatever your future plans are there so to speak to that we currently have if you want to we kind of have a casting pool so we use a staking mechanism which in crypto means you basically lock up your nft for a set period of time so a lot of our hold is blocked out for 24 months let's say once in that casting pool we're able to use those nfts in any of our content now our content is about a team of well between the people managing it and producing it as about 20 odd people and these these this is just growing um at the beginning it was writers from the community animators just sort of outsourced and as we go along this journey we start to uh bring in some incredible people and we were able to build out that world really how we see fit for our story i mean typically when you're building an ip you're building off of a comic or book that's already sort of delivered on the story so when you reverse that process the attention to building out your narrative has to be just like much more you know you have to be much more attentive to how how that story plays out and one of the things we've done to up to date is release these episodes that about five to ten minutes in length and then they're they're growing and growing like this five will be the first time we have a true professional writing team on it and i'm really excited for that and then you know they're just growing and growing but in the interim between season one and two we're sort of looking at doing um shorter episodes episodes that are about one to two minutes they can try new directors and writers and you know and just put these pieces together uh in a way that we can engage interest in the narrative and make sure as we go on this journey we're building the right narrative for deadheads holders so i i'm excited because i've now binged i guess you can say binged about a series that's i think like 20 minutes long total right now but uh i've been some of the episodes and i'm very excited for episode five so so glad to hear that i think this is where i would love for you all to maybe talk about how did you end up here running your own like movie studio or you know tv studio you're you're making ai art you get onto the the front of open c so you're like oh wow this is going pretty well how did how did you land here i'll quickly speak to that uh and then i'll let tempo as well because maybe we have different takes on it but i think where it where where it sort of birthed was this ai project that included a character and then all credits aboard apes because once board apes came out i think it was end of april early may everyone sort of saw the uses of ip as being very interesting it was the first time generative had been covered but ip allocation was not saying that we were really that familiar with we'd done it with ar house in february but it wasn't like a big project hadn't like really nailed that yet and when they did we sort of went to the drawing board and i had this background in film and templar's background in tech and we said you know what would be the best use of nfts uh looking at how you know board apes would enter the space and look at how crypto fights did and looking at zed run which is a game and looking across this entire spectrum through research research research and i just thought i mean what's stopping someone from building a production where they're not just stagnant images they're characters they're part of it what have you had pikachu how much would that be worth in year one versus year ten what if you like and you were the sole person you could go off and build a game you could go from have a book you could have a movie series if you had though that a bit if that narrative had existed for your character and you only ip that character you could build it out so like let's think of characters like let's say um you know harley quinn is played by margot robbie well the person selling harley quinn toys makes all the money that's the head of the studio they're making all the money now what if the person playing harley quinn could go off and make sort of make ends for what they had created uh in that that character celebrity relationship and that's just a really interesting concept that has not been explored tempo do you have a another version of events or is that how you remember no that that was like that was all 100 valid i'll i'll kind of give my takes and the things that i learned along the way as well though after so launching a art house ai artwork we at that point in time we thought nft is and the direction it was going was digital artwork as did 98 of the nft community back then what we started realizing with some of these other collections that came out like chubbies etc was that was that uh the power within nfts wasn't just artwork it was community and the community that it drives and the camaraderie that it that it builds is is extraordinarily strong and and powerful and so what we wanted to try to go and build was something that was community first and something that could survive long term in the space because clearly the space is extremely speculative a ton of these projects are going to go to zero and so jeremy and i sat together for a while and we said what is it that actually makes a project succeed long term in this space and the word that we came up with was narrative and narrative doesn't necessarily mean an animated series but in our case it did but narrative at that point was like it could have been nba top shot why is everybody top shot successful because it has narrative in the actual mba right like new things happen in the nba that make things more interesting for everyone to collect everybody stays around it's all very interesting we kind of wanted to mimic that but with by utilizing an animated series so where traditionally with an nft project it might get stale you know you have an awesome community you know when people get bored or go to another project that kind of dies out right whereas with dead heads because we're building out this narrative this underlying narrative with your characters that you own it it adds so much so much longevity to the project and to the vision and that that was sort of how we stumbled upon the concept and the road map behind deadheads i can touch on how we how we ended up at the art which is also kind of a somewhat interesting story i'll touch on it really really quickly ai arthouse obviously my my background is is ai after a art house we were looking at had okay ai artwork as physical canvases and as digital artwork very cool what other forms of air can we use and what we came across was um was audio so ai generated audio and the concept that we wanted to explore was resurrecting dead musicians and dead artists by by deep faking their audio and sort of bringing them back kind of eerie kind of creepy kind of interesting and exactly eerie creepy interesting there's the exact three words that we had as well and a bit of a a bit of a you know it's kind of questionable legally as well for a few different reasons like it's quite a legal gray area so so we ended up not going down that path but we got these models made based off of dead musicians and and with the idea of like having this vibe of you know creepy dystopian sort of rebels who were back from the dead ready to like you know disrupt the land of the living and all we did was throw away the audio part of that and generate basically you know obviously touch things up here and there but that's like the whole vibe of how deadheads came to be was was dead musicians resurrecting and then taking away the musicians part and just having dead things rising so that's why a ton of our copy early on was all about you know the dead will rise like it's all about the dead rising that's that's the whole concept behind deadheads but that's actually that's actually where it all started which not a lot of people know about but i love that well we're definitely keeping that part in i love hearing the origin stories of these concepts i talked to betty nft as my first episode about dead fellas and she had this like immediate thing of like we're doing zombies you know like i like or you know we're doing like you know that kind of eerie thing so it's fun for me and my my next question was going to be where do you start so you're like okay we can make art obviously you've been doing the art side of things and you have a little bit of a film back or you have a film background to some extent right and but like you're like great we're gonna create a massive intellectual property and narrative and story and characters and right like what was step one in beginning this process then how did it all begin as a fantastic question uh we sort of went uh to our community and uh earlier in my career when i was working on these film sets i sort of noticed tons of laborers fulfilling on one vision and so in this scenario our our ethos has always kind of been let's get the people in the community to to really contribute as a result um we found some producers who were emmy award winners we found writers who had written incredible comics and these people all came into the fold um we built from just we're sort of looking at production distribution to be sort of decentralized as possible and over time we realized that while competing with all these other projects it was to our advantage to onboard sort of writers who had incredible experience um writing about you know great stories world builders animators with you know plenty of uh experience and it would just make our end product of deadheads better so at the moment it's a hybrid of like community members who are contributing with what they're able to do be it voice acting or show running as well as professionals sprinkled in there and and we're just as we go further along this path able to bring in i mean the most incredible people and this year a lot of them will come to light that will be able to uh guide this ip to where i it deserves to be so the original vision where you start is basically hey what we know how to do is do an nft drop because we've done that and we know how to produce the artwork so did you all handle the the creating the layers and obviously with this ai art background did you have somebody else who did those sort of digital layers or you all handled those and do this nft drop we have our our incredible artist pozzi who was who actually did all of the artwork for dead heads and then i was responsible for the generative scripting um and the 3d modeling of it in and in the 3d software yeah okay awesome so you're like all right we're going to do this nft drop we're going to raise money and out of this community we'll find the people who are going to create our stories and you know our world did you know that the first thing you wanted to do was like a mini youtube series was that was that obvious from the get or was that something that evolved as you saw who was in your community our northern light has always been to do it for as much distribution as possible and reach as many people as we can because at the other day we are building ip like if you're building transformers what have you so you really want to reach the max amount of people and youtube is is a free accessible way to do that um we've seen other projects go like a more closed off route and i can't really understand the benefit to doing that um because the value isn't necessarily in each show and owning the each show like with thousands of other people it's participating and and really owning your character and having like remember some fierce debates in the stoner cats discord about whether or not we should just open up stoner cat episodes to everyone and i will say i was in the camp of yes let's do it let's show everybody's donor cat episode yeah it just makes sense i mean you're arbitrarily blocking it because you can not because it makes more sense i think when you do that like the idea of the episode living on the blockchain is cool but uh it can live on the blockchain and it can live on youtube there's no need to to do one or the other and so in your initial marketing of this project did you say hey we need we want writers and we want like creatives and talent we this is the kind of person we want to buy into this project because we're going to need you to build this project was that a part of the marketing and you're nodding your head for people who can't uh see so i'm going to do a quick follow-up which is you can expand on that and answer that but then the follow-up is and do you feel like that helped you get more reach for the project initially i'm interested in marketing strategy strategies in general as there are so many projects that launch today that want attention want to want to sell out want like anybody to pay attention to them so i'm curious how y'all did it i'll start off by telling you what we did not want what we didn't want and what and what jeremy had seen previously was you know jeremy and i as the two executive producers we have a vendor of animators who clock in clock out create creating someone else's ip that they don't necessarily have any ownership or don't really care about you have writers who are writing because they're getting paid and they're writing 10 other things and this is just one thing like we what what we wanted to build here and what we're and what we are building is a brand where the creatives are actually taking ownership and taking pride in their work so they're actually doing it like like on their in their spare time our animators are like creating fun little derivatives and and our writers are so passionate about it they're constantly coming up with new world ideas like like we we we're kind of taking almost like the tesla model where a ton of employees of tesla are extremely passionate about the brand they love what they're doing and we wanted to take that into sort of the hollywood space um and maybe i'll let jeremy touch on the specific marketing a little bit more but but that was sort of like like that was like the north side that was the culture that was that was that's the culture yeah yeah the the marketing we didn't want to gatekeep uh anybody from um entering but we didn't at the time gas wars were a huge point of contention and i mean they still are but to a degree they've kind of cooled off because people realize that they're necessary but at the time gas was like it's the project's fault people were so sort of and the entities were so unaware of the causes of gas wars that they would like blame the founders oh yeah i remember that and so what what month did you launch remind me june 30th so you launched in june of 2021 and at that point did did you all have a little bit of followings in the space networks in the space because of the work you'd already been doing one thing i talk about a lot on this show to people who are thinking about launching a project is like like any other industry it's helpful to have a network it's helpful to know people in the space and not be just like an artist who out of the blue pops up and hopes to sell your project for a million dollars that's not really how it works so i'm curious for for y'all how did you get that initial community how did you get that initial following or you know preferred for deadheads maybe it was coming from the past work you had done that's a great question we so we obviously had a bit of a community from when we launched a art house we did have a discord and and we had um we had some names in it and almost every name that was in that discord has gone on to do big and great things in the space actually just because you know they were so early back then zedeka is one that you talked to my man crypto jesus drop acid um but but you might you might want to cut out drop ass i'm not sure if we're allowed but anyways um oh no i don't care yeah um and uh so but on the twitter side of things it was very much untouched for us like i i created my twitter account for deadheads and i started getting followers i started reaching out to people like when when you're starting out if you don't have that initial network you really have to go ground and pound and just outreach outreach outreach reach out to everyone communicate with them just connect like really try to grow that network it's not necessarily the sexiest thing in the world but when i go back and scroll through all of my dms from back in back near sort of the middle of june some of the people like it's it's quite funny because like it's it's a bunch of people that are now quite big in the space and we have this history of me dming them back like june 30th of like hey you gotta you know can you please check out this project deadhead's like it's 3d art which was very unique back then but i think what really helped us explode considering we didn't necessarily have a huge network was the fact that the art was so unique for that specific point in time so pozzi our artist did all this 3d art which was somewhat unheard of at that point it was basically zen ft was sort of the other one who did the bonsais but people seeing like sort of a pfp based 3d model was quite unheard of and a lot of people took to the art immediately and then and so we started getting a bunch of people in the space um a bunch of people on our discord and i kind of it very much like got out of control in the best of ways possible very quickly like we didn't know how to manage a discord at that point really without getting that much volume like we were getting spam all over the place but that's kind of all all part of the fun all part of the process it's fascinating to me that the original community it sounds like came in in part because of the 3d art not because of the decentralizing ip premise i will say we don't know exactly where they came in we don't have the analytics behind that but gary vaynerchuk is on record saying that he came in specifically because we're the first people to angle towards production so although we were the first 3d sort of character model we were also the first person to tackle production and nfts i will also say we sort of sat this for new founders we sort of sat down and looked at the projects that were in existence and we said you know how can we make a difference how can we really make an impact based on who we are but also like these products have like a few thousand people they're all comprised of a few thousand people when you break it down you just have to find a few thousand believers and like then you're gonna make it i i joked about early you know the the startup entrepreneurs who were in like the b hag era i feel like that was like a whole thing where there were like a bunch of books about having to have your bhag and i feel like there's also the like ten thousand true believers i think we're hitting all the notes here just like startup founders have your big hairy audacious goal of your ten thousand true believers um that makes sense though that's you know i that's a theme that i hear a lot when i talk to founders has been somewhat luck we hit at the right time but we found that point of differentiation we found that thing that wasn't being done in the space yet which of course gets harder as the space evolves because more and more things start being done but i mean i would argue that a lot of things that we see now like replicas of things that came out like years ago or like pat in this past year like even look at this last week there's like kenzo that looks like only one i mean you see it happen like constantly oh there's so many and and it's interesting to see some derivative projects even are like you know doing very well i i tend to kind of shy away i i'm i like than something that feels totally new and revolutionary but i i think these are some of these derivatives end up going off to do very well i want to keep going in this very detailed timeline because i think you guys are building something so unique and i really like knowing at each stage what was going on so you sell out your first round of deadheads you've you've said hey we want writers we want animators we want talented people and at that point you you have this concept that you're gonna do a short youtube series first with you know netflix as the thing you're putting on your vision board or whatever you know some version of that and how do you go about you put an application link in the discord and say show us what you've got how do you go about now crafting a story in a show and again becoming a production company we actually did exactly that okay i guess i could do it too yeah okay we opened an election an open election to everyone who had just joined our community and said what are you good at how can you fit here's where we need people and someone can quote expand on that but it really was just like who was good at what and then we had out of that emmy award-winning producer you know we had writers who were all over the like tons of incredible ip that you're familiar with um we had artists and we had marketers we had we had business development like you see in you know ben exit who's currently working for the team as well we developers like squirtle these people all that still work here came from the community some have gone on to do other things and some have stayed yeah it was the way that we did it was we had all these different discord channels for all the different roles everyone would come in and give their spiel and then the community would be able to vote on who they thought is sort of the most qualified for the specific role who they would want to charge and then whoever had the most votes or if jeremy and i saw multiple people that sort of had a lot of votes and were incredibly qualified we would obviously bring them on board so you did like a decentralized hiring model from the beginning as well yes and then it sounds like what has happened is that there has been some you said this right you started to supplement the team then with outside folks where you're like we have this one clear gap somebody from the community can't fill it all right we have to bring somebody from outside which again as i as i dig deeper as i learn more it does feel like the sweet spot is this decentralization centralization balance which is sort of what you're describing needing to strike in this case yeah we're really building the ship as we sail it like you know like there is no precedent for building uh an animated series and using ip that's distributed in any way shape or form so in terms of how much and how qualified some people are the one area we found that really is great source from the community are voice actors we found that it's like really engaging and uh people really take that and it doesn't require like a massive leap of like understanding blender to like run an animation or you know what have you have you had awkward moments in the community where you didn't hire folks from the community and then ultimately hired folks from outside and now the community's like well what the heck it's supposed to be a community project like has that been something you all have had to navigate it's never actually been too bad like there's there's obviously been some voice actors and some writers and stuff who like aren't quite qualified enough to the level of quality that you need to have a show be actually successful outside of the nft space but everyone's very understanding and still very supportive and at the end of the day they're still collectors of the ip and they want to see it succeed so we we haven't had too many big issues in that department somewhat surprisingly actually that does surprise me i love i've been in a lot of communities i love communities and i also find communities can be uh you know scary places at times i want to i don't know if this is playing devil's advocate but i want to play out a scenario for y'all and get your reactions so i talked to a gentleman named john rogers last week if you haven't gone and listened to that episode go check out that episode of john rogers and he was really the first person to be given this role of like overseeing franchise ip at disney and basically being a business person saying how are we thinking about the pirates of the caribbean franchise or xyz franchise over the next 10 years and we were talking about decentralized versus centralized models of intellectual property and one of the concerns he raised about this decentralized or even pseudo-decentralized models and he used board apes as the example is you know if you have one board ape go and sign a deal with caa to make a movie about a backstory for that ape and then you have another ape that goes and you know signs a different movie deal for a future story about them as astronauts in space and and the stories don't align at all you do ultimately hurt the the ip as a whole because part of what makes ip powerful is when you do have this cohesive story that you can kind of track over the long term how do you all think about that risk do you communicate about that to the community of hey we need to be a little bit in sync here i you mentioned a mechanism you all have earlier that i think somewhat handles this but but curious as to your reactions to that if i may before tempo you have a we have a trade-off right is it how much these other people are hurting you or is it how much they're helping you and i would argue the amount it helps to have all these people with a vested interest it's i'm going to talk more on this later it's a fan community hybrid so by having people be evangelists for their individual characters albeit if their comic isn't a hit it probably doesn't damage your ip because no one saw it anyway and if it is and if it is it probably helps right p and ultimately you still own dead heads core story and all these interesting sort of pieces that fly out of it give you more ability and more reach does it hurt your having a individual single message like story perhaps if your communication channels don't do a good job of balancing it as well and letting people know what is the core narrative versus what are these offspring narratives derivatives i just want to push a little bit further because i think of course if somebody creates a comic that is lame or doesn't work and nobody sees it it's not a problem but i think what about the scenario where uta one of the biggest challenge agencies in the world reps one ape and caa the other biggest talent agency in the world reps another ape and now they're making movies that very much are going to be seen by people and the narratives don't connect and and you don't have a sort of cohesive franchise the official channels can communicate what they want to communicate with the actual brand name so having a collection of apes coming out in two movies but the movies are called like you know dogs crawl and like happy planet i mean these movies are different universes but they're just using apes characters like unilaterally all the apes are benefiting because now your local coffee shop might want one your burger king ad might want one so everyone kind of benefits in that conflict so long as the the original communication channels and the actual brand itself is like managing what is released as like their overall narrative now i guess it's just constantly this balance of like does it hurt or help you to have a lot of people out there leveraging your individual ip i believe it helps massively i think this is an important point and i i do think this is an important also place where you all have a little bit of a differentiation from aboard apes and what i heard you say earlier i think is really critical so it's probably worth repeating which is you all have a somewhat centralized ownership on deadheads and deadheads lore and deadheads as franchise ip but then these characters can go off and exist in other universes that's a little different than board apes now board apes can still have a central narrative to some extent of like a brand i think i almost see them more as like supreme you know then i see them as like a movie studio trying to build the next next star wars so i think they are playing in different games it doesn't be dismissive of of them or their ability to succeed but i do think it's important to to make it clear in the deadheads world you guys are trying to build the next massive lore franchise and there is a you have centralized some of that in a way that needs to happen for that to be possible while also trying to let people just amplify the sort of resonance or or the the fame call it of of these sort of this this artwork and these characters and you're making the bet that that all works sort of symbiotically to help the project as a whole yeah and i think what we're gonna see as well is um once once the brand of dead heads has sort of outlined the universe and the lore and and whatnot like it's in other production houses best interest to sort of stay within those constraints more or less so like when disney acquired star wars for example you don't see them go out and create an entirely new story because they only ip now it's like it's it's in their best interest to keep the story because that's where all the fans are everyone understands that the world makes sense to them so i i think i mean obviously we have no idea because this has never really been done before but i think we'll see some kind of hybrid of that play out i would say like an interesting real world example is like is if better call saul sucked would it hurt breaking bad or could breaking bad make a movie that's really interesting well and i think from a holder perspective because part of what i'm trying to do with this deep dive on intellectual property is to also help people understand like how do you monetize most people are in this space right they want to make money most of us aren't just like you know oh we just love the art there's some of that but most people want to make money and i think it's really under important if you're trying to make money to understand what kind of project you're dealing with right that that a blit maps bet is not the same as a v friends bet is not the same as a deadhead's bet it's not the same as the board apes bet like there's enough nuance between these projects that it actually does look a little different and so for example i think your i your r2d2 example is really interesting because what you all are are trying to do is say hey imagine if you own r2d2 the deals you could go make now you get to make the coca-cola brand deal for r2d2 to be in their commercial because you own that particular character but it it had to become r2d2 first right and if the owner of r2d2 had gone and made a stupid deal to ruin the r2d2 character before star wars became star wars they would be effed so the calculation here is sort of who do you believe in most to create incredible value and ip are you a creator who wants to take a bet on yourself and who wants to work within this cool deadheads ecosystem but bet on yourself awesome do you want to bet on you guys do you want to bet on garyvee like who who are you betting on to create amazing ip and then you get to celebrate the fact that you own a piece of it is there anything i missed as part of that i would love to get your reactions to that that was that was actually extraordinarily on point i have i have no other comments to make yeah no you you absolutely killed that podcast is over [Laughter] no no you nailed it i mean it it like there are risks inherent they're risk inherent with any model and the interesting thing that we all have to do is sort of discover what model will succeed and how to build it if people didn't own these characters i mean we've heard other people have ideas like give them production credits i see models where there's no ownership of this ip and i and i and i'm like why would you want one because at the end of the day having like one in thousands of these objects and if they're not significant to the story don't really bring any added value with a deadhead you not only have the character be it damien you can then go in the green room and mint the couch you know you can mint the fridge you can bring with you one of one assets from within this story everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto.x or nft unstoppable domains lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log into web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unstoppable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com so this is what i want to get to next because you're starting to segue us into where you're innovating from a technical and elsewise perspective you mentioned the green room the green room in there explain to folks this the the green room the staking part of this the show token explain sort of this broader ecosystem and how you guys are really innovating the green room enables people to collect digital assets from within the story and each object within episodes as like like they were props from shows can be minted to your wallet and in limited supplies so the couch from the simpsons if you minted that on episode one season one what would that be worth down the line is a collector's item so having these scarce digital assets that are part of the story that every episode in the green room you're able to bring with you adds a whole another dimension to this nft storytelling that we're doing currently does it add another dimension to the creative side too like do you guys feel like you're especially attuned to the little to the little details you're throwing into the episode like i think one of the the items you could make from the last episode was like a like an off-brand red bull like you know looked like a red bull can but it was branded and you know in the dead fellas universe language or like or dead dead heads sorry deadhead's universe language like is that do you guys think about that and you're like oh we think this one will be big or or is that fun in the like writer's room so to speak yeah i know it's tons of fun we saw like a bong lamp go for thousand thousand dollars you know we've seen some really funny props so we do consider it like we do consider how interesting the props can be that get given out from these episodes because we do think that in the long term they'll have some interesting values and explain to folks how they can buy these props because it's not just your typical ethor fiat or or usdc so the way that deadheads so it's it's only dead collectors that are able to collect things from the green room at the current moment in time but what we're tying in is is this is this new mechanism where we have our own quote-unquote currency which is like an ecosystem currency called show token and the way you can earn one show equals one show not passive income exactly exactly and and so the way that you earn show by participating in the dead ecosystem is by staking your characters into our casting pool and allowing us to use them in our series so you you passively earn an ecosystem token that you can then exchange in the green room after every episode for these collectors items and so these collectors items could be you know imagine you're watching lord of the rings and suddenly there's the one ring to rule them all and you can you can get in and mint a limited ring to rule them all and that ring may or may not come with some kind of utility in the future but at the at the very least it's this insanely cool collector's item that that because you're such a fan of the series you get to then own and and you have proof of ownership you know i have only one of 10 rings that are out there in the world or i have i have the only like arya stark needle sword like these collectors items that become so big in these series are really really fun to collect and it's something that we haven't necessarily seen happen in the digital space yet obviously there's merchandise physical merchandise that is quite popular but on the digital side it's quite unexplored so that's kind of what we're extremely excited about in the deadhead's ecosystem is building out digital merchandise and digital assets and you mentioned that obviously you get this because you stake your deadhead and then you therefore collect show and then use the show to buy these but explain the other side of staking and and i think we may have touched on it earlier but as we're talking about this general ecosystem what does staking do broadly so you can stake your deadhead into our casting pool and what staking does is it locks it up for a period of time you get to choose this period it's between one month and 24 months the majority of stakers are actually staking for for 24 months so so a period of two years and by staking you're essentially giving us a license to utilize your ip so obviously traditionally we wouldn't be able to go and do that we need your permission to use your ip in ours content and so by staking it into our casting pool you're giving us that license to do so and in exchange for that you get obviously cool cameos and all of our content which you love to see because you love your character and you love seeing it sort of be expanded and see its ip expanded for you but at the same time you get to earn show token so there's kind of like two benefits to you i think this is such an interesting concept and i talked about it on the episode last week with john rogers a little bit of how this is like a really fascinating and maybe sort of ideal model which is you know down the line could provide a way for folks to really reap the monetary rewards of of being a part of a major ip without like breaching securities laws you know like the question that i kind of have rattling around my head again as like a you know dirty capitalist or whatever is okay well if i'm gonna own part of the ip for lucasfilms or star wars like what i want is i want the financial side of that too and it it strikes me and i don't want to put you in a position to to get awkward with your securities attorneys or anything but like strikes me that this is a really interesting work around which is to say okay you own the individual character ip we sort of have this centralized control over the broader piece but but you know it is also sort of a decentralized ip because people own their individual characters you stake with us and then you know maybe and i don't think you guys have said this but maybe down the line if we get super massive and big we can argue that the payments we're making to you are in exchange for licensing your character and and therefore you know it's it's not just like buy into this and you're now an investor and because that would be a clear securities violation is that sort of on your radar and something that's interesting to y'all it's actually extraordinarily interesting to us and it's something that we had to pay a lot of attention to and be really careful with we have a really good team of lawyers who dug into this quite heavily and that's that's obviously one of the mechanisms that differentiates us but the other one is is the fact that it is just an ecosystem token it's not it's not a currency that you can go and buy there's no liquidity pools that we've created for people to go and sell for actual usd um it's this ecosystem token that lets you participate within the deadheads universe to uh you know it's it's like rewards points almost right like it allows you to participate at sort of a higher level and that was another question i had actually which is i i it looks like there isn't a liquidity pool i understand y'all clearly haven't created a liquidity pool for this i have others created liquidity pools for for show token or that's not something that's sort of sprung up um i think someone has on sushi swap i i don't think it necessarily has a ton of liquidity in it though so we haven't necessarily had to come across that but at some point in the future when it does become bigger obviously there's gonna be nothing we can do to stop collectors from creating their own liquidity pools but yeah it hasn't it hasn't been an issue yet and how did you all come up with this concept like was there this concept of we're going to sell artifacts from the show and and the staking and the earnings show to buy the artifacts like was this something over time was it were you sitting with your lawyers like i i think this is really cool i don't have another project doing something like this tell me if there is now and i'm assuming if there is that's because they copied you but like how did you come up with this idea it definitely didn't happen overnight like we we started off with the concept of the green room and the way that it is right now in the green room because show token you you can't actually use show token yet this is going to be a season two thing but the way it is right now currently in the green room is you have to trade in one of these dead tickets which is an nft that we gave out for free to deadheads holders um a few months ago and so by trading in these tickets you get to collect these collector's items we started seeing a lot of issues with that mechanism primarily was the cost of gas to a claim a ticket be burn a ticket c mint a collector's item and obviously using erc20 tokens the gas prices are reduced exponentially and so that was sort of the first idea that sort of got us down that that route staking was also something that we had in the back of our minds like how how can we come up with a way where we don't have to reach out individually to all these dead heads holders and get them to sign contracts for us to be able to use their ip obviously that's not scalable in any way so that was sort of where we came up with the staking pool they were kind of in parallel and then i think it was jeremy who sort of came up with the idea of why don't we give out rewards that sort of ties the staking pool in with the green room and sort of allow this whole ecosystem to be tied together in a really unique way what percent of your community stakes their dead heads right now is that information you're you're open to sharing i believe it's roughly 20 at this point a combination of burning and staking i don't know i don't know what that means but i think that's great i'm like trying to think if i have a commentary and if that's a good if that's bullish for the project or barry i think it's that sounds great um i mean i can tell you i can tell you matt kayla shows like a 130 or something he's stake all of them for two years our other biggest holder owns 140 or something and he staked all of his for two years like we we was it was it matt who said he's got the best dead yes that was the props episode he's like no i just need the world to understand that i have the best dad exactly so we finally take it so we can now use it in all of our content well you better pick it man i mean it's the best so cool i want to talk about your episodes and i first want to commend either you or somebody on your team for the music choices i think y'all i'm going to curse here so if you have kids i [ __ ] nailed the music i'm like music is such an integral part to any sort of artistic experience to me i think i spent more time picking the theme music for this show than i did like prepping any other element of this show so by the way y'all in the comments i really appreciate it when you compliment the theme music because like i spent time on that um so i think that's fantastic did either of you who runs the music on this this thing it's a guy called jeremy uh remix jeremy and he's our sound designer he worked travis scott and mcdonald's in the past he's extremely talented oh yeah okay so yeah he's a serious dude and it shows i mean there's the first if you guys haven't watched the deadheads show just watch like the first minute of the first episode the way it goes from it just like the way the vibe evolves in that first minute so good i'm curious though what what is the goal with these episodes they run from i don't know the shortest one's like four minutes to 10 minutes i know you said the next one the episode five might be a bit longer it's the first with a full professional writing team but what is the goal here to get attention from netflix like where what was the what was the ambition with this initial round of animations the initial goal with season one is to prove the concept and to show show traditional media the power of web 3 entertainment specifically so showing them how viable it is getting their attention showing that it's possible showing them how to do it and in the background we're forming all these all these connections and potential partnerships with more traditional web 2 media who are starting to notice hey like this is something that is here to stay this is something that adds a ton of value to holders and fans and it's something that is essentially the future for a ton of big media brands so it's it's very much proof of concept stage season one season two we're really going to be ramping up in terms of uh uh partnerships and in terms of quality as well and then the end goal is to create a big feature film of deadheads and get it in you know whether it's box office or it's it's netflix amazon some some kind of streaming service get it on there so i love that so it's film over a tv show like if if y'all had to pick if you had both options netflix like we'll do a show with you we'll do a movie with you but you got to pick one is movie where you want to go uh it's tough because movies like to produce a you know full feature movie it'll be it takes it takes time right like it'll be like two years of time so whereas like a season two we can probably get done and a lot quicker so oh so it's more like seasons in it and then a movie ultimately down the line yeah i mean it's we're not necessarily married to anything but that's that's kind of our north star at this point is to to partner with some big media brands um make sure we get a ton of eyeballs on this in terms of distribution and create content that people at the end of the day really want to see and start to fall in love with it might seem like an absurd nip an absurd nitpick like obviously if netflix offers you anything you're thrilled but i didn't know if there was something strategic there where i'm interested in the business mechanics and the strategy around building ip and i didn't know if there was a reason that a movie from what y'all have learned is somehow like gonna catapult ip more than a tv show would or something like that but it sounds like there's no super strong preference there it's it's yeah what i'll say to the idea of episode or movie i think the general core concept that we're looking at is like a lot of people can't relate to wanting to be part of a community where the value is so online and rubbing shoulders with other crypto natives be it let's say you're in a discord and the value is to like beep another one of these holders in the discord because you're like connected to them online um a lot of people can't relate to this vision right it's like you join a tennis club you join to be partners with these people who play tennis in your local community and when you join a discord i mean if you don't play tennis you don't join tennis club you don't play on the disc if you don't play online with twitter and discord you don't play in these communities so for us the core fundamental vision is like we got to produce desire through fandom a fandom community and you're able to participate because it relates to your life once it gets those netflix movie levels it's it can relate to your life opposed to like having to relate to being part of a discord or twitter so how are those web two conversations going any alpha to share with us there episode five yeah you said you know it's proof of concept you're trying to show web 2 how it's going web to media you know what's how does that go what does that sound like what are the pushbacks what's the excitement like give us the give us the scoop on all of it i mean we've we've heard from some people who disrupted these industries that they just love it we've heard from other people who disrupted ips that like if they were alive now they would have never had to you know do what they had done we have noticed everyone in hollywood take note and people came in like stoner cats and had given a shot but aren't exactly sure how to navigate it and they're getting their feet and there's people like you know matrix and ghostbusters who have kind of done the same where it's like we don't want to give you anything we just want to make money from you basically and sell you something but they're trying to layer on interesting ways they can add utility to their credit and i really want them all to like do really well because it would help us uh in short hollywood at large are noticing there's interesting entities but i'm not sure they're piecing together why perfectly i'm not sure we are either but together you know as we go on this journey web uh there's no doubt that it's it's it's like entertainment is is web3 is coming for entertainment the same way it is for finance and gaming have you had conversations with major streamers we've had conversations with people you know who have worked or worked there but we haven't um we haven't done anything remotely concrete more just trying to understand what we're doing and understand how you know impactful it could be because we're the people kind of doing it right now so um yeah we have weekly meetings about that kind of stuff lay that groundwork so you've episode five coming out reiterate for me the the uniqueness of episode five is it gonna be longer it's a it's a full full writer's room tell me what the it's episode five of season one is that that's what's next episode five of season one is next it's going to be the biggest and highest quality one yet or at least i i sure hope it is i've i've seen the animatic for it already and it's it's it's [ __ ] awesome like we have a really talented uh animation director who stepped in for this for the for episode five and six now which is some which is a bit of a hole in what we've had previously so i'm really excited to see that sort of come to life and then like jeremy's touchdown as well really good solid professional writers who just sort of make it make it a little bit more entertaining for people not necessarily in the crypto world specifically which is something that we've constantly gone back and forth on jeremy and i like whether like how how niche do we want to go with the jokes and with the content and with the references and stuff and i think with these new writers we're striking a really good balance between it's still clearly for the nft community but in a much more subtle way where it's still entertaining for anybody who doesn't know anything about krypto or nfts i was wondering about that because it is ripe with colloquial references from cosmo de medici and stoner cats and you know all these sort of very specific references which is fun if you if you're in on the joke for sure okay so how many episodes is are planned for season one and then is the hope that season two will is the plan for season two also be on youtube or that's where maybe there's an intermediary step between youtube and amazon web services or just give that that kind of road map and i apologize it might be out there yeah what we're looking at so six episodes of episode of season one and we're calling it kind of like a pilot season what we want to do like i said you know sort of earlier is we aren't uh we were found first so now we need to understand our story for our fans so to do that it's gonna require a bit of experimentation so before season two we're gonna experiment with one to two minute shorts written by a variety of professional writers and anyone can write one we're gonna have like kind of open that process up look at tons of animators directors and all these all the like and really put our resources to the test to find the narrative that resonates with our community the strongest and then build up off that uh in you know in season two and and i can't speak to who may or may not pick it up because it depends on how we deliver and how we how we produce it and how well we do so i have to say talking to you guys i rarely want to launch an nft being in this space though i am or maybe because i'm in this space as deep as i am i know how much work it is so i very rarely am like tomorrow is when my project's coming i may someday decide to launch one but it would only be if i really felt like there was very clear value i could add and a real need for it whatever but i have to say listening to you guys talk about this you're one of the few projects that like i'm like oh this kind of makes me want to launch an nft because it i don't know you make it sound fun and the building the story world and all the rest of it one thing that terrifies me when i think about launching an nft project is like the forever nature of it like it feels like we're at least in a stage of the nft world where like you're marrying this thing you know like the original founders can't leave and does that scare you guys ever or do you feel like oh well in ten five years you know we want to be in this for five years anyways and at that point it'll be big enough that there can be a new ceo who comes on or how do you think about that relationship to time i think it's something that we're both so passionate about that it's it hasn't like it's it's really hasn't scared us at all like like we're at the end of the day we're both really just creatives who want to create things and and want to innovate in a space that's so so untraversed like it's it's so fun and there's gonna be so many other things that we obviously can't do down the line as we continue down this this path in the world of nfts but in terms of sort of feeling pigeon holder or or whatever like it's it's really honestly felt like a godsend and i think a lot of that comes from our community itself like we have one of the most like we have one of the most precious communities it's of like the entire entity space like everybody i love every single person in our entire community that they really make like they take the stress away from managing an nft project because they're so understanding and they're so passionate and they're they're so creative themselves that it really rubs off on us as founders as well which is what keeps us so driven and keeps us so passionate about what we're doing that's beautiful and on that note i think maybe having one of you talk about the twitter impact program the twitter impact program is a is an initiative that we launched uh about a month and a half ago where the inspiration for it came from the fact that we really needed to expand our reach outside of our our community like we we have a really strong passionate community it's quite small in terms of the entire nft ecosystem and so what we really wanted to start incentivizing was people going out and expanding their reach and becoming sort of influencers as it were that are that are still part of the deadheads ecosystem so obviously with board apes is sort of the prime example a ton of board ape holders are like really big influences in the space which really helps gain eyeballs on their projects specifically and it's something that really helped them succeed in the early days and jeremy who's a massive golf fan can't play for the life of him but he loves watching the pga [Laughter] and there's something called the pga player impact program which is where we got the entirety of the inspiration from and essentially what it is is the exact same thing as our twitter impact program where it's not necessarily the best golfers that go out and make the most money in the in the player impact program it's the players that actually make the most impact on in terms of viewership and bringing new people into the game so that's where all the inspiration came from and it sort of manifested itself into this twitter impact program where we have prizes of a hundred thousand dollars going to the most highly contributors on twitter who help sort of grow our her brand and and uh and expand our reach sounds like baseball could use that too it's just about get like how do we get young people to watch this sport is that what i'm hearing exactly i mean tempo kicked me while my connection was down [Laughter] we saw that it was a great way to to utilize the people when you have individuals that are high value that make your sport more powerful incentivizing that process is necessary maybe walk me just one step deeper on this you talk about this hundred thousand dollars that you have as a pool you know is this somebody tweets and then somebody joins the discord and is like oh i saw this from so-and-so's tweet they get money or like how do you how do you figure out how to distribute these rewards to your your community the leaderboard is all based off of engagement and reach on twitter specifically so you put out a tweet that mentions deadheads tags deadheads hashtags deadheads and you know however many people that tweet reaches that's a direct impact on our brand specifically because it brings all those people in and gets them sort of recognized that gets gets our brand recognized i should say so when garyvee interview guys for props and drops did he just get the whole just the 100k just went off gary one tweet gary's dq'd okay very cool i think that's awesome i just want to kind of talk broadly about what you've learned in this process and i mentioned earlier you were on an episode of props and drops which was one of garyvee's podcasts and and matt kalish etc and they asked you if you've considered taking outside investment and at the time i think you said that's an interesting question and i'd love for you to talk about what that calculation looks like you know if you if you have any new thoughts on that if you're thinking about it like just kind of the business calculation you guys are making on outside investment versus just raising from the community it's been incredibly simple for us so far which is do we need money and so far the answer's always been no and we've we've always had enough money through all these community raises where we haven't had to go out and seek seek external funding when we do go out and need external funding for something that costs a ton of money like like a feature film for example that's when we're definitely going to have to go out and and have a sort of a round of funding for that but thus far it hasn't really been something that we've had to worry about which is very much a blessing so it's something you expect down the line there will be massive expenses that will probably require going externally is it something where you'd see if you could get the millions from a community first or it's it's going to be so clearly out of reach that you'll you'll definitely want to go out to outside sources i think it's very much i think it's very much a play by ear type type thing like if if we need 100 million dollars we're obviously not going to be able to get that from our community so we're going to have to go and explore different ways of doing that but at the same time it depends on where we're at and you know when we do need that funding say it's a year down the road who knows where we're going to be you're you're down the road like we've already seen like artifact mute and apes like all these different projects are able to raise you know 100 million dollars from their community so it's it's it's possible but it's more of a play by your type thing you too could be bought by nike yeah exactly i'm just kidding um so one of the biggest learnings like what have you learned about building intellectual property and building ip what have been the things that have surprised you and just the biggest takeaways i mean we've learned a lot and still feel like there's so much unlearned um it's quite remarkable actually like how how intricate this is i think talking to a lot of professionals uh who have understood ip historically we've learned a lot about the model we're choosing and oftentimes you know it does come up to some resistance i think like overall in this project there's just been so many learnings and and i i think one of the greatest ones is that this uh that the macros in a market will like have their preferences and like you kind of need to build true to your north star because if the sort of the theory was there at the start it doesn't change based on your floor it doesn't change what happened yesterday if the theory is good you know the hypothesis is right you need to sort of fulfill upon it and you need to understand that the macros might not understand but but you have to build it so our fan community our like our nft entertainment model uh this this absolutely unexplored territory is our like our gift to go in and like have fun and create uh and and with that we need to just we need to trust the process and enjoy it tempo what about you yeah like just to expand on that there's there's projects in the nft space that are just that they're nft projects and if their floor goes down and people lose interest their project's dead right like there's that's that's just 100 what they are whereas with dead heads we're like a multimedia brand that's using web3 technology and using nfts as this mechanism of decentralizing our ip and so as long as we have funding we have revision we're making all these amazing connections like outside of the nft space and so like we're we're not necessarily on a timer of raise our floor to 10th or we're going to die in you know one month like we we can take our time build ip which obviously takes a lot of time to build and stick with our long term vision and make sure that we're growing something that's here to stay so i know you all have talked to people who work for major ip and i'm curious what do you ask them what have you learned about the process of building a story or building a story world or if or what areas of focus have you you know kind of honed in on when you're talking to players who've already built massive ip i think talking to traditional natives of ip and entertainment uh gives us an idea and a window uh into like why it worked then um and sort of it enables us to like meet really like important people and like understand their theories behind what they would do in our position um the specifics of that like are sort of manifesting in the shorts that we're talking about and understanding our own narrative and our own story better and they also manifest in the way in which we're going to be doing like casting and and sort of ways in which we're going to give all and if we're hoping like you know bring in a lot of other projects and and give everybody the advantage of uh utility that deadhead soldiers have and i just like within our project you know like having we had board apes in episode two with cool cats in episode five and like really making that process uh stronger and more beneficial to the holders i mean anyone who has experience is helpful in a mentor capacity the specifics no one knows so you're just kind of having fun with them and throwing darts yeah it's also it's also incredibly inspiring talking to these people who have really disrupted ip and and disrupted media and sort of getting their their takes not only from the sense that like everybody kind of starts off in the same way where it's very like kind of bare bones kind of hustling like like they they see us and they say yeah we were in that exact same boat like when we started out this is just the way that it is and then also getting the confirmation from them like hearing someone of their stature like watch our episodes and say the content's actually really good and having the confidence that they have in us to say like you guys are going to make it it's something that that really like helps us sort of stay grounded and not worry about anything happening short term and just know that we're on a good path awesome well thank you guys so much for joining me really it's been such a pleasure learning about your project both in doing research before this interview and diving deeper with the two of you here i think it is really bold what you guys are doing i i love the way you guys are innovating i hope other projects in the space take notes because i think it helps us all when when the space is just better any anything that i didn't touch on that you're like well we have to talk about this this is the main thing about deadheads anything i missed or final words we said so much good content about the narrative we've talked about fan community engagement we've talked about the green room and attack we've talked about sort of top to bottom how we developed it so it's tough to add anything to that i will just say thank you so much for having us thank you for appreciating what we're building i hope more people in the space build based around what they want to build not try and play into the average opinion of what they think people will buy because nfts as a medium have a ton of potential and i think if we as a community enjoy that potential and build upon it then we're uh we're helping we're helping the entire space in the long term yeah they also have a ton of staying power too which is something that i know a lot of nft creators are they may feel rushed and jeremy and i kind of felt the same way early on with with dead heads that like oh my god this is like you know this is this is something that we just got to get out there before you know nft's crash because nfts are you know highly speculative which they are very highly speculative but in terms of the actual technology it's it's 100 here to stay it's going to disrupt so many different industries and hollywood's going to be one of them and hopefully that's us so thank you so much for having us on here until next time absolute pleasure as always fascinating fact about you jeremy that i just learned is that you don't have like a one home base unless i'm wrong about that you basically live out of a suitcase and travel the world and have been doing that for the last four years or so is that true yeah so i live out of a suitcase and i have for many years now um the biggest appeal for me is like is is there's so much to see and working remote you're working across time zones as well so i basically have a suitcase with some clothes and i have a pair of shoes on my feet and i and i travel around the world and i spend a few months in different locations and in those locations i get to meet new people and experience life like on a different perspective and i always think that like unique problems need unique problem solvers so like if by doing all these things and encountering all these unique problems i'm able to like find ways in my life that i can make like an impact and so i would attribute like a lot of my success the fact that i have i have had like all these unique experiences and you're in el salvador right now so i have to ask have you been talking to folks about the bitcoin as legal tender thing and like what's the vibe on like does yeah my coffee shop yesterday had like a sign with a bitcoin and below they said like mfts are sold here i'll send it to you after this it's like it's it's everywhere it's everywhere it said i missed it but i know we have it on the recording but it's at nfts like as payment like bitcoin and then below it's like we also sell a lfts or something like that and our people like do people do it like are people into it or is it more like on the commercial side businesses are into it but the general population aren't really into it at all the general population seems to be pretty resistant to it but the stores are forced to accept it so like there's kind of a tug of war and i think that's how any early adoption phase is so i mean you can't really fault it the fact they're even like accepting it as a payment is like pretty incredible cool okay thank you guys truly for for coming uh i i think we'll we'll figure this out again and thank you tempo thank you jeremy i think we already we just lost jeremy so tempo goodbye thank you thank you and i can't wait to have you guys back on in two years and we'll check in on the project [Music] hey we hope you enjoyed the video if
