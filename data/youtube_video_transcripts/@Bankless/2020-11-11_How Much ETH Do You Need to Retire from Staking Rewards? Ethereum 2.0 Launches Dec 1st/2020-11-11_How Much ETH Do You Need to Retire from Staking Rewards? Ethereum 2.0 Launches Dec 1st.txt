very important question of course we talk about on bank lists what what is bankless about it's about freedom financial freedom freedom from banks um and david has the question probably the same question that many of you have which is how much eath is actually required in staking to earn a decent passive income off of this stuff an income source that is denominated in self-sovereign bankless money ethnic source david i think that's the reason you started to get into this space is that correct that's always been the dream abs absolutely and and this is something that really gets me excited about ethereum 2.0 is because we're about to do this all over again like i got into ethereum because i started mining on my gaming computer finding out like i could make five dollars a day on my gpu and then i scaled that up into like 24 gpus like spreading different corners of my dad's house but then but then like in the bear market the bear market came and then you know asics kind of dominated the ethereum landscape and so i see this this migration to proof of stake as a resurgence of some of the original core values that brought people into ethereum in the first place the ability to mine ether and get ether dividends in your home is really powerful and like we are going back to that world with proof of stake that's always been the point of proof of stake is getting money paid to you at home in a self-sovereign way and so i want to know like how how much ether do i need to stake so i can like have a comfortable retirement like that's all right well let's find that out it's been my question for three years you know what colin myers designed we've got him on right now he designed the perfect calculator for you then we're going to go through it and i don't think david is the only one by the way i've talked to a lot of eth holders definitely not through the bear market and part of the reason they kept the faith and kept holding is like why i'm waiting for proof of stake i'm waiting for this to be a semi-passive income source for me in the future i believe in ethereum i believe that this is possible so david is not the only one and if you are watching you are listening i bet you have some interest in this too so i am pulling up the uh eth2 calculator designed by colin mara some other folks and and the team at consensus and partially bison trails this will be linked in the show notes there's also a guide that we will link it's already linked and there's a guide we will link in the show notes too that we designed that will help you thrift it has some variables we're going to go through and help answer david's question today so um we've got first this whole category under the eth2 calculator let's start here the current cost to become an eth2 validator is 14 293 dollars that is the cost of essentially 32 each owning 32 is that correct colin yeah that's your that's your raw cost if you will that's your asset acquisition cost so that's your capital outweigh that's almost the equivalent david to your gpus basically you've got to buy the gpus you got to buy the a6 that's what the asics are in this new model we have to get a certain amount of uh validators and stake on board to to launch the chain i'm assuming we get that i still have full faith especially after our uh ethe war effort next week david we're gonna hit those numbers not going to be a problem let's talk about um some of the variables here so one variable colin is the eth price of course right so this calculator auto feeds into the eth price another variable that you could adjust up or down is the total amount of each at stake so this model right now the default assumes about a million but is it correct colin if i adjust that amount amount up to say 2 million or 3 million or 5 million um that that indicates more east of the total state that the rewards will go down for david is that correct yes yes correct um so it's uh we're going to start off earning rewards at 524 thousand 288 uh that that is the genesis threshold and then as more validators get added uh you will see uh between phase zero and phase 1.5 when there is no liquidity you'll see a you know you'll see a a uni-directional decreasing reward structure where an earlier epochs you'll receive the highest and then as more state gets added to the network you will receive less we'll keep it at a million for now that will probably go up in other phases over time it's hard to know each circulating supply that that feels um you know fairly certain i think the assumption of all the other validators on 95 of the time feels pretty safe but let's so let's get to the validator specific so david um do you already have an internet router my friend can i say yes to this question i got i have an internet router yes that's how we are doing this stream okay good to know good to know we're not using your cell connection all right so um infrastructure um what kind of node are you going to run so you have kind of two options here right so you could either run your own hardware hardware or you could run in the cloud no hardware hardware staking at home all right so you want actual physical hardware yep inside of your residence where you live and what are we doing for infrastructure choices i'll give you uh i'll give you two here that's what the calculator says you go the bare minimum requirements or you do recommend it all right so here is i think um let's see the minimum requirements are something like this four gigs ram storage ssd i definitely got that yeah mm-hmm okay so so for people who are who are looking at this like i'm going to be staking on a 2018 macbook pro and that is more than enough uh i i think i have an i7 in it and an intel i7 chip maybe that's a little bit higher than average but an i5 is going to be just fine okay so you've got the recommended requirements you're above minimum requirements and then colin what's interesting is david just answered the question like he has the internet he has a router he has broadband that's all you need broadband you don't need some super like fast fiber connection like your your comcast connection if you're in the us works is that right all right cool all right so uh david how many how many validators are you gonna run maybe we'll say like base case here first and then we'll we'll work towards your dream retirement passive income yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna only put in 32 i'm gonna put one validator through uh in phase zero and then i'll get the rest of my ether over uh you know all 332 000 of them over uh you know later you know okay so this is you at first you're being conservative so you're like you're not ready to start retiring on this passive income but we'll set this to one one validator so that means you're putting 32 ethan and again 32 eth is about 14k in capital so not insignificant guys right and again we put out a a meet the nation video about rocket pool if you have less than 32 e there are other ways to stake and there will be other ways to stake but um david's running his own validator uptime 95 it's set at i'm better than that 98 percent give me 98 i'll just give you a flavor here's an sl like a calculator uptime calculator so 95 means um you could be down up to 18 days a year right that's 90 95 so what did you say 99 98 give me 98. 98. i'm a good boy all right that still gives you even as a good boy like that gives you the ability to be down seven days a year right so so when i move apartments i can close my laptop carry it from one apartment to the another set up comcast and that's that's my like five to seven day break then that's okay exactly exactly that's reasonable as long as comcast is now for like two weeks or like some sort of disaster hit so i'm going to set you at 98 cost of computer hardware i think that's already been put in useful life everything else is put in so um i think colin am i looking at the right place this is david's annual profit with these variables in place so that's an annual profit if you can't see this of 1777. at a net validator issuance so he is making annual returns of 12.43 percent on his 32 so on his 14k denominated us dollars he's making a 12.43 return this is after the cost of hardware and internet am i reading that correctly colin yes that's correct and for specificity purposes that means that that epoch that he participates in uh with the network state at one million eve staked on an annualized basis he would earn twelve point four three percent very good so that's an annualized number and it's based on the snapshot of the state of the network uh at a million e state which over the course of the year will will will change you know it'll only increase so his actual annualized reward will be less than than what what the metric is that you see here today as it's annualized at a snapshot point in time got it so as the stake increases that could go down a little bit and it would be annualized up to that amount so so david i guess uh one question so if you were to park your funds in say the equivalent sovereign um bond market like what would you do on it on a t-bill right like do you know t-bill rates off the top of your head t-bill rates especially right now i'm pretty sure are like one to three percent maybe more maybe that sounds about right to me right yeah and so specifically one to three percent on the us dollar which is not a hard money which is not a hard money it's between one to three percent and dropping i wouldn't be surprised if we saw zero some people talk about with the central bank digital currency negative and then in the background the fed is inflating your money right inflating the money supply right so this is uh i mean yeah this is this is a totally different paradigm here it's it's a different source but there are risks here of course so um let's talk about other places you could put your earth is there anywhere in d5 that you can get this kind of return at the moment that you're aware of in wiring you can submit your ether into a y eth vault and then it will draw die from maker dow and use that die to get a yield and that is earning something like four to six percent but that also has some risks involved because if um your ether drops you actually might end up having to sell your ether because you are taking out leverage to get that done and so like while that is four to six percent that is not a risk-free four to six percent that is a risk on four to six percent which is a very important difference then also has um other like defy risk uh you're trusting die you're trusting wire and you're trusting maker smart contracts whereas this and guys when we say risk free rate somebody chewed me out on twitter one time somebody in d5 because i said like eat steak will be risk-free rate and he's like it's not risk-free there's tons of risk i'm like yeah i know there's risk but it's it's protocol risk it's the base layer risk that's what you're incurring here but you're not taking all of the other layers on top right importantly in ethereum staking there is no counterparty risk right you are not loaning out your money there's no one receiving it the thing that is receiving your ether is ethereum which we can all trust otherwise it wouldn't work okay all right so so you're putting that in but like you're getting 1777 which is a which is a good start right right for uh some passive income for you but um that's probably not going to be enough to retire on right on retirement that's a pretty slim retirement all right so let's let's talk about some of your dreams david so we've got a few variables that we can adjust here all right just for fun if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about wiring is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wire will go and figure out which money market on defy and defy is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are we've got a few variables that we can adjust here all right just for fun um one variable of course is you could put more eth into this thing you could go buy more eth and go risk it in this risk-free rate of eth2 protocol risking um so you have that option my friend another option that we might see and um you know despite what people might think dave and i do not control the price of eth it ebbs and flows on its own but if the price of eth goes up what's that going to do to your return well in u.s dollar value it's going to pump that number up absolutely in u.s dollar value interesting but not your ether nominating your ether denominated returns will stay the same the independent of the dollar price but if the dollar value of ether goes up then the dollar value of your ether dividends also goes up okay so let's say that um what what numbers do you want to adjust then david let's let you play the scenario out so we could adjust each price we could adjust how much each you want to put in what's kind of reasonable for your retirement passive income dreams yeah so chris burniske who is a person i i trust really tweeted out recently about his projected returns based off of bitcoin ether and d5 mid to small caps and he uh estimated that ether at the end of this cycle is going to do a 10x where he thinks bitcoin is going to do a 5x ether is going to do a 10x and then d5 mid caps are going to do a 20 to 50x so let's go with what chris said um and so that would be put ether at roughly 4 500 at a stable end of cycle price wow four thousand five hundred dollars and uh when he was saying cycle any idea what the timeline was he was talking i don't think he gave a timeline no okay so he's saying probably in the next three to five years two to two to five years so we are jacking we are 10xing the heath price right now which is not crazy for a crazy market cycle okay and then uh are we keeping your you just want to run in one validator with 32e yeah let's let's keep one validator for now and then we'll see what number that gives and then we will go and change that number after i see you with the number that it gives all right colin's magic calculator did all of the calculations for us and but i think we have to tweak one more number because i think if we are assuming that ether price is going to be 4 500 i think there's probably going to be more ether of being staked i feel like that's a likely outcome so let's go from 1 million to let's go to let's go to 4 million 4 million 4 million each steak we'll keep the other variables the same of course eat circulating supply is going to be up a little bit too but maybe we we ignore that yeah that's an okay unknown quantity all right anything else you want to adjust no i think that's right all right so your annual profit right now you're doing 10k a year so you went from you just basically 10xed your annual profit right now it was at 1700 and now we're oh yes 10 000. exactly so less than 10x because the issuance your um net issuance annualized went down from what 12 to seven yep right and so it we previously when there was only one million ether staked we were receiving a 12 uh issuance rate 12 interest rate on our eth and since we bumped that one million total eat steak up to four million it went down to seven point four percent okay is that going to be enough to retire on my friend 10k here we're getting closer but still like seeing 10k like i have a pretty bougie diet i eat a lot steak so all right so i think we i think we're going to have to add some more validators ryan all right so what do you want to do well okay so if i'm making ten thousand dollars a year on one 32 east node validator my retirement goals are fifty thousand dollars a year so i think we should five x uh thirty two so five times thirty two which that number is um quick math a hundred five times thirty two is 160 each staked and the calculator does it for you my friend um fantastic and then that gets you to your annualized profit of 54k per year a comfortable retirement and that would be that would that would mean that you are and this is by the way like some people talk about like fire financially independent retire early this is around the benchmark that they use for that sort of thing personal finance world right like 50k annualized some people feel comfortable enough to retire what that means is basically you've still got a lot of capital here if you're doing that because that 160 k is all your capital that's like your net like capital but it's throwing off 54k a year in profit for you and that's paying for all your steak and your bougie lifestyle yep no that's right that's right yeah 55 you know it's not it's 55 000 a year as a salary is is you know a modest salary like some people would really appreciate 55 000 a year on retirement like that's not the it's relatively slim but i guess that your consumption and retirement goes down but like you're you're still gonna have to like you know do some things right you don't get to just like you know buy a jet and start flying all over the world you know what it does do though is it gives you the ability to go pursue hobbies like even income making hobbies like you know like the stuff that we do often i'm just like it's fun it's like stuff i'd be doing if i didn't have to work right so you get to do that and you don't have to be a slave to the uh the wage right yep um so that's what that income can do for you yeah that is 55 000 in again issuance of dividends to you coming from a protocol not a counterparty there is no dependencies on me receiving my 55 000 a year retirement right and so it's actually as a security as a as a safety net it's pretty strong yeah absolutely and this is uh hopefully will emerge as kind of the the risk-free like the tables essentially of crypto so this is less risky than say depositing your your um your eth into the yam farms way back when we used to do that kind of thing over the summer uh very cool all right today question i need 160 each in order to retire assuming that ether 10x is in price so i got some work to do with my stack should we do some anthony sasana predictions and just uh jack this up to 10 10 okay let's see what happens at 10k let's see 10k 32 deposit rather than 160 let's go back to one validator okay all right so one validator at 10k eth this is the anthony susana prediction you're doing 24k a year from 1700 a year to 24k a year if and anthony cesano is correct which i i trust the guy he he's he's pretty he's pretty correct uh quite frequently uh and so that means one validator node with 32 eth gets you 24 000 a year that is insane not too shabby my friend and then uh five if we increase that to five you're doing so this is again 160 each staked on a single validator you can do this it's 122k a year in relatively passive income okay but that if that's going to be the case we have to bump up the total stake to 12 000 or 12 million each we got to do that because that's just too good return all right you don't want to live in fantasy world i don't know if it'll ever get to 12k what do you think like yeah six years excuse me 12 million what do you think colin do you think it's going that high because at a certain point like it kind of trails off and you're just diminishing returns as far as the returns go right depending on the price of each uh net like nominal yields do do turn negative um if he doesn't like moon really hard once you get about past that 10 million mark i personally think that through phase zero to phase one we see about a million and a half to two million i think phase one point five people sorry phase one to one point five more people begin to step in and then by the time we fold eth1 and eth2 i think we're around that five million mark which is like phase 1.5 and then it's kind of you know it's ongoing state uh once it gets into phase two and then with what we know today it's it's pretty mature on its fungibility properties but things may change uh i see 10 million as being the economic barrier uh that it may not make sense for people to want to participate given the skills required to do so on your own and the rewards that uh that you're offered but 10 million each takes plenty for security of the network uh but but i personally see 10 10 million probably being being that ceiling because there are uh negative yields that could be experienced based on where the price of these have all right 10 million you're doing 77k a year david and then by the way that's plenty that's a pretty decent retirement if uh if some of our youth bull friends are right and then by the way how is there a way to see how much colin um like at it at 10k price eth at some of these variables um 10 million staked how much economic security does ethereum have is there a chart on that in this calculator yeah there's no there's no security measures okay um and benchmarks set inside of this just kind of relative issuances um if you scroll to the right though a little bit um one one interesting thing is this chart with the three uh descending which is validator issuance network at home and using a vps um so this is the scale it's the top right chart so if you go up a little bit and then scroll it over to the right yeah this one right here so if you take a look at this this is genesis to 10 million eat steak uh with the price of each set at around 400 so so it is uh you know relevant so assuming you're seeing prices there this is your this is your gross from nineteen point eight percent to four point five percent uh and then when you begin to layer in cost there's two different cost factors as we've gone through uh as you can see once you begin to use your bps and you get out here and you're only staking one validator into the five million range uh your yields actually turn negative uh whereas if you're validating at home you're you're pretty close to break even at 10 million uh so i think it it'll it'll come down to the cost to the validator setup is to as to where that breakeven point is um but i think this is probably relevant for users to take a look at uh it explains the reward structure and how how it's related to the amount of eat sticks and that's interesting because it could it should kind of uh collapse to to sort of something close to the marginal cost right and like risk of staking the similar similar to the way um proof of work does where it's like correct like energy plus a6 like marginal cost yeah it'll i mean doing a break even analysis is probably what most larger people will do when deciding whether or not you know whether or not this is a good use for for their eth or whether or not they could they could earn uh more rewards someplace else very cool all right well we've got uh david on his retirement plan colin this has been fantastic guys bankless nation we've got guides we've got calculators you can see if staking is right for you and if it makes and how to get on the passive income terrain if it comes to pass um colin just thanks a lot for your time and thanks for putting all of this stuff together right devs are super hard at work um also like people like you to help educate the community uh on staking and the potential internet bond it's just like instrumental so like thank you for all the work that you're doing here yeah absolutely this is my my e2 effort is is my uh my 15 of my time commitment and consensus that is that is you know meant to to give back in a non-profitable manner so it's been a very exciting two years it's been a great experience for me to go through go through the whole thing it's it's me giving back to the community that's that's given a lot uh to me over over the past three years so um i appreciate you guys having me on today to to walk through the calculator and also to help get more or more people educated about you know if to staking what what internet bonds would look like and also to leverage the community that you guys have to kind of drum up a good conversation i'm i'm really hoping this kind of gets gets people's gears grinding thinking about becoming a validator thinking about the different abstractions um that could be built on top of staked ether as there's a lot of different things that could be built on top so hope that the paper serves as a fundamental viewpoint and uh i can't wait to get back on with you guys once once genesis goes and then we actually start seeing some data as to how these things are valued and if it's relevant to some of the projections um that we did uh so just uh just to close it out um for those of you who who want to check out the the internet bond paper uh that mara and myself put together um there's been a couple of good uh twitter posts by the bankless team and then we also collab on an article as well so feel free to check those out and head over to the pdf um and and last last shameless plug for me would be for everyone to go check out activate uh activates a uh a project that consensus that i spend most of my time on we collaborated with the ethereum foundation to build the e2 launch pad um so it's kind of the big thing that we're trying to to promote people to come into activate learn more about phase zero we have an faq we have an interface built on the calculator there and we also have a secure link most importantly to the eth2 launch pad so you can ensure that you're not getting phished by coming through activate um as we built we help the ef build the platform so we're excited about phase zero stoke the genesis uh is around the corner and uh doing things like this will help it become more successful so i appreciate what you guys are doing as it's extremely helpful likewise colin one thing i've been hammering on lately is i've been watching the the macro world really learn how to place bitcoin in the world around it and there's nothing more bullish for for bitcoin than being understood and when it comes to ether and staking ethereum and proof of stake and and advertising like this internet bond market that's what i see you doing with this calculator for ethereum right like really putting it into digestible and knowledgeable mental models for people to understand what is actually going on here and so that's just one thing that really just makes me really excited about you know staking my own ethers like people are going to figure out what this thing actually is and it's going to be on the the shoulders of your effort and mara's effort and and everyone else who's trying to push this conversation forward so thank you for everything you're doing awesome thank colin take care cheers guys talk to you see you later everybody bye
