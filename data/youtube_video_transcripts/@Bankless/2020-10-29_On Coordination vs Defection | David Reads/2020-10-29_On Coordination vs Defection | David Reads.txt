this episode of bankless is brought to you by wyrn wyon is a yield farming money robot to do the yield farming in d5 so you don't have to wire has various products like vaults or urn where in vaults you can deposit your preferred defy token and defy experts have written strategies for this token that you deposit to go and find the yield automatically in d5 earn is that same thing but with stable coins where this the urn system will move your stable coins around from protocol to protocol to seek yield from whatever defy protocol is offering the most amount of yield at that particular time

where we get human readable blockchain domain names that are also completely censorship resistant one of the really important features about unstoppable domains is that you can set up a website that has a domain that the any nation state cannot take down really important for being a self-sovereign individual in this world additionally what's also insanely cool about unstoppable domains is that bitcoiners or any other blockchain can use unstoppable domains to make their bitcoin address human readable right so no longer is this just technology built on ethereum now unstoppable domains brings this to all other blockchains so you can tell your bitcoin or friend to send you money to davidhoffman.eth or you know your name here dot crypto check them out at unstoppabledomains.com all right hello everyone today is article day and so i just released this piece on coordination verse defection on the bankless newsletter and i'm going to read it uh it's it's i guess one of my longer ones it's about 15 minute read time which means it's going to take about 20 22 minutes to read it out loud and it is a thought on how the relationships between choosing to coordinate or choosing to defect plays out and i think it's pretty integral to how the bankless nation comes to be and how these cryptocurrency systems end up uh producing the results that they will produce so let's go into it choosing to coordinate the story of the progress of life is a story of coordination versus defection dogs choose to be in packs birds fly in flocks fish form schools and humans form tribes the world is a rugged unforgiving place and your chances of survival are better if you choose to coordinate with others we don't group into tribes because we enjoy socializing we enjoy socializing because grouping in tribes makes survival easier things are easier in groups not only that but things tend to get easier as groups expand over thousands of years humans went from tribes of 50 to towns of 50 000 to cities of 5 million this growth occurred because time and time again groups chose to coordinate rather than defect at the substrate of this story is the prisoner's dilemma a thought experiment that illustrates a scenario in which two prisoners are rational to choose defect from one another even though it means a net worse outcome for both parties only by a mutual understanding that playing the long term game is a better choice and a willingness to sacrifice for this outcome can two prisoners choose coordinate in the name of this potential better future the path from hunter-gatherer tribes of 50 to cities of 5 million was not a linear path of people finding and better and stronger ways to coordinate it was a long winding curving detouring path of defection spying misinformation malice aggression violence and then eventually coordination every single instance of defection theft cheating sabotage treason murder oppression genocide or war was eventually overwritten by coordinating around those outcomes looking into history one can claim that humanity is using the planet as one giant sandbox of coordination experimentation in an attempt to create the largest possible coordinating group from a previous article of mine a bankless nation if someone were to ask us what are we doing here humans could answer we're trying to get coordinated or perhaps humans first need to get coordinated so they can begin to formulate an answer to the question what is our collective purpose either way our prime objective as a species is to create an organization organizational structure that can enable coordination on a large enough scale so that we can begin to collectively work towards a common goal a group is formed when rewards for coordinating together are greater than the rewards for defecting part of the incentive to choose to coordinate versus defect is that groups are able to coordinate themselves into a better world the product of good coordination is the ability to manifest the rewards for coordinating in that first place currently the nation-state is the largest vehicle of human coordination the nation-state has achieved this by leveraging strong defection prevention strategies in which the individuals of a nation are highly incentivized to follow the rules of coordination that ultimately compose the state as a whole fines jail prison and capital punishment are all tools leveraged by the state to generate coordination incentives that significantly outweigh defection incentives hobbes leviathan is an illustration of how the nation-state stays composed as a unified body he claims that a strong centralized executive leadership which has a monopoly on physical force and violence is the necessary tool for enforcing the social contract of a nation the combination of access accessing the upside of coordination with the nation state in addition to the avoidance of the stick of punishment keeps the body of the nation running smoothly in a coherent fashion disputes are processed through a system of arbitrations the the judicial system and the social contract is revised and reformed by rulemakers or the legislative in order to inform the role of law enforcers the executive and thus a unified body of humans have generated a system of mass coordination a blank slate it's often said that the cryptocurrency industry is speedrunning the development of finance across history starting with a new form of money and working upwards the cryptocurrency world is learning to reinvent the same financial primitives humans have already discovered in meat space and recreate them in their digital form in the crypto world this is absolutely true but i believe it's even grander than that it's in addition to the recreation of money and finance inside of a pure substrate we are also rediscovering systems of re of coordination the combination of free and open source software and internet native value and value management aka finance creates a new kind of sandbox for research and development i recently wrote a coindesk piece about how ethereum is producing financial innovation at light speeds as a result of the open sandbox for developer developer experimentation open source software is free and forking changing and iterating on open source software costs the absolute minimum amount of resources time through this effort any developer that produces something of value while experimenting adds something to the common library of knowledge in this space which only further reduces experimentation and development costs with thousands of users and billions of dollars only a single transaction away developers are able to quickly discover either failure or success and move forward now replace money and finance with human coordination and you have the next chapter of humanity to fork or not to fork like the nation state crypto economic systems bitcoin ethereum maker dow unit swap compound year and yams are perpetually in a state of friction between defection incentives and coordination incentives these systems are primarily bottom-up structures in which success is determined by the protocol's ability to attract attention and capital from the world around it no government aid or regulation here whether or not a protocol survives is entirely determined by the fitness inside the free market if a protocol is fit it will generate coordination incentives that outweigh defection incentives the moment where defection incentives pass coordination incentives is the moment the protocol dies we look at the total value locked leader board on defy pulse and we are looking at coordination leaderboards how strongly does a particular protocol's coordination incentives outweigh their defection incentives forking the low cost of forks is one of the most advantageous characteristics this industry has when the cost of experimental iteration approaches zero innovation naturally explodes before the vegetable yield farm copycatting of defy summer 2020 there was proof of work there was the proof of work fair launch era in 2013 to 2015. bitcoin cash litecoin dogecoin bitcoin xt bitcoin classic bitcoin unlimited bitcoin gold bitcoin diamond bitcoin dark bitcoin private bitcoin sv monacoin litecoin cash cloak coin einsteinium feather corn purecoin nova coin black coin stratus green coin vertcoin eight share nexus decred digibyte size coin red coin elastos emerging coin gossip coin nav coin vehicle and komodo replace all those names with vegetables and you have defy summer 2020. ethereum is an open sandbox for financial experimentation where the cost of experimentation and innovation are as close to zero as they have ever been not only is there plenty of code available to leverage but also thousands of users and billions of dollars are always one transaction away from whatever you can build the yam story illustrates this well five individuals got together and borrowed code from compound synthetics ampliforth and iron to produce a product that garnered hundreds of stakeholding community members and a multi-million dollar market cap in just 10 days yam didn't really fork any of these protocols the goals of yam of the yam system whatever they may be are materially different from any of the above protocols synthetics aims to make a decentralized synthetic asset exchange compound a money market ample fourth a weird new form of money yearn a yield maximizer but the end goal of all these protocols is a zero zero sum game maximize value the goal of synthetics yam compound urine and ampliforth is number go up each of these protocols has a token and the success of the protocol is directly reflected in the value of their respective token snx yam com wifey ample every system is a value maximizing system and each system attempts to achieve this in its own way value is inherently scarce and a protocol can only capture so much value before it starts to compete with the value captured by others carbon copycats while yam's method of achieving this goal is adjacent rather than in opposition to the protocols it borrowed code from it was also the main inspiration to the fork and fair launch movement where many protocols were carbon copied with their tokens swapped out for our new one cream forked compound sushi swap four to unit swap based came out of yams and then there's yfi yf iii that forked yfi and then there's yfiii that forked yfii isuzu of three arrow capitals illustrates this phenomenon with the euthanasia roller coaster a theoretical design of a roller coaster that kills its passengers by exposing them to two strong g-forces for too long the end of d5 summer 2020 came when every single major d5 protocol had 17 forks each and each of the forks had their own set of forks which had their own set of forks etc etc at some point we ran out of emojis also gas sustained 400 gway for multiple days putting pretty hard breaks on the ethereum economy at large it's highly likely that the significant majority of these forks will bleed into nothingness the few that make it through the great filter of coinary are going to be the ones that tapped into something novel and also learned how to generate sufficient anti-fork incentives fork resistance strategies and defection incentives successful protocols will deploy fork resistance strategies in order to achieve the in-group coordination the fair launch phenomenon was an experiment in spinning up projects with minimal defection incentives as the genesis token distribution was hopefully something that rewards stakeholders for their alignment to the protocol uniswap's retroactive airdrop of tokens to previous value providers was a fantastic deployment of a defection resistance strategy because everyone got their twelve hundred dollar universal basic income everyone loves unisua the concept of fair token distribution was extremely attractive and it generated significant forking incentives for developers and defection incentives for users and their capital liquidity mining and yield farming were extremely lucrative and even with a low percentage of chance that the protocol and its token not working out it's still rational to farm the out of every single token on the potential upside of becoming a massively coordinating protocol the mere possibility of this outcome generated the value in the token which generated the incentive to farm which contributed to forking and defection incentives the only problem with this movement was that it created a pro-defection environment while it was trivial to carbon copy the defy darlings carb compound unit swap iron in the hopes of enticing some gamblers who want to take the three percent chance of a 100x gain the reality was that it was also trivial for someone to carbon copy you and steal all your users and capital and attempt to offer it the people who didn't get in on your ride yield farms learned how to leverage yield farms learned how to leverage defection incentives but they ignored the other half of the equation coordination incentives every single crypto economic protocol operates because it has sufficiently strong anti-fork incentives this doesn't just only apply to d5 protocols fork resistance strategies could also be named as consensus algorithms proof of work and proof of stake are two gigantic fork resistance primitives the cost of mining on the wrong chain or validating incorrect blocks are incredibly high in proof of work you are burning electricity without btc rewards and in proof of stake you are literally burning money instead of receiving it pretty strong fork resistance mechanisms the social layer the design space for creating anti-fork incentives doesn't stop at well-designed code the social layer behind a protocol is equally important for generating fork resistance no coordination group has leveraged the power of the social layer better than bitcoiners bitcoiners at least the ones on crypto twitter are have a very firm line drawn in the sand which signals to the rest of the group what is and what is not appropriate i do not mean to generalize to all bitcoiners but like many in groups bitcoin bitcoiners are defined by a set of concentric circles in which the innermost circle are is are the most radical the most maximalists and things get more moderate as you move outwards the mere presence of the radical center-most circle moves the overton window of acceptable behavior closer and closer to the goals of hyper-bitcoinization speak well of an alternative protocol that's a paddling express moderation about bitcoin's future success that's a paddling everything is a coin unless it's bitcoin bitcoin social layer is one of its greatest features although people from the outside of the bitcoiner in group express significant reservations about this culture's ability to scale with this strategy bitcoins barrier troops barrier troops are anti-retreat forces that were located in the rear of the front line to maintain military discipline to prevent the flight of servicemen from the battlefield famous famously the soviet red army deployed barrier troops who would shoot any retreaters defectors in order to generate sufficient defection prevention incentives for these soldiers to never stop fighting nazi germany if you retreat you die so you might as well not retreat and then here we have a tweet from gavin andreessen who is uh the second individual to kind of carry the bitcoin mantle after satoshi himself and he says scale bitcoin in three easy steps one scale ethereum two trustlessly tokenize your bitcoin three transact using the wrapped tokens on the eth2 chain and then dan held a famous bitcoin maximalist goes gavin isn't a bitcoiner anymore dan held is one of bitcoin's barrier troops don't you dare defect this is the same strategy that the leviathan of a nation-state imposes albeit in a more humane manner with fines and prisons if you defect you go to jail so don't defect punishment aka the stick is only one half of the equation the carrot is all about producing rewards that prevent thoughts of defection from even arising in the first place bitcoiners have leveraged the social layer very well to this end get enough bitcoiners together to all claim how bitcoin will become the world's next de facto currency and the voice of any skeptic defector gets drowned out by the rest of the in-group the goal of bitcoin social layer is to generate enough fomo about bitcoin that no one thinks twice about selling the world's next money this leaves the potential of memeing it into existence regardless of the technological capacity of the system to do the job value the og defection prevention strategy d5 protocols on ethereum generate revenue the defy tokens govern over how the protocols are constructed and therefore have the ability to direct these cash flows as they see fit some protocols don't charge fees to the governance token and instead direct 100 percent of the revenue to the supply side such as of a unit swapper compound other protocols are further along in maturity and are redirecting that captured revenue into their native token kyber maker yearn revenue is coordination incentive if a protocol has revenue coming from its contracts there is a incentive to be a part of that system while the costs of forking a d5 protocol are minimal no one wants to defect from a system that turns out to be a huge winner this is the power behind bitcoin's narrative and that's why the beloved d5 protocols that were around before defy summer 2020 are still the dominant protocols and even the most successful fork farms are distant seconds to the ogs yearn being the significant exception coordination defective coordination defection incentive ratio behind every coordinating group is a coordination defection incentive ratio what is the ratio of a group's coordination incentive to defection incentives if coordination incentives are greater than defection incentives the protocol grows if they are lesser than the protocol reduces now for what is the entire thesis of the article the spread between coordination defect the spread between coordination incentives and defection incentives is the accessible revenue of a protocol the more and more a protocol can develop its coordination incentives the higher percentage of revenue it can capture in its native token so long as the fees being captured aren't sufficiently high to incentivize defection and therefore a carbon copy cap the protocol will continue to capture fees previously in ethereum there was a frequent conversation about how ethereum was destined to be a place where the middlemen are cut out and all fees are forked away into nothingness if anyone built a protocol with a fee in it it would be forked into an alternative protocol without the fee and then the protocol would then become a new protocol and then that protocol would then become the new protocol because why would anyone use a protocol that has fees in it when there's an alternative without fees what this conversation was missing was the difficulty in coordinating the migration to an alternative protocol this is the same reason why we all hate facebook but we still can't pick up a pick up and move to an alternative social media platform we're all on facebook and coordinating everyone to pick up and move to at the same time is too much of a coordination challenge where facebook has users uniswap of a compound and die have liquidity these protocols all have very strong liquidity modes and act as defection prevention mechanisms the liquidity behind these protocols is the spread between the greater coordination incentives versus smaller defection incentives as these protocols grow in liquidity they also grow in coordination defection incentive ratios and therefore the fees that they can capture bitcoin a shelling point of anti-defection as discussed above bitcoin social layer employs extremely strong social incentives to not defect from the group values the most extreme bitcoiners consider all other digital assets other than bitcoin as inferior assets or even  coins the reason why the word coin is so frequently used in bitcoin culture is to signal the intolerance to those who prefer any other asset other than bitcoin bitcoin maximalists as defined by those actively that actively denounce all other crypto assets other than bitcoin are the spartan fan i cannot pronounce this word falax van licks of crypto assets not one  coin to the average bitcoiner at coin represents the embodiment of defection a denial of the bitcoin narrative and the bitcoin social contract coins coiners and coinery are all instances of when the bitcoin narrative broke down and someone defected from the ranks from wikipedia there was a leader in each row of a phalanx and a rear officer officer who kept the order in the rear the hoplites had to trust their neighbor to protect them and in turn be willing to protect their neighbors a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest elements the effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could with stand their ground especially when engaged against another phalanx for this reason the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family close together thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows and a disincentive through shame to panic or attempt to flee the more disciplined and courageous the army the more likely it was to win often engagements between the various cities of greece would be resolved by one side fleeing before the battle i just think that's so funny bitcoiners are the embodiment of do not defect and this is why bitcoin has really abandoned any interest in improving itself as a technology and seems to be primarily focused on improving its social layer its narrative bitcoiners are extremely smart in encouraging this behavior the opposite of coordination is defection and we've all seen what happens during periods of high defection rates the euthanasia roller coaster if we encourage a pro-defectionary environment we can likely never discover a new shelling point for coordination we need to encourage coordination around some commonly shared values or else we devolve into coinary while financial experimentation is good  coinery is bad however extreme rigidity and intolerance to anyone who is interested in expanding the design space means that defection from the extremely tight in group is the only possible new choice if one wants to experiment with building something new this was how ethereum was created vitalik proposed a bitcoin hard fork to include new opcodes that would make bitcoin more expressive vitalik loves bitcoin and once it wanted it to be able to do more things and grow into a larger possible design space however this was against the bitcoin air social contract and changing bitcoin or social layer is basically impossible so vitalik quote unquote defected and made ethereum and it has made the innermost concentric circle of bitcoiners the maxis extremely upset to this day that someone dare to defect ethereum was the first successful example of coordinated defection where a group of then bitcoiners migrated to ethereum in a coordinated fashion but without triggering a pro-defection environment which triggers the euthanasia roller coaster a bunch of then bitcoiners metaphorically linked arms and all agreed to take one step away from bitcoin and two ethereum but not one more after that by participating in the ethereum crowd sale those people chose to coordinate the tau the tau often called yin gang but this isn't accurate is called the way in taoism yin representing chaos is the black side and gang representing order is the white the entire universe is built upon a balance between order and chaos and the tau or the way is the line between them that represents a healthy balance of order and chaos that produces positive outcomes defection is chaos and coordination is order in order to produce healthy outcomes for the world you need both you need coordinated defection this is how humanity chooses to abandon a previous status quo in the name of a better alternative when humanity makes the correct choice it's representative of proper alignment between order and chaos or defection versus coordination order creates hierarchies and structures for humans to depend on and leverage for their well-being it also creates oppression and inequality the nation-state is the largest ordered structure we have created so far chaos is creative destruction the recycling and renewing of calcified systems with newer more modern structures the bankless nation is a new ordered structure that is formed out of the chaos of cryptocurrencies and endless games of coordination defection if we do things right the bankless nation can become a new structure that surpasses the organizational capacity of the nation state with new mechanisms that are fairer more inclusive and more scalable an excerpt from the three nation problem at the end of the eighteen hundreds nadine shape proclaimed god is dead neziche was an atheist and didn't mean that there was a god who had actually died but rather an idea our idea of one had after the enlightenment the idea of a universe that was governed by physical laws and not by divine providence was now a reality philosophy had shown that governments no longer needed to be organized around the idea of the divine right to be legitimate but rather by the consent or rationality of the governed that large and consistent moral theories could exist without reference to god europe no longer needed god as the source for all morality value or order in the universe philosophy and science were capable of doing that for us god is dead was less of a proclamation and more of a warning nazi sheikh said niziche was warning that if humanity was no longer organized around god then we would need to find something different and new to organize around or else chaos would consume the world without the scaffolding of religion the societal structure would collapse and rebuilding it would be a long arduous process filled with debate and conflict this is exactly what happened religion the main organizing force of the people was relegated to history without a viable successor to offer an alternative organization schema in order to keep the people of the world stabilized and coherent the world absent of any organizational structure fell into the most bloody and brutal century in human history out of this chaos emerged the world order that we know today democratic nation states that uphold the values of classical liberalism and with the bankless nation the wheel turns yet again religion grew out of chaos and turned into calcified oppressive non-iterative systems humans needed something newer and more modern to organize and then therefore created the nation-state which iterated and iterated into the liberal democracies that we know today and now those in turn have become calcified oppressive and non-iterative and so we choose to defect in a coordinated way into the world of cryptocurrencies and internet-based organizational structures eventually the world of crypto will likely calcify into an oppressive and non-iterative structure but that won't be for generations today bitcoin and ethereum are the iterative flexible structures we need to coordinate humanity into a better world all right guys let me know in the comments what you think uh this is uh one of the cooler articles i think that i've ever written so i'm happy to share it with you so thanks and make sure to subscribe to the youtube cheers
