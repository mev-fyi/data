foreign [Music] coordination today on the Pod I've got Danielle Allen and Glenn Weil we're two of the co-authors on a new paper entitled ethics of decentralized excuse me decentralized social Technologies lessons from web3 the fediverse and Beyond uh Glenn and Danielle have co-authored the paper with Eli Frankel wujin Lim Divya Siddharth and Josh Simmons hopefully I pronounced everyone's names correctly Danielle is a professor of political philosophy ethics and public policy at Harvard University Glenn is research lead at Microsoft research and the special project of the plural social technology collaboratory the founder of radical Exchange in the plurality Institute and the author of the book radical markets uh Glenn Danielle and their co-authors are contributors to the getting plurality research Network at Harvard's uh Edmund and Lily Safra Center for ethics that is being launched today uh in collaboration and support from Glenn's project at Microsoft so um as they co-author this paper paper they cheating as a founding document for that project I wanted to have them on the on the podcast because Glenn's work has been an inspiration for me well back when I founded get coin it was uh built on top of quadratic funding which is something that Zoe hitsig and vitalik buter and Glenn invented together um and I also just wanted to have Danielle and Glenn on the Pod as I think their paper will be foundational for the web 3 transition uh to a more regenerative and ethical economy as it grows and matures so this podcast is all about ethics of decentralized social Technologies we talk about web 3's constitutional moment basically constitutional moments are moments that lead to the transformation of a social platform EG like the US Constitution being on built on a social platform structured by the economics demographics and technological facts of the late 18th century so this is a similar constitutional moment we think for web3 print vigilance which is basically being explicit about goals and offering justifications as we build projects having governance structures to oversee the design and evaluation of experiments and then we also talk about just the values that Glenn and Danielle and their co-authors have brought from traditional political philosophy around human flourishing things like non-domination things like individual Community self-determination egalitarian pluralism coordination capacity Collective ownership and regenerative economies so I I really just enjoy every conversation I have with Glenn and Danielle they're such Rich deep thinkers and I think that this paper can be a foundational part of the plural and regenerative web 3 movement so that's why I was really excited to have them on the Pod and I think that's why you're really going to enjoy this episode so coordination please enjoy this podcast episode on ethics of decentralized social Technologies with Glenn and Danielle working in web3 is awesome but

this new paper that you released can you tell me about the plural technology collaboratory and what led you and your co-authors to write this paper on ethics of decentralized uh social Tech go ahead Glenn so the plural technology collaboratory is a new special project at Microsoft research bring together people throughout Microsoft research throughout the rest of Microsoft and a number of Partners including Danielle's group at Harvard Folks at MIT at Berkeley on Ventures and others and what we're really trying to uh focus on has shifted a little bit so when we started we were originally the decentralized social technology collaboratory and our mission was to deal with the social legitimacy issues that got in the way of many folks adopting web free technology um recently we've granted the plural technology collaboratory um and we're responding to the moment with uh generative Foundation models these large AI models like Chach EBT that a lot of people have been interacting with um which we believe are going to create an environment where a lot of the challenges that people in web 3 face are faced by the broader society and we're trying to scale up some of the insights from the web3 community to meet those challenges and one way that we're doing that is we're trying to involve folks like Danielle and her colleagues at Harvard and elsewhere who bring that depth of philosophical and social inspect that we need to confront these uh enormous challenges and I'll let Danielle speak to that and then maybe she can speak to what interested in her on in working with us on this paper great thanks hunching we have just launched a new research Network at the Edmund and the lady Stafford Center for ethics the network is called getting plurality and that stands for governance of emerging technology and technology for Next Generation governance through plurality so we share Glenn's sense that a plural approach plural technology is a focus on plurality is really important for changing the direction of Technology development and ensuring that we can build and use technologies that are supportive of democracy and other human Goods so we pulled together a real multidisciplinary Network a core group of us have been working over the last nine months on this paper that we're also releasing today the decentralized social Technologies paper ethics for dsts so we're really excited about this and it really takes people from all disciplines philosophy political science economics as well as technologists to face the hard questions we've got right now um Kevin would it be useful for me to say a little bit about what plurality is and like what where that catchphrase comes from yes please do I think that yeah go ahead um so I'm writing a book right now with Audrey Tong it's a get based open collaboration that I hope many of people in the community will participate in and it's called plurality that's a term that Audrey uses to represent her vision for the future of technology Audrey is the digital minister of Taiwan and um there's a lot to say about it you and I have gone back and forth about it for a long time but I think a simple way to think about it is that there's kind of two dominant Visions for the future of technology today one is very sort of individualistic it's about like you know money and markets and it's very dominant in the crypto world there's a second Vision that's about you know powerful AI systems replacing the need for an economy replacing the need for work etc and uh what we believe is that there's a better third Vision that emphasizes social diversity uh you know a diverse range of Commons cooperation across social differences but also that supports and maintains and actually proliferates those social differences rather than uh just sort of washing them away into a global system so anyways there's a lot to be said about that but that's the basic frame that both the effort at Microsoft and the effort that Danielle is highlighting at Harvard um it's trying to adopt thanks yeah I would just add one thing that was a great description Glenn the other piece that I always like to include is the point that human intelligence is plural there are plural intelligences and so the amplitude of human intelligence really requires recognizing that plurality and building from it and in support of that plurality not undermining it eroding it homogenizing it and so forth and even human is perhaps just one part of it um these machines as well we should think of as diverse as containing many different systems at many different scales not as sort of homogeneous black boxes that bring down some you know a quantity called Power intelligence to be used for any purpose and that's something that we should desire and seek to proliferate as we build technology uh whether it be in human systems or Beyond so um I really encourage everyone to go read the paper but I'm wondering if we could if we could tee off the episode with a short summary or tldr of the paper how is it organized and and what were the main messages you wanted to get across sure maybe I'll jump in and then Glenn can add as well as he sees fit so the first and most important point is to say that recent technological developments do rise to the level of a constitutional moment there's been a lot of controversy over how important our decentralized social Technologies how important our generative Foundation models and the paper is mostly focused on you know d-soc so blockchain fetaverse a little bit blockchain is the main example but the the takeaway is yes it is a constitutional moment the kinds of things these new technologies can do go to foundational elements of how Society is structured they affect core elements of how property operates core elements of how identity operates and the like and changes at that level will have fundamental impacts over time we may not have seen those fundamental impacts yet this is not to say that cryptocurrency as such is the fundamental impact but the underlying technology are transformative at a sort of deep constituative level so that's point one and so then point two is you know what's an ethics for developing such Technologies when the impacts are so substantial we draw on some you know pre-existing examples from bioethics sort of explore the landscape of how people have built different Frameworks and precautionary principle and the like and we land on a recommendation for what we call prudent vigilance food and vigilance is a framework where you expect experimentalism you're not trying to block it you're not trying to make sure that you know you know in advance that no harm will come but you are building in processes to look for near-term and long-term uh Downstream consequences harms and so forth and building and processes and practices as part of the technology development to mitigate those risks and then of course there's also the question of can we take new technologies with constitutive power and not just avoid the harms that they cause but also in fact deploy them to positive ends so in some sense the really important part of the paper finally is a picture of human flourishing and a vision for what we call either plural or plurality based or power sharing liberalism it is exactly the directions that we are articulate with the plurality concept to start and the question is how can technology be used in this direction then the other question of are there key techno-normative Concepts that are pertinent here whether it's trustlessness for example or any of the others and how do they map on to the values that we should want to bring to using Technologies in this space I'm sure Glenn has lots to add so let me pass it over to Glenn I would just elaborate on Daniel's points which I actually think were really the right ones um one thing I would say is there's sort of a poll element which Danielle emphasized like what is it that decentralized social Technologies are empowering us to do there's also a push element which is that um I increasingly believe that with the rise of powerful AI systems many of the Legacy systems that web3 has proposed itself as potential alternative to are simply just not going to be sustainable um I think a lot of the authentication that we've relied on whether it be captchas or talking to a loved one is going to be very easily replicable and so people are going to have to increasingly rely on these more sophisticated approaches whether or not they prefer them because other forms of digital authentication are going to evaporate and so I think these Technologies are going to be put in center stage one way or the other so it's important that we find what can be valuable about them the second thing I'd say is just to make an analogy to Danielle's idea of prudent vigilance for the context is probably more familiar to your listeners I think of it as a little bit being the ethics equivalent of The Lean Startup methodology so you know in The Lean Startup methodology you neither have like a plan that you're going to execute based on a careful analysis of every contingency nor do you have just like you're sticking to the way that things have always been done both of those are inimical to this Lean Startup methodology and within ethics those roughly correspond to what's called utilitarianism and deontology utilitarianism is about like calculating everything out and you know making a the best plan and deontology is all about following the rules um prudent vigilance or Lean Startup methodologies about deliberately experimenting with something trying to get as much information from that experiment as you can and being ready to quickly pivot away from mistakes and towards potential you know and that's not a framework that's I think been translated fully to the ethics world and I think one thing that is exciting beyond the applications here which Danielle got at nicely is you know there's also an insight for ethical Theory here which is about um how to take some of the lessons that have been learned in the technology world and bring them to how we approach Ethics in a context that requires that where there's this constant change in in the environment partly driven by our own actions you know what stands out for me Glenn as I hear you talk about this prudent vigilance in this constitutional moment is just all the foundational impacts of web 3 decentralized social technologies that you uh identified in the paper you and your co-authors identified in the paper and uh they're pretty foundational parts of of of society uh titling and validation notaries public identification systems fund transfers media social media governance and voting rewarding digital labor property relationships dispute resolution so it feels like the stakes are pretty high here uh to to get this right um can you say more about about what you would like to see in the web3 ecosystem based off of what you've unveiled in this paper so uh to me the um the real challenge in the coming years for the web 3 ecosystem is going to be um how to very rapidly be able to mainstream things uh at much lower cost and much greater accessibility and much greater sort of integration with mainstream values than has been achieved today um and how to do that very quickly without um necessarily uh a ton of money backing it up you know uh and it's going to be a very interesting moment to like to take an example from what you gave um suppose that you know generative AI advances very rapidly and this has wide scale impacts on creators um and people uh you know standard means of earning livelihood just sort of evaporates very quickly for a large segment of the population um obviously there's been a lot of exploring using things like nfts um alternatives to that that was kind of an interesting sideshow but there's a chance that might become one of the primary possible sources of income for a significant chunk of people and I don't think the system is really prepared for that I don't think nfts like have stabilized or come to a point that's socially legitimate or that is sort of um you know consistent with the rest of society in a way that allows them to become a foundation for that many people's income um but they might have to so that's going to be I think uh huge demand and it's going to require the cooperation of lots of different parts of society including governments that have generally taken either a sort of reactive or a standoffish position uh with regards to this space this comment about the need for integration with substance mainstream Norm's values and expectations in various ways for me this is particularly true around the concept of governance so I think web3 Technologies do provide Innovative governance resources and tools but at the same time there's lots of sort of old-fashioned kind of governance protocols that would have been relevant for example to you know the Sam Bateman freed collapse when they lacked basic governance things that people actually have known how to do for centuries so I see the sort of fusion of some of the sort of old school thinking about governance with enablement through web3 Technologies is really promising and I hope that there's a sort of openness to that kind of project of integration Glenn anything to add there uh yeah I mean governance there's a lot to say about governance governance is going to be a fascinating challenge um you know the the uh I've been working on some very out there governance stuff for a while and often pointing to taiwan's example as one that's really impressive um but I've increasingly come to think that even stuff that's well beyond uh what's going on in Taiwan may be relatively short term necessary um just to deal with some of these challenges uh that I was that I was mentioning so uh it's I think yeah it's going to be really an interesting there's a challenge in that you know to date so much of the energy has been directed towards defining how the various web3 Technologies can be used to generate value in a you know often frothy way right and instead of asking the question of which Collective action problems or social organization sort of roadblocks or obstacles could these Technologies resolve and the truth of the matter is that there ought to be sort of value along those Pathways as well and reward for pursuing them but the structure of activity hasn't really directed energy in that way so that's sort of the question for me is how to get people sort of directed towards seeing the you know the potential for positive social impact and exploring points of application where that could be realized I mean uh people always say that fear and greed are the two great motivators and I think one interesting thing that may happen in the coming years is the emphasis here may move from greed to fear a little bit like if a lot of traditional governance and uh verification systems begin to fail and these uh the possibilities in this space become fallbacks things may become very real for people very quickly for good or for and for ill you know uh and people may be looking for ways to make things uh work that kind of happened to some extent with the Twitter uh you know Twitter going south under elon's management but will um we might see that at much broader scales for some of these other things and and it might be generative or it might be uh just as problematic I'm not sure we'll have to see well I mean I think regardless it's in web 3's best interest to Route capital and talent uh to decentralized social Technologies or web3 projects that can bring the most positive impact in the world there's a lot of one of the things I talk about a lot in my work is how do we rotate capital and talent from the Degen projects to the regen projects uh how do we make the market reward ethics because I think that once the Market's rewarding the type of Ethics that you talk about in this paper then you'll just see a flow of innovation into into projects that that follow these guidelines and so um how do we rotate capital and talent into into these type of of projects because the market learns its lesson after FTX and after some of the hacks and Ponzi schemes that were part of the last web uh cycle what would have to be true for the next cycle of capital and talent to roll into projects that are part of your vision uh maybe I'll go to you first Danielle yeah now that's a great question I think that's one we're trying to answer so one of our projects like this I could kind of put a call out to your listeners honestly is we're now really trying to identify um use cases where people are wrestling with the question of how to structure experimentation and the like and we are going to be identifying some use cases to dig into to try to give guidance in that regard um I mean we're doing some work at the moment on Dows for instance because that does seem like there's a lot of sort of promising governance potential there so we ourselves try to spot the places in the universe where we see pro-social benefits flowing and then sort of try to lift them up and Elevate them bring research attention to them bring sort of validation from the research Community about where value is hoping to some extent to shift the value framework you know that way and then that obviously I can't do it in itself but it can make a contribution to it so that's a big part of it um but I do think you know identifying the right kinds of problems to solve where there is value on the other side of a solution even if it is sort of structured somewhat differently than the speculative Market structure value is a part of the work you know I though uh thing that was sort of implicit in Daniel's answer answer that I would emphasize really comes back to the pluralism point I think that you get beneficial social change from the intersection of various dysfunctional sectors so like the academy has a lot of limitations governments have a lot of limitations Civil Society has a lot of limitations the market you know especially the quite anarchic Market in crypto has a lot of limitations but out of them together might come something really interesting so I think one major goal we have with this paper is to welcome into the conversation people from Danielle's academic world and maybe eventually people from politics to not just uh talk about what's happening in the space or be Pro or anti but to actually help shape it um and to help promote directions for it and I think that's what we've seen in Taiwan um and we've seen for years government investment in fundamental research and all sorts of areas not so much in this area and I love you know if our efforts can help bring some of those other sectors into proactive participation in helping to shape this space because I think if the logic of the the market you know is the only logic here we won't get to good outcomes there have to be a lot of different Logics at play that sort of like intertwine with each other to to get good outcomes yeah that's right yeah plurality but also that's what I meant by sort of structure of value that is it's even Glenn's way of putting was better that market Logics deliver one kind of structure of value but that's not the only structure of value available to us and it is true that the kind of intersection of public sector or Civil Society of the market can generate opportunities where there's another sort of Pathway to values structured differently than the market would structure it but it exists and so being really clear and sort of problem identification so that we're seeing those problems where our Solutions of that kind would make a huge difference is sort of I think a really important job and you know I think it's important for people to keep in mind that that's how we got to the extent we got it at all decentralization in web one it was not primarily driven by hackers who are anti-establishment it was driven by government bureaucrats who were worried about disruption of centralized systems um and them working with academics who had been trained in various social thinking and then uh that eventually offering commercial opportunities to scale it so it was a it was very much a multi-sectoral collaboration and I think if we want sustainable decentralization it's critical that we do that again today and rather than just using one way of approaching the problem anything to add Danielle well I mean I I mean sometimes I say to people we get sort of stuck in this kind of false dichotomy between subsidized and privatize um as if those are the only two Logics for achieving any major scale transformation but there's a third logic which I like to reorganize um which is exactly this matter of taking different sort of institutional configurations realigning them reorganizing them with each other so that different kinds of human coordination are possible and then boom like huge amounts of value flows from that um you know provided that the thing you're realigning to achieve is socially useful and valuable I'm wondering if y'all can tell us about some of the values that you put forth in the paper uh specifically I'm looking at the human flourishing section where we talk about things like non-domination individual and Community self-determination egalitarian pluralism coordination capacity Collective ownership um for me these are our new sort of phrases and buzzwords in in web 3 we talk a lot about decentralization and sometimes public goods but why why these values why why were these so important to you in writing the paper sure um so I'll jump in on that one for starters um so over you know the Millennia political philosophers have put forward any number of different theories of human well-being or human flourishing so this framework represents in some sense the Leading Edge there are a number of different philosophers you can point to around the world Philip Pettit based mainly in Australia marchia Sen connected to India the UK and the US Elizabeth Anderson at the University of Michigan myself all of whom have really dug into the concept of human freedom and human well-being and made the case that the richest concept is one that centers a 90 of non-domination so it's a contrast between the idea that freedom is just freedom from interference you know the government should always just leave you alone anything the government does is interference versus a concept where the thing to avoid is domination so arbitrary decision making for example illegitimate decision making but that in fact what we all need is sort of empowerment in both our private and our public lives as co-creators of the norms and constraints that shape the conditions for action and then that the creation of those constraints always be non-dominating hence the need for legitimacy and so forth the legitimacy requirements at any rate so there's that sort of big body of work in the world of philosophy that is articulating this view for where the path of human flourishing is it is also supportive of a pluralist view the ideas of that human flourishing looks exactly the same for every human being it's rather that if we are again empowered in our private lives and in our public lives as co-creators of norms and constraints then we can all find our paths to flourishing and we can also find the way of aligning our different Paths of flourishing with one another for sort of broadly positive social cooperation so the other Concepts sort of flow out of that core idea the commitment to egalitarian pluralism decentralization coordination capacity and the like and so then one of the things we were really trying to do in the paper was to see where in the normative discourse in the web 3 or decentralized social technology space we could see those Concepts operating and they don't always fit perfectly you want to be clear it's not like there's a kind of one-to-one mapping between the philosophical Concepts and the techno-normative concepts but we did see people's pursuing sort of normative aspirations you know in the web three space or the dsox space that seemed to you know have some family resemblance to Concepts in this picture of human flourishing and so we wanted to push on that and figure out you know what more could be said could we tighten up the normative thinking in the tech space yeah I mean I guess the short the short way I'd put it Kevin is that um you know there's a bunch of stuff that people talk about effectively normatively within the web 3 community in fact it's obsessed with various slogans like this and then there's like thousands of years of political philosophy and the language is almost unrelated so that seems kind of weird you know and so what we're trying to do is like find where we can build Bridges find where there's tensions and also maybe we didn't emphasize as much but I think one of the most interesting things is where can like problems intentions on the ground within the web 3 Community trying to live out those values like reflect limits of the philosophical Concepts like for example non-domination has I think a lot of relationship to this notion of trustlessness it means that like there's nobody who can take away from you something you know or nobody who can constrain you in certain ways but of course trustlessness has had a lot of issues uh in practice and I think not all of them are issues for non-domination but like they they show some of the tensions that come out trying to make uh non-various visions of non-demand so it's in that back and forth that I think you know both philosophy and the web3 community have a lot to gain foreign super productive set of conversations I will say I mean just to Glenn's point and you could obviously hear in our answers right that I come from one very specific intellectual place and sort of background place and had a lot of learning to do so the bridge building was an important part of this work but as Glenn said I mean there is you know real sort of normative vocabulary real questions about ethics people are sort of probing and pushing trying to understand you know people are trying to think about regenerative economies for instance um and so we really wanted to provide some anchors for that and give people the chance to connect to on both sides academic and Tech side sort of connect to a conversation so people could see more what the stakes are of the ethical terms they're pursuing anything else you want to add upon yeah to me that's all again just pardon parcel of this thing of bringing different Logics to bear on the same problems letting people learn from each other rather than learn everything completely separately and you know trying to um find this cooperation across these different communities even if it's not complete even if we're not going to make them the same discussions at least we can help people see what the parallels are so that people can read those philosophical discussions and maybe gain something from them you know mm-hmm you know as as we uh discussed the paper I find myself drawn to this this line that I saw in the paper um many of the utopian and dystopian Promises of decentralized social texts are hypothetical uh and they're just projections about Futures that the underlying Technologies might support and um I just thought that was kind of just very profound that we're projecting out into the future uh what these Technologies might support and so that that sort of leads to my question if y'all are maximally successful what does web3 look like in five or ten years uh I think last question I went to you Danielle so maybe I'll go to you Glenn for First on this one so if you're maximally successful if this paper is maximally impactful what does web3 look like in in five or ten years um I hope web3 is no longer a subculture uh I hope that you know the learnings from it have suffused the broader culture and on the other hand the you know problems with it uh have been sort of ironed out and made consistent with uh you know broader social values uh I hope that uh a lot of the ideas that have been popularized through the web 3 world are parts of mainstream systems I hope we have you know sort of web of trust pluralistic verification all over the place um I hope we have a bunch of creative new ways of governance and decision making uh being used by governments but also by new types of organizations I hope we have um lots of experiments with lots of new property regimes uh going on harnessing these Technologies and I hope a large chunk of it though not all of it is not for-profit businesses there's lots of government support there's lots of philanthropic support there's lots of Partnerships between private organizations and various kinds of charitable and public sector organizations um yeah no I would um second all of that and I guess the way I would put it is I hope that in five years time the use case that the general public thinks of when they hear about blockchain isn't cryptocurrency actually that so many other use cases have suffused the space that people realize it's a technological enablement that can solve problems you know across domains again governance problems verification problems Etc so um yeah um well as as we're sort of getting towards the bottom of the hour I'm wondering if there's anything that I didn't ask that y'all want to say maybe Danielle will go to you first on this one well I mean and for me I am really interested in the question of what case studies feel the most pressing for people and so I really love again to kind of put out a call and people can find us online at the getting plurality network if you Google that and there'll be a kind of point of contact and if you have if people if listeners have cases where they're sort of wrestling with questions of Ethics as they're trying to figure out how to deploy some element of decentralized social technology we'd love to hear from people because we are really wanting to be responsive to the decisions people are actually facing and I think we still have a lot of work to do honestly to be effective in offering you know practices protocols and the like for people to you know be able to use the kind of Ethics guard rails that we've tried to sketch out in the paper thanks Danielle we'll have a link to that in the show notes the getting plurality Network and people can reach out if they have ethical questions as they build dials in web 3 Tech exactly Glenn same question to you is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say well I'd I'd love to welcome people's participation um you can check it out at plurality.net uh in the book that I'm writing with Audrey it's an open get based collaboration we'll be using a lot of the Innovative governance approaches that we describe in the book and that you and I have talked about for so long that you talk about in Greenfield as part of the book project um and we'd like to help have people use those tools to co-create their vision of of the future of them so uh that's my call for participation amazing and I would also ask that the listeners read the paper I read it over the last couple days it's really quite inspiring to to hear how uh how you hate in business web3 technology and the ethics of decentralized social especially knowing just how deeply connected in the space y'all are uh you know my work get coin was built foundationally on top of uh quadratic funding and the decentralized society paper that Glenn and vitalik and uh and Puja put out uh was really foundational so um Glenn congratulations uh exciting um fundraising effort recently around that paper that's right yeah for for the audience's benefit uh it wasn't my uh fundraising uh effort uh get coin uh had Glenn and vitalik and Zoe signed the qf paper and um I also wrote an article and signed the paper and that was dropped as an nft called get coin presents and I think it raised like 800k for the Bitcoin matching pool and for the polarity plurality Institute so thank you again for your support of that one meaningful yeah well I think I was Meandering there but what I wanted to say is that y'all have both been such an inspiration for me uh and your work has been foundational for some of the stuff that I've worked on and so um if I can pay it forward and we can build this movement of plurality forward that seems like a really exciting outcome for me fantastic thank you Kevin really appreciate your work all right so uh call to action for The Listener check out the getting plurality Network check out plurality.net and read the paper there will be links in the show notes for each of those thanks so much for joining me Danielle and Glenn thanks Kevin [Music] foreign [Music]
