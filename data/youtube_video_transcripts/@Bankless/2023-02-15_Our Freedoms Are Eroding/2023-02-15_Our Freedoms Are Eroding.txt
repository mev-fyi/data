what is happening is a progressive erosion of freedom very quietly without anyone particularly thinking about it New York has yellow caps and you've held them off the street jump in and they take you and give them 20 bucks and you get out right and the only way someone can stop you from doing that is by arresting there's no actor including mistake can say hey Ryan you're not allowed to use a taxi anymore that's just not a thing now what is needed for Uber to say I don't want Ryan using my service anymore absolutely nothing and so if the CEO of uber wakes up and says I don't like the look of that guy's face you're off the clock
