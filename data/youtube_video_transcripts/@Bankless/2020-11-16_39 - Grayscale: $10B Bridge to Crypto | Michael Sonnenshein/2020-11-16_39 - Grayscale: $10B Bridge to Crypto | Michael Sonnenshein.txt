[Music] [Music] welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better and how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless david what'd you think about today's episode this episode with michael sun and shine i thought was really fantastic i've listened to a number of different episodes with michael and other members of the grayscale team about you know what grayscale is and what they do but i never really felt satisfied with with other podcasts and how they approach the subject matter of grayscale and how grayscale fits into the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem so ryan i actually thought you did a fantastic job as host on this podcast and so tip at the tip of the hat to you i think the the flow of conversation and the topics and some of the things that we talked about really did a fantastic job kind of putting into perspective you know first what grayscale is and then also its role in relationship to bitcoin and ethereum yeah you know i think part of this david was like i don't think people totally understand what gbtc is and what ethy are i got a text from a friend of mine who's actually an investor and he's like hey i own some ethan bitcoin on coinbase but i noticed this gbtc and this e in my schwab account what the heck are they and so these are of course grayscale products that you can buy inside of a brokerage i think we spent a lot of time in the first part of this actually talking about what those products are are they real crypto do they represent crypto how are they who has the private keys who secures them how are they priced compared to buying it on spot so i think this will be pretty handy for you if you're a retail investor and you're like hey i want some exposure into uh into these assets should i buy them on coinbase or some spot market or should should i buy them uh inside my brokerage these these great scale assets buy them that way it sort of starts to answer that question then we got to talking about um how the institutions are coming they're already here and what they think about things like defy and eth as an asset which started to get really interesting in the second half too when michael came on to the podcast and before we started recording i kind of gave him the pitch of what bankless is right and so i told him that the through line throughout bankless is you know how do we live a life with crypto assets and and to create a world without banks right which is actually kind of something i think from the grayscale side of things might be kind of a weird thing to hear uh but and that is kind of a little bit true the the bankless through line and also the grayscale product are a little bit at odds with each other right because grayscale and its relationships with banks it's a very bank-friendly product bank-friendly environment but you know i think in in the bankless world where we like the banks that like crypto and that's exactly what grayscale is right and to me what grayscale is is this gigantic coupler between the crypto world and the legacy finance world and grayscale's doing a really fantastic job of helping the narrative of bitcoin helping the narrative narrative of ethereum and cryptocurrency really mature and they have done a fantastic marketing campaign literally for the cryptocurrency industry right promoting the the value and merits of crypto to the greater world and so as far as financial institution goes we like grayscale yeah that's that's interesting that you put it that way because you know i agree with you too look great i'll be the first to say grayscale is not fully bankless it is a banked crypto option however you know you've used this metaphor so often of like who who's on the boat like noah's ark and sort of the flood well grayscale is like the bridge to the ark it serves as very useful function to start getting liquidity and start getting value inside of the crypto ecosystem now if we just stay on on that bridge portion and we never actually get to the fully bankless arc i think that's a big problem and and personally that's why i have a problem with the way bitcoin is scaling it's a lot of the the bitcoin scalability measures seem to happen within custody within crypto asset banks within you know grayscale type investment vehicles but i don't think that's where the world is going to camp out and stay so this is a great first step uh and i'm actually like optimistic about what grayscale is doing to help get people on the arc and on the path towards going bankless you know bitcoin and some of these products in a retirement account that's just the gateway drug people aren't stopping there they're going to dig deeper they're going to discover how to be fully soft self-sovereign without using a bank whatsoever and uh that is my hope and why this i think is a really useful episode for us grayscale's assets under management have absolutely exploded they have seven and a half billion dollars under management and i think there's going to become a really interesting friction maybe maybe i'm just speculating here but between grayscale and the united states right because grayscale is making it really easy to purchase bitcoin right and as a financial tool that is kind of diametrically opposed to the dollar and the federal reserve and money printing it's kind of there's this interesting relationship between grayscale's growth and the the power of the dollar when grayscale gets bigger i see it as you know the dollar weakening and that and grayscale is doing it from inside united states right the calls coming from inside the house we didn't talk about this subject with michael but i i think that is going to be something to pay attention to moving forward yeah i think the truth is right now that nation states uh are not worried about crypto eroding their reserve currency status at the moment you know they're worried about breaking sec accredited investor rules and that sort of thing they're even worried about bank secrecy act sorts of things but that could certainly change like when we talk when we talked to michael and he said hey the majority of people who bought crypto within the last nine to 12 months or so they bought it because of covid because they were concerned about money printing from the fed that's why they bought it as soon as nation states start to feel that pressure on their reserve currency status you can bet they're going to start to turn their eye on crypto and all of the crypto banks that power the ecosystem if there's one big takeaway from this podcast is that grayscale is going to help number go up with no further ado let's go ahead and get into the podcast but first we're going to talk about some of the fantastic sponsors that make this show possible if you are looking for the front page of

search monolith in the app store all right let's get to the podcast with michael thankless nation we are super excited to bring on the podcast michael sonenshine he is the managing director at grayscale investments which is the largest digital currency asset management company by far you may have seen a product called gbtc or if e in your schwab account your fidelity account these are products uh that are a way to give you price exposure to eath and bitcoin if you've ever wondered what those things are what they're composed of how institutions see assets like ethereum and bitcoin we're going to talk about all of those things with michael today michael welcome to bankless how you doing i'm great thanks so much for having me i'm looking forward to chatting well it's been a pleasure you've been in this space for like i think seven years or something now is that right seven years wow feels like feels like uh oh i don't know i think what it what's the old adage now a year or like a week in in the digital currency world is like a year in the real world okay something like that yeah so uh i don't know how old you are that's like methuselah age like a thousand you spent millennials in this space already but um but but you are now the managing director of grayscale which is closing in on something like six billion assets under management last quarter you guys did about a billion in inflows how does that feel um it's honestly been a true pleasure um and i'm really humbled by the opportunity i've been given to be a part of building and growing this business um i couldn't have imagined that we would see this asset class develop and flourish in the way that it has over the past seven years and riding all the ups and downs and stagnant periods um it's it's really been incredible um we're actually now um as of last night uh at seven and a half billion dollars oh my god that's partially because bitcoin keeps growing in price right as well as inflows it's not just inflows i'm sorry it's not just bitcoin price appreciation um it's inflows it's very very strong steady inflows and um you know i'm happy to dive into that with you guys today but i'd also probably tell you that is as proud as i am of being a part of this and really being a leader and helping to shape and mold the grayscale business um and seeing us grow when i joined with 60 million dollars of assets we now have over you know seven billion like i told you um i started we had one product now we have ten products uh i'm probably more proud of the team of people um that i put together um it's a really interesting eclectic mix of forward-thinking thoughtful caring intelligent collaborative people uh and i think everybody is really taking what they've learned working for the most part in the traditional finance world at banks um and applying some of those best practices and leaving some of those worst practices behind um to build you know what what we think is the asset manager for the next generation of investors it's got to feel like you've been right about a few things in crypto too right uh i guess you can say that i attribute a lot of it to luck and you know happy to talk about what my journey was getting into crypto but you know a lot of it is just you know time and place and good luck well michael congratulations on all the uh all the success if we were to uh wind back the clock like maybe a year or or two years and if somebody told you yeah that in the future you're gonna have seven and a half billion dollars assets and management uh what would your reaction have been back then um i'll believe it when i see it would it was that going to be a believable number or was that something that you actually could foresee happening at that time or has this kind of just uh blown expectations out of the water it um no it was always within it was was in you know within reasonable grasp um it was just a question of how fast we would get there you know even today talking to you at seven and a half billion dollars uh underpinning the grayscale uh family of products i still have to say it still just feels to me like we're only getting started that's super impressive but i think anyone in crypto knows those words very well because we say them often crypto is just getting started and therefore grayscale's probably going to be a big part of that story but you know before we talk about institutions and inflows um i actually never heard you michael on a podcast talk about products from a retail investor perspective and um that's where that's where i think we'd like to start talking about the products themselves but like putting a retail investor hat on so if i'm somebody with a schwab account or a fidelity account some sort of a brokerage and i'm i'm based in the us what do grayscale's products actually look like to me so how can we start there maybe like how does a retail investor buy your products in their brokerage account what does that look like happy to talk through that so you know for us we now have 10 products uh underpinning the grayscale family nine of those products facilitate exposure to a single digital currency and the tenth product is a diversified basket of large cap digital currencies um and so we think of the grayscale product lineup as really almost like a tool kit um and every investor uses the tools within the gracefield toolkit in a different way some investors only use one grayscale product you know every quarter that passes we see more and more investors adding more great scale products to their portfolios and inherently diversifying their exposure within the crypto space um but it's um it's uh it's a unique constituency of products and i think we're really serving a broad base of investors so it's important to make a couple distinctions as i talk about this i want to try and be as clear as i can be we continue to raise assets on a primary issue inside so new new assets new shares of our products being created through ongoing private placements so if you're an accredited investor so these are mostly high net worth individuals and family offices hedge funds institutions they come directly to grayscale and can buy shares of any one of the products at the product's daily pricing at its daily net asset value what we've done though is we've also made these products available to the public market um and so so far six out of the ten products that grayscale is responsible for managing and sponsoring have also been quote unquote turned on having public quotations in the u.s market and so those products are for bitcoin and bitcoin cash ethereum ethereum classic litecoin as well as our diversified fund i mentioned the the grayscale digital large cap fund so if you're um an investor whether you're a large investor a small investor you have a lot to invest a little amount to invest you can go to your brokerage account um or retirement account and buy any one of those products in any size or for any period of time that you may want to um and for a lot of investors that's been a really easy accessible way for them to gain digital currency exposure in those types of accounts alongside the other assets they're invested in whether those are stocks like netflix and apple and tesla or bonds or whatever it may be so we really do serve a whole broad swatch of the community but it is definitely worth noting that the products on the public market have historically and currently do trade um at a premium to their actual net asset value and so it's something for investors to be aware of because that means they are buying exposure oftentimes and historically um at you know inflated levels of varying degrees and it's also important to note that we as a firm aren't involved in the public trading side of our products so the price at which you know you mentioned gvtc or eth the public ticker symbols for our bitcoin and our ethereum products earlier as we were talking those products prices every day in the in the market are always being driven by market forces um and so we're not involved in setting the prices or maintaining the prices of those products uh so just something else for people to note as they're thinking about it super cool we're going to get into all of that and i want to camp on this for a bit so let's keep with our retail investor product on uh hat on rather somebody who has a brokerage account like any brokerage account the way you'd look up an apple or netflix you can look up something called gbtc which essentially gives you price exposure to underlying uh bitcoin uh the underlying bitcoin asset or eth e so e-t-h-e you can type that into schwapp and get an asset that has price exposure to um to ether the asset of course it's not the same as spot price exposure we're going to talk about all all of that so one quick question before we get in is this available for international investors too or is this kind of u.s only oh no it's available to anybody on on both sides so on the private placement side about half of our investors are offshore um and on the public market side um certainly no no reason that investors all around the world so long as they can access the u.s securities market um they should be able to access these products as well okay and then one nice thing we've talked about is you can access them in a traditional um brokerage system that you might have um but but of course a lot of retail investors they have the majority of their their assets in retirement accounts 401ks iras that sort of thing and they can get they can get these products inside of those retirement accounts which is which is kind of nice and these are sort of the only large products that that i know of in order to do that but one question i mean people are used to buying things like etfs right and you know generally investors with brokerage accounts they understand what an etf is but what's the difference between a gbtc or an e3 and etf well so um etfs um um are different structurally so they have um you know constant creations and redemption programs um meaning that there are participants in the market that are constantly creating and destroying shares and those forces act to always keep the product as much as possible in line with its actual value the other difference because we don't operate a redemption program is that our products trade on the otc market which is where a lot of foreign companies trade in the u.s companies like roche and adidas and volkswagen etc um that's where the grayscale products are quoted as opposed to a national securities exchange like the new york stock exchange or nasdaq so those are probably two of the the biggest differences of our products against what they would be if they were etfs although it is worth noting that both grayscale bitcoin trust and greyscale ethereum trust are the first two and the only sec reporting companies um with respect to the digital currency investment product space and what that means is that they file 10ks and 10qs and have the same reporting obligations and standards as investors are used to seeing for other public instruments or public companies so they're about as regulated and over and have as much oversight and disclosure obligations as investors should see for other things they invest in all right so so that is one i i guess uh element of transparency is basically they have the same level of transparency as you know a stock might have but when they're buying a gbdc or an ep any of these products um i want to get into like what are they actually buying so um first where are the private keys actually held so if i'm buying um you know bitcoin or eth on coinbase then coinbase is custodying my private keys of course and then if i request uh those to be sent or redeemed to a bitcoin underneath address that i hold then coinbase will will go and do that but in this case um you know if i have one of these products in my brokerage account they can't ever be redeemed for the underlying is that correct and then where are the private keys actually held that is correct so the two products are talking about the bitcoin product and the ethereum product they're each just solely and passively invested in the digital currency for which they're named so grayscale bitcoin trust holds nothing but bitcoin and grayscale ethereum trust holds nothing but ethereum these products don't use leverage they don't use derivatives they don't even have a pennies worth of cash inside of them they're just passively invested in the underlying digital assets themselves um and greyscale custodies the underlying assets underneath all of our products in the coinbase custody trust company solution um and that is you know a cold storage solution that as you may imagine involves many many many many many different signatories parties time delays all kinds of things to be able to access any of those coins so no investors do not own the bitcoin or the ethereum directly they're owning shares of a trust and that trust owns its uh underlying digital currency and that's how investors are getting that exposure this is kind of like all the owning uh owning shares of some sort of a like a gold trust you know you already gave the distinction between like an etf and a trust and why this is different but lots of people are familiar with gold etfs or maybe there's even gold trust i'm not sure yeah or if you wanted to gain exposure to oil there's a product that gives you exposure to oil or to yeah and somebody's custodying that right it's like the gold that you're buying is eventually it's you know in some big vault somewhere in london right but you're buying exposure to that gold but there's a there's an underlying i don't know lloyd's london i don't know who does that but there's an underlying vault somewhere that actually holds the physical gold right correct yeah i i don't want to tell you that that's true across the board because some of the products you're referencing do use derivatives and aren't one for one um i can you know say with assurance that our products are fully invested in and backed by um the the digital asset that we're that we're you know naming each product for okay so now let's get back to keeping our retail hat on let's get back to the fees right so obviously um when you buy you know crypto on coinbase or something at spot price you might be paying some transaction fees to to a coin base for it for example um you know but you're not paying annual management fees i have to make that purchase but these products do have an annual management fee is that correct they do the same way all investment products do got it and that fee is what like 2.5 or so or does it range it depends on the product the bitcoin product has a two percent fee the ethereum product has a two and a half percent annual fee gotcha and i imagine some portion of that goes to like pay for custody but also general administration of uh these products themselves by grayscale is that correct yeah i mean that's the only fees that there are there's no upfront fees there's no back-end fees there's no performance fees or carry or anything like that and actually investors often ask about this so it'd be great to set the record straight with you know your your audience which is that if you invest in these products it's not like you're going to get some separate bill for the management fee or that somehow what you're investing something is is being deducted away from you um it actually is all behind the scenes and what i mean by that is that the management fee accrues daily in the digital currency itself so if you buy you know grayscale bitcoin trust and that has a two percent annual management fee well every day of the year the bitcoin to share ratio decays by one three hundred and sixty-fifth of two percent so we actually take the management fee out in the underlying bitcoin itself so um just wanna set the record straight on that so so people don't think it's anything other than that which is truly the way most um most uh you know commodity based or a lot of similar investment products structure their management fees michael does that mean that grayscale pays itself in bitcoin and ether as is profits it does um our revenues are derived solely from our management fees so we are taking the price risk um on the underlying currencies themselves so when bitcoin goes up when ether goes up grayscale actually is well you guys just have as much exposure to the industry as as anyone else i i think that's actually a really great way to align the values of crypto with what you guys are offering i think that's really cool indeed it is another thing that uh you mentioned on price so again keeping the retail investor hat on right so the one thing to keep in mind is the management fee and i think folks know what that is if they purchased you know mutual funds or stocks they've seen those sorts of fees before that's different than buying in spot of course and another thing that you mentioned earlier and i want to dig back into this to make it to make it clear michael is that there can be a premium to nav price if somebody is purchasing a gbtc or an e in their in their brokerage account right and you mentioned that's like that's because that's a there's a secondary market right for retail investors in the brokerage essentially and that's where they're paying you guys don't control that price the market does but it's something for retail investors to keep in mind because um i i think i was i was looking this morning maybe gtb gb gbdc was about 15 over nav spot price something like that um but uh ether has been up to 800 percent over spot price at some points this year it's down a lot from that but um that represents a premium to what they could be purchasing eth at an 800 premium for what they could be purchasing ethat at at an exchange is that correct any anything more you'd say on that it certainly is again all of that's driven by market forces and not something that grayscale is dictating or putting into the market yeah totally get it but it is definitely something for folks to keep in mind as they're evaluating uh their investments here because that can fluctuate up or down and you guys really have no control over how it fluctuates that's exactly right michael does that premium simply imply that there is so much demand for crypto that people are willing to pay that premium on the legacy stock market in order to have exposure to these assets i think it really is driven by market forces so it's really hard to to say um i you know i think one thing that certainly may be attributable to driving that that premium is the fact that um you know there is you know no redemption program and this is you know really the way in which investors get liquidity is this robust secondary market um but also because of the novelty and the i guess um yeah i guess really novelty you know there are no other you know listed securities um where investors can gain exposure to digital assets right alongside the other things that they're invested in it does seem over time that that premium does does tend to drop right uh gptc's has dropped quite a lot in its history and even we're seeing eath drop quite a lot um is that kind of your general anticipation that it will kind of drop really hard to really hard to predict i think over time you know markets um have a way of um ensuring that uh that things get ironed out and you know information gets disseminated and and we try to do our very best certainly to make people aware of you know all of these kinds of risks that relate to investing in products um whether they're ours or other investment products for that matter and uh over time i think the market works all of those things out you guys there is so much left in this interview we talk about grayscale's drop gold advertising campaign which has really been the biggest advertising campaign to come out of the crypto space to targeting the rest of the world we also talk about the value proposition for grayscale for retail investors as well as michael's future predictions for how large the grayscale trust will grow in assets under management but first before we get to those conversations we're going to take a moment and pause the interview to talk about some of the fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you own crypto what really matters is the security and ownership over your assets being a part of the bankless nation means having complete sovereignty over your crypto the easiest way to do that is with a ledger hardware wallet a hardware wall is a little device that manages your private keys for you so you don't have to worry about proper private key management your ledger hardware wallet keeps your private keys private but still lets you have easy access to your crypto the combination of my ledger hardware wallet and metamask lets me store my crypto assets in the most safe way possible but still lets me easily access uniswap or all the other defy apps that i use on a daily basis if you already have a ledger wallet you can use the ledger live app to participate in some of the money verbs that we discuss in the bankless program the ledger live app is your headquarters for managing your personal crypto finance it's a great tool to manage the assets you hold on your ledger as well as receive a portfolio summary of all the assets that you have stored using the ledger live app you can buy bitcoin ether and stable coins and have it sent directly to your ledger hardware wallet skipping over the trusted exchanges and getting your assets into your control you can even use the ledger live app to swap crypto assets natively inside of the app so you never need to send your crypto assets away from your ledger to make a trade buying a ledger is like buying a fire extinguisher the best time to get one was yesterday especially if you're doing something silly like holding your crypto in a hot wallet that's always connected to the internet if you haven't gained full control over your crypto yet go to the link in the show notes and get your ledger today wiring is defy's first self-building project on ethereum focused on producing products for those who are interested in earning yield in d5 why earn's various products are all built to suit each individual investor's preferred level of risk from various vault strategies that leverage defy tokens to the safer urn system which relies on stable coins vaults are aggressive yield farming robots each with a unique strategy that is designed to maximize the yield of the deposited asset wire employs some of the most informed developers in d5 to keep the vault strategies updated with the various yield farming opportunities on ethereum for customers who are more risk adverse the iron's earned product may be for you earn is a yield aware dynamic money market that automatically seeks the best interest rates across the various d5 protocols and regularly migrates your deposited stable coins between the d5 protocols that are returning the best yield at the present moment why iron is a system that is just a little over four months old so things are still very much an experiment however this hasn't stopped people from depositing over 700 million dollars worth of assets into the wire system in order to find yield on ethereum perhaps the people that deposited all this money were tired of constantly making daily transactions to follow the best defy interest rates and maybe the gas fees that they were paying ended up eating too much into their profits with wiring it doesn't remove the risk of these various protocols that it leverages but it does remove the overhead of constantly trying to make sure you're finding the best yield and also so that you don't have to pay for gas to switch up your assets check out the products that iron has to offer at yearn dot finance that's y e a r n dot finance which they also have a nice statistics page to see what other people are doing so what do you think the value proposition overall is for the the typical retail investor you know it comes to mind that one is hey you can really easily get some price exposure to these assets inside of your existing retirement accounts so if you have lots of money in a 401k and you want to diversify into crypto you can you can kind of do that so as long as you're kind of your retirement account is locked in the brokerage this could be an attractive way to essentially put those funds to work in crypto is that the bulk of the value proposition at least for these retail investors i think that's certainly one of them i think a lot of investors have no you know real understanding of the um the digital asset landscape um because it's new right and um that's that's not their fault um and so i think they have difficulty figuring out where the best places to buy or transfer or how to transfer how to store how to save keep digital assets and you know to kind of you know go around or alleviate any of the aforementioned challenges um they have the ability to buy that same exposure but through a a titled security um which i think is just a much more familiar experience to them not to mention you know doing it in a tax advantage manner you're saying like so someone like my parents for example they're not maybe comfortable with uh creating a whole new account on this thing called coinbase but they're very comfortable with their brokerage and they're also scared of like private key management this essentially gives that to them all in one package exactly can we talk a little bit about the accredited investor side so if that's how it looks from a retail perspective accredited investors have a a different set of options because they can buy these these shares directly from you and of course in the us there are accredited investor laws that mean an accredited investor is a person with over a million in assets or 200k per year you guys of course didn't put these laws in place they are such as they are in the u.s and i for one think they that we need to rethink these laws entirely and not make their base changed a little bit i don't know if you guys caught wind of this but the sec actually just updated the definition um so it has expanded and that does allow more people to then be considered accredited investors things like having certain types of licenses like securities licenses and things like that so they are rethinking some of that and i'm sure it will continue to evolve over time i hope they do and i i hope they rethink it like my understanding is these newest changes open it a little bit but it's kind of a crack in the window it's still not giving the average retail i think that's a fair assessment um it's a step in the right direction and i think we're right alongside you you know we we believe in you know the democratization of the capital formation process and you know people should have access to make certain investments and you know if they're sophisticated enough et cetera it shouldn't solely just be based on income or kind of network yeah absolutely okay but so say there are accredited investors uh listening to this they have a different option which is they can buy these shares directly from grayscale and then uh how does that work do they have to hold them for up some period of time and then essentially they can if they want they can exit them into the public market as gbtc or e and there's sort of an arbitrage opportunity there for them so yeah that's um that's exactly right so investors um if you're accredited they can buy shares newly created shares the fund directly from us at nav and um in our bitcoin and ethereum products there's a statutory six-month holding period before they can sell those shares on the public market and it's really as simple as that investors are doing this in a taxable way in a non-taxable way putting these in retirement accounts etc um but there's there's you know quite a few options there it's pretty cool because there i guess for that for that class there is a um an arbitrage opportunity there there it seems like because ideally they'd be you know they could purchase at at uh more close to nav price basically and then sell it a little bit higher in the secondary market that's that's probably the the carrot there for them but when you guys are talking about inflows and we we sort of kicked this off in the intro saying that um you guys did a billion in inflows in q3 um those inflows are all coming from these accredited investors right so you you're not tracking the uh amount of purchases on secondary markets in brokerages and things like that the inflows are actually coming directly from accredited investors is that correct correct so when we're talking about raising assets or expanding um our investor base we're talking about new inflows from accredited investors exactly so who are these investors well i think one of the most interesting things about it is uh the fact that we are dealing well let me first say this i think most people think that crypto investors are just one kind of individual um and or one kind of entity or someone with just you know a cert very specific investment mandate um we actually are really empirical evidence of the fact that that is in fact not the case um so we deal with high net worth investors family offices hedge funds registered investment advisors financial advisors endowments pensions um it really runs the gamut but i think what's even more interesting is the fact that it's not any um any one kind of investor so you have this maybe preconceived notion that it's people that are momentum traders or people that are you know uh technology investors and actually when you look at our investor base it's everybody from global macro funds to risk arbitrage funds to um venture investors i mean it's literally deep value investors it really runs the gamut so i think we like to try and make it as clear as possible that folks understand that while crypto is something that we feel now must be considered by all investors the same way you should consider everything that's out there as you think about building out a diversified portfolio that it will not be something that should end up being in everyone's portfolio because it's not for everyone but at least needs to be considered and we certainly have evidence that it's not only being considered but it's being acted upon by investors of all different sizes and investment mandates when people in crypto repeat the institutions are coming is this what they're talking about are these institutions i think a lot of people have been saying the institutions are coming i think grayscale is the evidence that the institutions have been coming are here and only more of them are showing up michael what's been the the catalyst would you say for such a rise in the assets under management for grayscale oh well i think you have a confluence of a bunch of really interesting factors at the moment i think that um there is the narrative that's generally well received now which is one of you know assets like bitcoin are a digital gold or digital store of value and um you know maybe can can help insulate investors um portfolios when markets get rocky or there's instability or things of that nature and perhaps that's such a now widely held notion because we're living in a world that is really and truly characterized by digital as opposed to physical exchanges and so perhaps as people think about what constitutes a store of value or an inflation hedge or any kind of instrument that may be a flight to safety it probably should be one that's much better suited for a digital environment than a physical one and so you'd certainly see that differential between something like bitcoin and something like gold i think a lot of investors are excited by the potential um of certainly bitcoin being a value mechanism um for transfer um around the world and so i think we look at how fast information moves around the world you know pretty much seamlessly and for free but somehow value has not kept pace with the speed at which information moves and so they're excited by bitcoin's potential to you know move value around the world instantaneously and pretty much for free um i think you know those are kind of some of the newest and most widely held reasons that we're hearing from investors that they're excited about investing in digital assets like bitcoin i think we've also seen over the last year quite a propensity of investors to get excited about ethereum and the idea of dfi or decentralized finance and all these new applications that are being developed on protocols like ethereum um and so we've seen a material uptick there as well and then i think certainly we'd be remiss to not discuss you know within 2020 itself um we have seen such a crazy world um over the past year we saw this massive deleveraging in the market in march as the kovid 19 pandemic brought the global economy to a grinding halt and even though crypto um actually sold off even harder and dropped almost 50 percent in a single day than other asset classes did this was a year where although it's happened many times before i think there was a lot more eyes and ears keeping uh keeping tabs on crypto is that it came back harder and faster than probably it ever has before and was once again um a a real moment for crypto and in bitcoin and ethereum to really demonstrate their resiliency to the investment community and i think in a world now that is characterized by perpetual money printing and fiscal stimulus intervention a lot of investors are thinking about what assets like bitcoin may have actual verifiable scarcity and thinking about the juxtaposition of having an asset like that in their portfolio compared to you know a fiat currency like the dollar which somehow seems to be getting printed to no to no avail um and so it's kind of those kinds of conversations we're having about investors that i think is really not only moving a lot of investors off of xero but we've also really deepened a lot of our investor relationships this year who are using any of these pullback opportunities to really average down or opportunistically add to their positions we've definitely been beating the drum on the bankless podcast about how 2020 has been the year where the world begins to understand how bitcoin fits into it how how uh what niche bitcoin provides and i think the evidence of the massive inflows of value into the grayscale trust are just very strong evidence of that however over the last you know six nine months we've seen well while there's generally been overall bullishness of digital assets and bitcoin there have been like instances where there are certain like market news cycles or market events or news events that people really get uh excited about like one of these would be the the paul tudor jones uh memo or micro strategy putting bitcoin on its balance sheets followed by square when you guys are conversing with your your customers or your investors or people that are putting uh you know value into the grayscale trust are there like um peaks of interest around events like this or is it more of kind of just a a a low and sustainable interest rather than you know any volatile interest at a momentary notice you know investors surprise us all the time there are people who are investing now who have been kind of sitting on this idea for the last six or nine months and when they see the likes of paypal and you know other important milestones transpiring it gets them off of zero um it's really tough to say what i do like to promote as much as i can though is having been in the space for the past seven years i have dealt with and had the fortunate opportunity to deal with some of the world's most storied intelligent you know public investors who have seen you know everything in careers that are double or triple you know the length of my career and have navigated all kinds of things and i continue to remind all these people that no matter how smart you are no matter how many things you think you've seen in your career i tell people that i've never seen somebody really successfully time their exposure to this asset class um and that you either need to decide you want this exposure or you don't you should size your your allocation appropriately and um you know i think for most folks we try to encourage them to take a more medium or long-term horizon because we do think it's so early for the development of the asset class do you guys at grayscale make any effort in trying to learn who or why or what motivates people who are interested in in purchasing you know gbtc or e3 or or you know adding value to to the trust what goes on what what are the communication channels between you guys and your customers and also you guys and your investors sure so you know i think we have what we hope is a really robust um communication channel um we issue um and publish a tremendous amount of content so that we're keeping investors informed of things that we feel are important for them to know and understand that is you know about this ecosystem which is changing every day i think that causes our investors to be pretty proactive with us as well certain areas of the market they'd look to get exposure to on certain products they're interested in us launching for them in the future um certain questions they have about you know events taking place in the ecosystem or how we might think certain announcements or certain initiatives may impact the asset class regulatory changes things of that nature um i think what we find though is that ultimately it's those investors that really spend the time thinking about in researching and working on their understanding of crypto because it is so different from all the other things they've ever invested in those are the ones that we are still having a hard time finding anybody who really does the work really really does the work on understanding crypto we still can't find someone who does that and doesn't come out on the other side of that research totally amazed by the asset class um doesn't mean they end up necessarily investing although often they do but it's usually those who kind of bulk or reject the asset class or those that just haven't spent enough time understanding it so using these communication channels that you have with your customers and investors and then also understanding that on the other side of the equation we have a lot of excitement around events like paul tutor jones memo or micro strategy how does do you guys use these uh the information that you get from your customers and investors to change up your messaging to kind of iterate and refine how you guys pitch your products is there anything about that process that you can shed light on totally i think if we're hearing often from investors about the similar issues um that they want unpacked then we try and host a webinar around that idea or bring in speakers for that kind of idea or publish ourselves on that kind of an idea you know i think we try to be as proactive and as non-reactive as we can be so that you know we sitting inside this ecosystem every day um can do our best um to uh stay in front of investors and what they want um but it's a very quickly evolving landscape as i'm sure you know so michael i was running through your last report and looking at like what what are the the most popular products it seems i it seems to correct me if i'm wrong it seems like bitcoin is far and away the most popular 40 million in inflows 12-month trailing next was the ethereum trust with 9 million then you then you had the large cap fund and sort of everything else is is that generally how it goes it's like bitcoin number one it's if coming in number two and then it's kind of everything else or what's sort of the popularity of products been recently yeah i think what we found historically is that bitcoin was usually most investors first foray into the asset class um we have seen this the emergence of this kind of ethereum first or ethereum only investor which has been really interesting and then we've also seen a lot of investors pouring into the grayscale digital large cap fund because it gives them the ability to make a single investment and in doing so gain broad-based exposure to the asset class right it's it's a basket of large-cap digital currencies um that being said a lot of the other themes within our product lineup still resonate with investors quite a bit the idea of financial privacy and investors investing in zcash and horizon um investing in litecoin and stellar and xrp i mean i don't feel like at this point there's anything that's really an under loved product in the grayscale lineup but i think from your perspective it's easy to see why you may think that because they all have varying degrees of aum and sizes of aom rather but it's also not really an equal footing each of these products were launched at different times in different market conditions um so it's a little tough to say so you mentioned d5 being one of the the kind of the three pillars of uh narrative that you've seen increase this year what is the thesis for ether in particular is it sort of exposure to the upside of d5 or why are these institutional investors attracted to ether or even in particular eat their first investors why do they do that it's tough to say i mean i do think a lot of it is probably attributable to d5 um i think you know this year has been a really strong performance year for ethereum it's probably doubled um the return that bitcoin has had this year they both had very strong years and so a lot of that could be investors wanting to participate in in that robust return stream um but it's early to say it's really only in the past quarter or two that we really started to see that emerge and you know as as you're noting we put out this report on a quarterly basis to look at our investor base and flows and try and give investors actionable intelligence and um you know it's up on the grayscale website and we invite people to check it out um so i think for us it's gonna be one of those metrics that we continue to revisit you know you know quarter after quarter what's kind of the take on defy among these institutional investors what do they think about it um i think some of them are meeting it with a lot of optimism and excitement and others with skepticism um i think that for a lot of them if they if they spend some time in and around d5 they're starting to realize that you know we're not just talking about the digital currencies themselves but actually you know they're able to start sinking their teeth into actual applications of these technologies um which i think helps them to understand them more than just as you know digital versions of money as far as allocation goes you know we're we're always thinking through sort of allocation of like fiat versus crypto you know the different people and bankless take different approaches to that what does a particular a typical portfolio allocation look like for this group in terms of percentage of assets outside of crypto and percentage in crypto great question i think it really depends um i think it depends on risk tolerance time horizon but i'd say broadly the lower end of the spectrum is probably someone investing call it 20 to 40 basis points um so we're still talking about way under one percent of their portfolio i'd say our more aggressive portfolios are probably teetering on you know call it four or five maybe even six percent of someone's portfolio within that more aggressive group that five six uh percent plus group within crypto what does their portfolio look like usually and every day that passes more and more diversified um i think a lot of those portfolios are anchored by bitcoin but i think now what we're seeing is such a propensity of investors to not only appreciate the diversification benefits of having crypto exposure in their investment portfolios but even further benefits by having diversified exposure within their crypto portfolio or crypto holdings one thing that i really appreciate about what you guys are doing is you're basically starting to sort of mainstream this asset class and you recently put out a an investor study this one was bitcoin focused um but there there were some interesting takeaways from that one one that i took away was that more than half of u.s investors right now and i think this was a correct me if i'm wrong but a general survey of investors that you did more than half of us investors are interested in investing in bitcoin right now and that's up something like 20 from the previous year is that a surprising finding not for us i mean a lot of the so we published this study every year and we just published it um in the last week or so and um you know i think it's a lot of the things we're talking about um it's it's the resiliency of this asset class it's it's the asset classes ability to create diversified return streams for investors it's the staying power of the asset class you know a lot of people have called bitcoin dead or the digital currency asset class you know dead multiple times and it kind of just keeps getting challenged and coming back stronger so we're not surprised and if anything we're just encouraged by the propensity and interest of investors wanting to have digital asset exposure you know the other crazy takeaway i think for that uh from that investor study and i encourage folks to read it we will include a link to our show notes is that 63 of those that invested in crypto and bitcoin recently did so because of covet as a result of covet so the money printing meme it seems is actually showing in the data of investors taking action and going and buying some crypto due to covid is that is that surprising to you or is that kind of like shrug your shoulders yep we we thought that was the case and it's happening um the latter of the two people are are you know paying attention um to the world around them navigating um an investment environment that's that's very different um and uh you know crypto thankfully is now part of that another i think interesting topic of conversation within crypto is just the the sheer size of grayscale um perhaps relative to the supply of these crypto assets i mean you guys are getting pretty darn big how much bitcoin supply does grayscale hold today i'm not sure if you disclose that generally but oh we certainly do yeah we own um more than two and a half percent of the floating supply of bitcoin uh today inside the grayscale bitcoin trust product so it's not us it's our investors right um we're just the sponsor of the investment product two and a half percent and how much for uh ether do you know that top of mind or um off top of my head i want to say it's also about two [Music] um but that statistic i don't have as readily available so so grayscale's just like gobbling up these crypto assets it seems like um and another interesting stat that you put out is as a proportion of the amount of of mined bitcoin or mined ether uh the amount that gets essentially gobbled up by grayscale investors is is super high i think i read in 2020 in your report that of the new issuance of bitcoin grayscale inflows were basically 77 of that new issuance so it's like it's like grayscale's gobbling it up almost as fast as it's getting minted and awarded to miners that is that is uh that is true um that is definitely true and yes actually we the great scale ethereum trust does own over two percent of the outstanding ethereum float that's an insane number do you know of any other institution that owns more bitcoin than than not will not owns but holds more bitcoin than grayscale um i i do not that's well tip of the hat for that so congratulations on being being number one i know in ethereum we we like to look at our you know eth locked in defy metrics for you know how much you know a d5 protocol has locked up in its faults and i think on on the bitcoin side of things the uh the a bitcoin held by grayscale is the bitcoiner equivalent for that so congratulations on on being number one holder of bitcoin thank you i do have a flip side to that because i think as bullish as that is i think for asset appreciation and let's call it the institutionalization of these asset classes ethereum and in bitcoin there's also an element that hey like aren't are these crypto assets getting trapped in old finance getting trapped in legacy banking is that really what we want yeah i've commented before that sometimes if you think about buying crypto in an etf you're still on the traditional banking system rails you're almost stuck inside of a a brokerage jail so if you have eth in an etf you can't stake it you don't hold your own private keys you can't really use it in defy yourself and you can't send it to an eth address what's your reaction to to that criticism that hey like great scale could and these in general custody through some sort of crypto banking system could become too big and then crypto essentially loses the plot a little bit it becomes much more like the legacy financial system and we lose the ability to transfer and do this finance in a peer-to-peer way do you think that argument has some merit it's certainly not our intention um i think rather the role we play in who we are as an actor i think we are certainly out there as really big advocates of this asset class um i think we are hopefully viewed as a as a positive actor right that i think in the absence of our offerings you would not be having as many people or as many institutions or investors getting into crypto right a lot of these investors are coming to grayscale because they can't buy and hold crypto directly and so the grayscale solution really is that entree for them into the asset class that if it wasn't there would not be drawing them into kind of either what digital currency exposure can do to their portfolios or help them kind of unpack the ways in which we we think that digital currencies as a technology are gonna kind of transform um a lot of the systems um and things around us but at the same time you know those who may have a have a gripe with our you know taking bitcoin out of circulation and putting it in a financial product or taking ethereum out of circulation putting in a financial product to that i would say it's really kind of evidence of where we are in the life cycle of this asset class if it was that much easier and it is becoming orders of magnitude easier for folks to access this this directly um then you know what we're seeing and why grayscale is in the position it is is because by and large digital currencies exist outside of the traditional financial system and for a lot of people aren't as accessible as they'd like them to be it's not as easy as buying a stock or a bond or an etf if you want to buy and hold bitcoin and if you lose a private key with bitcoin you don't have a reset button or a 1-800 number to to call or you know things like that um so you know i think it's um certainly a role that we're excited to be playing we want to provide educational content we want to be providing actionable intelligence to investors but i think the role that we've you know come to assume within this community is one of wanting to grow the asset class together with other industry participants and uh we're just excited um of kind of where we are and again we just feel like we're just getting started could you do things like a staked eath product inside of a trust or maybe at some point when that cc lets us an etf or any other sort of yield bearing crypto asset products it's it's all possible i'd say at any one time we probably maintain call it 20 to 30 different product ideas of things that we'd like to uh bring to the market it's really just that balance between you know where we're finding opportunities what's permissible what fits into the legal and operational frameworks that we want to make sure that we're adhering to to bring our investors the best products we can um and make them actionable and trustworthy for them and at the same time hearing from investors where they're interested in putting exposure on and what's important to them and building out their portfolios speaking of going mainstream with investors you guys have put together a series of pretty brilliant uh ad campaigns recently can you tell us a bit about that and the reaction from them yeah so you know i think you know advertising is one of those um areas that we have a lot of fun with um as a team and it's a really collaborative effort um most of 2019 was characterized by our drop gold campaign um in which we had a national advertising campaign you know that aired on television and across you know social media platforms and display ads and banner ads and you know pretty much everywhere you could possibly think of where we are you know part of a now very solidified portion in a big portion of the investment community that believes that digital currencies um like bitcoin are in fact the the next inflation hedge or the next store of value or have in fact emerged now as a digital gold or a digital inflation you know hedge um and so this whole idea of younger generations waking up from i guess these these old or antiquated or preconceived notions that somehow you know gold is is going to be the asset that does that in their portfolios going forward and we tend to say well this is a wake-up call there are other things that have now emerged that you can use in your portfolio as a tool besides gold to achieve those outcomes and we believe that with about 68 trillion and again 68 trillion dollars moving from older generations down to younger generations over the uh over the next 25 years we believe that today the way a lot of those assets are postured in things like gold will as they move in are passed down to younger generations get reallocated and it's not to say and again i want to be clear we're not saying 68 trillion dollars is moving into bitcoin or digital currency but we'd be hard-pressed to believe that that younger generation of investors is going to be investing in assets like gold of which they have no tangible experience doesn't really resonate with them and it's a generation that grew up on instagram venmo and uh airline points and credit card points right this is the generation that is going to grow up on bitcoin um in digital currencies and so we are paying attention to and are trying to create a wake-up call that investors should be looking to where where the you know skating to where the puck is going right if that's how investment preferences are going to change over time um and so you know that is a idea that we're really you know still very enthused about and i'd say over the lot of course of a lot of 2020 um we've had a history of money campaign um which we're also really excited about which i think for a lot of investors has helped them to realize that we believe that digital currency very well may be the next stop on the train if you will in the evolution of money and so we have a national television commercial now that goes all the way back to rocks and salt and animal skins and you know every single form that money has taken over the course of time and eventually gets you to paper money um which is you know for the most part a foregone conclusion at this point and now kind of helping people to understand that you know perhaps digital currencies are the next evolut next step in the evolution of money and you know giving again that kind of that call to action to wake up and understand what this is and make sure you're paying attention to this michael i want to thank you for your time and coming on the bankless podcast and there's nothing that gets me more excited and more bullish about this industry than the national ad campaign that talks about the merits of bitcoin and crypto so tip of the hat for leading that charge i want to finish up with this one last question what's greyscale's next move where are you guys going to expand um i think probably on the product front um and i'll have to come back and talk to you guys more about it but um we have 10 products today and we're seeing some really interesting opportunities and we are hearing from investors about certain opportunities they want to be able to get exposure to and um you know i think we're uh we're always hard at work at hq um thinking about additional products to launch and expanding our product family and um i'm excited that we'll be doing some of that in the months to come michael want to thank you again for joining us and coming in front of the bankless nation talking about these things it's been a pleasure thank you thanks for having me guys this is great awesome bankless nation some action items today we will include these in your show notes uh you should read the report that grayscale put out the bitcoin investor study to see some of those specific metrics we were talking about also number two if you have a fidelity account a schwab account go take a look at gbtc and ethy in in the portfolio and compare them to nav price we'll include some links where you can do that finally five star reviews david how are we doing on five star reviews with bankless we can always do a better with five-star reviews can't we ryan five-star reviews get gets bank-less podcasts to the front of the itunes investing and finance charge which we are already in the top 100 but we want to be in the top 10 by the time that bitcoin and ethereum go completely mainstream and so we need your five star reviews to help get that done absolutely guys of course risks and disclaimers none of this today was financial advice ethan's risky bitcoin is risky crypto is risky and certainly when you buy them in grayscale products they can be volatile and risky as well as always you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot [Music]
