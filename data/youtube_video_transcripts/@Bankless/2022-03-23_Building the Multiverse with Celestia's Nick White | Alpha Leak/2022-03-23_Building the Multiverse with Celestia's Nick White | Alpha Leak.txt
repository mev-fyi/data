what celestia enables again is experiment more experimentation like it'll be it'll increase the speed at which people can spin up new blockchains and try new things and experiment which i think will overall increase the amount of innovation in the space hey banquets nation welcome to this edition of alpha league alpha link is actually just meet the nation rebranded into a little bit more of an exciting name so this is where we go and dive deep into various projects that catch my attention around in the crypto sphere today we are talking to nick white from celestia and celestia is a layer one blockchain that's living inside of the modular blockchain paradigm so celestia and all the people behind it i think are just uh very committed to this whole modular blockchain thesis which both me and ryan are definitely aligned on we think that the long-term conclusion of this cryptocurrency space however it may be will be modular ethereum or if or a different shame like perhaps celestia so let it be known that we are not ethmaxis uh we're actually modular blockchain maxies which is why we're talking to nick from the celestia team here today i've already kind of given the pitch for celestia it's a it's even more modular than ethereum is in its current shape and so nick does a fantastic job walking us all the way through the design architecture of celestia its differences and similarities to ethereum what it's optimized for how it's going to do cross-chain multi-chain stuff how consensus works all of that deals so it's relatively technical of a show but if you are here to learn about celestia this is going to be the perfect show for you and so let's go ahead and get right into this alpha league episode with nick white of celestia right after we talk about some of these

nick white who is the ceo of celestia labs nick welcome to the show i'm excited to get into everything about celestia today thanks david excited to be here so let's go ahead and dive right in i think bankless listeners will already be familiar with the modular blockchain thesis and so this is kind of where that conversation starts nick what is celestia at the highest level celestia is the first modular blockchain network so it kind of was the the origin of this modular blockchain paradigm in which you separate the two core functions of what typical monolithic blockchains that's bitcoin ethereum well the original ethereum and salon and all the other l1s do which is consensus and execution so basically celestia's core insight is that you can split those two functions apart into separate layers and so celestia focuses on the consensus part so it's the consensus and data availability layer so data availability is another topic that we can dive into but basically it's another core primitive that is crucial for building you know decentralized applications okay so i think we should probably start with like definitions and mental models and just to allow the listeners to get up to speed splitting the blockchain between execution and consensus let's dive into each one of those uh and we'll take them apart separately uh consensus what are we talking about this proof of work proves the stake what are we talking about with the consensus side of a blockchain yeah so consensus is basically the mechanism by which you all the participants in the network agree on the order of transactions so when like a block for example has consensus on it that means that it's now placed in a certain order among all the other blocks so once a block has consensus in theory it should never be reorganized like it should always be in that place like that that that block height essentially and all the transactions in that block are now ordered so with that like once you have consensus every network has the same view of reality everyone has the same view of history of events so that's that's like how you prevent things like double spend like that's how you know basically what what has happened one single shared source of truth that doesn't have active the blockchain is not forked there are two competing versions of the truth there's everyone exactly come to terms on the same protocol the same data and everyone has strong assurances that they are uh on the same page as everyone else exactly everyone's looking at the same thing everyone's in agreement like this is the reality this is the canonical chain cool all right okay so that's consensus and then execution let's get if you could just divine execution for the listeners yeah so execution is perhaps the more interesting part of it right execution is where those transactions that history gets interpreted right so there's there's something that you call a state transition function which basically defines you know this is like how you interpret a transaction and this is like how what the effect of that transaction is so for example in bitcoin you know the state machine is pretty simple it's just basically like okay well this is this uh person this that's signing this actually have the right to spend this utxo and if so then like we'll move the balance to this new uh address essentially but in you know ethereum obviously got way more interesting where we have a full you know turing complete uh sort of like vm as the state transition function so that's like how applications are born is basically like okay now this transaction interacts with a smart contract and it executes this trade or you know it votes on this like governance proposal or whatever it is basically um execution is where you know the the activity is like without execution there's really no point you just basically have this ledger but there's no like you know effect of that ledger so execution is is like applications smart contracts and all the stuff that end users end up interacting with correct me if i'm wrong but execution another way to explain execution is just like uh execution is what goes from like block one to block one plus or block n as in any number uh to n plus one right it's the plus it's the plus side of that part because we have to actually make changes and when we say we're making changes to those ledgers we actually have to execute changes uh and yeah kind of like how you said with bitcoin the math the math for bitcoin is very simple it's just basically checks the balance of the sending address and then if the balance is larger than the amount that's being sent then it says yes execute that and then like you said with ethereum we're getting into code uh the vm is a virtual machine but basically it's just computation at this point and it's just like a bunch of smart contracts or just a bunch of rules to execute upon and that's and if you follow the rules and it gets verified by all the node operators you're allowed to go from block n to n plus one and that's execution uh and so previously and and mostly still actually we're in this paradigm where both consensus and execution are done by the same parties uh and i think the modular blockchain thesis is that we actually can separate out those two parties into two different into two different groups and allow these resources to be managed separately how does um where does the conversation with celestia begin how how what how does celestia actually modulize these things yeah that's a really good question but i i want to i guess like double uh tap into this concept of separating i like the execution and the state being updated because in a typical blockchain what happens is every time there's a new block right it doesn't just contain the transactions in that block there's also what you call a state route which is basically a commitment to these transactions that i'm including this is the new state that they create and so both of those things every time a new block is mined in a monolithic chain both the transactions and the new state are included in that block so in celestia like basically all it is it's it well the original paper that kind of inspired the project was called lazy ledger and the reason it was called lazyledger is because celestia is a lazy blockchain so it does less it actually doesn't even interpret it doesn't even look at the transaction data that people are dumping into it it just mercalizes it and it has a special kind of scheme of of building the block that enables something called data availability sampling which makes it really really scalable because one of the one of the reasons that you there are a few different reasons why you want to separate consensus from execution so the first one is that you know in a blockchain where it's monolithic there is only really one state transition function that you can implement so you can either you know stuck with bitcoin like you can't run like the evm on the bitcoin blockchain right but also like you know on on ethereum you can only really uh interact with ethereum uh through the evm right there the ethereum blockchain doesn't run other forms of execution so by separating those two things you can actually have a blockchain where the execution like you can define different kinds of execution environments so you're not just locked into the evm or let's say salona c level like you can define that after the fact on layer two so that's that's one of the big ones the other big one is that you get more scalability and that's kind of where this whole data availability problem uh comes in okay yeah so we'll take those one one at a time we'll we'll get into the data availability availability part later i want to go back to the execution side so the evm is ethereum's execution environment right right so like that that's the execution environment is like this is where the execution happens it's all the transactions are contained inside the evm and what you're saying is that celestia allows that part to be swapped in or out for any other execution environment would it be fair to say that every single blockchain has to have an execution environment in it somewhere like it has to have execution and so celestia allows you to pick and choose what your execution environment is is this am i using the right words yeah exactly so i mean you could even think of you know i mean i guess i wouldn't call i wouldn't call bitcoin state transition function necessarily an execution environment because that execution environment kind of implies that there's sort of like computation sort of like rich stateful kind of like like like the evm like a train complete like programming environment um but yeah basically the execution environment is exactly what you said um and so yeah celestia frees up developers it makes it more flexible right because now let's say either it could be as simple as like actually i do want to build an evm but i actually want to add in a new uh pre-compile or i want to remove this one function like for example like self-destruct which can can cause a lot of problems and and and make things more difficult you could you could actually use the avm but just you know make some small modifications for your application so it could be better for dfi or nfts or you can just completely experiment like i i actually believe in the celestia team believes that innovation in execution environments has been held back in blockchain artificially because of this sort of monolithic paradigm the fact that if i wanted to build a new experiment with a new execution environment i had to build an entirely new blockchain right and that the bootstrapping cost of doing that is so high that it's kind of prevented people from trying things out so in the same way like before ethereum there's actually a lot of parallels here so before ethereum you know bitcoin proved that you could build a decentralized application for the first time so people are like oh this is so cool we could do lots of stuff but because there was no general purpose blockchain every time you wanted to build a new decentralized application you had to spin up an entirely new blockchain but then when ethereum came along and said hey we're going to build a general purpose blockchain on which you can build a decentralized application without building a new blockchain so celestia takes that one step further and makes it so that you can do the same thing but for the execution environment itself so i can build a new blockchain for all intents and purposes without actually building a new consensus network so that's that's really like the key part there okay i really like that that tells a great story so first we have bitcoin and we have the first decentralized application on the internet and then like oh cool we have the the it's like on the uh on the spectrum of dimensions we're at like 1d right like we're a dot it's like we can we have like this one thing hello world which is said yeah hello world we can send bitcoins around that's all we got and then ethereum was like all right well we can either make more blockchains and make more dots or we can or we can have a grow in a whole entire different dimension and just allow any blockchain to have any application and that is the what and so we added a an evm to bitcoin right and created ethereum right we added an execution environment to bitcoin and then instead of having to make many many many dots we go from a dot to a line uh and so what you're saying with celestia is that you uh buy but then but then uh ethereum's constraint is the evm so where bitcoin's constraint was that it can only move the bitcoins around ethereum is constrained it is constrained by it uh can only do stuff in d5 inside of the evm and then celestia is saying like okay we can go from a line to a three-dimensional shape 3d and by saying like well we can remove the constraint of the evm and allow for any execution environment to come and exist on celestia is this right exactly yeah exactly it's almost like you know the evm only speaks one language and then a modular chain like celestia is multilingual like you can you can load any language and speak any language that you choose i love that so how though you say okay you said load any language my next question was so ethereum uses the evm because like that's just the language that it uses and it enforces it checks all of the rules of the blocks using the evm like the evm is the police it's the enforcement of the chain it checks all the rules how does if if celestia is completely modular with this execution environment how does it know what rules to check that's a really really good question and that is where layer two constructions like roll-ups come in so basically what what roll-ups are and what l2s are is a way in which you enforce so like let's let's take a step back like whenever a on a monolithic chain whenever transactions or a new block are mined they are made sure that they're valid first and foremost by the miners or the the validators like the proof of stake validators right so that's one way in theory everyone wants a full node and they they re-verify for themselves but also the the miners are the ones enforcing the validity right now in celestia anyone can submit a transaction and the transaction doesn't even need to be valid because in celestia's eyes there's no such thing as a valid or invalid transaction it's all just data so but then that of course leads to your question so how do you determine what a valid transaction is or who is enforcing the execution the validity of the state transitions that are happening on celestia and so the answer that is l2 construction so roll-ups are a really new uh and interesting technology that basically make it possible for um someone to trust not without having to re-execute transactions or re-execute a block to know that that block is valid so in short it's it's either a validity proof which is where zero knowledge roll-ups uh sort of how they enforce validity or it's a fraud proof which is basically how optimistic roll-ups um enforce the validity of blocks and transactions so when we say that celestia is modular in terms of its like execution like you can put any execution environment on top of celestia are we really talking about like the layer twos are the actual modular component of the execution environment as in like this layer two uses the evm and this layer two uses starkware's cairo or whatever and so that's the actual part that is modular yeah exactly so you can kind of think you know what we're doing is we're decomposing the typical monolithic blockchain into components so celestia is the the sort of base level component sort of like the l1 component which is consensus which orders the data and data availability and then the other component the execution layer component is the rollups so when i say any execution or you can run any execution environment what i mean is that there's no like the roll-ups themselves define their own execution that they run on top of celestia okay and then we when you said that celestia doesn't isn't aware of anything like an invalid or invalid transaction that's because it just is a place for the data of the roll-up to be uh deposited into like the data celestia just receives the data from the roll-up yeah exactly so maybe we should go a little bit deeper into how roll-ups work so basically a roll-up is for most intensive purposes just like actually a blockchain so it's this almost analogous to a normal blockchain where but instead of having a validator set and instead of like doing their own consensus there there are roll-up operators and they so they collect transactions from all the users they put roll them up into a block they basically create a block and they they uh compute what the next state is so that they do the like the validation of that block and then they post that block onto another blockchain that is actually doing the consensus and also data availability so um i guess like the the the roll-up data uh is is itself like its own block within a block does that make sense and so but celestia just allows anyone to post data there so we don't you know we don't we're not aware i mean we're aware of the fact that the people are putting data there but we don't actually interpret it or look at it we don't say like okay this you know in a monolithic chain if i if i try to send an invalid transaction to ethereum it never ends up on the chain because it's it's the the miners discard it they're like oh well you don't have the right to you know withdraw this money or to spend this money or whatever so it never goes into the chain is what i'm saying is that in celestia's case there is no interpretation there is no valid or invalid so any all transactions get posted there so how do all the rollups then have shared state and assets right so like that with ethereum because you do have like the invalid or valid transactions right like it also has like native tokens the native token native tokens on the layer one and it goes from one execution environment on a roll up down to the l1 and then across the l1 and up to a different roll up how can you how does celestia manage that if it doesn't have any rules at the l1 how do you have shared state between all the rollouts really really good question so actually so this gets into so we already talked about the consensus and data availability layer which is let's say celestia um and the execution layer which is a roll-up there's also another component that i think will be very important in the modular blockchain stack and that is what we call a settlement layer so in the model of ethereum right an ethereum based rollup ethereum acts as the consensus layer the data availability layer and a settlement layer and then the ethereum roll ups act as execution layers and so to to explain a bit more about what a settlement layer is it's basically a coordination mechanism between different roll-ups so like the it's like a bridge essentially so the when you when you deposit an asset from ethereum into a roll-up and you're bonding it into like a contract at the l1 and then that contract listens for the state updates from the roll-up um but i guess like the the the good thing about a settlement layer is that if it's kind of like in a multi-chain world right like let's talk about like cosmos as an example there is no you know people thought talked about cosmos hub being sort of the central spoke right in which all liquidity can pass so rather than having all every chain talk to every other chain in a very very like you know chaotic kind of like topology there would be like this ordered system where there's like one canonical spot that everyone kind of relays to to get between each other so that's kind of what a settlement layer is it's sort of like this bridge it also in a sense custody's assets um and it helps to make it easier for those roll-ups to talk to each other but you don't actually need like the settlement layer is not fundamental to the security of these roll-ups in fact you know these like roll-ups can actually have uh bridges with each other directly they don't have to go through for example the ethereum as a settlement layer it's like it's like a nice to have if that makes sense okay okay and so the plan for like an asset on roll up a to go to roll up b if the both of these roll-ups settle on celestia is to it's up to their own it's up to those two roll-ups to establish communication between them rather than having to rely on on celestia as the settlement layer yeah basically so well i think the way to think about it is that celestia doesn't enshrine a settlement layer so like an ethereum i mean it's debatable if you would call like the ethereum like l1 evm an enshrined settlement layer because rollups on ethereum can also just connect to each other um they're on their own independently of that but in celestia there is no enshrined sediment layer but you can build a settlement layer on top of celestia as a rollup so like settlement assignment layer is basically just a special case of an execution layer it's an execution layer that's just it's not really meant to do any fancy kind of execution it's just meant to verify state transitions of other rollups and kind of like you know facilitate the movement of funds between places what would you say is the advantage of that design structure the advantage is basically that um to me you kind of have well there's a few so one is as we just as we talked about like it adds order like we have we imagine a world where you know it's not just you know hundreds of blockchains not just thousands but in the future long-term future millions of blockchains right and when you have that level of complexity and emergence you you're gonna need some more some organization and so i think settlement layers act as like a way in which like coordination mechanisms between all these different state spaces so that they can easily route funds to each other like rather than you know me having to create you know run like 100 clients to all the different other chains that i want to talk to i just run one client to the the settlement layer and every other chain that is connected to that settlement layer is also just one hop away so it's almost like a kind of like a i don't know like a network kind of thing like you you're able to like the topography of the network gets it's more organized the other thing that's very important is that fungibility in a multi-chain world becomes really challenging because depending like the the fungibility of an asset is path dependent so it depends on how you bridged like let's say i took a usdc from chain a and bridge it to chain b and then to change c that uscc is actually different than if i took it from chain a to chain d and then to chain c so like but if you routed it through a common settlement layer that usdc then can if it originates at the same settlement layer then it becomes fungible across that sort of like universe so i think that's that's a really important feature for for settlement and also actually last the last point about why solomon's important is that um if i'm running a client the settlement layer verifies the state transitions of all these other rollups so if i'm a user and i don't like i i want to have i want to be trust minimized i want to like make sure that all the um the state of all the the rollups that i'm using are is legit like no one's like pulling a fast one on me which is key to decentralization then i instead of having to run 100 clients of all every different rollup i could just run a client of that one settlement layer and that sentiment layer will tell me the state of all these other rollups so it also kind of reduces the amount of overhead that i need to verify other chains so this is all talking about the advantages of having just like a single shared source of truth right like this is like you have this one place everyone can look at me like all right here's where here's what the state is but i'm having a hard time differentiating that between like that and the ethereum l1 because isn't that also what the ethereum l1 does yeah so i mean like the ethereum l1 i think in this model um is a settlement layer in the sense but the thing is so why okay so to i think maybe you're touching on two things why not have settlement on the l1 itself uh well one of the main reasons is that the settlement layer is this it actually reduces it makes it harder to make that layer one truss minimize so like in celestia we have made the l1 that there is execution on the l1 it is minimal minimal minimal it is like bitcoin it's basically just sending and receiving funds and staking them that's it and the reason that we did that is that it incurs like okay so if i'm a roll up and i want to use an l1 to post my data there i actually have to take an interest in the validity of that chain for my own security so so with celestia with minimal execution it incurs minimal overhead on the roll-ups that use it if that makes sense so that that's like i think a really key advantage so um that's why we have chosen to remove as much execution as possible from l1 and then uh there was another point on this that i i wanted to talk about but i'm kind of blanking on what it was maybe it'll come back to me yeah probably probably probably will when you said it'll the roll-up will have the minimum overhead when it posts to celestia because celestia has reduced it minimize the amount of execution it needs to do at the l1 is this related to like gas fees because i know like i know that the ethereum of gas fees actually does impact the layer two gas fees uh and a large part of that is because there actually is computation that happens at the l1 that's why we have that's why i have high gas prices is that the same conversation that's part of it although if you um you know i know that like for example in the new ethereum world map as i understand they're they're going to actually separate fees for data availability space and execution on like gas basically on that one so it's possible to do that but but but you're right that like it it it doesn't and that's why ethereum is doing that they don't want to conflate these two resources so this is like this topic of resource pricing which um john adler uh gave a talk on in at ecc last year which basically is like you know and this is part of the modules of blockchain paradigm is the like pricing there's different resources that need to be consumed to build a decentralized application one resource is execution like you know i want i want to be in the chain of this order like i want to have priority right of my transaction that's a that's a big one and then another one is just straight up block space like i want to be i want i need block space i need data i need data to be made available so those are two different kind of resources and in celestia it's purely data availability that's that is the resource basically that we are selling or providing as a service and then the the layer twos the roll-ups will have will have their own probably have their own token or their own fee model which is all about execution which is about like priority in this queue to like i want to be execute i want my transaction to get executed if that makes sense um but but yeah we can go deeper into that okay yeah um with so if it's it's an l1 that doesn't have an execution layer baked into it in the same way that ethereum does does it have its own native token then it does yeah so it it's a proof-of-stake network and so the you know we need that for the crypto economic security of you know ordering guaranteeing the that the blocks will not be reorganized they won't be reverted which is critical to all the l2s building on top so it's critical for that and then the token is also used in the fee market so there's you know there's a scarce resource which is block space it's like and and every roll up well basically instead of an ethereum where you pay gas to like you know have space on the ethereum computer you just pay you pay in the celestia token to have space in the in the celestia block right because like i want my block for my rollout to be included well i have to pay and it basically will be a fee market um proportioned by the like the number of bytes of block space that you want to take up okay and so that doesn't seem all that different from ethereum in the sense yeah very similar there's just like there's demand for block space when demand goes up prices go up yeah well so but there's a key difference and this is maybe a good good time to transition into data availability sampling so one of the key reasons why you want to remove execution from l1 is that one of the one of the bottlenecks for scaling any chain is that the full nodes of the network have to re-verify or like recompute every transaction they have to recompute every state transition and make sure that it's legit before they accept a block so what that creates is this dynamic where you can only be as fast you only do as many transactions as the slowest person right the slowest full node right so all of a sudden you can only you you reach this maximum amount of scaling and you can't go past that unless you basically do what solona did and said hey everyone just has to upgrade their machine right but then then you run into centralization because then all of a sudden hey i just have a laptop all of a sudden i can't run a full node i'm no longer like a first first-class citizen of this network now i have to delegate my trust to i don't know some someone with more more like money than me basically so we want to avoid that situation so when you remove execution from the layer one all of a sudden you remove that constraint because what you can do is now instead of re-executing transactions you're just verifying that the block data is available and it's a very nuanced thing but basically for all l2 security you need to make sure that the transactions were published to the network that someone out there if they wanted to could download them at that point in time so um and and you can verify that normally you'd have to download the whole block yourself to make sure that all the data is actually there but with these data availability sampling schemes you can verify that a massive block was available with by only downloading a very very small subset of the entire data so all of a sudden you remove this constraint where like you know it used to be every node and the network had to download the full block now every node in the network just has to sample you know maybe a few kilobytes of data and all of a sudden they they have they have security that the whole block data is available so it it increases like in orders of magnitude the amount of like the size of the blocks that you can create in the network still in a trust minimized way and this sounds a lot like sharding it is it is like sharding actually it's a very good point so in sharding you you try you build a system where there's a bunch of different blockchains running in parallel but they're all sort of secured by like this sort of like shuffling of validators so like all that like the the security is uniform so and the point is that each node rather than having to verify the whole network and every single chain they just verify their one chain so it is similar to that but in charting you a the like you can corrupt each like sub shard committee which is like i think very very feasible attack that you can do the other thing is that you're still monolithic in the sense that each chart is still executing uh every transaction so in celestia it is similar in that like you reduce the the resource requirements for the nodes and network um but it is it is actually quite quite different in the end um you do end up like you can think of um roll-ups in a modular blockchain as sort of like the shards in in in a sharded model except the difference is again in a starter blockchain you can only pretty much run that one execution environment and you can't just spin up shards or spin down shards and in a modular blockchain you can you can have there is no limit to the number of shards that you can have you can have any kind of execution it's like way way more flexible the layer two era is upon us ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need l2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with across you don't have to worry about the long wait times

should go thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so you've got some money but how are you gonna use it you want to spend me shopping now bro when you know you should be saving you'll never buy a house at this rate but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind with inquiring minds a new world awaits [Music] set yourself free with completely flexible self-repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile seize the power of alchemix allowing you to spend and save at the same time leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance you're only dead his time what was once inconceivable is now within your grasp [Music] i think the perhaps a more correct word was parallelization uh where like uh with celestia what you guys are paralyzing is data availability by not having to have every single node download every single block but just some of the data and there's because there's many many nodes and they're all doing the same sort of thing other significant overlap in the data that's being downloaded so you have redundancy and assurances that all the data is actually there and the way that you have these assurances is through sampling you sample like random bits of data make sure it's all there if it's all there you have assurances that all the rest of the data is there but all that data is actually split among many many many many nodes uh allowing lighter work for each individual node but a heavier total summation of all the nodes altogether yeah absolutely i mean we can go into the exact mechanism if you want it's pretty technical but you can think of it as like strength in numbers it's like everyone's pitching in everyone's sampling yeah and yeah exactly and then by that sort of like group effort everyone becomes secure um okay so does the celestial blockchain in terms of like total available block space does it have like is is with all these innovations that we're talking about especially with data available availability sampling does it give celestia the ability to have like more block space because like ethereum's biggest constraint is that it's blocks place l on the l1 is really really limited i would imagine like celestia doesn't doesn't have like it's not like the solana type level of scale where it's basically like infinite level block space but does it get tailwinds or just like perks uh from this model to have more available block space at the l1 that's a really good question in fact this is why i think i forgot to like follow up but we were talking about fees right and you're saying that in ethereum the more demand there is for blockchain space the more the fees go up and so the really key thing about data availability sampling is that there is no limit well okay there is a there is probably a theoretical limit but for all intents and purposes for the current scale of like blockchain util utilization like there is almost there there's no limit to the box size like you can keep increasing it with the number of nodes in the network so more node sampling means you can safely increase the block size so and and if you if you assume that the more people that are using the network the more nodes there are in the network that means that the more users there are the bigger the block size gets so as there's more demand the block size increases so this the fees actually stay constant so like there's an aggregate more demand for the token being spent to pay for that box base but the fee per user or per byte of data to use the block is the same so it's it's like a fundamentally new sort of paradigm in terms of like the fees every monolithic chain as more users come on inherently because of the design the fees have to increase um yeah but we can talk about the limits of scaling uh or sort of the scalability properties that's interesting yeah so the the cool the cool thing is that when the more users are paying more fees to the chain the block size increases at some function uh related to the level of new fees being paid so the fees is it hard-coded in that like the user just always pays the same exact fee or is it like flexible like ethereum's gas gas markets yeah so i i want to be clear so like uh it is just a fee market but uh and and they will have to actually oh right right right okay decide to increase the the block size so like okay um it sounds like it's over long terms it's it's yeah over long term so it's not like it's not like oh well from one block to the next it's gonna like scale up or scale down or whatever it's more like okay well now we're realizing we have more users and most of the block space is filled so now we're going to increase the block size um so that's kind of the capacity to increase the block size because you have extra fees being collected by the use so you have extra incentives to people for people to spin up more nodes no so um it's a little bit different so the but the so there's the validator nodes who are the ones who are earning block rewards but then they're the and and they are also sampling and downloading the data so they're securing the network but there's also um just the end users who are sampling because they're running what we call a light node so the more the more people using the network the more sampling is going on and therefore the bigger block size you can get so the fee the fee part doesn't actually incentivize the increase in in block size it doesn't increase the number of people sampling per se okay okay uh then what is the incentive to spin up more nodes to increase the block size so the the there's a few different things so first of all the more the more roll-ups that are being run they're they're running nodes right and they're sampling and they're doing everything and then all the clients of those rollups if they want to be trust media so we assume that users of chains want to have full security and be trust minimized which i think they do that's the world i want to live in is where i am i'm not just like pinging in fuhrer to know what the state of ethereum is i want to know myself directly then every user will be running and it will be feasible because of validity proofs fraud proofs and data availability sampling for every user on their phone for example to be running a full node then like more users of these products equals more sampling in aggregate so that's kind of the the base assumption there the base assumption is that it just becomes more and more feasible to uh contribute resources to the network well well the main assumption is that end users want to have want to be secure if they want to be secure then they will run the like a sampling node and the reason so i think one of the reasons why people don't run i mean how many people do we actually know that actually running ethereum full node not very many because it's a quite technical b it's kind of expensive right um but in in the celestial model in a modular blockchain model one of the things that we want to do is democratize the ability for people to run full nodes so like for example an ethereum to run a full node in theory it's like a laptop i don't know if that's really feasible anymore but that was sort of like the target right um and solana it's like a you know mega power like cloud machine with a gigabit internet um but in celestia we want to target and like modules blockchains we can target something like much more uh broadly accessible like a smartphone because it's actually feasible because of the way that the technology works so zooming out and looking at celestia holistically is this particular construction like designed for something like ethereum i think in my mind is very much designed for defy like uh hard money assets tokens uh high security because of high value transfers is this change in how celestia's design change what it's kind of optimized for or is it is it the goal definitely something like d5 nfts kind of all the stuff that we know of today it's basically um like as general purpose as any layer one blockchain can get so it can be used for any application um i would say that the the real the raison d'etre for celestia is to create plentiful box plentiful trust minimize block space that any developer or community whoever can leverage to build their own blockchain and their own decentralized application so i wouldn't say that it's specific for any particular thing i think what celestia enables again is experiment more experimentation like it'll be it'll increase the speed at which people can spin up new blockchains and try new things and experiment which i think will overall increase the amount of innovation in the space and then i i also think that you know celestia is really this place that that makes it easier for people to have access to the to their own blockchain computer it's like before like let's say i don't know i i'm i'm someone uh who just like it's a huge overhead to to deploy my own blockchain and if i wanted to have that level of sovereignty and control over my own decentralized computer i have to pay a high price and so i think celestia brings that price down significantly um and so yeah we just wanna we wanna democratize access to block space maybe that's that's the best way to put it uh are there any other components or aspects of celestia that we haven't touched on yet a good question i i would talk about um two two things one is um celestiums so we released a blog post maybe a month ago that um talks about this idea where we want to help ethereum roll-ups scale so um as you might be aware like as of now the theory like call data on ethereum is still quite expensive so even though these rollups have massive increases in scalability the fact that they post their data back to ethereum main chain makes it kind of expensive like still more expensive than i think these rollouts would like to be and if adoption continues then that price will only go up right because ethereum's block space is still limited so celestia is trying to build a solution for that problem so what we do what we've done is we're building a bridge that um it will allow ethereum roll-ups they will still settle to ethereum so they post their state updates to the ethereum evm but they will post their transaction data that needs to be made available for their security to celestia and then the celestia validators will attest to that data being available and if they lie it's a slashable offense so it's actually crypto crypto economic guarantees and then that attestation gets relayed to ethereum so that the the contracts the roll-up contracts can actually verify them so it it's a way of basically being this sort of like off uh ethereum can offload some of this data availability need to to celestia so we can help the ethereum community scale in in the time being and for uh this is called a validium right on the ethereum yeah well yeah so so validium yeah so that's why we call it celestium because basically it's like a portmanteau of celestia and volidium and that so volidium is a zero knowledge roll-up where rather than posting the data on chain you post it off-chain but the problem is that a lot of these validiums today is were they really not decentralized they use what uh often are called data availability committees and so and that's just basically like a multi-sig and we all know multi-stakes are really not that secure so celestia is like a a much more decentralized version of that with actual crypto economic guarantees like it's a slashable offense so we think of them as different like an upgrade above the lydiums so that's why we call them celestiums so with a valydium like in theory you could just place that data on aws right and because you still have the execution of the assets that get settled on ethereum the assets are safe but then there's data that's relevant that's needed that um could go in theory just on like aws right but what celestia is doing correct me if i'm wrong but what celestia is doing is like well you don't have to put on aws you could just put it on celestia instead and like retain some of those cryptoeconomic assurances that we all know and love in this industry is that all right kind of yeah so what you need right for the security of all these um layer two constructions is data availability and so what that is is not it's different than storage so this like it's something that you know a lot of people get hung up on when they're first learning about data availability it's very understandable because it's a nuanced concept and that the term data availability sounds a lot like oh well you got to make it available you just like store it somewhere right but it's different it's not that you need to store the data is that you need a guarantee that the data is public information that anyone can download so you know just the validator telling me hey well don't worry i uploaded the data to aws doesn't give me that guarantee because they can just delete it like or they didn't even necessarily release it they're the only ones who know it it's it's about information dispersal it's like multiple people know what this data is that's what you need and so um celestia actually can give you like a a guarantee of that whereas other off-chain data availability mechanisms don't really give you very strong security on that that's the key difference okay so this next question comes from the uh the eth maxi camp of the world uh what about the idea that uh celestia is just trying to vampire attack all the ethereum roll-ups trying to get uh all the ethereum roll-ups to settle their uh data on celestia and then eventually uh tries to just convince the the roll-ups to come over to celestia that's a really good question so first of all uh ironically actually we never thought that this would be a use case um like we were very dismissive of it because we didn't believe because okay because what happens when you build a um a validium or when you start when you settle if you're a roll-up and you're putting your data on celestia now your your minimum threshold of security is actually now the celestial blockchain right so like you're no longer really a rollup in the sense that you're no longer that's the same security level as ethereum right because that's the whole point of a roll-up so that's why we were always kind of like really are people gonna want to do this but then when we looked into it and we saw how desperate the need was and the fact that people were using these data availability committees were like actually we can do better than that um but frankly like if i were an ethereum rollup and i were settling to ethereum and ethereum actually had plentiful block space then i wouldn't use celestia like there is no reason to do that like you know if you're if all your assets and your users are coming from the ethereum chain and the ethereum ecosystem then you should stay there so it's not i don't think it works as a as a vampire attack for that reason and that's really not our intention okay cool um i don't know i don't know much about the technical details to be able to go further with that with that question but uh uh another question i have for you is just like i mean i'm i'm already totally sold on like the modular blockchain thesis how in if we zoom forward five ten fifty years how does the general crypto ecosystem landscape topology look like under under like a celestia paradigm or just a modular blockchain paradigm like who's doing what what applications are using celestia how just like how does this thing mature and develop and expand over time that's a really good question so um i also this reminded me of the fact that we never when we were talking about scalability you were saying like oh well you know celestia wouldn't be as scalable as salon or something like that actually the answer is is no it's the opposite so the celestial will be far more scalable than solana or any monolithic chain ever possibly could be because basically we get the best of both worlds we can have these like mega powered nodes um where like the block production is i'm going to call it centralized but high very high resource but actually doesn't cause centralization so that the because the end users are still verifying everything um and so i foresee a future where celestia has maybe orders of magnitude more data throughput than um any monolithic chain ever did and so i think we'll we'll really reach this like if we if we want to transition to mass adoption to me the only viable path is via a modular blockchain so but beyond that what is what is the future i mean i see a proliferation of um execution layers i think and and i'm already seeing this sort of anecdotally within our own ecosystem and and within the blockchain space like a lot of people are getting excited about roll ups because they're realizing how they're they're really a new paradigm and i also frankly see a proliferation in the long term of other data availability schemes and other data availability layers like i think and i think that's healthy right like the like we have this saying um in celestia which is modularism not maximalism and so what that means is basically that you know in in a like i think one of the reasons why the blockchain space has had this crazy tribalism and maximalism is that every monolithic chain has to be its own island and is really locked into its one design paradigm and has to do everything on its own right so it's like it's very much like dog eat dog kind of every man for themselves and in a modular blockchain paradigm it's more about like hey i'm you know i'm building this one chain to focus on this one function and then the end users and the developers can plug in and mix and match and do what they want and there let the market sort of decide right like there will like there'll still be a competition between different execution layers or different data availability layers but the point is that we're we're all sort of like on an even playing field and we're all trying to build the most trust minimized most useful most like plugable and modular uh components as possible i think to put that differently is that we're all very tribal because our island our uh blockchains are all siloed away from each other but then when you put them onto a substrate that allows cross-chain communication cross-chain assets cross-chain whatever all of a sudden that those tribes perhaps melt away just because like we're on the we're all on the same protocol for the first time yeah exactly and a key part of this vision and we didn't really touch on this but one of the other reasons why this module blockchain paradigm is so important and i think revolutionary and is the future for blockchain infrastructure is that the roll-ups or these chains when they share a common data availability layer they can interoperate with the highest security so they can have truly tough trust minimized securities it's almost as if so it's it's it's almost as if they would be applications running on on the evm like you know we're used to the fact that applications the evm they all share the ethereum as their security layers you don't for an application to talk to each other they don't have to worry like oh is this application secure or not so you you get that same thing what you don't what you lose though is atomicity so like you know different roll-ups will still you know have this sort of cross-chain thing where you can't guarantee that a transaction here is going to be atomically execute with another like contract here so you do lose that but what i think would it will supercharge this multi-chain the evolution of this multi-chain universe and really like create like an internet of blockchains where there's this common security layer that underpins everything and then you can proliferate you can like deploy chains at will like we want to make it possible for people to deploy a blockchain as easily as it is right now to deploy a smart contract on ethereum so like in if you imagine that world will have the same amount of proliferation of contracts or of of chains as there are contracts and applications on ethereum in the long term like that's that's really what gets me jazzed up is like just the the future sort of you know explosion and cambrian sort of like um explosion of of like the multi-chain uh universe like we're so early still in in this whole exploration of what blockchains are capable of and um i think this is a fundamental evolution and how we'll be able to build these systems and how we'll be able to scale them well nick i can certainly see your excitement so it gets me excited as well if any listeners or viewers on the youtube are
