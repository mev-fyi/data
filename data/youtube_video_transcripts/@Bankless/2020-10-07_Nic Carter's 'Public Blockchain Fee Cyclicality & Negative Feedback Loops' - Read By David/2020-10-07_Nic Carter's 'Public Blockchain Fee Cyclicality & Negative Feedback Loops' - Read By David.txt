on wednesday october 14th coindesk is throwing an invest ethereum economy virtual event which i'm really excited that coindesk is getting into the ethereum space more vitalik buterin is going to talk there as well as heath from the cftc and i am also giving a talk as well on the bowl case of ether so here i am right down here defy dad is also talking rune christensen is also talking uh some really all stars who are giving some really fantastic talks so i i've seen the schedule i've seen the list of talks and i'm really excited about it they've done a really good job picking out the right topics there's a link in the show notes where you can register with the code bank list to get 25 off of your ticket so get that ticket and then watch me talk about how awesome ether the asset is hello everyone nick carter just put out this piece called the public blockchain fee cyclicality and negative feedback loops which has a lot of extremely relevant content to the ethereum gas markets and so i asked nick hey can i read this on the bank list youtube and he said yes and so we are going to do that here today but before we go through the whole entire article let's go through what nick recaps in 2017 nick notices bitcoin fees and transactions oscillating with transaction leading fees effectively fees cause a negative feedback loop to develop in transactions so here's what he's talking about uh the feedback loop he illustrates is that there's this demand for block space there's always this inherent demand for block space and because of that transactions go up and therefore fees go up because there's only limited block space because fees go up people start transacting less and then transactions go down and then the fees decline and because the costs of purchasing block space go down therefore demand for block space therefore increases and so it's kind of like this business cycle except he nick is citing it being this two-month-long phenomenon and the the important thing that he's talking about uh that's relevant here is that like fees the the highness or lowness of fees dictate what can be viable economic activity on these chains and also who can participate right who is able to transact in these public networks is dictated by how big these fees are so that's that's kind of what this article is about so let's go ahead and get into it public blockchain fee cyclicality and negative feedback loops by nick carter invented in 1788 by james watt the centrifugal centrifugal governor is a small clever device that made steam engines viable in an industrial context effectively it takes rotational input from a steam engine and applies it to weighted balls as they spin the centrifugal force pushes them upwards moving a lever connected to a valve as they spin faster the valve closes in this manner the governor takes input from a steam engine and mechanically regulates the flow of steam hence the speed of the engine this innovation made steam engine suitable for industrial processes which required stability and predictable speeds like mechanical looms the key idea is that as the system gains in energy a negative feedback loop develops which caps its growth for steam engines this is part of their design and is a very good thing as we will see a similar phenomenon exists in public blockchains with more mixed results and so here are the balls that he's talking about and as the speed pressure uh let's see they it goes roundy roundy roundy and because these balls are weighted when they go roundy roundy roundy it activates this lever which increases or decreases the pressure in the system so it's this self-regulating system that allows the thing to perpetuate right it's it's an equilibria discovery system that's what nick's describing here and so he goes into actually mapping out the cyclical fees the curious case of the cyclical fees as the does dust cleared on the main of 2017 i noticed that bitcoin fees and transaction count appeared to follow a repeating pattern blocks would fill up fees would spike transactions would start to drop and then blocks would start to fill up again by my account this cycle repeated itself six times in 2017. note that i've smoothed both average fees and transaction count on a seven day moving average people recalls bitcoin's late 2017 fee crisis as a single single event but in fact there were at least four periods of rising a fees rising dramatically and six if you count smaller peaks it's just that most people count fees and dollar terms rather than native unit terms so they only really noticed the final prolonged fee spike when the us dollar value of bitcoin was spiking too on average fees would take about two weeks after fees would peak about two weeks after transactions did the entire cycle took two months to complete although it accelerated throughout the year as blocks became progressively fuller a marginal new burst of transactions push fees into intolerable ranges for transactors of course fees are just the symptom the underlying constraint is block space you can visualize the hard stop develop by examining the relationship between block fullness and average fees so we've got average fees here in blue and then in excuse me um you have block size uh in blue and this is with the bitcoin blockchain and so bitcoin blocks are capped at one megabyte uh and then it also goes up and segwit to four megabytes later and uh and so here's that one megabyte line right and so uh right right here it's one of these gray lines it's this one and so these the amount of transactions in the block you know somewhere below it and then sometimes it goes up to it but when it gets up to it and gets really close to it and holds it there that's when nick says we're starting to see these increases in fees and these things map on to each other really well and then segwit gets introduced right around here and we start to see uh bitcoin blocks uh be become even more full but since segwit is an opt-in thing even though it's a four megabyte cap it's only a four megabyte cap by who opts into it and so as a network you know the the average size only went up a little bit but you can tell that you're we're pushing up against the limit here and this this is when fees i remember i remember this where on the of the bitcoin blockchain were like a hundred dollars a transaction it was insane so a hundred dollars a transaction think about how many people that gets like kicked out as a viable economic actor in this space when like everything you do must must be at least worth a thou a hundred dollars using this approach you can see that as blocks filled up and stayed full fees crept upwards as fees reached a peak users chose to transact less and blocks emptied out giving rise to the ragged pattern block size but as fees came down block space looked more attractive to users and they flocked back to the protocol causing blocks to fill up again in the final grand speed fee spike in january january 2018 blocks stayed full to the brim for months and fees reached eye watering levels both in btc and usd terms keep in mind that segwit officially arrived in january july 23 2017 since it represented an effective block space allowing blocks to carry up to the equivalent excuse me since it represented an effective block size increase parentheses allowing blocks to carry up to the equivalent of four megabytes of data in parentheses you can see blocks burst through the one megabyte limit in the latter half of the year however because segwit was not fully embraced by transactors right away average block size grew only slowly here's a diagram of the process i call it an oscillation because it causes both fees and the utilization of blocked chain resources to oscillate like a sine wave but you could also describe it as a negative feedback loop as fees inhibit transactions when they hurt certain thresholds so here's that graph that illustration again as demand for block space increases transactions count increases therefore fees increase therefore transactors curtail their usage therefore transactions count decreases and then fees decline and nick says that this takes about two months this was a little more than a curiosity i pointed out at the time but the cycle didn't really matter but the cycle didn't really matter all together too much you couldn't bet on where uh you couldn't bet on where you thought transaction count would be in a week after all the lesson i took from this was straightforward at a certain point users grow frustrated with fees and de-prioritize on-chain transactions especially if the fees are large relative to their transaction size segwit helped a fair amount as did the institution of batching seen in a certain way fees are self-correcting as they encourage large consumers of block space to be more parsimonious with their consumption of chain resources but all this did was reinforce my idea that scaling bitcoin would require a number of deferred transaction systems that settled to btc under array of trust models the other takeaway for me was that users evidenced a clear transactional life cycle and after a period of acute feed pressure required several weeks to return to their prior level of consumption all right here's when we start to get into the same model but in ethereum ethereum's 2020 fee crisis this year when ethereum fees started to creep up and then exceed those on bitcoin i wondered to myself whether ethereum would see a reprise of bitcoin's fee transaction count dynamics i puzzled over whether it would have this the same effect or be more disruptive to ethereum since so much liquidity is on chain as opposed to primarily being off-chain at exchanges i figured we see the same thing with a less dramatic oscillation since the supply of the ethereum blocks place is somewhat dynamic and can increase in response to surging usage as it turned out fees would end up being much more disruptive than i had expected and we all remember very recently uh during d5 farming days uh you know fees on ethereum got up to three four five hundred guay so that's like that's like a couple dollars just to send ethan 50 to 100 to do anything more complex like bitcoin in 2017 ethereum saw this year ethereum this year ethereum this year saw a utilization spike as transactions grew which gradually drove freeze upwards compounds public token launch in mid june intensified blockchain utilization and hence fee pressure and a host of other launches saw fees reach a crescendo starting in mid mid-august several notable launches namely the dual launches of sushi swap and uni swaps token spiked fees to eye watering levels on september 2nd the average ethereum transaction cost over 14 dollars all told almost 17 million dollars was were paid in east fees that day while surpassing minor revenue from new issuance of ether which totaled a total six million dollars as those fees rose rose some users chose to defer transactions and transaction counts started to drop as we entered a new high fee epoch in mid-august ethereum transactions per day started to steadily drop fees peaked much later on september 2nd but also but have also begun to come down over the last month just two days later on september 4th i predicted on the on the brink podcast that ethereum high fees would not only affect chain utilization but also liquidity on decentralized exchange i'll post a brief transcript below nick we saw the this feed transaction count oscillation happening in bitcoin in 2017 i would predict that we would see the same thing with ethereum so effectively fees rise as block space utilization rise and as a certain as a certain critical threshold users kind of get fed up then they stop transacting for a while it's not economical for them to transact and so transaction count and fees drop and then fees get cheaper so people start transacting again and the cycle continues and i think that if you look at the sell-off it's probably partial to that because some of the more retail investors that were using these on-chain exchanges they're getting priced out of those trades and if there's no retail investors that's a lot of the uninformed flow that the smart traders trade against and so i think there is a hint of look uh hint to look hit to liquidity when that generally happens this is a really big point and this is kind of why i i want to read this article here on the on the bankless youtube what's nick is saying is that when fees got too high retail got priced out and stopped transacting and that drop in transactions made returns in defy less because less fees were being accrued right less people were trading in uniswap and because not only the fees of the blockchain protocol went down but the fees into the returns that people were providing liquidity into defy apps also went down and so this can start to unravel like the whole d5 mania that that happened right and matt finishes the thought as no retail no party and while eth price dynamics are hard to bend down i am not claiming they are solely attributable to this phenomenon eth usd peaked on september 1st and declined from there while fees stayed elevated through the rest of the month so what happened exactly a couple things first ethereum entered into what i believe is its first major fee chain usage oscillation with fees peaking about three weeks after transaction count and both declining subsequently perhaps more interestingly the average size of ethereum transactions and the various stablecoin transactions shot up alongside the rising fees this stands to reason users have a view of how much they're willing to pay in fees as a percentage of their transaction and as fees rise they stop making small transactions and larger transactions start to dominate the correlation is startingly startlingly tight and suggest to me that users are very sensitive to fees nick is saying here that people will really pay attention to how much money they're sending versus how much the fee is and if it's too much of a ratio if it's too much of a chunk they are very sensitive to that and they choose to not transact it's not just basic ether transactions which exhibit this fee sensitivity either tokens like tether also evidence rising transaction fees as ease fees increase right so he's saying it's not it's for stable coins as well it's not just for ether transactions makes sense this suggests that transactors have a threshold of fees as a percentage of transaction value that they're willing to pay and as fees rise they become unwilling to make smaller transactions unless they really have to the above could be explained by some third exploratory explanatory variable like the growth of liquidity mining which both with which was both congesting the train and causing larger transaction transactors to enter i found more clarity when i investigated the composition of ether transactions i felt intuitively i intuitively felt that smaller transactors were getting priced out by fees but it wasn't clear until i put together this chart initially this chart may not look too notable it shows the cooling off of transaction count as fees rise as we saw above but more interestingly is the chase changing dynamic among eth and usdt transfers which i split up at the 500 threshold you can see transactions accounting for more than five hundred dollars worth of eth gaining steadily share gaining steadily share relative to smaller transactions as fees rise let's eliminate contract calls and focus on only the two categories of the transfers found above this is the smoking gun for for non-contract call transactions eth transfers were under five hundred dollars were idling at 85 percent in june but when fees spiked they collapsed to as little as 40 percent of eth transfers finally some hard evidence for my intuition fees price out smaller users super important predictably the same phenomenon is evident in the usage of usage patterns of the biggest erc20 token tether you can clearly see the smaller usdt transactions start to drop off as median fees start to climb in mid-august larger tether transactions hold firm but still evidence a declining trend overall as transactions cooled off during the high fee epoch next section do high fees affect liquidity so we've established that there's a clear negative feedback loop between fees and utilization of blockchain resources both in bitcoin and ethereum in bitcoin we know that the cycle historically takes two months to complete we haven't and we haven't yet seen what it will look like on ethereum moreover it's clear that transactors have a threshold in mind for the highest tolerable fees relative to the size of the transactions they are making and that smaller transactions transactors defer their transactions during period of high fees this causes average transaction sizes for both eth and other tokens to creep up during high fee epochs but is there more to the story or is this just a recast of bitcoin 2017 i'd venture that there is indeed another wrinkle here remember that in 2017 bitcoin trading took place at centralized exchanges with the blockchain being used for inter-exchange settlement and for user deposits and withdrawals actual markets were made off-chained a user could fund an exchange account with fiat and hold and then sell bitcoin all without actually touching the blockchain so when the fee crisis appeared it absolutely put a break on the bitcoin economy but plenty of users were able to make trades on exchanges that already had funds on the platform or wanted wanted to wire in usd by contrast ethereum trading in 2020 together with its litany of associated tokens is very much an on-chain phenomenon now centralized exchanges are simply are still very important to price formation but certain indexes like unit swap have at times eclipsed even the largest centralized exchanges because automated automated market maker dexes do not require kyc custodying coins with a third party or a lengthy onboarding process they are far more convenient for the end users the no order book amm model is also extremely simple to use in certain asset types and types of exposure like smaller defy tokens or mining with liquidity are only possible on chain as a consequence a vibrant industry of on-chain liquidity has emerged with ferocity as virtually everything traded on these dexes is ether or token on ethereum everything is exposed to fees unlike centralized exchanges every trade you make at a dex has to settle on chain on-chain fees are therefore an ever present consideration so contrasting the vanilla fee transaction count oscillation model we saw with bitcoin in 2017 here's a modified version to account for the new dynamics we saw from ethereum in 2020 and so here's that old model that old oscillation that that is just what you get without a smart contract platform and then you add in defy and you get this secondary oscillation where the the fees and the liquidity also oscillates along with the fees paid with the blockchain so where does this second loop derive from why single out dex heavy chains for special treatment first it's important to understand that as maya yeah javi puts it high fees are a regressive taxed on users regressive because fees are not proportional to your wealth but instead apply largely in the same way whether you're moving 10 100 worth of eth or 10 000. fees are a function of the computational heaviness of your transaction rather than the dollar value of your transaction this is similar in manner to which sales tax are regressive because groceries account for a larger share of the income of the working class people than they do wealthy thus a fixed five percent sales tax is effectively a much larger portion of income for a less well-off family let's consider an analogy imagine a private game of poker with a rake which is fixed in dollar terms rather than being a percentage of the value of the pot the rake is the fee that the operator takes for running the game it's like your bid i mean about minimum table table bets players have the choice to play a given hand and play pay the fixed fee or sit out in which the case they don't have to pay there's a variety of players at the table a couple professionals some semi-pros and some gamblers who are enthusiastic but aren't particularly good at poker the house can set up the value of the rake wherever it likes to have a winning night not only do you need to win against your opponents but you need to be profitable net after the rake is taken by the house it's not it's not enough just to win you have to win after absorbing transaction costs if the rate is low everyone participates happily but when the table operators get greedy and increase the rate the table with the smaller stacks start to sit out more and more hands if they have to fork over a tenth of their stack just to play a hand they are going to opt out unless they have pocket aces the general trend is that as the rake rises in absolute terms players are gradually priced out of the game starting with the players with the smallest bankrolls when the smaller less sophisticated players start to drop out the game gets substantially less profitable for everyone else after all the semi-pros depend on the existence of unsophisticated opponents to make a living as every poker player knows you probably don't want to sit down at a table on a tuesday morning with the grinders and semi-pros you want to fit you want to hit the felt on a friday night when the when the loose amateur gamblers roll through lose their stack and stumble off to the bar the return to the return to return to the analogy to ethereum the fees are the rake and they price out the individuals who until recently were having a rick rolling roll-licking time on uniswap and other dexes but as fees climbed to 14 on average and much higher for d5 transactions like swapping each to die on unit swap it simply became uneconomical for individuals with smaller bankrolls to participate in trading or liquidity mining an entire portion of the market was forced to sit on their hands and as read to and and since retail investors are the uninformed flow that professional traders trade against and profit from if retail isn't sitting at the table the game is not as worthwhile all of this manufa manifests in a degradation of liquidity and worse trading opportunities overall all of that said this theory is hard to confirm empirically a detailed analysis of wallets active and d5 at various thresholds and their reaction to fees or comparison of spreads versus eath fees would be helpful in confirming these hypotheses but there are a few data points which are indicative here first here are aggregate dex volumes courtesy of friedrich haga's dune analytics dashboard compared to median ethereum fees you can see that volume and fees have co-moved in the last few months this is consistent with fees putting a break on usage especially at the retail tiers the problem is that the casual causality is hard to infer and it can easily be the case that high dex volume was the cause of elevated fees and vice versa rather than high fees being the catalyst for declining volumes perhaps more interestingly this chart shows the daily new addresses taking part in various defy protocols the first derivative of the dune dashboard built by richard chen versus median eth with the exceptions of two big spikes around unit swap sushi swap and the uni token launch daily new entrants to d5 seemed to be cooling off after mid-august when east fees when eath fees reached a new plateau the conclusions being drawn here are more speculative while it's clear that smaller users defer transactions when fees are higher the direct effect on chain liquidity is hard to measure future prospects for ethereum fees we haven't seen the full fee chain resources cycle play out yet on ethereum so it's hard to gauge the length of the cycle but in the spirit of making concrete predictions i will forecast the following i expect that we we will see ongoing positively correlated oscillations on ethereum between fees transactions and crucially the liquidity and volumes of on-chain exchanges i can can imagine it would look something like this if you believe that dex volumes and the on-chain liquidity environment are more generally accretive to the price of ether it doesn't take much imagi imagination to make educated guesses about the potential price impact of this phenomenon to the extent that ether's value is exposed to the reservation demand for the asset as a liability free collateral at the base of the defy system fees that put uh put a break on usage will most likely make the tvl the total value locked in the system unwind and put pressure on the price of each that said there are a few counter-cyclical features that might attenuate the oscillation and spare ethereum for the tyranny from the tyranny of volatile fees dynamic block space unlike bitcoin which has formally increased the block size cap once in it once in existence ethereum is more amenable to producing more block space if necessary although the rate of increase is constrained elastic block space could in theory be employed to stabilize fees but this comes at the cost of increased validation requirements which are already fairly high for ethereum as ethereum utilization has increased miners have rewarded transaction transactors with ever more computational capacity however because raising the gas limits increase gas limit increases the uncle rate making the network potentially more vulnerable to dos attacks and making operating a full node more costly the ethereum community is divided on the prospect of further gas increases while ethereums are more willing to tolerate more aggressive trade-offs than bitcoiners as far as the cost of node operation is concerned the two camps generally agree that merely increasing the supply of block space is not a scaling panacea while so while block space has a certain supply elasticity which enables it to respond to increased demand there is little political willingness to pursue a wholly accommodative block space policy eth 2.0 and charting when i first wrote about the prospect for ethereum feeds vitalik's response to my article article in which i claimed that ethereum would likely be saddled with high fees for an extended period and this would affect the viability of non-financial applications vitale clarified his stance on fees effectively he pointed out that he still believes in ethereum's visions for low-cost blockchain in which for a low-cost blockchain in which a variety of applications both non-financial and financial are possible his proposed solutions are roll-ups in the near term and eth 2.0 slash sharding in the longer term vitalik has said that he expects eth 2.0 to produce 100x more cup more capacity although he expects that fees might eventually rise to an equivalent level thanks to induced demand induced demand is just that as things get cheaper more people can purchase them i'm inclined to agree if you produce a commodity more efficiently the world will find more uses for that now cheaper commodity thus it wouldn't be at all surprising to see average fees reach a high plateau even taking into account the creation of more block space regardless eth2 still appears fairly remote so it's difficult to reason about at the very least it won't be moving the needle fee wise in the near term roll-ups roll-ups the current orthodoxy and ethereum holds that roll-ups are the main path to alleviating ethereum's current fee woes roll-ups come in two major types zk and optimistic but they are both generally in but they both generally involve bundling many payments together and vastly increasing the economic density of transactions in theory preserving the assurances of base layer transactions while massively increasing tps transactions per second in short transactors rely on relayers who assemble large batches of transactions and broadcast broadcast digest of these transactions a zk roll up involves broadcasting significantly truncated transaction stubs alongside a proof that the bundle of transactions is a valid change to the ledger the optimistic variant involves semi-trusted operators who assemble transactions with transactions who largely assume that the operators are not acting maliciously deterrence is in theory achieved through a combination of fraud proofs and economic penalties for misbehavior current zk roll ups are mostly limited to simple transfers while certain breeds of optimistic rollups promise to open up the full scope of transactions currently possible in vanilla ethereum for a comprehensive breakdown of the state of optimistic roll-ups and see this comprehensive report courtesy of daniel goldman roll-ups roll-ups effectively take transactional data off chain and put validity proofs on-chain bitcoiners embraced a similar data parsimony vision of years ago and pursued lightning which could reduce hundreds of thousands of payments to a handful of on-chain transactions and side chains as well as advocating for pro-efficiency measures like bad batching and segwit usage thanks to the popularity of roll-ups and the apparent pace of progress vitalik is championing them as the best near-term approach to scaling ethereum while ethereum 2.0 may yet come into play the roll-up vision the roll-up vision of ethereum is much closer at hand there's a couple reasons why roll-ups may not be the panacea for ethereum fees first it will be a challenge to coax all consumers of block space to be responsible stewards of the system especially if they are service providers and can pass fees onto end users rather than internalizing them we learned this lesson from bitcoin if intermediaries can pass fees onto the end user they have limited incentive to invest in a more suitable more sustainable infrastructure what's what nick is talking about here is that each individual app would need to create its own uh zk roll up system so therefore it has a host it would have to host a server that runs that and that's something that they're not doing today and they can say in instead they could say f it you know we'll just make the user pay on chain fees because we don't have to pay them so we'll just make the user pay for them so what he's saying is there's no actual incentive for like some unit swap type operator to run it run a server to process off change transactions because they can just make their customers pay for it additionally because ethereum has repeatedly increased the gas limit to effectively bail out blocks based consumers at the expense of validators heavy users may spend their resources lobbying for more gas limit increases rather than spending engineering hours on roll-up buying their transactions their transactions along these same lines the specter of super abundant block space on the horizon with eth 2.0 might impair the enthusiasm for rollups among heavy transactors perversely eth2's main contribution today may well be to discourage heavy users from rendering their usage more efficient second the global user base of a blockchain like ethereum is not strictly something that developers and advocates can actually uh can actually appeal to directly ethereum is open for anyone to participate in with without exclusion which is part of the reason for its popularity with ponzis and other marginal schemes presumably the orchestrators of these schemes which are routinely some of the heaviest consumers of block space are not necessarily planning for the long term or trying to often optimize their on-chain footprint but rather more focused on making a quick buck it sure would be interesting to see force force age pushing the envelope tech wise by rollerbizing a pyramid scheme though on the technical side roll-ups especially of the optimistic variant are not identical to base layer transactions in terms of their settlement settlement qualities vanilla ethereum transactions are final almost immediately and do not carry chargeback or settlement risks this property permits automaticity which means that chain transactions either all happen or none do this grants users the ability to safely interlink multiple systems without risking a cascading failure because one payment to the chain failed to clear this is a highly desirable property which is a function of its status as a digital bearer asset atomic thomas oh boy atomicity flows into composability the oft touted feature of ethereum whereby smart contracts can safely reference each other allowing for the build-out of ever more complex systems without having to evaluate each module introducing more complex systems like roll-ups throws these assumptions of autonomous atomicity and composability into doubt due to the fraud-proof challenge trust model in some optimistic roll-ups finality periods are extended in the unhappy case matter labs estimates that the time to finality for optimistic roll-ups will be in the order of one to two weeks note this estimate was made in november 2019 so the state of the art may have changed since then one proposed solution involves intermediaries which provide users withdrawing from the roll-up discounted access to their temporary frozen coins for the duration of the challenge period as far as i can tell this effectively creates a tiered system with lengthier finality from the free version of a rollup exit and shorter finality in the paid accelerated version to put it somewhat uncharitably optimistic roll-ups introduce the potential of a deferred settlement there's nothing wrong with this deferred settlement is at the core of all efficient modern payment systems but it is a different settlement system settlement from the settlement model from base layer ethereum transactions which are cash like if you are you if you are used to transacting solely with bank wires moving to ach and credit payments will be more efficient but it also means that you have to still make impaired guarantees around settlement this is why chargebacks are possible with credit card payments they don't actually settle right away great for the consumer bad if you were a merchant and you had those earmarked those funds to pay bills coming due aside from questions of finality impaired composability is another issue which may might inhibit an immediate transition to optimistic roll-ups i am not an expert on roll-ups by any means but i have seen composability challenges mentioned as one of the biggest drawbacks of optimistic roll-ups for these reasons i don't believe it's inevitable that all smart contracts on ethereum will switch to a roll-up system to me there seems to be a critical difference between a fast settling base layer ether or token transfer and a roll-up-eyes version of the same especially when it comes to settlements and if either composability or atomicity is impaired the systems can you can build look very different from those present on ethereum as it works today there is something there's definitely something unique about defy as constit constituted from fast settling ether and token transfers today and i believe that this will become clear as some large blocks based consumers start to make that switch onto the roll-up system as a consequence i don't expect that rollups will be meaningfully abate fees in the near term even if they get partial uptake conclusion the difference between a centrifugal governor and on-chain fees is that the regula regulating effective fees is more of a side effect of a properly functioning system rather than a key design consideration in public blockchains fees exist to ensure the non-frivolous consumption of network resources and to provide validators with revenue they're not strictly intended to put a check on the usage of the system in practice however they do and this break tends to be a sharp one rather than gradual as a consequence we see an oscillation in resource usage transactions and even liquidity of on-chain products rather than a gentle deceleration these dynamics are well established in bitcoin and only just starting to emerge in ethereum but due to the predominance of on-chain exchanges on ethereum they are arguably more disruptive to the network as it works today as kyle simoni puts it bounded throughput instrumentalized by feed pressure may be defy's invisible asymptote the ethereum community should consider the effects of repeating periods of high and volatile fees on the network with the understanding that some applications may be permanently priced out of viability lastly roll-ups while compelling scaling technologies may not be a panacea from a fee perspective due to their effects on settlement assurances thanks to ryan gentry lucas newsie and antoine le calves for their assistance and feedback all right guys this was nick carter's very long not not too long but very dense and very insanely insightful article public blockchain fee cyclicality and negative feedback loops so i'm just going to go through this really fast he uses this illustration of this thing that regulates a steam engine and compares it to the cyclicality of fees and usage on public blockchains as blockchain fees go up people stop using them making block space empty and fees go down and this is interesting in bitcoin but it really gets interesting in ethereum as it relates to how defy works at large right and let's see and so he this is the main thesis of this article right so not only are fees on ethereum part of the base layer but they're integrated in d5 apps and a reason why we are farming is we are farming these fees and when there's more farmers coming to farm the fees the fees go up and that creates kind of a feedback loop but then that feedback loop goes too high and the cost to transact on the main ethereum blockchain becomes too much people say i'm out i'm not i'm not this doesn't make sense for me to transact anymore and then the fees stop and nick claims that this is a hard slam on the brakes not a slow uh a slow roll to a stop and so he expects the cyclicality to come out in defy as we move forward which is interesting as we are looking at uh you know prices in the last you know month or so let's pull up ether price uh right around let's go 90 days and so right here if you guys remember right around here you know the the gray price was 400. it was ridiculous there was so much farming going on it was it was just endless uh and and then the price dropped and you know we've kind of been sloughing it out ever since then now i could just be reading the tea leaves but like from what we've seen in the local price environment along with on on chain fees everything kind of seems to be playing out in the way that nick is illustrating so i'll leave it there thanks everyone for listening if you have any feedback if you have any comments leave them in the comment section or at nick underscore underscore carter on twitter i'm sure he would want your feedback as well thanks
