let's talk about the current state of block building if we can also as well define block building talk about the current state of how a block is built and added to the blockchain sure so the existing model is proof of work everything is sort of all tied together in a fairly small and compact set of software and a fairly small and concentrated set of miners but are actually more likely mining pools you build what's called a block template which is basically a candidate block with the transactions and then you try to solve for the golden nodes where you try to do a bunch of computation to do the computation you have to pour energy into computers and you solve these problems and the first one to solve the problem basically it says hey i have a block and they broadcast it to the network and the other nodes basically inspect that valid and say it's okay
