we got Tesla and Amazon absolutely wrecked Amazon is back at the same price it was at the bottom of the March coveted lows Tesla coming in at 123 dollars when it used to be almost 500. everything that happened during the covid period was just funny money if eighth was back at its March 2020 bottom it'd be 90 we are like 13 x from there and Bitcoin went back to 4 000 or something crypto I mean Ethan BTC have done remarkably well because if you look at stocks Amazon is a big ass company but their stock price did nothing the last two years now Tesla's a different story I think Tesla got way way overvalued for where it was supposed to be if you weren't going to be a crypto investor the other asset class that you were probably would have invested in is like high growth high risk tech stocks and so like they also got wrecked too so if you're feeling like wrecked by crypto it's almost the same health and BTC a relatively like doing so bloody well compared to these other stocks right it's just crazy 100
