uh in bad news though operation choke point promises to take crypto bankless but in the bearish way uh perhaps crypto's biggest regulatory threat ever bankless Nation it is the second Friday of February David what time is it Ryan it's the Friday bankless weekly roll-up where we cover the entire Weekly News in crypto which is always an ambitious Endeavor especially this week an insane amount of shipping uh some extra large fud and we're going to cover it all on this roll up here and now with of course coffee coffee as always yep in my Ember mug too so it's it's nice and piping hot David you are back and uh your voice still hasn't fully recovered although it's better than it was yesterday so like how many days of recovery and what happened to you yeah my voice is slowly coming back after going to the stockware sessions Intel Aviv Israel and doing nine interviews which the bank close nature will notice at the first four of is on their podcast feed so you can go ahead and listen to those if you me like if you just can't make it out to conferences don't worry because bankless has your back I bring out an entire podcast studio with me including three microphones and I interview everyone who's founder Builder developer of that particular ecosystem this conference in Choice was this darknet world and sometimes I put my voice on the line too to get that done and that's why you're going to be hearing a little bit raspy of a voice on this weekly roll-up this week big sacrifices to make this happen many gothams died for this uh information Little Star Wars reference for you um David I always thought you were just going to the conferences for me man but I guess it is about the listeners too seriously I appreciate that that's one of the great things about people don't know the partnership between David and myself it's just like a yin yang type thing where he does all sorts of stuff that I'm like ah I don't want to go to a conference it was like I absolutely want to go to all the conferences and so it's a really good fit and David's like uh I don't want to do accounting and bookkeeping and that sort of thing and I'm like oh that's fine for me I enjoy it in a weird way weird that's what makes this partnership work yeah anyway it's just like the the disposition of who I am at a conference is like I just want to talk with as many people as possible but I also hate small talk and receiving pitches and so in order to defend myself from getting pitched by everyone all the time I schedule out interviews longer form interviews and I'm like oh I'm sorry I'm interviewing people not the small talk yeah I'm like that too yeah you know what's funny is um I know you've characterized yourself as an introvert but I think somebody met you at a conference I don't think they'd see an introvert yeah everyone is surprised like I say oh yeah I'm kind of introverted and everyone's like what no you're not and actually I have had to actually rethink that so yeah because there are true introverts that just really yeah there are people who are more introverted than me but also like coming into crypto I have discovered that it has created a more extroverted outgoing person in me that is something I've noticed look uh it come for the money but stay for the personality Improvement or the psychological changes it's like also happens to be the subject of my talk at shelling point in Denver if you want to talk about the way that permissionless sell self-sovereign protocols change the psychological disposition of the societies that organize around them if that talk interests you definitely go to shelling Point David's been waiting years to apply a psych degree to uh crypto and then the moment has come six years six years in the making this is great well it's it's super unlike Bank list to shill its own content on the show but you can you can tell we've got a lot of hot content coming at you David and I've been looking at our podcast schedule too I mean we're recording three podcasts over the next like three days three working days with some real big names um oh my God there's the I think it's some of the hottest content lined up over the next like 10 days that I think Eric Howell this is uh in crypto ethics we're talking about that uh Elisa um we're talking about Ai and this isn't just been Nicholas following the AI Trend this is yeah this is not about AI tokens this is really AI I mean this guy's like a big brain I'm uh it's incredible he's these shoes can come on and then any game well okay but here's my uh take on it she's going to tell us if we have to hide from our government if the government is coming after people in crypto right not I wouldn't say that that's the most accurate way of the theme of the content the the Annie Jacobson content Andy Jacobson is an author who does not really know much or care about crypto and doesn't need to in order to talk about what we're going to talk about she's written books uh like uh the pentagon's brain which is an exploration into how the Pentagon thinks and how it's organized and this subject matter is uh there have been there are many intelligence agencies in the United States uh that you know the CIA the Pentagon et cetera and they're also throughout history has been a number of counter-cultural dissident movements and there have been ways that these intelligence agencies have engaged with these counter-cultural dissident movies infiltrated infiltrated yes perhaps is the correct word uh and so while Annie doesn't have any specific knowledge about how the CIA might have been chosen to engage with crypto the idea is that we can talk about all of the different strategies that they have infiltrated other movements and it's up to the listener to connect the dots and extrapolate this into how uh how you know because the CIA might have infiltrated uh you know the the crypto world the question is how well do you really know your crypto podcast co-host like how well do you really know that person that's a question I intend to Ask Annie okay the the I'll jump to the conclusion of that episode there are we don't know the conclusion yet as a punchline I'm pretty sure well okay so Annie Jacobson spoke at the a16z founder Summit which is uh Retreat which is how she came onto my radar and the the conclusion is like yo if you are in the social networks of crypto the VC networks the at the media networks the likelihood that someone is a plant is like that's looking back throughout his history as how this has happened throughout other dissident movements is likely and so like I look at myself and I'm like oh I moved to New York to be a part of the crypto socialite crew I have them one of the most extensive media networks in all of crypto chances are you know CI the CIA really wants to be my friend well maybe they probably already are then yeah there's someone who's my friend who has probably already invited over to my apartment who's probably listening to this and it's like oh [ __ ] they're on to me thanks David paranoia increases 10x you guys appreciate that that was like a whole eight minutes of Shilling bankless content I'm sorry we got to get to the the roll-up content today all right is Biden operation choke point this operation choke point we're going to talk about is it coming to kill crypto we'll talk about that what else we got David dcg and Gemini hug it out maybe we'll get some of our money back uh perhaps a successful resolution and so if you have money and Gemini earned stay tuned to find out how much money that you may may get in return and also Ryan you've noticed this I've noticed this it is absolutely ship season so many teams have shipped very cool things very big updates in the last recent weeks so we're going to cover it all fundamentals are up big also a16d is a D5 governance cartel The Manhunt for dokwan nfts on bitcoin continue their exponential growth ark's audacious bitcoin price Targets this roll-up is absolutely jam-packed I'm really excited for this one so stay tuned for this all you know what else I'm really excited about is uh more tools to help us learn about crypto and go bankless here's one of the best tools I have seen this year it's called metamask learn you're seeing on the screen says welcome to metamask learn this is like courseware to help you learn crypto you can click here you could say start course and you can get on the journey lesson one what is web three maybe you're you're skipping all the early bankless podcasts and you want a quick recap this is a great way to do it David what else is in this uh courseware in this metamask learn app well you'll also be given an interactive and engaging way to learn how to open up a medevask wallet so if you're you know family and or non-crypto friends or curious this is a place for you to send them they metamask obviously teaches you how to set up metamask and what what's going on when you write down these 24 words but also just has some very important D5 paradigms like digital identity what self-custody is and why it's amazing nfts and creators decentralized Finance so if you want to onboard yourself or not have to onboard your friends you can send them to learn.mask.io really cool this is really the next step to go bankless step one is you open up your craft okay your what step one is you open up your your Kraken account and deposit some funds you transfer that to Fiat and then you open up a metamask while a step two uh all right David let's get to markets I think we got some happy news this week yet again it's it's only happy news what is bitcoin doing on the week it's not happy Ryan I don't know what you're talking about it's uh we're down 5.4 percent where have I been yeah where have you been wait was yesterday happy uh no it's been it's been I mean it's not been like super sad but it's been a down week we started the week at 23 800. so embarrassing guys David puts these numbers in before the roll up and clearly I don't even read them and I am uh sozen this year I'm not even checking prices only being down 5.4 is apparently not down enough to be on right right now uh Bitcoin currently coming in at twenty two thousand five hundred dollars oh sad sorry for that I wrecked you guys how about eth is that down too David don't let down but still down yeah starting the week at 16 75 uh 1 675 down 3.2 percent to 1620. um yeah so down down on the week uh not overly bad especially with like so we're gonna talk about this banking fund this operation choke point and we're only down this much I'm like kind of really optimistic about this and so very rarely in the bank list weekly roll up will we give a forward-looking market uh take but I saw this here and this is from uh crypto Trader Horn hairs three weeks of compression and higher lows on the eth price chart and so you can just see this triangle wedge forming uh and he's and he is claiming that the resistance the 1700 resistance which we talked about last week is uh perhaps fading away and when that resistance finally gets chewed through uh we go up and to the right now this is The Ether price we're looking at but this is probably also true for overall market indicators um I think there are more bullish indicators in the market than there are bearish indicators in the market and that is despite all this banking flood that we'll talk about so shortly did we just do Ta on Bank listings we have done this like twice before in all Bank close develop history and now we have done this a third time let me click away I mean you said we don't do um price predictions but we actually do they're just like really long term yeah right they're like the 10 plus year price predictions yeah he's going to 10K it's absolutely going to 10K uh how about eth Bitcoin ratio what's that looking like yeah up a little bit on the week we are up 2.3 on the week we're at .072 David look these charts from Kraken that that we're showing um it's uh it's really hard Futures here yeah so the URL for this uh you know pro.cracken.com app slash trade eth hyphen BTC you can actually just like delete BTC and type in USD if you want you can type in trading pairs in the URL so like you know I mean you have it also pulled up in the Fantastic modular UI ux that Kraken has you can you can look at multiple charts at once so you they're tabs they're tabs and but you can also drag and drop them and make them modular so you can pull them out if you want to look yeah but we've got tabs and tabs right now tabs inside of tabs but you can also intuitively change the url like I don't know if other people do this when they navigate crypto but it's just like if you want to type in any like like ticker you can do it straight through the URL to get what you want I think it's great can I do the sole BTC ratio what's that looking like see let's see if they got it so PTC boom there it is straight from the URL that's pretty amazing yeah big screen love this stuff yeah good job Katherine look at that look at that you're a Trader now look at this I need cracking is wow I never thought maybe behind me live updates all the time so I can keep track of freaking prices apparently I don't do that clearly um Global crypto market cap are we above a trillion David 1.1 trillion dollars slightly down on the week that's all I need to do okay let's talk about some Market stuff going on uh one is ultrasound money just keeps getting more and more ultrasound eth is at all time lows in terms of deflation post merge all-time lows yes postmark all-time lows ever since the burns started no no ever since the merge happened yeah this is I kind of consider it all ether Supply metrics before the merge kind of irrelevant now because this is we are so close like oh is that a good take David maybe I think so maybe there's only two dates in crypto there's BM and there's a merge at least in ethereum if uh if you want to be an eth maxi about it you can say for all of crypto but at least in ethereum kind of like it I kind of like it yeah so like all ethereum monetary policy kind of resets at the merch and now like and now we are at all time lows uh PM post merge okay and that's uh so how much have we burnt 14 000 eth 14 000 East since the merge uh 20 000 each since the top of the supply so the top of the supply when the eth supply Peak happened and not too long after the merge it was at a little over six thousand ether plus positive 6000 either we are now at negative four thousand four hundred each when the burn starts it just uh keeps going David I think that's what your take is here what well actually let me read it I'll try I'll try in your voice the 24-hour record for ethburn was set on November 8th the day FDX went insolvent that's a fun fact 3600 eth was burnt fire Emoji today we burnt 1800 eth 3600 eath was burnt during crypto's worst crisis ever and now we're burning 1 800 eth on a Wednesday that is on a Wednesday folks just a typical Wednesday for eth and we're burning eighteen hundred eth ethereum ether we're burning like an average over a 30-day period we're burning like an average of like 12 to 1300 ether per day David that must mean uh block space is in high demand is in demand that is an equivalent statement ether burn means block space demand uh and this is uh Hill Dobby who's just got great uh gas analytics uh he's pointing to a couple events here the ethereum merge the FTX Bank Run and the floor of gas prices is up only we haven't seen like uh below 15 gray gas prices in months now and this is this is to me Ryan like gas prices could go down they could go back down to where it was they could you know level out but a crescendo Wing floor of gas prices is what a bull market would start with isn't this okay do you remember like 18 months ago when this was like the most bearish indicator ever gas price on eth was going up therefore bearish for ethereum do you remember this yeah you mean 2021 the triggering of all player one season yeah this this was like I don't know was it December of last of of 2021 or that that was kind of the peak of this I think was a suzu tweet where um he criticized ethereum for sitting around watching circle jerking into the circle yeah is that what we're doing well we are currently doing this yes okay well but um so are you happy about this are you sad about this or are you like is this I high gas fees are bad for eth aren't they or are they good I'm confused tell me tell me what to think I will take suzu's point when he tweeted that and say that if all the ethereum proponents who were talking about how awesome the burn was were perhaps not being sensitive to how much ethereum gas costs were costing people that weren't able to buy ether at a cheaper price of which it was cheaper not like four or five six months prior yeah so I'll take that point because at that time layer twos of round ethereum were not nearly as mature or developed or as cheap as they are today today layer twos are in production with blossoming defy and nft ecosystems there's not much you can do on an ethereum layer one that you can't also do on ethereum Layer Two so now when we you know circle jerk about the eath burn there is also a way for all users to experience sub 10 cent gas fees and do all of the crypto ethereum things that they would like to do on any of the layer chews that they choose so now I declare that it is once again appropriate for the eth Maxis to circle jerk about the burn thank you for telling telling me that David thanks for the clarification you have permission because I needed that permission basically saying is look the cost of living in Manhattan is going up once again but why don't you live in the suburbs um that there's tons of uh cheap housing and affordable things to do in crypto on the layer 2 ecosystem David this is uh the daily median gas prices this is another view of the same thing from Hill Dobby uh that's exactly right just gas gases definitely hit a floor at bottom in the September 2022 and has been up only since then do you know what ethereum blocks base ain't the only block space that's selling and going up let's talk about Bitcoin Bitcoin block space the ordinal effects we love this so this is Bitcoin block space going all the way back to January of 2022 uh into February 2023 where we are now and you can see Bitcoin Brock space breaking all time uh all-time highs in terms of uh how much actually how much size they are and so the ordinals effect have increased the total size of Bitcoin the average mean of Bitcoin block space uh to highs that it has not yet seen before which means of course Ryan that more people are paying for Bitcoin block space and as we have been saying blocks based demand is bullish and so congrats Bitcoin is one of the strongest properties I've seen out of Bitcoin in a very long time what this is this this uh is a marker of sustainability of the Bitcoin network of course this is how it pays for defense in the future and Security in the future is through a block space fees so those blocks have to be worth something okay we talked about what's happening but why is it happening uh so ordinals which uh there was a we did a show with Eric wall and Casey rodemore who's the creative ordinals Eric Wall I tap him in as my Bitcoin technical co-host he's my Bitcoin my Bitcoin I tap him in when I need help explaining Bitcoin stuff so him and I uh talked to Casey who is the guy who created ordinals uh and this is what we're looking at this chart which is absolutely exponential as soon as Orono says come into the mainstream which is the nft it's the thing that allows nfts uh on bitcoin exactly yeah uh and it's actually pretty simple like how it works uh basically uh the Bitcoin utx mobile model unspent transaction output is basically oh ethereum has an account model as in you have your ethereum address and you put all of your tokens in there Bitcoin has a utxo model which is that every single Bitcoin is actually like a unique denomination like uh 13.7 Bitcoins is like a bill that's like 27.42 dollars like a unique bill that's for Bitcoin what ordinals does is they turn they make a bill out of one Satoshi which is the smallest denomination and then just append data to that and that's what an nft is on bitcoin uh and the minting of Bitcoin nfts Originals on bitcoin is just going exponential has not slowed down uh did you ask them why didn't somebody think of this years ago but they needed they needed both segwit and Taproot so it was specifically a Taproot thing that's right which is relatively recent but also at the same time like Bitcoin or culture isn't really one to like enjoy a lot of non-btc use cases of Bitcoin and so like this is why this is controversial and like some like uh Luke Bast Jr is a Bitcoin core Dev is like people have lied and tricked the code in order to make this happen which I think is one of the worst takes I've ever heard you can't trick code that's not how it works uh but anyways uh ordinals uh brand new demand for Bitcoin block space really cool right so bullish Bitcoin but how bullish are you David if you want to be Kathy Wood as Kathy Wood of Arc invest her bull case right now is 1.48 million dollars per Bitcoin and that's in 2020 in 2030. by 2030 I should say yes it's not happening this year according Kathy the bear case I want to hear that most bearish possibility Kathy would things could happen for Bitcoin 258k per Bitcoin um actually I could see the bear case playing out what do you think about these numbers though David um I gave my takes I think that bull case is extremely bullish um while Bitcoin perhaps might be able to tick that amount I do not think it will ever be able to sustain a one million dollar price and the reason and the reasoning behind that is this math that is on the screen here Bitcoin at 1.5 million dollars in 2030 means that it's issuing 2.33 million dollars every 10 minutes in Block rewards new Bitcoin being minted every 10 minutes is going to be worth 2.33 million dollars when Bitcoin hit its 2021 Peak it was issuing 400 000 per block and so Kathy Woods bullish Bitcoin uh prediction would imply that Bitcoin would be issuing 2.33 million dollars every 10 minutes and that is why Bitcoin can't sustain a one million dollar price tag because no bull Market could ever sustain two million dollars of flows out of Bitcoin miners because they have to sell Bitcoin miners have to sell so that 2.33 million dollars of issuance per block every 10 minutes comes out to 330 million dollars a day of issuance for minors which not all of it is sold immediately But ultimately generally becomes sold like 90 95 over time ultimately becomes sold how will anyone how will any asset be able to sustain itself under 300 million dollars a day of net cell pressure that is that I I don't think Bitcoin can ever sustain a one million dollar price tag because of this math well um eventually that block subsidy will drop to zero though yeah but then so does the security and that's a different issue yeah I I think uh bankless listeners hopefully you're seeing the way that bank list Dave and I at least think about these assets it's very much about how much yeah it's about flows uh it's about how much of block space the product that blockade blockchains create are you selling versus what if this cost of the sale through issuance um and um and through other uh other other kind of transaction fees so that is Bitcoin uh what about this other leg up which we've seen which is these AI tokens yeah um here's a headline from coindesk the AI token search traffic spikes as crypto Traders seek exposure what in the world are AI tokens David and should I buy some there are a certain class of tokens that are uh at various levels of relevancy to the world of AI uh most of them are not very related to Ai and like some people people are looking for it how do I get exposure to Ai and so they're going and buying AI crypto tokens the level of how much ai's actually integrated into these assets and actually meaningfully giving AI exposure to these assets it's extremely suspect which brings me to my take which uh uh which are some of these tokens so like um singularitynet ciscoin fetch.ai brain chain is a 2017 Ico darling token which I have not heard since then I mean we're looking at seven days of about 160 first polarity uh net yeah and so you're saying like it's basically there's a narrative which is chat GTP um is really cool and so so is crypto and now these like AI tokens are kind of taking that narrative are you saying it's basically a narrative trade it's basically a meme trade because this is this is a tweet that I put out and I didn't really expect this tweet to get over a thousand likes I just put this out there but I guess it it ticked and ticked the right nerve with certain people if you want to thank you uh let's make something clear is what I say there's no material integration between Ai and crypto you cannot put AI into a blockchain you cannot make a token that has AI in it that doesn't make any sense uh Ai and so I make the claim that AIS AI tokens are meme tokens it is just a narrative trade it's just a meme trade not too dissimilar from deutschkone there are ways like numeri is a token that legitimately does use real AI to achieve its end goals but it's the end goal that you should want exposure to not the fact that it just uses AI does that make sense are you saying that totally makes sense are you saying this is a dumb Market this is a meme trade there is no such thing as a it's a meme trading you know uh chat GPT from the blockchain yeah gbt on the blockchain okay train though or chain would uh I if at a certain volume you're going to see that yeah I'm sure we're gonna see that this cycle uh you know what is kind of cool though is a bright spot in the market too is nft Phi it's processing record number of loans so are people lending and borrowing against their nfts now I know that was a an idea that we started talking about about two years ago and now we're actually seeing it in the numbers 18 000 eth borrowed in January that's a lot of eth David that's a lot of eth 444 million dollars in monthly volume in January from Ni and nft lending so this is using your nfts as collateral to borrow uh Ben Dow heads volumes of 36 million dollars four thousand four hundred loans were made in January which is almost double the the previous Peak so nft lending coming into the the world the numbers are up bigly I gotta say David despite the detractors nfts are still um pretty strong during the spare market and we're seeing an actual nft 5 usage of nfts um it hasn't collapsed the way some people thought it would nfts are doing pretty well well there's a there's a huge amount of capital quote unquote that's like locked up okay so like there's a big difference between something like the United States and the legal system that we have in the United States and like third world countries and the legal system there a lot of people in third world countries or you know countries with inadequate legal systems can't use their house uh as like as collateral they can't get a mortgage on their house just because they don't have assurances the legal system isn't set up America does have that and so people can use the value of their house to access capital and this has been a huge Boon of wealth for America that's why one of the reasons why America is so great is because our legal system allows us to tap into Capital this is the same fact we're applying this to nfts previous to now and if the capital that's locked up in value of your nft your 100 your 100 ether crypto Punk or your 100 ether uh board ape you can't access that Capital without selling it with nft Fi you can access that Capital without selling it and so there is a wealth effect that is generated for all of the nft holders because they are you able to use Smart contracts to tap into the capital of their assets and outside importantly this is outside the bounds of a nation state so it doesn't matter where you live you know another way to describe what you talked about this kind of legal assurances settlement issue settlement assurances effectively what legal assurances are and ethereum gives us stronger settlement assurances too David we got a lot more to cover what's coming up next coming up next did you have money in Gemini earned because you might be getting your money back State yeah Ryan some good news so Ryan stay tuned I'll tell you exactly how much you might be getting back okay uh in bad news though operation choke point promises to take crypto Bank lists but in the bearish way uh perhaps crypto's biggest regulatory threat ever and the Manhunt is on for doe Quan meanwhile Kyle Davies is ignoring the subpoena for the three arrows Capital lawsuit Bag Boys Bad Boys on the scene all of this stuff and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode

cheap and friction free David is the Biden Administration coming after crypto what is Operation choke point and what is happening what's been the stir this week as we've learned more about what the administration's doing yeah operation choke point is a historical something in history not to do with crypto that really just talks about how government institutions government administrations can use the banking sector to debank industries that they find unappetizing so Nick Carter is tweeting out I don't want to raise the alarm I don't want to sound alarmed but since the turn of the year a new operation choke point type operation has been targeting the crypto space in the US it is a well-coordinated effort to marginalize the industry and cut off its connectivity to the banking system and it it's working the original operation checkpoint was like an Obama era thing you know 20 yeah 2012 and 2013 and it was like targeted towards you know all the kind of gambling yeah all the all the um uh the poker yeah websites yeah kind of shut down almost overnight and then which is why they started to use Bitcoin that was a big big impotence of Bitcoin adoption and then then it was expanded later into other you know nefarious uh Industries you know the marijuana industry and and others like it so now what Nick Carter is saying is basically there's going to be an operation choke point 2.0 indeed it's already begun and this time in the Target sites is the crypto industry and he's brought some evidence to the table too so what what are some facts that he uh he mentions that are relevant to this uh case yeah so he wrote this fantastic blog post uh and just I'll read some of the experts here experts here to give it give the summary see he begins what began is as a trickle is now a flood and by the way all of these events have happened in the last two months or so the US government is using the banking sector to organize a sophisticated widespread Crackdown against the crypto industry and the administration's efforts are no secret they've expressed plainly in memos regulatory guidance and blog posts however the breadth of this plan spanning virtually every Financial regulator as well as its highly coordinated Nature has even most of these Steely eyed crypto veterans nervous that the crypto businesses might end up completely unbanked stable coins may be stranded and unable to manage Flows In and Out of crypto and exchanges might be shut off from the banking system entirely the Biden Administration is now executing what appears to be a coordinated plan that spans multiple agencies to discourage Banks from dealing with crypto firms it applies both to traditional Banks who would serve crypto clients and crypto first firms aiming to get Bank Charters this effort includes the administration itself influential members of Congress the fed the FDIC the ooc and the doj so there's inter-governmental agency coordination here so then Nick goes on to list off some of the events that have shown this effort on December 7th signature which is a active Bank serving crypto clients announces its intent to have deposits ascribed to crypto clients which basically means they'll give customers their money back and shut down their accounts drawing is crypto deposits down from 23 billion at the peak to just under 10 billion as its exited stablecoin businesses I've had this happen to me by the way they just sent you a Dear John Letter and say yeah can you eject see you later yep no due process on January 3rd the fed the FDIC and the OCC releases a joint statement on the risks to Banks engaging with crypto not explicitly Banning bank's ability to hold crypto or deal with crypto clients but strongly discouraging them from doing so on a safety and soundness basis January 9th Silver Gate stock which is probably crypto's biggest bank one of the only banks in the United States Bank the exchanges and such yeah the stock Falls to a low of 11.55 on Bank Run and insolvency fears after having traded as high as 160 dollars in in March of 2022 January 27th the Federal Reserve denies crypto Bank custodia's two-year application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System citing safety and soundness risk safety and soundness is a really occurring theme here uh 27th of January again the National Economic Council releases a policy statement not explicitly Banning Banks from serving crypto clients but strongly discouraging Banks from transacting with crypto assets directly or maintaining exposure to crypto depositors February 2nd Department of Justice Fraud Unit announces investigation into silvergate over their relationship with FTX and Alameda February 6 binance suspends USD Bank transfers for all retail clients January 27th the FED issues a policy statement which discourages banks from holding crypto assets or issuing stable coins and broadens their authority to cover non-fdic insured State chartered banks on February 7th that same statement I just talked about is entered into the Federal Register turning the policy statement into a final rule with no Congressional review or public notice or comment period and lastly there's more I'm just pulling out the big ones as as February 8th protego and paxos's applications to follow Anchorage and obtain full approval to become National Trust Banks are outstanding past the 18th month's deadline and appear likely to be imminently denied by the OCC so hopefully this gives you just a flavor of how broad and coordinated and intentful this effort to debank the crypto industry has become we can you can tell why it's called operation choke point is because the banking sector that the the state largely controls the the US largely controls and the executive branch can apply pressure to is is choking off the crypto industry uh Nick says this too in some banks taking deposits from crypto clients issuing stable coins engaging in crypto custody or seeking to hold crypto as principal have faced nothing short of an onslaught from Regulators in recent weeks time and again using the expression safety and soundness there it is again they've made it clear that for a bank touching public blockchains in any way it should be considered unacceptably risky do not touch in a blockchain banking industry or we will come after you that is the uh the message that the executive branch is sending right now yeah the whole strongly discouraging them is basically it just like uh don't do that and you want to get investigated yeah we do yeah exactly it's like as not a threat that's also a threat uh Jake Stravinsky who is a lawyer that both Ryan and I trust very very much great great guy uh he tweets out this is accurate talking about Nick's take without new legislation from Congress federal agencies lack the authority to comprehensively regulate crypto markets so their fallback position is to weaponize control over the banking system to mandate discrimination against crypto companies this must stop that's what it is it's mandated to discriminate discrimination isn't it against crypto against the industry uh this is Senator Bill Hagerty who tweets out Regulators signals Regulators singling out business activities should alarm all Americans it doesn't matter if it's crypto assets Firearms or any other lawful business using using banking Regulators to advance political agendas should not be tolerated yes thank you Senator Bill Haggerty appreciate the take that's great I'm glad you're a senator look um I think this is apolitical right if if it wasn't the Biden Administration then maybe it would be the Trump Administration and obviously people in crypto Bank list would come down just as hard on that industry this is about using the banking system to uh undemocratically control certain industries and to restrict us from the ability to freely transact with our money that I think is a breach of American values of our constitutionally uh granted Liberties and should not cannot be tolerated and it's seeping in it's not a declared policy but we can see the effects in the last few months and I do think David look SBF didn't do us any favors did he all of this kind of gave those who maybe already wanted to come after crypto an excuse to come do it yes no one can stand in our way now crypto is uh you know clearly a scam that we have to we have perfect cover in order to execute this operation choke point all we have to do is say SPF the name FTX and we'll get whatever we want that's what seems to be happening yeah there's absolutely no coincidence that this started right after uh FTX and the the powers that be were just asking for an excuse to to do some of this stuff um and also it should hit really close to home because what we're doing in crypto is Building Systems that intentionally cannot do this like this is what we are trying to prevent freedom to transact no political control over money and economics so this this isn't just like oh they're coming for crypto this is exactly what crypto is standing up to remove the powers of and it was your take last week Ryan that I really really liked separate government from money separate money from separate Finance from political Powers thanks for that James Madison I gotta give credit to that guy I think he has great important things to say on the subject yeah so also this is sort of related sort of unrelated but it seems like local Bitcoins is closing down that's certainly a shame uh local Bitcoins was a way for you to exchange Bitcoins using the internet as kind of a facilitator but actually meeting up in person and doing a kind of a swap in person it was it was completely Craigslist for Bitcoin peer-to-peer right um in the analog way so it's like it's like trading cash for crypto and you would meet up and somebody would give you cash and hit you they would swap for crypto so you would have to like meet with this person they're also like you could have a third party um uh custody person if you wanted to have that as well but like I mean you can kind of get why governments don't want this but also it's cash and we should be able to trade cash well I don't know if this was this is not related this is just local Bitcoins I think had to close a while ago uh a long time ago uh there was um uh government regulation specifically going after local it's over over maybe over two years ago so big local Bitcoins has been like in the crosshairs of Regulation before well it's not only local Bitcoins it might be uh institutions that provide staking in the US this just happened um before we recorded this the day before our recording from Brian Armstrong we're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the US for retail customers I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S if that was allowed to happen Brian goes on talking about how it will drive uh staking offshore will not help the U.S uh on its path towards becoming a more Innovative economy it will set us back all of these things again the SEC is another branch of the executive you know so this would fit into the whole Narrative of operation choke point um this is still a rumor Brian Armstrong says but the fact that he tweeted it means that he wanted to make a statement he wanted to get the news out there David can you imagine if Gary Chancellor in the SEC came after staking in the U.S retail staking so that almost implies that if you're wealthy you can stake so it's basically like another discrimination discrimination against the poor sorry you know your pleb you're too poor to steak um it also remains to be seen if this would extend outside of kind of the institutional staking of of a coinbase for example or a centralized exchange and would it extend to like a rocket pool David would it extend to a Lido would it extend to a home validator that you're running can you imagine that what a breach of uh our liberties that would be if that happened you must do it through an institution give it a break like I I I I don't even know this is again it's rumor and I feel like some of this is um obviously Twitter is kind of optimized for maximum fud it's probably not as as bad as it all sounds but it's clear something is going on here and we need to brace ourselves we need to be ready for it yeah when Brian tweets out something like this when he starts to tweet thread and the Tweet thread says we're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto Psych in the U.S like coinbase lawyers are connected this isn't this isn't Brian just like oh I heard a rumor this is coinbase's lawyers who absolutely know something who's like Brian we need to use your messaging and platform and and Twitter account to broadcast this to the rest of the industry this is so like we're hearing rumors this is the rumors are substantial I can almost guarantee you that this is uh definitely the US's loss and people are saying well this is the end of crypto and the US can choke off crypto it actually can't choke off crypto uh it can choke off the US the US can't kill crypto but the US can kill the us if it wants to age old line is you cannot ban Bitcoin you can only ban your citizens from accessing Bitcoin and there's a difference there 100 you are just doing a disservice to your own citizens there's more from Gensler this week uh I can't believe this headline you want to read it out yeah uh so you think it stops at staking Ryan uh Gensler states that nfts are a Gateway token uh appearing before the students of George Washington High School SEC chair again Jerry genzler called and if he's a Gateway token during his speech about the dangers of crypto the talk was a One-Stop shop on a campaign called just say no to crypto bro which gives your design to warn younger Generations about cryptocurrency you didn't give me that time David no I didn't get you that I read this in the agenda ahead of time so uh what's this from this is not true this is not true although if you believed it you would be remissed because other things that Gary Gensler have said has been like this so if you believed that without noticing that this was a rug congratulations you got rugged uh this is a product out of the bank list dial the rug is basically the onion of crypto you can go to therug.mirror.xyz last week we just started doing this last week was the second time we did it Ryan got rugged and he's the one who pulls up the links in the first place I know imagine that it makes it even better uh and so uh there's a bunch of other headlines check them out they're really great there's a link in the show notes you can also collect this rug this is a collectible rug you can collect this rug remember kids just saying I thought this was great I thought this is awesome good one uh Genesis versus dcg David am I gonna get my money from Gemini earn how how much how soon give me the Deeds the is not not completely locked in stone but people have done some math they've done some napkin math and come up with a number of about 80 percent under the current proposal Genesis creditors expected to receive 80 recovery under the current proposal uh this decrypt article states that uh there's a Genesis Global revealed our new restructuring plan between Genesis and digital currency group their their conglomerate which enables creditors to get their money back so where are all the funds coming from how is dcg and Genesis coming up with the funds to make Genesis creditors whole well first off Genesis of course has some funds they didn't go to zero they have some funds to start with in addition to the funds that Genesis has dcg is also selling Genesis global trading and so they will generate some money for that in addition to that dcg is also exchanging its existing notes amounting to 1.1 billion dollars for stock and refinancing one billion dollars of loans so it's getting money that way and they are also moving to sell block box of shares in the trust that they have so they have a Litecoin trust they have a Bitcoin cash trust they have an ethereum classic trust I don't know why they have an ethereum classic trust they also have a digital large fund cap and so they hold their own Assets in their trust and so they are selling their trust funds on the Open Market at a large discount by the way uh and so people are buying these trust assets for very significant discounts of the Net Present Value in the actual trust and with all of this selling and an additional Ryan 100 million dollars from Gemini to make its own earned customers whole again to pay for the fault of Genesis all of that is coming up to about 80 cents on the dollar so this is the napkin math that has been calculated if you are a Genesis creditor and that includes Gemini earned customers you are perhaps going to get 80 cents on the dollar probably not soon but maybe hopefully this year do you know what I this feels like a very adult thing to do everyone took risk everyone gets a little bit of a haircut all right uh DC including customers including customers I I use Gemini urn it was risky uh you know before I deposited I knew I was getting into I feel like I should get a haircut for this sure uh not 100 haircut please please crypto Gods how do you feel about that 20 haircut um fine I'm I'm not gonna say I deserved it um but I kind of like it wasn't a bankless thing to do the the reason that I I've used some of these centralized exchanges is just to kind of test them and compare them versus defy um it's not a large amount of money for for me I think for some people the lesson will be much more uh painful because they had a large portion of their funds inside of these accounts they weren't using them in the way I was using them and that does feel a little lopsided and unfair but still what happened was dcg is taking a big haircut which they should Gemini is acknowledging some culpability and uh you know um contributing to this and depositors take care of it much different than what's going to happen with Celsius and block fi I don't know if you're going to get anything from Celsius I don't know because Alex machinsky totally rugged you block five you're making something I don't think we're gonna get anything close to 80 from either of those cases um so it's uh it's unfortunate but I'm glad that both the winklevosses and Barry silbert could kind of come to terms on this and figure this out there's a lot of back and forth publicly on Twitter before this happened but this seems to be a reasonably good outcome for depositors so uh look this was the last Domino to fall and it feels like now it's fully Fallen we dealt with 2022 can we some can we safely say that now David well now we have to deal with all the regulatory blowback but the crypto side of things coming to a close just I'll just say that um the winklevy Twins and Gemini kind of get a lot of flack but I mean they don't have to put up 100 million dollars and but they are anyways and so I just want to give them some quick props yeah that's good it was also probably a good business decision I mean they didn't come out of this looking uh looking clean so that's maybe the uh the cynical view of it but uh yeah it's um it's good good outcome David what do we got coming up next coming up next arbitrum enables devs to byol what's byol Ryan ah is that does that stand for bring your own language David no it doesn't you just made that up but that is what's happening I wanted to say guys thank you yeah exactly yeah Lido V2 brings lado's path towards decentralization uh maker Dao releases a financial performance report we're talking about the a16z governance cartel uh as well as a number of other really cool stuff uh stay tuned for all of that very cool stuff and more but first a moment to talk some to some of these fantastic sponsors that makes the show possible uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and uniswap's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts the Phantom wallet is coming to ethereum the number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved ux to ethereum and polygon if you haven't used Phantom before you've been missing out Phantom was one of the first wallets to Pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon but that's just staking Phantom is also the best home for your nfts Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your nft experience pin your favorites hide the Uglies remove the spam and also manage your nft sale listings from inside the wallet Phantom is of course a multi-chain wallet but it makes chain management easy displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or fishing websites Phantom has already saved over 20 000 users from getting scammed or hacked so get on the Phantom waitlist and be one of the first to access the multi-chain beta there's a link in the show notes or you can go to phantom.app waitlist to get access in late February byol David I'm going to say it again bring your own language that's what is doing at least that's what I interpreted can you talk about this big development upgrade I know some of the folks from Prismatic Labs now part of the arbitrum ecosystem are very excited about it but what's happening in arbitrim world so arbitrary is announcing stylus which is what they are calling a next-gen programming environment upgrade for the arbitrum chains arbitrum 1 and arbitrum Nova what is stylus Silas uses webassembly to prove all kind of programming languages and run smart contracts on arbitrum using languages like rust C C plus plus Haskell python the move programming languages from Aptos and sui will now using stylus you can use that on arbitrum so the idea here is both arbitrum and optimism have gone after what we call evm equivalents but that is really optimizing for solidity what Stylus is is perhaps like a sidecar these attachments plugins that uses webassembly and webassembly lets you use any programming language which is why Ryan has created this term bring your own language which has never been stuttered before in the history of ever and so this is why Arbitrage is calling this evm plus as an evm plus literally every other program it's pretty awesome this has never been done before this is a very big deal it is awesome if you're not a developer and you don't know that that the Haskell in Python and C plus plus and everything that David mentioned this is a really big deal like if you're interested in trying to do this for a long time it compiles all down to the evm but you can bring your you can bring your own language the third time I got that in nice uh so uh it's pretty cool I don't know if I'll be able to do it with like I've got a little bit of HTML experience and you know you're Myspace yeah you think I can thanks that's how old I am where do you think I learned HTML it's from Myspace on MySpace yeah I remember we were talking about geocities one time though and you're like what's GEOS okay the the OG's the internet OG's listing no no what geocities was um take my word for it uh yeah this is how you can date Ryan and date David that's during the Myspace days and uh yeah well here we are now um there's more going on in the dev ecosystem that is good news though too tell me about starkware they're open sourcing their prover technology that sounds like some geek speak please uh Bank let's explain it to me David so uh ZK Roll-Ups which is what sarcore is uh require provers uh optimistic Roll-Ups require fraud proofs uh ZK bullets require provers and stockware has announced their plan to open source their approver which will allow individuals to review the code detect bugs transparency all the stuff this is a one of the critical steps for the decentralization of our layer twos however it's kind of the step that is the most esoteric and if more people didn't know about the proofer that would be kind of okay because it's kind of Niche but it's still important nonetheless um notably they did not actually announce when they would do this they said that they would uh open sources at the time that they needed to decentralize net but uh they still a good step it's kind of an announcement of an announcement they announced that they're committing to it which I think we actually kind of assumed anyways David this was really cool um maker Dow they released a financial performance report on the protocol all right and uh this is all an ipfs this is so cool because it reminds me of like just like you know how you look up a a 10K or quarterly earnings report for uh your favorite stock at least I used to do that back in the day it's my favorite activity is it really this is the equivalent I mean but like it's so it's so cool look at these key financial results for the maker protocol this is all on-chain revenue that they're able to kind of generate these reports from and then put it on ipfs these are unstoppable organizations that's what a Dao is it's an Unstoppable I'll put an air quotes Corporation on ethereum doesn't have a jurisdiction I could go on about this but what do you think was cool about it for the podcast listeners who aren't looking at the screen uh what we're looking at on screen is a financial statement report that looks exactly like what a boomer would love to see this is a this is a speaking Boomer talk uh tradfy talk this is a financial statement report for the maker protocol again hosted on ipfs which is pretty damn cool and it is organized with just like in the in the way that an Excel sheet in like year ending year over year all these terms net operating earnings total operating expenses total net revenues blah blah blah blah all of these things that would make tradfy able to understand what's going on here yeah yeah by the way Banker listeners and for all the Baby Boomers listening right now when David says the term Boomer sometimes he's using that as a term of endearment and that was that's half the time I'd say yeah David uh calls me or I talk about like taxes or I talk about like things that adults want to do things yeah and uh so I I hope you took that as a compliment that is just I'm doing some intergenerational translation here yeah maturity it's like people require mature reports about what's going on in Dubai adult things adult things yes all right um what do we got yes a boomer things and adult things are are mostly not all but mostly synonymous here we go uh a16z they voted against a proposal to deploy the latest uniswap iteration on the BNB chain flexing their token governance power a lot of people were upset about this uh can you tell us about the controversy and and some of the takes here yeah so people are uh gearing this up as a VC versus VC governance War so it's a16z versus jump crypto a16c backs and this has to do with a bridge that would uh that connects um uh the governance uh the uni vote between the Wormhole Bridge so like Wormhole is backed by jump uh a16z backs layer zero but there was a propos there's a proposal to put um uniswap on BNB and then there was some controversy over what bridge that they would use is this right this is well this is what people are assuming is being fought over so ACC and Z wants unit swap to use the layer zero Bridge which is their product that they invested in Jump wants you don't swap to use the Wormhole Bridge which is what jump invested in and so now these evc's are fighting over this um I don't actually I don't think jump crypto voted with their tokens but it was the uh Wormhole bridge that was used in this proposal which a16z used its governance power to veto uh and so uh the debate about this which Bridge views is partly about security because we all know the dangers of layer one uh cross layer one Bridges um a16c used 15 million of their uni tokens to vote against the Wormhole bridge for the uni swap V3 deployment uh so you have to take on this some people are outraged calling this an A6 Z cartel what's your take yeah so I'll give my take at the end this is a Steven's tweet uh Doge toasty From the Block uh and a quote from the community that he's quoting says if a16z goes against the community vote and tries to tank it I'd be shocked that would be truly abhorrent I don't think that they would go that far and then he follows up uh with you know narrator they went that for but that far because that's that's what they did however uh there is Eddie lazarin who I believe is at uh a16z who tweets out this uh seeing many false claims about a16z's cryptos voting power in unswap Foundation governance let me clear it up a16z we delegate 40 million votes to outside groups with no conditions on how they vote we vote with 15 million tokens less than half of what we've delegated to others so a16z has given their governance power of the majority of their tokens to others and they say that they don't have any influence over their vote and so the a16z used 15 million of their uni tokens to vote on The Proposal that they wanted and that swayed the vote and it the thing is it though they were the only ones that really voted for the no to reject almost everyone else voted yes which is why this is a controversial but I mean the vast majority of Voters just tokens didn't vote at all very good point like a minority of total voters how do I feel like this is a a VC cartel yeah not really I'm kind of like mad about this whole thing what do you what's your take my take is similar I think it's kind of like it's it's token voting like this is right yeah the protocol states that those with the majority of tokens uh win the vote is literally what it says um I I think people need to realize that some of the decentralization and the token voting around these protocols um is like actually not pure decentralization and the most decentralized part of uniswap is the code that runs uniswap right that's it after that you have varying degrees of decentralization or centralization this token vote is very similar to the governance mechanism for publicly traded companies or for any uh pool of capital that has kind of some sort of shareholder vote so I've never exalted the idea of token vote in my mind and thought that this was somehow some Panacea and somehow more decentralized than uh shareholder voting models I've always thought that look it's just the shareholding shareholder voting model that we if we poured it into into crypto we're not making that part of things any more decentralized so decentralization that's really the issue here it's it's that a16z win against the community they are they are they have like yeah right they are the community they are the community yeah like that's that's the deal and also to to give the pro side of the a16z argument just another one more line is like yo like let's not discount how cautious and conservative that we should be when it comes to which cross-train layer one bridge that we should support uh and if a16z who has the resources and Manpower and Technical uh capacities to vet the security of cross train Bridges feel that the Wormhole bridge is insecure which has already been hacked once by the way um not to say that their Bridge layer zero can't be hacked but if that's what their expert opinion is they have the resources in the world much more than the community the the retail of the world to actually vet that bridge and so yeah I think we should actually appreciate some of their abilities to do due diligence Beyond retail we should consider it for sure and for for those who are saying oh look at Ryan and David are now a16z apologists no that's what we're saying PC apologists like um the ultimate remedy for this is the ability to go Fork the uniswap code and spin up your own uniswap um the decentralization of uniswap is that a16z no matter how hard they ever tried cannot shut down the code and turn the thing off or ban you from using uniswap that is the decentralization that that makes uniswap actually bankless and so governance layer aside I think there are far more ways to preserve the decentralization of protocols that are built on crypto versus the real world David what's going on in the nft world I see a tweet here from Lincoln Park what are we looking at yeah they have a new music video lost which is getting a ton of attention and hype uh the reason why it's relevant is that uh the Beloved artist people pleaser the the artist that created the uniswap V3 x times y equals K nft movie which created pleaser Dao which is already also done so much stuff people pleaser the artist uh created the directed the music video for lost for Linkin Park uh uh congrats uh people Pleasers a dear friend of mine uh I think she's becoming probably one of the iconic nft artists of this base uh the fact that she's working with uh Lincoln Park I think is fantastic you know what else she's done Ryan um before she came into the world of crypto she did the um cinematic shorts for Diablo 4. no way yeah Diablo has some epic cinematics that's amazing yeah she she did she does Killer so is there an nft related to this at all is sorry is this going to be an nft uh I actually can I buy this actually oh this is all about people pleaser this is all about people pleaser yeah okay all right so I don't believe that there is an nft but the it's it's people pleaser and also her startup Shibuya who's kind of like a uh Choose Your Own Adventure type of a Production Studio so their Community does have tokens nfts and using those tokens you can choose the outcome of what this production company will make their story like uh so Shibuya is also part of this music video for Linkin Park so just an overall success for uh people pleaser and Shibuya the a crypto defy nft native team so that's how it's related David so coffeezilla is somebody who exposes scammers and is been doing a lot of scam exposing in the crypto space lately uh this is a tweet from coffeezilla just just earlier this week we just tricked Dylan danis into promoting a fake nft project we paid a thousand dollars to post he didn't disclose it was an ad and posted copy that literally spells out s-k-a-m that's a scam scam that's not how you spell scam how do you spell scam David he's followed with a k s c a m now the scam the word scam David so he's promoting uh he got again coffee Zilla told Dylan Dan says hey we'll pay you a thousand dollars to promote this it's our nft project it's called sours candies are moon bound s-c-a-m and then Dylan just tweets this out check this out sauer's nft Kenny's are moon bound uh hashtag not Financial advice and then sours nft.com uh what this man did not do Ryan if you scroll down is that he did not go to the website so coffeezilla follows up and says the entire project is fake and if you mint it it takes you to the website devoted to all the scams that he has done in the past he being Dylan Dan is the guy that's tweeting this out he's still in Dennis some some MMA fighter related not relevant all right um they made a website that is of all of these scams that Dylan danis has promoted and then they paid him to to promote this token mint and the token website was actually this website that was about how all of daily Danish has promoted scams so the guy didn't even check the link wow and he did it for a thousand dollars right for a thousand dollars how much would you sell your uh reputation Integrity for David at least two thousand dollars he's low pulling himself I mean what do you think what do you think of this kind of like Honeypot activity by people like coffeezilla like uh baiting the influencers and I think it's awesome do it more yeah oh yeah please uh I you know I will say this may be a good time to show our disclosures bankless.com disclosures I actually think we do a pretty good job of this David which is I think we have the best disclosures in the crypto industry I don't know if anyone who has more uh strict disclosures than we impose on ourselves if you see somebody that's better um send them to us because let us know because we'll beat them yeah we'll we'll want to change it we will one up here well Anthony uh anyway you can see um all the sponsors for bankless uh individual Investments that we have Investments of people on our team uh disclosures of bankless LLC anyway it's all there and I I think this is really important to hold people who have influence in society to this type of a standard and we don't have kind of the regulations or the you know the ad police not necessarily I don't necessarily want that either either but I do want disclosure to be a social Norm across all of crypto I think that's really important um 100 David FTX tell us about the bad boy so let's start with SPF and then get to dokwon what's happening with SPF uh this is just FTX debtors want their political donations back so FTX debtors are sending confidential notes apparently not that confidential because we heard about them to the recipients of donations from FTX as lawyers review 93 million dollars in political contributions as part of the bankruptcy case so they are sending out all of the political figures or entities or whatever to saying them hey that money that FTX donated to you uh you should give it back give it give it back yeah because it wasn't him so politicians who received contributions linked to FTX should return the money by February 28th some political groups have already taken steps to return the money the Democratic National Committee and Senate and House campaign committees have set aside a million dollars in cash and to return to bankruptcy lawyers as well as others as there is Justice in the world David this is good news um oh and this is also uh if you don't do this uh that just means that FCX is going to go to court to claw back the fun so this is like volunteer to do this now or we take you to court to clot back so this is like just the easy way exactly that's exactly right yeah there was a rumor going on earlier this week speaking of FDX that uh the Super Bowl was going to ban cryptocurrency TV commercials now I don't think that's true yeah that said David I don't expect to see many if any crypto commercials this year and that was such a contrast I remember last year at this time this exact roll up last year we were excited about anticipating it was we had an article about it right and just after it and in fact I hate to say this now it sounds terrible but you gotta give FTX credit at least they're whoever did their ads they actually had the best ads they had last year I mean it's on brand for the scam to have the best one like they're all marked out right I mean it was such a well done scam wasn't it I mean like SPF pulled pulled that part of it off uh anyway but there's coinbase there was who else there was um itoro there's a whole bunch of them last year none of that this Budweiser had shout outs to crypto projects they had the nouns goggles uh which was uh the most what would I call tasteful and just well-researched way of putting crypto into your your I don't think there's a way that like wouldn't offend normies because I don't know what those the noggles were the nouns goggles but all the crypto people knew this is for uh those in the US if you're watching the Super Bowl this weekend if you notice a Super Bowl commercial about crypto then tweet bankless I want to hear about them if you see anything subtle in the Super Bowls this weekend isn't it [Music] it's sometime in February oh it is oh my God it's the 12th yeah I had no [ __ ] big sports fans over here no idea but you do you know but the rumor was it was that uh crypto ads are crypto ads in the Super Bowl are banned yeah they're not banned um two companies they just don't have any money yeah all the money fell through so two other companies were on the one yard line they said uh quote from the article before the collapse of FTX and then that created the nft the NFL uh motivated to look elsewhere for their ads uh and so it's not banned it's just like all the deals fell through can we find this guy though Daquan we talked about SPF uh where's he uh unknown and that is what Korean officials are who they're looking for him so a Korean officials traveled to Serbia to the far reachers of Serbia last week to help seek who is a fugitive uh so a long time ago an arrest warrant he's still tissued yeah dude he's still Tweeting man they can't yeah like somehow track an IP address and like figure out I don't know man are they trying to know how hard are they trying there's an international red notice out for his arrest which means that like yo all governments who are anything uh if you find this guy arrest him so people are are going as far as Serbia to find Oakland like there's only a matter of time like we're gonna we're gonna get this guy so gone's going to jail yeah real small world hard to hide um Kyle Davies is also hiding David what's this headline yeah so a few weeks ago we covered the Twitter subpoena because Kyle Davies was also still Tweeting and so since they couldn't find the man they just tweeted out his subpoena because they knew that he was still Tweeting uh and so a quote from this article a quote from one of the attorneys says he is without question aware of the subpoena having been tagged in 41 replies and 64 retweets one of those was mine and has once again chosen to ignore his duties to three arrows Capital says Russell Crumpler and Christopher he's been taking interviews seeing the bankruptcy training firm um yeah well Davies was taking interviews like at least a couple months ago he did remember he's raising to to build an experience I mean he's just doing this blatantly it's like hey all of the charges that I'm probably guilty for I'm not going to answer to meanwhile I'm going to stay in Dubai and raise for my new phone so do you want to invest in myself did I share my DMs with him with you he messaged me dude Kyle I'm gonna pull up my DMs right now on my phone hold on uh Kyle Davies when did he message me Monday January 30th hey David hope you're well Sue and I are launching open exchange soon it would be great to get your feedback if you're free this week what does Kyle Davies expect from me dude I am not your friend I hope you told him you were free okay so I was joking with a few friends it's like yeah I'll do this but I'm also bringing on five of my friends and we're gonna roast you as as you talk but uh I don't think he'd be interested yes not probably not appealing to him right now I think he wants to um Pitch his company meanwhile this is going on consensus is fighting to get staking uh tax-free essentially they're backing a lawsuit against the IRS over taxing staked crypto and here's the arguments basically some appellates are arguing the position that staking rewards should not be considered taxable income because there's no employer that's doubling them out it's a protocol it's not employed it's just code they should instead be considered effectively self-generated or created Property and there actually is some precedent for this David it's similar to a farmer who grows crops staking rewards are created by the protocol to incentivize participating in providing security for the protocol so created Property is not taxed until sale right now the tax treatment of a staked income most people assume are of staked um either or any asset most people assume is just as income so you receive it has income and it's taxable income the same way a salary might be in your job well this argument is happening in the court system right now is that it should be treated more like growing crops and when you grow more crops those aren't that's not a tax event it remains to be seen whether this holds up in court but um that would be incredible if it did that would mean all of the staked uh all of the staked Revenue that people receive is not actually taxable at the time they receive I love those words yeah just when you sell just when you sell yeah we'll see I'm rooting for him that makes too much sense David it's ship season what are we ship season what do we got oh my God so much Lido V2 path towards decentralization a new architecture for Lido that is supposed to be the architecture that allows for Lido to accept anyone to be a validator in the lotto system it is a big step is one of the biggest steps that lydo has needed to take for a long time to open up light out to more permissionless validation so anyone not just a permission set of validators can join the lotto Dao this is also where Technologies like DVT come into play and this is also how Lido can become a more modular and composable so that is really cool because that's right huge a bit more like rocketpool yeah in that direction so this is much more similar to stakewise's design philosophy but overall the same ethos is applied here uh and so we like this this is more decentralization from what is previously been by some hardliners in the community fixes Lido's to centralized nature so there's that Ave go gho is their stable coin is now on the Gorly test net so another decentralized stable coin is coming to play to follow after makers die curved stablecoin is also coming soon there's elements hyperdrive element is an interest rate uh vehicle inside of inside of D5 totally permissionless it has previously been plagued by having to spit pick a very specific term and having to fragment liquidity across all those different pools hyperdrive is fitting into this theme that I've been noticing Ryan where a lot of these defy apps that have to segment liquidity and pick different terms like live refinance compels into this camp they have found a way to put and pool all liquidity together and allow for any term length for any sort of market and so much more uh just much a better stronger evolution of what element is trying to do congratulations to element uh there is infinity pools which Dan ellitzer who is I got one of these Giga brains when it comes to just like crypto economic on the app layer protocols uh so uh infinity pools is out there and Dan elitzer says this is by far one of the most interesting things I've seen built on top of uni V3 any asset unlimited leverage no oracles no liquidations no counterparty risk nailing the ux will be tricky he says but this design is this design is a very cool breakthrough and what I thought was not possible in defy I have not yet looked into infinity pools but I definitely want to because Dan's something like this I I pay attention mean finance mean mean Finance is a dollar cost averaging tool in D5 so dollar cost averaging without a bank have introduced their meta aggregator so you know all the dexes Ryan uh unit swap Sushi swap et cetera well they have Dex aggregators right like matcha and one inch yeah well mean Finance is a DEX aggregator aggregator so it's it's recursing one more time uh if you want to connect to metamask and and try this out yeah so I just connect my metamask wallet here let me do that connect and this will allow me to dollar cost average in to crypto position so I could mean find it so that is the invest tab over there on the left yes but you can also swap now with mean finances Dex aggregator aggregator this is awesome and this is you know in our opinion the the most foolproof way to uh build positions in crypto is a dollar cost average over time yeah I believe mean finances on multiple networks including polygon I think is fantastic so rare and we're not done yet with the ship season so rare uh partners with the Premier League which I think is a big deal the football fans check me on this Premier League sounds pretty Premiere uh so from the article football fans from around the world can now collect buy sell and trade officially licensed digital cards featuring every player from across the Premier League's 20 clubs I'm assuming this is like well the premiere league of football uh I'm assuming this is a big deal for football first I think it is a big deal David I definitely do you know it I am striking out on my sports stuff this is the uh the tech behind this is um starkware right ZK technology behind this which is the thing that you and I geek over about um football the sports stuff is kind of lost on users David with all this shipping going on uh that means there's been a lot of building and to build we need people in crypto the bankless jobs board is popping been a couple weeks since we told you about it but remember bankless.palot.com is where you can see some jobs I'm gonna shout some out uniswap Labs they're looking for a senior software engineer of a protocols bankless we need a social growth lead and also at bank list needs a producer we want a growth marketer senior back-end typescript engineer and investment Associates a lot of things we're hiring for consensus is hiring what's a director of engineering Adidas are you kidding me wait we have Adidas on the jobs board yeah Global head web3 strategy and planning bullish oh God I'm like so bored I could do this uh pre-po a senior web 3 front-end engineer there's a whole bunch more go check it out bankless.pallet.com jobs David what's coming up next coming up next we got some questions from the nation we're going to talk about ZK EVMS as well as account abstraction which has dominated my brain lately and then we've got the takes of the week as well so stay tuned for all of that and more but first a moment to talk about some of these beloved sponsors that help pay for all the goddamn content and all the conferences that I go to at the Bangles Nation thank you hey bankless Nation if you're listening to this it's because you're on the free Bank list RSS feed did you know that there is an ad-free version of Bank list that comes with the bankless premium subscription no ads just straight to the content but that's just one of many things that a premium subscription gets you there's also the token report a monthly bullish bearish neutrals report on the hottest tokens of the month and the regular updates from the token report go into the token Bible your first stop shop for every token worth investigating in crypto bankless premium also gets you a 30 discount to the permissionless conference which means it basically just pays for itself there's also the airdrop guide to make sure you don't miss A Drop in 2023 but really the best part about bankless premium is hanging out with me Ryan and the rest of the bankless team in the Inner Circle Discord only for premium members want the alpha check out Ben the analyst Degen pit where you can ask him questions about the token report got a question I've got my own q a room for any questions that you might have at bank list we have huge things planned for 2023 including a new website with login with your ethereum address capabilities and we're super excited to ship what we are calling Bank list 2.0 soon TM so if you want extra help exploring the frontier subscribe to bankless premium it's under 50 cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey West I'll see you in the Discord how many total air drops have you gotten this last bull market had a ton of them did you get them all maybe you missed one so here's what you should do go to earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet and earn if I will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get and it also does apps and mintable nfts any kind of money that your wallet can claim earnify will tell you about it and you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for earnify they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again you can also upgrade to earn five premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under 21 a month it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop to plug in your wallets at earnify and see what you get that's e-a-r-n-i dot f i and make sure you never lose another airdrop guys we're back questions from the nation here's one from Faro dot eth in the bankless citizen Discord as ZK EVMS rapidly grow to new ecosystems on top of ethereum could you outline the major selling points for most prominent projects like starknet ZK sync he said as David you've recently been to Israel for starknet so tell us about the major selling points of starkna of ZK sync maybe even of scroll if you're feeling extra ambitious yeah so it's really just there's a few areas a few a few frontiers of innovation that is specifically being hosted by the ZK uh roll up specifically why ZK Roll-Ups because all the optimistic Roll-Ups out there uh optimism arbitrum are trying to be evm equivalent evm ethereum equivalent which means there are certain things that are not enabled ethereum does not have this thing called account abstraction enabled which prevents all of our optimistic rollups to have what we call Smart contract wallets which are something I'm going to explain in the next question but the frontier of account abstraction and smart contract wallets are absolutely happening on ZK Roll-Ups and so we'll talk about smart contract wallets in a second but eventually everyone's going to have a smart contract wallet and that is starting on the ZK Roll-Ups Argent Bank list listeners might be from familiar with also Bravos as well there's some other smart contract wallets that are out there that's a big one massive massive field of innovation and opportunity there there's also the world of on-chain Gaming we all know that the term web3 gaming and this is generally known as like gaming but with assets that's different and much smaller in my mind of an opportunity than on-chain gaming which is where all of the logic goes on chain uh why why not you can put more composable components of your game on chain and allow that like metaverse if you will to be organically built and so this is a very limited example but say like your chess moves go on chain like Knight to Knight to F3 great move and that can be composed upon for whatever goddamn reason that you can think of and so just use your imaginations you you're like physical location in Minecraft is stored on chain and that can trigger if this then that statements and so more stuff on chain produces games that we can't even think about and it's the ZK roll-up technology that the insane levels of compression that ZK Roll-Ups have enables stuff like this to happen so so you get more compression versus optimistic roll up so that's what separates ZK versus Optimus roll ups now we have ZK EVMS but the difference between like starkware versus something like scroll my high level you know take on it is we have like four main ZK evm types of ecosystems one is the stockware ecosystem another is a ZK evm from matter Labs another is uh what polygon is doing with Hermes that they Acquired and the fourth is scroll now I think on the far side of the spectrum the most evm equivalent I probably put scroll correct and the least evm equivalent that is mirrors the ethereum mainnet virtual machine environment you could just port code from here to here is probably um Stark net they use an evenly different yes language they use um Cairo rather than solidity and and then ZK uh sync and um yeah it's somewhere in between that's sort of how I think about them but it's like you know from a high level if you're just sort of a user uh you don't see a lot of the trade-offs here and I think a lot of the trade-offs are going to um come from actually developers and the builders and it will remain to be seen which of these CK EVMS um really hit product Market fit and really nail it and what communities they attract and it's still super early to call any winners or to even understand which of these ZK EVMS what niches they're going to exist in and dominate in yeah I think that's right and I think they're all going to find product Market fit in their own particular ways um each one like optimism and arbitrum are differentiating in what's being built on top of them and uh I think they're all they're all viable and they're just optimizing for different things and along with their be relevant BD teams at this stage use them all try them out and see what you like yeah uh here's another question from killjoy from the bankless member Discord as well hey guys I've heard you mention account abstraction there you go David teaming up a lot but I'm wondering if you can explain it more detail I'm not sure about how to grasp what it unlocks in ethereum that can't already be done with tools like gnosis safe nose is safe of course is a multi-sig wallet fantastic wallet we use it at bankless all of the time everyone uses this what's different why is account abstraction better you mentioned smart contract wallets is that part of the the puzzle here yeah so you you said Nosa safe is a multi-sig wallet uh technically it's actually a smart contract wallet and what that smart contract does Ryan is enable multi-sigs uh so it's like a semantics but important it is a smart contract wallet and that smart contract is meant to be a multi-sig Wallet account abstraction is this term that is it's one of these terrible words that we come up with in crypto and doesn't really help anyone understand it but account abstraction enables smart contract wallet on the ethereum layer 1 more natively Nosa safe has kind of had to brute force it in a way and so what is a smart contract what is account abstraction like I said account abstraction enables smart contract wallets to exist and it is perhaps like an EIP or technical standard that needs to be embedded in the actual protocol of a blockchain in order for Native smart contract walls to exist so like I said earlier externally owned accounts which are like public addresses Public Accounts public wallets that are externally owned externally being like a private key which is external to the ethereum protocol again another terrible phrase another terrible word that this came up with but to apply a metaphor here to get you to understand what the hell I'm talking about if Bitcoin is to externally owned accounts ethereum is to Smart contract wallets currently an externally owned account is a dumb input output only very primitive wallet you what you do unless you just be clear when you whenever you're saying externally owned account that is probably the eth address that you have today probably do do you use them do you use a ledger do you use a treasure do you use coinbase wall do you have a private key do you have a pride phrase these types of things that means by these are all externally owned accounts right and that's what you're saying yes okay and so ethereum is smart contract wallets Bitcoin is like externally owned accounts so that's why this is kind of so hard to explain because a smart contract wallet is like a smart contract it's a touring complete wallet where you're a ledger or metamask is just it just signs messages your a smart contract wallet can do anything and so you can input any bit of code that you want you can input rules you can make it expressive and so the ux upgrades that smart contract wallets will bring to crypto are going to eliminate so much of what makes crypto wallets difficult in and unintuitive and account abstraction unlocks the ability to have Smart contract wallets like enshrined into the protocol rather than having to be built on on top of it you know how I would explain account abstraction just like the dumbest possible way is like you guys know how hard it is to use crypto wallets even good ones like like metamask for instance or Ledger it's still really hard to use them account abstraction will make a crypto wallet like venmo as smooth as a venmo or maybe if you're in Europe like a revolute like the fintop uh fintech apps where you just log in you get your face ID you unlock it you can set limits you can transfer out you're not paying outrageously high gas fees and hitting clicking sign transaction sign transaction oh my god did I just send the wrong account it will smooth all of that out and make crypto wallets look like fintech that is the bottom line and we can't unlock account abstraction on ethereum mainnet today right that we need an EIP implemented first but we can start uh in the layer two environment correct and that's what you're saying is is uh ZK of roll ups are really doubling down tripling down on account abstraction wallet if you've ever used Argent for instance on um where's that deployed is that uh a ZK sync right so Argent has two they have Argent which is the ethereum main net smart contract wallet which as soon as ethereum him left its one-way gas fee Paradigm it was in 2019. it just broke so bad because we don't have account inspection on the layer one so while they've been maintaining their Argent wallet at the layer one they've really been focusing on what they're calling Argent X which is their ZK uh ZK roll up uh smart contract wallet which is dominated by on these darknet uh Stark net layer 2. yeah and uh that that's going to be more what the experience you know will be for the everyday users this is how we mainstream crypto right I don't have this tweet in here but I tweeted tweeted this out like you are not using your imagination big enough to understand how big of a deal smart contract walls are it is a zero to one moment in wallets ethereum was like okay let's put software into our tokens software into our money that's what an erc20 token is like asset plus software that's what smart contracts are that makes it so cool that's why we love it we have not yet had that zero to one moment for our wallets our wallets are still like just simple Bitcoin input outputs we are not having the Bitcoin to ethereum moment about our wallets yet in the ethereum world yep that's right a huge improvements coming and getting closer David some takes of the week already yours all blockchains are illegitimate in their early days they have unknown founder alignment poor token distribution highest risk of bugs and exploits unknown economic sustainability legitimacy is only gained by proof and time David you saying a new chain has to earn it new trainers yeah and I actually have a follow-on tweet if you want to keep on going I'll go this is why incumbent blockchain communities Haze the newer ones don't trust them until they prove they're here for the long term bitcoiners Haze the ethereans ethereans haze the uh salonians and did I say that right so on and so forth It's not maximalist Behavior it's a healthy immune response how do you feel about that tank some people said that that was a pretty spicy take um I completely agree I 100 agree with it this is called the social layer is an immune system if your social layer of your chain doesn't have an immune system what happens imagine if your body didn't have an immune system David you had no white blood cells eaten alive you get eaten alive by viruses by malignant cells by Cancers and those all of those types try to enter the the social layer in crypto um like scammers and grip grifters so you have to have some resistance against them that said David I think like protocols like Bitcoin projects like Bitcoin can develop a an unhealthy immune system call it an immune system disorder where the white blood cells just attack everything autoimmunity yeah yeah and that's that's a big problem an autoimmune disorder um is that what you meant here uh I wasn't talking about the autoimmunity but yes the natural like all blockchains are illegitimate on day one and they slowly become legitimate over time and I'll kind of give like a if you are a single cycle blockchain you have not yet earned your stripes you only earn your stripes by coming out of the inevitable inevitable bear Market that you're going to go through and proving to the crypto world that you are able to make it through a bear Market because if you haven't made it through a bear Market you're not legitimate David you know I apply this to people now too yeah yeah it's a good take like I I just I I don't does this sound bad like I don't trust people who haven't been through a cycle in crypto who who didn't make it through one single cycle in crypto in the last cycle three hours Capital got got made all their money starting in 2019 and 2020 and then reaped reaped it all like just harvested so much in 2021 and Then Came Crashing Down in 2022. STX was not here last cycle Came Crashing Down in 2022. Terra Luna a single cycle blockchain did not it crashed in April of 2022 it didn't even make it halfway don't trust the single cyclers single cyclists not to say that like if you're a single cycler you're sharing that and you're like well they're elitist they like no you can you can become you have to stay here for a while you have to prove your stripes proof in time legitimacy's only gained by proof and time that's what you said here I apply that to people too I apply that to projects I applied to exchanges it's why we like working with Kraken that's why we like other exchanges like coins how many cycles has Kraken been here literally all of them um every single cycle they haven't gone insolvent yet I mean that's like Lindy effect there yeah and uh yeah so I I agree with that take David and just I would apply it to people too all right I guess we're just reading our own speaking of people yeah this sections become read our own tweets um well why don't you read it so it's not that yeah uh this guy Ryan Sean Adams tweets out not everyone's opinion on crypto is valuable a lot of smart people in other areas have absolutely no idea what they're talking about when it comes to crypto don't listen to them man are we doing the latest takes this week or what David I got fooled by this in my early days I thought like if you're an expert in something then you must like know what you're talking about with crypto it took me a while honestly in my crypto journey to like start trusting my own instincts and my own opinions yeah but I've I've definitely come to that place and I I hope I don't over correct and be like I know freaking everything right yeah and like there's there's obviously that failure mode um but um I mean I was looking at this uh last week right after the last roll up uh Charlie Munger notable investor I've admired this guy his investment takes he's like a Warren Buffett type wrote an opinion commentary why America should ban crypto it isn't currency it's a gambling contract with near with a nearly 100 Edge for the house he goes on Charlie talks about um the government of China the communist government of China actually doing the right thing and banning cryptocurrencies because they wisely concluded that they would provide more harm than benefit uh he thinks the Chinese Communist leaders had Splendid Common Sense he says obviously the U.S should now enact new federal laws that prevents crypto he's calling for a ban on crypto and um do you know what David this guy's opinion doesn't matter at all just because he's an expert in other domains maybe in stocks maybe that sort of investing that he knows about um he knows nothing about what we're trying to do here and about the like the crypto movement or about these assets he absolutely there's absolutely nothing about it and so if you're hearing his opinion you're going like whoa what does Charlie Munger think or some notable Economist with a Nobel Prize Warren Buffett it's like Bitcoin is is trash have they used uniswap have they um looked into the fundamentals behind D5 protocols do they understand why ethereum is worth greater than zero dollars do they understand why Bitcoin is worth greater than zero dollars if they don't if they can't answer those questions don't listen to them that's have they been through a crypt I was like oh no they haven't even started right uh yeah my first introduction to this was John John pfeffer um you know you know John pepper right I remember John pfeffer yeah he wrote this uh paper about how ethereum uh ether uh is the velocity of ether's too high to be treated as a currency because it's all gas and it's never a True Value never would accrue value and when I read that I took that personally and that is one of the main motivations when I was reading that paper to develop the triple point asset thesis which is a one of the earliest Bank List's thesis about how ether know is it not just this uh velocity gas coin it is actually the world's greatest monetary asset that humans have ever produced uh and so same here but if you remember reading that paper yeah he was very persuasive wasn't he oh I no I thought I didn't believe it at all I was like this doesn't make any sense I didn't make sense to me but also I was like but he's a seasoned investor yes yeah and listen to these arguments listen to like the white paper and the language surrounding it and the expertise and the credentialism flowing out of it dude this is where I personally I got over like imposter syndrome where I was like this doesn't make any sense I'm gonna write a thesis that counter argues this and I'm just a no one but I have differing ideas and I think I'm right and then I I think I have been proven right yeah well guess the only reason you've actually earned some legitimacy David is uh proof and time because legitimacy is only gained by proof and time thank you sir so it takes some time you know what do you know the the plank principle what's the plank principle it's pretty it's really Savage um yeah it's paraphrased as a society progresses one funeral at a time well this is this is very very much true of like science isn't this what people say about science right yeah um scientists clinging to like old ideas and New Generation has to totally disrupt it yeah like Monger Buffett all of these like very old older than Boomer like era people are like crypto is bad like well yeah you also missed the tech boom uh Warren Buffett so I'm not listening to you yeah well uh someday we will be there David and when that day comes and no longer listen to us there will be some some younger Generations about how dumb we are I'm hoping I'm trying to preserve this open-mindedness as I get uh older maybe preserve some of that wisdom David what what what makes you bullish this week well we went through all of uh what was going on in ship season uh and I've had this take last week markets are being resistant to bad news and even though we are down uh on the week we are down to 1620 ether price and 22 000 bitcoin price like we're still up pretty damn good on the year like we started the year at like 11 or 1200 ether and we had this bad bad uh choke point news which does threaten very much how this crypto World Works we've only dumped a little bit we've dumped two and a half percent since that news came out so I'm calling that I'm still resistant to bad news and I think Ryan if crypto prices and tokens bounce back from this uh and it go back into that with the the TA that I was talking about at the very beginning which we don't usually do and we go back up to like the high 1600s maybe 1700s that is the market shrugging off bad news and being very perceptive to bullish news so that makes me bullish uh as if we can shrug this off that's so awesome and 2023 shipping so far has been like an order of magnitude greater than what we saw in 2019 and so like just what is being built right now the fundamentals that D5 Protocols are going through is so bullish man like this is this is what 2019 felt like it's like you are watching the fundamentals grow at an accelerating pace around you meanwhile just like everyone else that's not a crypto is not paying attention anymore thank you that's my [ __ ] on I agree I you know I would say I probably got nothing to add to that because like um that was my uh that was also my take I have the ability to to rugs I know because because you go first and um but yeah it's we're in this bear Market but it's hard not to get bullish when you see the ship season when you see all the shipping and you're right this does smell like 2019 except 10x in 2019 this is just so much bigger right the arbitrum multi-language support So compiled the evm this is so big for developers the uh Optimus sorry we didn't say this earlier but when arbitrum develops stylus like their evm equivalent that extends to the rest of ethereum I know other people can take this and run with it it's not just arbitrum uh optimistic like the op stack with bedrock that's coming to you so bullish dude um like all of this stuff is happening now for for Builders and um we've got ZK EVMS right around the corner was so bullish everything's so bullish I mean the building right and it's like it's not reflecting in price right now but it is a little bit so I don't know about your earlier take like I don't know if I read the TA right it could go up it could go down who knows but it's all FTA it's all it's all it's build season man and uh it's just it's huge it's we've come so far it feels great that's it all right uh before before we move the meek uh I remember uh Luke the editor who was editing this right now gave us uh when it was like officially the bear market like this was after like uh three rows Capital collapsed Luke was like you and Ryan are like giddy about the bear Market you guys are so excited and it's because of moments of the shipping that has happened in the last like since 2023 started is because stuff like this happens like progress happens and the signal about progress is so clear because the noise is all gone yeah we're looking forward to we don't have to wave our hands around be like stop just ignore this like look at this it's very it's very just very clear now I think we'll go months from this and we'll be like Oh I'm hungry for a bull market but can the tokens move that's partially why opens are moving though I know that's why it's just like this is happening so quickly I don't feel like we've embraced enough pain yet but uh anyway we'll see meme of the week David what are we looking at here meme of the week we actually got two memes of the week uh so this is some guy who's uh doing his one phone call out of jail and somebody in the background saying hey man what what are you in for uh and the guy who's given the phone call says uh I staked with rocket pole and now I have life sentences with my parole oh my God it's funny but it's also scary I know second meme uh this was Ryan's Meme Nice about Brian uh this is bitcoiners when they discover nfts uh and what we are looking at is what looks like a retirement home and I think I'm pretty sure this is physical therapy this is like Physical Therapy gamified physically yeah gamified physical therapy so they're playing all these fun games uh but they're just like you know just puttering along do you know what it's uh honestly I've never seen some elements of the Bitcoin community so happy with nfts like other elements they love anything in Rage everyone loves nfts they do they do that's why this video reminded me of uh the good parts of the Bitcoin Community uh that's it that's the show today thanks for hanging with us extra long one but I hope you enjoyed it a lot of news to download during ship season risks and disclaimers gotta let you know crypto is risky so is D5 so is ethereum so is Bitcoin all this stuff is you definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot hey we hope you enjoyed the video if you did head over to
