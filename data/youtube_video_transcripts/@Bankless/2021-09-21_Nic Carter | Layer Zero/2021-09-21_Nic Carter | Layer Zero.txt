[Music] welcome to layer zero layer zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the ethereum community ethereum is built by code but it's composed by people and each individual member of the ethereum community has their own story to tell cypherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it and layer zero focuses on the people behind the code because ethereum is people all the way down and it always has been today i'm talking with nick carter who i don't necessarily think identifies as part of the ethereum community but i think he has impacted it all the same nick carter is a prolific writer and also content producer and just general bitcoiner in the bitcoin space he works at his fund castle island ventures and also has a podcast which i listen to the weekly roll up every single week was it was actually the inspiration for the bank this weekly roll up uh they call it the weekly roundup and some of uh nick's writing and just overall content conversations has deeply impacted uh the way i think uh thought about this this uh industry uh it's it's thanks to nick that i began to understand uh crypto and blockchains as political revolutions rather than just technological ones uh and in this show we we actually go and go back even further into the organizational structures of history and talk actually a lot about religion and the comparisons and and comparing and contrasting uh bitcoin as a religion and you know a blockchain as an omnipotent omnipresent god and also talk about the the differences between uh the bitcoin culture and and ethereum culture and i asked uh if nick thought that the bitcoin community generally is a more faith based one as in like they tend to go to church more than other uh crypto communities out there and nick agreed with that point and so we collectively him and i uh parsed that apart and made some jokes and then i also asked nick about um you know what else what else does he do he he mountaineers apparently uh you know and also spends a lot of time in in deep thought mode while writing and overall it was just a lovely conversation with my friend nick carter so let's go ahead and get right into that conversation but first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys not your keys not your crypto that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets which makes proper private key management a breeze but the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app and if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite d apps all in one place ledger is where you want to be not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like paraswap which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control defy never stops growing and the ledger live app grows alongside with it so click the link in the show notes to see all the defy apps that ledger live has and stay tuned as more and more apps come online and if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet what are you even waiting for go to ledger.com grab your ledger download ledger live and get all of your d-apps all in one place arbitrum is an ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use defy if you've been using ethereum for the past 12 months you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing d5 too many people want to use ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us that's where arbitrarum comes in arbitrary is a layer two to ethereum which means arbitrarium can increase ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying when interacting with arbitrary you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into ethereum's level of security and decentralization this is why people are calling this ethereum's broadband moment where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security if you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users go to developer.offchainlabs.com to get started building on arbitrom if you're a user keep an eye out for your favorite defy apps building on arbitrage arbitrary has been working with over 300 teams including ethereum's top infrastructure projects and will be opening up to all users shortly there are so many apps coming online to arbitrarily so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrary layer 2. to keep up to speed with arbitrary follow them on twitter at arbitrom and join their discord hey nick what's up how's it going man pretty good this is so i'm doing good man i i just moved i it's been it's been a lot but i fished out the cables and we were at the audio with the video we're all set up am i the first person to get a peek into your new abode the actu yes i believe so yeah so this is the first piece of video content i'm doing for my new place so there we go what uh what inspired the move why'd you move well a number of factors um but miami is kind of a good center for oh you moved to miami yeah i'm in miami so it's a good just it's a good zone for crypto people there's a burgeoning community here uh the northeast uh seemed kind of stale frankly um and you know heavily sort of locked down and things like that um and miami's just you know it's like a more happening place um although it's very hot here right now so you know there's downsides as well yeah i lived in um boca raton for like almost three months right before covid hit and like boca raton anywhere outside of miami's not at all like miami miami is his own thing but like florida felt like there were there were costs to living in florida like the the seattle rain that i'm used to is not the florida rain that you experience down there yeah there is absolutely torrential rain actually about an hour ago i kind of just got stuck on the highway no one could really drive um i mean i guess you know new york just had like incredible amounts of rain so that's not just you know a florida thing but yeah i to answer your question i mean we operate remotely now uh as a consequence of covet uh and so i could operate out of anywhere and i spent four years in boston i figured okay you know um try new city uh not to mention you know crypto has a very heavy latin american sort of influence um you know some of the highest penetration rates in the world uh for crypto are in latiam and if you run a latin business you most likely have a miami hq or miami office and so this is another way of getting sort of in touch uh with that sort of genre of entrepreneur yeah i kind of had the same exact path except on the west coast where like covet happened after soon as covert happened i wanted to get out of seattle because i lived in seattle all my life so as as soon as i was ready i was like well i'm gonna go do exactly everything i'm doing and move down to san diego so we both like had our upper corners moving down to the lower corners the opposite sides of america that's kind of funny exactly i have some catching up to do on the plant front though yeah you do i'm sure florida is a fantastic place to have plants i know i know i brought some of them down they were very much neglected and kind of starved of sunlight so i'm hoping you know they're they'll be restored are you how are you how are you going to deal with the heat are you are you ready to handle that head-on uh it's been fine honestly i mean people here just scurry from ac to ac so they don't spend too much time outside uh the humidity is what as they say is what gets you um but i don't know i i'm like completely fine with it i mean yeah you get sweaty but uh you know whatever that's the cost of doing business down here what what about the the east coast resonates with you you seem like an east coaster yeah i i don't know what that means but but you seem like one so miami is exactly 1500 miles south uh by road from boston precisely 1500 miles uh so yes i did want to stay on the east coast you know my family's here on the east coast um so i was i was gonna miami's like not that far from you know dc where like you know my a lot of my family and friends are so you know i i figured i would stay on the coast but just go to the most tropical part that's funny um so the the first question i ever gave to you in a podcast was what's your deal and then uh the first question that ryan ever gave to you in a podcast was are you an etherean uh and so i kind of want to get an update on both of those things uh so i think when i asked you what your deal was it was like roughly like two years ago so like how would you update your answer to your question what your deal is what's your deal as of now i don't remember what i said back then what did i say do you remember uh yeah it's whatever you said it actually like triggered uh for me a complete like reconceptual reconceptualization as to what like crypto is and started to get my mind thinking of crypto as like a political movement more than a technology one and so you said that like bitcoin um it just instantiates a lot of values that you have uh like the unprintability of money strong property rights um and a few things of this nature that's deeply insightful uh two years ago me was a genius i don't know about i don't know about present-day me i think i've lost some brain cells in that time but uh that's still my deal actually that's that's that's uh that's that sounds quite insightful i mean um just recently i was thinking about how we keep mistaking technical decisions uh or what are actually political decisions for technical decisions um i i'm sure we'll get into this but eip1559 i think is a great example of that actually um but yes i think that's still my deal um you know trying to peek through the sort of opacity and the veils of decentralization and and get to the fundamental you know nature of these systems um and you know kind of like resident enthusiast to all a skeptic all bundled into one um so i think that's still my deal maybe i'm more open-minded than i was two years ago so um when the the intro to the show is talking to uh all the people that compose the ethereum community and when i uh pitched you coming onto the show you were like i'm not sure i count myself to be a part of the ethereum community could you elaborate on that point well i guess it's like you know the same way like a theater production like do you count the guy in the audience who's like heckling the performers as like part of the production like i guess [Laughter] so like you can hear them from the stage so that's me like you know i'm like sort of adjacent uh like occasionally you know like making like annoying noises um but you know i'm not like an etherean uh per se but some ethereans uh you know tolerate me so that's good of them and some some just write me off as like a hopeless maxi which i'm not to be clear but uh you know so that's you i'm on the sidelines do would you do you have resistance to being considered part of the ethereum community would you decline that label if you were given it by someone well an outsider i mean that's certainly like in terms of the venom diagram of the things that i am like no one would say i'm primarily an etherean but sure um i've certainly used ethereum much more than sort of the average global citizen and we also have invested in many companies that you know build on a theorem and things like that so maybe i'm just being too uh pedantic about the distinctions here uh you know maybe maybe you could allege me to be an ethereum who knows well i think that when we talk about like the layer zero if we really want to zoom out the layer zero goes all the way back to the cypherpunks really like they are the layer zero of the layer zero i kind of think everything um hazu said that like uh crypto culture's downstream of it like a uh of bitcoin culture because bitcoin started this thing in the first place but i actually think bitcoin culture and bitcoin itself is actually downstream of the cypherpunks naturally right like it came out of the cypherpunks so everything is kind of downstream of the cypherpunks and so and i think one of the cool things that crypto did for the world is it kind of shattered the identity of a cypherpunk into a million different pieces and allows all of us to become like some sort of cypherpunk um and as we all know also know cypherpunks are like zealots right like they really believe in in what they believe uh and so when i i see you like endlessly like writing articles fighting fud um talking about all the different aspects of the relevant aspects of bitcoin to the rest of the world so i kind of consider you to like a bitcoin zealot but it's all related it's all the same community right we're all downstream of the cypherpunks so that's kind of why i'll include you in the community ethereum community no matter what yeah i mean you know it's the same way like you know sloths and you know armadillos are part of this you know same animal kingdom um you know we do we share a common ancestor um but you know like i think it might actually be a mistake just to say bitcoins of the sole heritage of the cypherpunks like there's a lot of cypherpunky stuff which doesn't understand you know nothing to do with blockchains um like julian assange was a classic cypherpunk and i mean you know he was a bitcoiner i suppose still is a bitcoiner but um him he was more about encryption and you know revealing data and um you know passing data in a sort of a covert way like that's cipher punky for sure but it's not like crypto um and then you know actually i was reflecting on this recently you do think it's very important to remember the cyberpunks many of them well so it was a heterogeneous group for start um they were interested in in sort of digital cache as in uh cache like instruments that were natively digital with david chom you know digicash type things and of course they had different opinions about it but um a lot a lot of it was sort of dollar denominated and the challenge was to to build uh the you know anonymous cache protocol and non anonymity was an incredibly important part of the cypherpunk doctrine and then bitcoin i would say is actually really really different from sort of establishment cyberpunk thought right because bitcoin has sort of reasonable pseudonymity you know not perfect um and uh it is a bearer instrument you know kind of settles uh did you know digitally uh but it's not really that cash like in that it certainly doesn't attempt to have a stable you know stable unit of account or anything so it's really really different from the charmium ideal right it's not just an upgraded version of digicash or anything like that uh it's very much you know has these these ideas impregnated into it about monetary systems and that attracted a whole different breed of people right so uh that that attracted you know like monetarists and um like gold bugs right so those are completely different concepts but i you know it it was so attractive to them that it sort of took flight and then you know somewhere along the way we forgot okay what about fulfilling you know the vision of charm and people that wanted you know dollar stable uh digital bearer assets and some people uh have attempted to do this obviously with public blockchains but there's just not that much emphasis on that which i find interesting because if you look at the history of cypherpunk thought that was probably i would say the primary version of digital cash would be something more resembling a stablecoin right i know you know that might be a controversial idea but you know just go back and and read read the discourse right i i would argue that um the emphasis on like a cash instrument an anonymous cash instrument was simply confined by the the um vehicles that these cypherpunks had at the time right like they couldn't even like imagine a non-state money because no one could imagine a non-state money at the time really really the thing that satoshi really invented was inventing the idea of non-state money and then that as you said like that idea is impregnated into bitcoin and then i but i would say that like cypherpunk values would be like aha we no longer like we i would say that the desire for like digital cash that value is uh above the desire for self-sovereignty and self-independence and i would say that monetary a monetary policy that's non-state that's non-sovereign it more subscribes to the whole values of being independent than they than they would care about like a digital anonymous cash yeah it's an interesting question you know because bitcoin gives you independence in this whole other domain right which is monetary independence you know which is a very important thing of course um having a non-discretionary monetary system um but it's almost like that idea was so strong that it blotted out this other idea which was let's you know build dollar stable instruments to transact private privately online which was kind of one of those prior ideas and you know that's an idea which is important though because it's now a matter of public policy right right uh and and let's say there had been a huge emphasis solely on completely anonymous stable coins instead of uh uh you know whatever synthetic monetary commodities like bitcoin um we might actually be in a better place with regards to the cbdc discourse right you know like i don't know what that kind of factual world looks like but um if we had hundreds of billions of uh super private uh whatever zika snarkified uh stable coins floating around that would still be enough win for freedom and and sovereignty for sure uh it's just that the main battle has actually been around the monetary discretion front um so i don't know i'm some i'm sort of a little bit wistful for for that other uh that other outcome which we didn't get i mean the private dollars yeah yeah i know that seems like completely incrementalist and it's like well nick like actually we have a bigger like battle of a fight which is you know destroying central banks or whatever but private dollars are pretty important too yeah i i would like uh i'll want to get your take on this is that like so maybe maybe i'm falling into a fallacy but i kind of like the fallacy that i'm falling into is that like whatever crypto values we discover as like a community of crypto people retroactively we get to say that these are cypherpunk values like everything is downstream like whatever values we discover to be valuable is like oh yeah these are now cypherpunk values yes and um you know there aren't actually really that many true cyberpunks uh floating around uh i don't i wouldn't say i'm one right i like don't use pgp for instance so or whatever the new version of pgp is so you know i don't i don't use signal enough even you know like i'm not even using uh the best cryptographic tools we have um so yeah i think a lot of people you know profess themselves to be cyberpunks in crypto land but it's mostly branding exercise and uh a lot of the original cypherpunks just would completely denounce cryptocurrency at this point a lot of them have so you know maybe maybe i shouldn't keep this like cypherpunk branding like and held in such high regards but that's kind of like why i want to redefine it right like you know that we can use it more expansively because it's such a generally such a positive term in this industry and i mean the cyberbunks was just such a small group of people and so you know the culture just changed uh and this is a more mainstream movement so um you know the question is like is that label still um does it have semantic content is it a useful label um or should we rebrand the movement and and and call it something else yeah well one thing that crypto has done is put a public private key into the hands of of everyone that uses crypto and that is absolutely like a cypherpunk thing like now we all have private keys um and we can build on top of that and go from there so like cipher i don't think cypherpunks would at all argue that that's a that's not a cypherpunk thing that's true it uh it was the consumerification of public key cryptography in a way that vastly outstripped any of the i mean what i think the biggest public key infrastructure before cryptocurrency would have been pgp i can't think of anything else and that was at most uh what a hundred thousand individuals and in terms of people that have used a uh as they say non-custodial wallet an unhosted wallet on hosted wallet yeah uh according to the if or whatever that's how many how many people do you think that is probably well over 50 million i would say like probably probably 250 million people have sort of had exposure to the financial assets in some capacity but most of that much of that would have been in a hosted manner uh on hosted i'm sure it's over 50 million i mean you know how many hardware wallets is ledger sold things like that right well i have at least four of them so there's that yeah and and metamask they have 10 million monthly actives now i think yep yep so one of uh one of your changing gears here a little bit one of your articles was uh bitcoin at 12 where you um illustrated uh bitcoin as this like cathedral that many different individuals are helping build and they all know that they're not actually going to be able to see the ultimate like manifestation of this cathedral because it takes hundreds of years to build a cathedral um and so it's still it's like dedication out of the values of the builders that actually creates these things regardless of whether they get to enjoy the fruits of their final projects so my question to you is how many hours a week do you work for a bitcoin that's a good question um probably zero i don't you know i nothing i do is sort of directly uh accretive to bitcoin i think um oh god i fundamentally disagree with that but maybe that's just a different perspective as to what it means to work for bitcoin does uh does making content yes peter mccormick works for bitcoin okay okay well i don't know i i probably spend um you know five to ten hours a week writing something um and then i mean you know does funding bitcoin startups account i guess yeah i suppose yeah everything counts every very lumpy some some months i don't and then you know some other months i'll do three so um i don't know you know like i i can't say i'm a full-timer on bitcoin uh but i'll give it at least 10 to 15 hours a week probably i i kind of more or less think that everything you do in your professional life is like working for bitcoin unless i'm missing i have no idea what it's like to be nick carter in the professional life but like i i think like every single podcast that i make and every single article i write is like me working for ethereum yeah that's fair i mean i think i'm maybe more broad in my focus i mean uh you know a lot of my time is on stuff like coinmetrix which does like i don't know 50 blockchains or something so um some of it is more broad and you know like when like sieve castle island will fund startups that are just like financial infrastructure for the space at large whether it's stable coins or or you know cryptocurrency so um i wouldn't say it's confined to bitcoin but yeah in theory it's all sort of generally useful for bitcoin in some some capacity when you were when the the whole bitcoin energy like fud part of the recent history of crypto was going around i think you were putting out something like how many articles like a week like what like take us through like that whole phase of your life well that was weird because the fudd somehow reached a crescendo for some reason i guess it was probably elon the elon effect but it was like i'd like some somehow serendipitously or or unluckily uh ended up being situated in in the middle of it because people i i guess i sort of like appointed myself like one of the one of the main like uh debaters sentinels of bitcoin sentinels yeah and i mean i'm sort of glad it's over because it was a lot um like you know i was like talking to the press like every other day um and it just it wasn't really sustainable i couldn't like do my job um at the time and so for the last like two months i've just been saying no to all press inquiries and all podcasts uh with the exception of yours and i did pomp's as well because you know he's my neighbor now oh really i didn't know he's yeah yeah yeah yeah his studio is here uh it's great so you know people i'm friends with i'll like still you know do the content but basically i'm sort of like a little burned out from all that stuff although i will say there's one final thing that i've done on the energy question which is actually more of a paper and uh that i think will be really useful for a lot of people should be out this month so stay tuned for that but yeah i i don't know how how many like videos and pieces of content things like i did is like an uncountable amount do you do you like it enjoy the limelight of being like a bitcoin spokesperson is that like something that's fun for you um it felt more like an obligation than anything i think uh of course it's fun like when your star is rising you know i'm sure you know you felt the same but uh it just becomes a grind eventually and you know at the end of the day like there's only so many hours in the week and the more time you spend being some sort of like unofficial bitcoin spokesperson the last time you can spend on real work um whether it's writing or you know like funding startups or anything like that do you think like sometimes i kind of think these like um these protocols will lead themselves into the their own future and obviously these are all these this podcast is called layer zero so it's all about like the people that help these things like direct themselves but there's also these are decentralized networks so many different people are building the cathedral in their own specific way like to some degree like what can one person do do you kind of think that like if nick carter didn't exist that bitcoin would more or less be in this same spot or do you do you actually see what you do actually moving the needle for bitcoin i think bitcoin would be absolutely fine without me so why do it all then it was fine before me i because i find it interesting you know i think you know occasionally i have sort of maybe good points to make uh but yeah i think would be completely fine without me in fact you know haven't done that much publicly in the last uh month or two um and uh everything you know the blocks kept arriving um you know like i've noticed that you know um certain talking points that might have originated with me like other people just glom onto them and they get a life of their own they don't need me you know and you know bitcoin content like it's there's an incredibly vibrant ecosystem out there um which you know like people will they'll respond to the fud or they'll you know like write interesting things original ideas like there's no need for me whatsoever it's a very bitcoiner answer like bitcoin absolutely does not need me um and i and i think maybe it's it's kind of interesting in in the ethereum world we definitely fundamentally accept like the layer zero of ethereum as in like ethereum is is it's code until it's people and then like like you said uh before we hit recording like hazu says like it's it's always the social layer that is the final the buck stops at the social layer but bitcoiners i don't think want to have uh that same sort of illustration for bitcoin they want it to stop at the code and and the code be the thing that propels bitcoin into the future and no bitcoin doesn't need anyone um do you agree with that that perception that certainly is the view probably the establishment view in bitcoin but i would say bitcoin also has what i call value primacy so effectively values that supersede the code especially in a time of crisis and so even bitcoin the code is merely an encoding of the values but the values are supreme especially when there's a conflict between the values and the code right so you know with the overflow bug you know there aren't 184 billion bitcoins or 192 billion whatever it was this 21 million so we're going to revert the code and we're going to sort of engineer the fix to that so i don't know what the next instance is going to be where there's a conflict between the the implied specification we don't have one exactly but uh between the sort of constitution and then the actual uh you know enforcement of that but bitcoin also has the social layer just it's convenient for people to pretend that it doesn't the the way i've described bitcoin social layers that uh the social contract of bitcoin is to not have one which implies that there's still a social contract but like it still also at the same time diminishes its own role by like it's like it's almost like a snake consuming its own tail it can get almost all the way there but it doesn't fully be able to like consume itself that's kind of what i'll take on the social contract i mean it's not just a bitcoin question it's any monetary system like this is a question that um like monetary theorists have puzzled over for decades and decades really just forever i would say it's like how do you as long as you have uh money how do you build a monetary system in which the people in control uh can't tinker with it excessively or you know like can't um you know can't change the parameters especially to benefit themselves and that's why you've you know throughout history had these movements to get on the gold standard because the gold standard is sort of this you know at that point you're beholden to sort of natural law as opposed to the law of man right so that's the whole point is that you you you know you you bind yourself to the mast you sort of voluntarily tie your hands and you say okay i'm gonna actually give up power here um and but that takes like active management that takes like an ongoing commitment to the surrendering of power um and of course like the history of the gold center there's a history of uh governments saying well you know actually it would be really convenient if we could get off the gold standard for a little bit the the most interesting thing to me is that in you know historically the norm was after departure from the gold standard people would advocate to go back on it uh and so you'd have this recognition like okay well you know we had this like temporary aberration we went off it but let's you know surrender control once again uh and you just had these cycles you know on off on off and uh so that's just the same thing that's happening with bitcoin but you have to have this ongoing vigilance and this commitment to not changing anything so you do need that sort of continual pressure and i sort of worry about what happens if we get extremely complacent and say well the code is supreme whatever what happens if a decade passes and people like huh like why did we submit to this like particular parameter in the code again and we should just kind of forget about that uh so i do think you know it does need a measure of sort of like active vigilance and sort of participation hey guys i hope you're enjoying the conversation thus far we are about to get into the comparing and contrasting of religion and bitcoin and that that whole religious conversation as it relates to our crypto industry that's what's coming up next but before we get there we have to talk for a moment about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible when you shop for plane tickets you probably use kayak expedia or google to compare ticket prices so why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto when you make your trades you want to make sure that you're getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided that's why you should be using matcha matcha routes your orders across all the various defy exchanges on ethereum polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commissions matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources if matcha sees that it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pulls the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defy trades and they will go through automatically while you're away new to matcha is an integrated fiat on-ramp so you can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity when you're making a trade head over to matcha.xyz bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets bankless is proud to be supported by uniswap uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum which is what ryan and i call a money robot no human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy something brand new in the uni-swap ecosystem is the uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants we have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again dows have money and they are in need of labor if you think that you have something to contribute to the uni-swapped out apply for a grant to uniswap just look at the size of the uniswap treasury it's almost three billion dollars this mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap dao no matter how big or small your idea is you can apply for a uni grant at unigrants.org and help steer unit swap in the direction that you think it should go that's exactly what we did to get uniswop to be a sponsor for bankless and you can do the same for your project thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless so that's that's super interesting this active vigilance thing and like i i've i don't know if this is true and you'll probably be more familiar with this or not but like the bitcoin uh community generally i think is a little bit more faith-based than the rest of the the crypto world as and i'm actually talking about like straight up religion here and like when you say like act of vigilance it kind of reminds me of just like the the part of like religion organized religion where like it was your duty to wake up in the morning and like remember your faith to god right like you you wake up and before the renaissance right like before it was all about the individual it's like you're supposed to wake up and remember that you are subject to god and you need to remember to keep your faith right and so like bitcoiners and their very very strong like social dynamics are always like you know we all need to wake up and remember that the 21 million hard cap is is uh mo is most holy and we all need to remember that well you know there's a reason that uh uh i think islam means uh submission in arabic if i'm if you're not mistaken i know that uh so you know religion is all about submission of course right like you uh you accept that you are you know uh infinitesimally small and you know unimportant relative to the the highest power um and you know in christianity you're submitting to like a you know very specific set of beliefs uh it's the same thing you know in i don't want to you know push you the religion analogy too far but um because i find it sacrilegious sometimes but um yeah like bitcoin is all about submitting to a specific monetary schedule like you have to submit you can't push it you can't change it and even if you know you're the most important developer you probably can't really even tweak it even a little bit uh and and there's like a you know there's a sublimity in submission i think um if if you know if you actually can accommodate it um but if if you can't then bitcoin's not for you you know do uh was i right in my would you would you agree with me when i said that like the bitcoin community generally is a little bit more faith-based than the rest of the crypto industry as in like actually like do they believe in more colleges right like yeah maybe they they tend to go to church on sundays more than the rest of the of the industry uh yeah i think that i think so i think so why do you think that is um because bitcoin is more conservative in its sort of uh core value um you have these clustered um values you know um it's like i don't know what the right term is but there's this there's this sort of thing about society where if you know one belief of a person you can predict the next 15 beliefs right even if those beliefs are completely unrelated to each other yeah completely genus yeah like um for instance like one's uh opinion of like sunscreen or like seed oils or you know eating meat or those are like very like you know kind of like meme meme things but um so like and the reason they all map is because those values are all expression of some sort of like deep underlying you know set of beliefs like am i fundamentally uh you know like a conservative like not in like the political sense but you know like do i fundamentally believe in like hierarchy and stability and like keeping things the same or do i believe in progress and shaking things up and you know etc and so um bitcoin is not big c conservative but i'd say it's little c conservative in that um you know i view it as an attempt to restore um the the you know the the not the not the you know the form of a gold standard not the features of a gold standard but uh the environment that the gold standard you know facilitated uh and so that's why i call it um you know it's a paradox because it's like technologically progressive but uh in some senses you could say it's maybe not regressive but like an attempt to reclaim something that has been lost right so some people call it revenges like you're reclaiming lost territory right uh and so that you know that's the paradox of bitcoin right it's technologically forward but it restores more ancient values that's the idea yeah that's the idea uh so we'll see that's crazy i know it's one of my favorites uh if you don't mind me asking do you go to church um not currently but i am religious for sure i also just moved here so i need to locate a good one ah as someone who's literally never been to church other than like touring like how do you how do you choose a church like how do you look like it feels like if we want to map this onto the crypto world it like you it's like you picking a tribe right the crypto world is easy to pick a tribe you generally fall right into one um how does it work in in like religion well you're born into it you know so you don't uh you don't typically like you know i guess yeah right you don't like lay out a map of all the schisms in christianity okay well you know i believe in uh predestination but like you know like these are the gospels that you know you don't uh pick and choose that way do you have a what's your specific denomination um well i was baptized into the anglican church uh in england uh and so in the u.s uh that would map on to the episcopalian church so uh amin soleimani who's one of like my own like personal heroes in this space uh coined this term money god um and it's simply uh you know something that uses control theory or has automated a way all of the governance functionalities and so like uh on ethereum we these would be in the application layer um but bitcoin is itself one instantiation of this right where like we've created bitcoin we've cast it away into existence and now it controls us right like it's autonomous uh and we can't control it but it determines our lives right like it has a monetary policy it's a supply schedule and it imposes those values upon it's users right it's subservants and and so like do you serve two gods um [Laughter] you know this actually came up in a debate i had with francis coppola um the infamous new coiner because she said as a christian she rejects bitcoin because it's you know this doctrine of absolutism but only only god himself only providence uh is absolute and um i was just kind of baffled by this but uh but maybe maybe there's something to that um i mean you know like i see bitcoin as a human institution it's just we're trying to do something inhuman we're trying to create um an institution that uh supersedes our sort of base human desires so in that sense you know there's there's a similarity um but it's it's not divine i mean it may um you know in my view sort of it inspires feelings of uh sublimity and you know something truly awesome in sort of the baroque meaning of the of the word awesome you know on screen yeah um and and you know so you might you might go as far as to say it's sort of wow it's incredible that uh you know such a creation exists like this is evidence you know of you know of of something greater than humans like it certainly inspires those kinds of feelings i'd say to a lot of people but um you know it's fundamentally human creation i i believe uh you know uh i believe that satoshi was a human the i think you can take this even further right because like some of the properties that are are discovered in good blockchains that are actually like alive ecosystems like bitcoin and i basically only other included ethereum is that like well they're they're uh omniscient they know everything because all of this state that is held in bitcoin and so bitcoin remembers all they're omnipotent in the fact that like you must comply with the rules of bitcoin um there's a few more omni words that if i had like if i could think of them i would i would but like it these the properties of these things do approach something like the words that we use to describe like actual god i think that the same part of your brain probably lights up when you think about it probably yeah yeah i we might be torturing the analogy a little bit at this point [Laughter] you know bitcoin doesn't make any metaphysical claims sure as far as i know as far as i know but um you know like there's a great degree of mystery and uh and uh like intrigue in in the origins of bitcoin which i've always held up as a strength you know i think it'd be it would be tedious and boring if we knew uh you know what the origin was i i hope we never find out uh well if we want to hop onto different subjects let me know but i'm going to keep going on this for one last little bit um and so like there's the claim that like uh the story of like the christian god or the catholic god or even all religion more or less it's like in the same thing as this this layer zero podcast it's people all the way down and so like the bible was written by humans and was composed by humans to tell a story of like a holy figure and and uh as somebody who didn't grow up with religion but then discovered it and discovered how to appreciate it much later in my life like to me the bible is just a story of it's a collection of fables of stories as to how to live like a good life and have good values but the all these stories were composed by people right in the same way that like you know the bitcoin is a is a system of human that instantiate human values and same thing with ethereum like it can be argued that like you know the way that we discovered religion is that like we discovered all these things that are fundamentally capital capital g good and then we created like a network around them and so like these these conclude well we we are definitely like mutilating this metaphor like it also keeps on going yeah well there's there's like two i guess there's like the secular description the charitable secular description of the bible which is it's sort of a set of heuristics that we learned over thousands of years and uh incorporated into stories and then you know it's it's guidance of how to live uh and then there's you know i would say the religious version which is it's genuinely the received word of god right um so i guess if you use that first definition um the metaphor the analogy probably makes a bit more sense uh although the rules encoded in blockchain is very simple i would say it's like you have to write craft transactions this way for them to be valid and blockchain doesn't care about anything else right so it's really just well i suppose there's other rules relating to monetary policy and things like that right and that does feel like how the the 21st century version of religions is right now we've actually removed the subjectivity from a religion and now we actually have objective properties about these things if we want to consider bitcoin and ethereum or religion which i kind of do i don't know i i haven't decided i'm mixed i'm mixed on the on the merits of that i mean uh religion is not very popular these days in the us like zoomers are mostly agnostic or atheists but also it also bitcoin or ethereum or crypto doesn't fit into the old categorization of categorizations of religion is like very much like a neo-religion in the same way like bitcoin and ethereum are like neo-nation states yeah i mean i think my preferred analogy would be a political one so the nation's day one which you've done a number of times people feel a religious deal perhaps towards their uh nation state or their tribe or their ethnos you know that we see for sure i mean people that's probably the primary cause of people living and dying and fighting you know becoming soldiers and going to war and things like that um so again though you know blockchains are not complete in in the sense that a nation is you know they don't but you know i think that's probably my preferred analogy like i can certainly see that you know this you know 100 million or so people worldwide that kind of subscribe to bitcoin nation uh i like biology's uh conception i think you know the the crypto capital versus the whatever the world capital or his communist cop well i think that's really really apt yeah that's funny i actually just read that like for the first time like last night so good timing good timing for that i i would say that the reason why i frequently use like the nation state to like analyze ethereum is like what it is whenever i do that like i also go backwards and say well the nation state is just like the next iteration of religion well the nation state now is sort of becoming obsolete too i would argue i mean like if you just look at the crypto community like you have people that have much much more in common um with each other even though they you know are it's a global audience fundamentally uh than they have with their sort of fellow countrymen uh and yeah and that doesn't just happen on you know along the line and i think that's like the truest definition of the metaverse which is you know a congregation of people that are uh gathering in a certain venue uh where that new digital typically identity supersedes the old identities that they sort of had um or subscribed to and it and and that could be crypto could be like trading jpegs back and forth and discords or it could be whatever like um roblox i'm not even sure what roblox is but i'm just gonna say it because i i think kids like it um or you know fortnite or whatever so like if you were to pull 100 zoomers and say what's your primary affiliation i think they wouldn't say like american necessarily or like a good chunk of them would say something else right yeah i mean that's always the that's been the early promises of the internet right is like pull all like-minded people regardless of their physical locations in the world in the world and regardless of where they are really in relationship to borders and allow them to meet on the internet and group together according to like like values and like interests and it also just so happens we have this new crypto crypto thing that is instantiating uh specific values upon like internet digital objects that we can all like rally behind well the crypto affiliation is the strongest because it's deeply tribal the stakes are enormously real it's financial in nature uh so it's a very grown-up game but it's also you know very fun and and you know youthful and you know and like even gamified but uh you know the stakes are incredibly real so when you manage to not do work and and including the work that you do for bitcoin and the work that you don't do for bitcoin whatever you call work what happens what happens after you do work what happens when it's play time what do you do um so i try and carve out i would say one week in a month to like go climb a large pile of rocks um is this hiking or rock climbing um like mountaineering i would say which which includes some technical uh climbing but typically you're just hiking uphill um and i like that because it's an excuse to turn off my phone for two to three days not that i don't have service typically unfortunately you know it's like hard to get lost anymore you it's like all these mountains like you think they wouldn't have service but they do and it kind of like takes the joy out of it a little bit but um yeah i like it because it's an excuse to just turn off my phone uh and you know suffer basically i mean that's what mountaineering is it's suffering right at altitude um and so i i attempt to do that once a month but i can't always but how are you going to do that in miami there's not might any mountains around you no i have to fly typically i i would fly out west and do okay oh sure you come out west to go to go hiking yeah i was uh where are you now you said you're in southern california in san diego yeah oh i was like in your neck of the woods a few weeks ago oh no yeah so next time i'll hit you up but you know back when i lived in the northeast the mountains were there but they were all small right uh the best ones are obviously out west uh like where would you go cascades rockies i was most recently in the high sierra um and before that i did shasta up in northern california so we're gonna yeah we're gonna try some harder ones soon glaciers if you ever if you have yeah anywhere anywhere on the on the west coast if you ever go mountaineering like in this within i want to come okay what do i need to know that that's not just because i'm i'm i've done an insane amount of like actual backpacking trips where i put a tent in my backpack but like what do i what am i not prepared for if it's mountaineering so that's the essential skill is just being able to you know walk with a 40 50 pound pack um but you know if it's there's snow involved you have to know how to use crampons and fix them to your uh boots um like learning to self arrest with an ice axe is pretty essential that's easy enough to learn and then glacier travel um on a short rope um and uh you know crevasse rescue that would be like the next skill right to learn but if somebody if somebody in my troop knows how to do it do i know how to need to know how to do it yeah you should know yeah because you might have to save them right um and then like anything to do with cold weather just like gear management cold weather camping um if you've done that you'd be good okay i mean there aren't that many mountains in the lower 48 that are really going to imperil you yeah this is this is this is right up my alley i'm a big fan of the concept of suffering i think pain is how you how you improve yourself um so it's funny that you brought that up i have a good friend that he divides fun into like three typologies have you heard of this like type one fun type two funds like type one fun is just like straight pure hedonic fun you know like i don't know like doing coke or drugs drugs for dopamine type 2 fun is like you know it's like actually kind of challenging in the moment you might not seem that fun but afterwards you're sort of glad you did it endorphins type yeah you know maybe like you know running a 10k or something and then type 3 fun is just miserable in the moment uh feels terrible and then i suppose upon reflection you might be like oh maybe i want to do that again that's where i'd put most mountaineering experiences nice yeah oh maybe meditation as well because whenever i try and meditate like i hate it and then i can't do it at the end i'm like oh i guess that was okay i'm like the worst tech bro ever i can't meditate yeah i don't know can't do it have you okay so here's something i've noticed ever since especially this started happening before crypto but as soon as it's as soon as i got into crypto it got even worse it's just like my memory is absolutely shot and i think it's just because i have so many devices around me that i just use to outsource all my memory functions and so like as a muscle the atrophy is just endless have you noticed anything like this that's an interesting concept so as you have more external storage available to you you just externalize more and more right and then eventually your brain just becomes an index of how to find things so we we're we're we've effectively become uh sort of like cyborgs a little bit absolutely yeah we've uploaded part of our i mean i guess that's true like you you've uploaded party you outsource some of your consciousness i mean like that's kind of like you know we don't remember maps of cities anymore because we have gps right and we don't remember like trivia or like facts about the presidents because you have google exactly uh so i do worry about that actually yeah certainly like honestly i think mentally speaking i'm at my worst like i've been on a steady decline since high school like i think high school me would have just like blown me out of the water when it comes to like any mental sharpness actual test yeah i think everybody feels like that i don't know i don't think it can be reversed yeah i definitely remember being more mentally short but i'm definitely also much more wise than i ever was so like there we go there there is the trade-off there like mental acuity maybe it's not there but like wisdom is wisdom levels are off the charts hopefully that's the trade that's the trade we all make yeah okay but you so it's the weekend but you're not you can't go mountaineering so what are you doing in miami this weekend i'm still trying to figure like trying to get settled here there's like a lot of slices more generally stuff to do um i would i'm actually not a big beach person um but i would try and do something outdoorsy probably if i despair weekend i mean like the truth is that i reserve my weekends often for writing um because i can't get it done sure uh i can't get into like a deep work uh like you know non actual work work uh phase during the week so that's when i do probably 70 of all my writing would be on like a saturday or sunday morning um but yeah relax go to the gym uh like go to the sauna um write you like got to eat like you know really boring stuff but um stuff i can't do during the week as much sure do you okay do you actually like coors light or is it just a meme i actually quit drinking so um okay if i if i were to drink i would drink coors light but i'm much more focused on on uh sort of being healthy these days oh i have when i the way that i get through writing is i just brute force brute force the writing by ingesting beer so we are on offices into the spectrum there yeah i used to do that i mean when i was an undergrad uh that's how i wrote most of my philosophy papers uh you know like uh write drunk out it's sober um but uh yeah i don't know these days like you have to try and get yourself into the flow state somehow um and so these days i don't try and rush it i mean i'm not you know i'm not on a contract i don't have to write every weekend or whatever so i just now i just kind of wait uh for inspiration i suppose so as as 2021 is coming to a close with the last quarter remaining here like what do you what do you what do you see on the horizon for our industry and for bitcoin well bitcoin is just becoming much more sort of predictable and like widely understood um you know things like cuba passing a bitcoin law like that's probably honestly not net good for regular cubans or cuban bitcoiners but it just cements the notion of bitcoin as sort of this you know like not that interesting um monetary alternative and that's i would say good for bitcoin overall like bitcoin like gold gold is extremely boring but it's worth 11 trillion dollars bitcoin is just gonna grow up and uh we're gonna look back at these days with nostalgia and be like wow that was like such an exciting time uh so we should be grateful to be living through it frankly um but you know the future of bitcoin is just going to be this onward march towards respectability uh and there's nothing wrong with that uh just won't be as exciting in 10 years time um in the near term you know i've always kind of been more on the conservative side in terms of um you know being uh wary of financial regulators um at this point i think they've signaled to us that they're gonna try something whether it's treasury whether it's sec whether it's some other agency there's no doubt in my mind now that there's some reprisal coming from the state i think we can survive it i think it's likely to be healthy but i think it's also going to be extremely painful and so i don't know what form it's going to take whether they're going to target exchanges smart contract developers you know uh entrepreneurs uh funds uh it's not clear to me yet but it is clear that there's sort of a lot of political capital behind this uh anti-crypto movement and now of course you know we're looking at a time of um you know like relatively rare um unity at the state level you have the president both houses of congress or blue um that may not be the case in sort of a year's time after the midterms so this might actually be sort of like their shot to you know do something extremely harsh um maybe in a year or two like we'll be in better stead in washington um but yeah the the you know the crypto industry is like what 60 percent america based it's like very exposed to what happens in the us and so i think it could be like a really really really tough 18 months and uh you know i would steal yourself for that but that doesn't mean that you know what we're building is invalid or isn't going to work it's just we might have to you know reimagine what it's like to build these you know unsensible protocols um and uh you know critically examine some of the you know the the choke points which is you know what they're gonna go after they'll go after things that give them strategic leverage uh whether it's stable coins exchanges uh whatever uh and so you know it'll be a process of also i think learning about what what those exposures are and and maybe we'll we'll sort of think twice about um having uh stable coin based liquidity for everything uh you know something like that what do you think's at more risk bitcoin or defy i think like bitcoin will like suffer collateral damage uh just by association um i think like lightning operators would be probably you know lumped in with d5 so you know like if something adverse happens to like d5 um it would suffer in that respect uh it seems to me that d phi like dexes would be like a primary target at least just looking reading through the lines like looking at what gensler's had to say um you know some of the tone i'm seeing from people that are actually talking to you know these officials it seems to be pretty pretty down in the dumps as far as i can tell from my position i don't really have um you know any privileged information whatsoever um but yeah it seems like a lot of it would be targeted either at the like um brokerage industry or defy directly who's your favorite music artist um all time i'm a huge beatles fan uh i love pink floyd as well um the eagles um led zeppelin um more contemporary like tim impala and uh i'm a big kanye fan as well did a good new album yeah oh that's the other more frequent take i've heard is that the album's not that good i haven't listened i liked it i've been listening to it um you know it's very like very you know christian and in nature um which i like you know it's like connie's work has been sort of like it's always like had some like gospel elements but it's like unabashedly right uh religious now which you know like i i like but yeah i actually think there's like some good tracks on there too i'll have to give it a listen awesome man well thanks for coming on layer zero and uh let me pick your brain thanks david maybe you can uh come on on the brink we'll get you on there i've always wanted to to be
