Bitcoin might have a run up to forty thousand dollars ether might have a run up to three thousand dollars people say the bull Market's on and the bull Market's not going to be on and people are going to try and trade it and they're going to on net lose money is it a fallacy to think that every bear Market plays out the same way I remember going through the last bear market and everyone was like oh next cycle next cycle next cycle like doesn't that mean if everyone's saying it it's not gonna come and then it totally came and so I think that you just assume that it's going to play out exactly how people expect it to with another cycle crypto is just plays out in fractals this is the next track though we're just at higher numbers on the highs and higher numbers on the low and now the Cycles might lengthen there might be kind of different timelines involved I think the base guess is probably the right guess which is just playing for another fractal it's gonna happen in the way it has in similar barebacks
