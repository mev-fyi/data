welcome bankless nation this is a special episode that we're bringing to you on youtube we are bringing to you on the podcast this is alpha leak david we only do alpha leaks when something alpha happens when we know that there is something that you want to know about and you need to react to quickly a major type of event what is this alpha leak today man the alpha leak that we are talking about today is something that i think we've seen coming a long way off but that doesn't change how big of a deal it is today alpha leaks are when we just need to drop everything and get into the content production mode to talk about this what's going on and what is going on is the ethereum 2.0 phase zero deposit contract has been announced starting on december 1st is the first december 1st could be the day that phase 0 goes live so there's a lot of conversations to be had about how to prepare for this we all want to be a part of the group that helps ethereum 2.0 get off the ground and so this this podcast episode this youtube video depending on where you're watching it is going to help you understand what the hell is going on with the deposit contract with phase zero and how you can help grow ethereum 2.0 starting on december 1st it could be as soon as december 1st absolutely we want you to be able to find the alpha in the midst of all this so we're doing two things first we're going to give you kind of an overview of what is happening what just went on the significance of it how you can get in involved then we're also going to be bringing on preston van loon who's a developer at a uh ethio client called prism and we go through and we ask a whole bunch of questions of preston and we get in depth into how to stake how can you stake from your home what are the risks what are the rewards all of those details as part of this alpha leak episode as well so with that david we should just get right into it man it was like i was having kind of a a rough day you know not knowing who the president is and everything else like this morning when i woke up it's something that you talked about on uh monday's post on bank list that hey like this election could go one way or the other but the worst outcome is uncertainty and we got the worst outcome didn't we and then i got a very uh cheering message from someone i saw on twitter that the eth2 staking contract has been announced so the ev2 staking contract has actually gone live more than been announced gone live with a specific block time and we'll get into what that means but high level this is what we've talked about for a long time uh dave this is ethereum's initial bond offering so think of this ethereum right now is the largest non-sovereign global economy decentralized economy that the world is ever seen and they're getting ready to issue a bond that's how i see it we talked so many times before david about the triple point asset ether being a triple point asset like it can you can you can use it as a commodity pay for gas you can you can use it as money as a store value of collateral and defy well this is that third point right this is using ether as a capital asset to actually generate returns for you and it's finally going live i feel like i've been here like waiting forever but it's it's finally happening so yeah what like where were you what was your take when you heard this news yeah this it happened this morning except it started to happen yesterday and a lot of people that really pay attention to the intricate details of ethereum started to figure this out and people noticed this by the deposit contract dot eth ens address getting deployed to an address that had a bunch of zeros and there is significance to an address that has a bunch of zeros because those aren't easy to find right and so there there was a lot of uh some behind the scenes like what's going on here like deposit contract.e that's a real thing uh and then the next day the day the day after election day which is the craziest time to announce the launch of phase zero uh we get an official announcement from the ethereum.org site a new website on ethereum.org that shows you how to be a validator on east 2 uh so all these things happen at once which is did you predict this though i feel like a few episodes ago you were just calling it came pretty close i came pretty close i predicted uh a week and a half ago that the that this last monday a date would be announced and it happened it happened on wednesday morning so i was off by two days not too bad that is super close that is not too bad so what's been the reaction in crypto twitter can you talk about it so like i put tweets out i feel like you put you put tweets out the entire community is celebrating this this is uh spencer noon he had to take like this is a big deal i think is is basically the summary of what he's saying here um it was enough to get eric connor back on twitter eric connor's out of bed like welcome back eric connor to twitter we'll see how long he stays here i'm not sure he's in the move to save for the whole bull run yeah i probably thought i'm glad eric connor's back to help lead us into ethereum 2.0 he's a great community manager if that's what he's here to do then then absolutely um yeah so it's and you know your question about how did twitter react to this um it was mixed and that you know and it's a little bit frustrating because there's a bunch of you know very deep core ethereum people that have been paying attention to this for a while and to these people people people like you and me ryan like you know at some point this is just not a surprise like yeah we knew this was coming from a long way off we never had any doubts that this would actually be here we did have doubts about when but we also were able to talk to people we've had danny ryan on the bankless program like twice in two different capacities now uh we've had a bunch of just e 2.0 talk we've been seeing what's been coming right vitalik a couple weeks ago he said yeah it's it's coming coming in 2020 the end of the year right well we've got two months left in 2020 of course right and so like some people are surprised but like i think the people that are paying attention the most are just like oh yeah like this is it it's it's very much later than we thought and now it's here okay so ethereum community is celebrating i i think one one take on this is like for to me you know like being the space being you being the space mainstream media is not going to pick this up like they have no idea what's going on crypto media yeah they'll pick it up but they'll be a generalized crypto media yeah yes there'll be a slant from kind of like is this that big of a deal i think this is the most significant event clearly to happen this year right maybe it's the most significant event in the last five years like this is a big deal but bigger than paypal yes bigger than paper like you don't see it on you're not going to see on the any of the mainstream even if they weren't just covering politics 24 7 these days this is below the radar that shows how early we truly are like this this is a major event in crypto and no one knows about it right important importantly and i i definitely do want to get to how how and why this is so significant with preston van loon here in a bit but importantly i would like to say that the 2017 bull market was pinned by eth 2.0 being right around the corner turned out that was a little we were disillusioned by that that was a little bit of three years around the corner yeah but but now now we actually have phase zero right we actually have staking staking was a huge bullish undercurrent for the last bull run and now it's actually here or at least it will be here on december 1st all right so are we just going to say david like eth at a price of 400 per each is just stupid silly hilarious yeah i mean so like the market responded by going from 380 east to like 400 east what what should be priced in right now is uh roi from staking ether ether lockup from staking ether and also may i think perhaps even most bullishly a complete reduction of execution risk for ethereum 2.0 as a whole and i made a graphic in a previous market monday that talked about the evolution of ethereum 2.0 and how people think that it's like okay first we do phase zero then we do phase one then we do phase two and we're not even at phase zero yet so e2 is a long way off in reality phase zero one and two have all been working in parallel and the teams themselves have been working in parallel learning how to work with each other the progress i think is going to compound so it's not going to be another three years between phase zero and phase one i think it could and and preston in this uh in this episode talks about his his timeline predictions about where phase one is um i think there's overall going to be compounding progress on these fronts that is the david hoffman eath bull that i know coming out once again good to see you i do agree with you that 400 is hilarious right i mean so if you're looking for like what's the alpha what's the alpha in today's alpha league it's eve yeah the price of eth is the alpha guys that's the alpha and we we could talk about staking what the returns are but i feel like um in general i don't think eth as an asset uh and the execution risk diminishment that you were talking about is appreciated in the mainstream of course but let alone that the crypto markets so uh we will see how that feeds into price in the coming days but um can we talk about like what what folks should do so what what the announcement actually means is that there is now a deposit contract for your youth right um you shouldn't just send eve to that deposit contract right uh you have to set up a validator and go through the steps you know one way to do that is to look at some of the guides that we've put together on on bank lists about doing this in test net but there are some like you don't just get free money like in a in a yield farm there's some responsibility that goes within the old farm this is not a yield farm this is the yield farm of all yield farms and it takes some work so you got to get your hardware together you have to understand a little bit about how the software works you have to secure your private keys there are some steps to this but um let's talk about that date of uh december 1st so in the intro earlier you were talking it looks like december 1st but you didn't say it's absolutely going to be december 1st why did you why did you hedge a little bit right on that right so there is a window of opportunity for many people to deposit 32 eth or more into the deposit contract.ethe address but we want a sufficient time for people to do that right and this is a big deal like we this isn't some like random you know proof of stake chain that you know got spun up and doesn't really do much other than that this is ethereum and this is also ethereum 2.0 so we're going real slow here and so we're going to have a nice long window for people to deposit 32 eth in order to reach a minimum amount of ether required like we need some sort of like consensus as to like yes we're ready to start ethereum 2.0 and we are signaling that consensus by having roughly half a million ether uh deposited into the staking contract so we're taking our time to get to there uh we have almost a full month of november to get to that point and if on december 1st we do cross that threshold of half a million ether then we can have the security needed to get the ethereum 2.0 phase zero chain up and running if we don't hit that threshold by that time it gets kicked out until we do hit that threshold so we have infinite amounts of time to get to that threshold but we aren't starting until we do get to that threshold and then if this hap if that threshold is met at december 1st or later the phase zero of ethereum will start seven days after that threshold is met right and so that is what we can expect that is something i think we'll we will be frequently talking about on the bankless podcast on the bankless youtube uh so you know prepare for for tweets and for information as we watch this bar march forward into completion david probability that it doesn't hit 524 000 some odd eth before the date required to launch this december 1st what's the probability on that fifteen percent fifteen percent interesting okay i hope you are uh you're paying your 85 percent likelihood that we get there before the the uh december first date i hope your calculations are better than nate silver my friend uh my bank list predictions have been pretty pretty local to the actual answer so i'm feeling pretty good about it not bad yeah i would um you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna raise yours i think it's a 95 chance 95. i think yep i think it's absolutely it won't take much but let's talk about if there's gonna be a prediction market well i'm sure there will be uh absolutely um so with that we're going to get to the rest of the episode with preston van loon where we go real deep on some of this eat staking stuff if you want to live a bankless life you need to get a hardware wallet there is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self-sovereign fashion that's why i have four ledgers that i use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well ledger live is like your home base for managing your ethereum defy and crypto accounts it does a really good job of aggregating all of your different ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one but you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page one thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and ryan talk about with the bankless skill cube enabled in the ledger live app so right now in the ledger live app you can buy sell lend swap and stake your crypto assets which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skill cube something that's new to ledger live is ledger swap where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on ethereum and on bitcoin if you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger go to the blog post the power of ledger live on the ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet i personally like the ledger nano x but i also have both they're both great options when you own a ledger you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone so go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self-sovereign as possible the bankless state in the nations are brought to you by wiring wiring is defy's first self-building community run project which i just get really really excited about iron is a system that seeks out yield in d5 and it does that in a number of different ways a very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different defy experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token right and so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in d5 for those who want to just earn yield on their stable coins the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and wiring will go and figure out which money market on d5 and is producing the best interest rate whether it's dydx it's compound or ave it looks around d5 to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stable coins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn.finance to get started and also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well all right bankless nation we want to welcome preston van loon who is a developer on one of the most important clients of this new eth2 network the prism client preston how you doing man hey uh doing great today is a pretty exciting day for us so having a great day it is an exciting day um i feel like i i woke up this morning and look uh we don't know who the president is but we know when the e2 launch date is and i guess that's fine i guess that's okay one kind of equals others so how long did you know that this date was coming like this specific date that they were going to announce the date uh just a few days ago the people from the research team reached out to us and asked if we agreed with the deposit contract and if we were okay to go and we said yeah you know it's it's time we're we're ready for this to be out here so we we didn't know this was kind of news to us as a couple of days ago so yeah we're not weren't too far ahead of you guys that is pretty cool so preston what are some of the things that got finished like what were the boxes that got checked that made this made us ready to have this the release of the deposit contract yeah i think one of them you know like the most important pieces were that all of the clients were very stable um you know madasha the testnet medashas are our current long-running testnet has been suffering from finality issues for like three weeks now um it was like something like five almost five thousand epochs since finality um but we saw the light at the end of the tunnel everything was stabilizing and then just yesterday it finalized um so that was good the client stability was was good the launch pad which is how everyone's initiating their deposits it's kind of the canonical route to do it um that tagged their version v1 everything was good there with their audit and everything um then the final piece was just to to deploy it i mean the deposit contract has been audited and formally verified for some time now um yeah exactly there it is so uh i think those were the biggest blockers or our client stable is launchpad ready and then is the contract ready and this has a this this is the specific address on etherscan where the contract is deployed so like what was the what was the process to get that working right we kind of saw it move through the github process but like finally activating this contract and creating the public key for this contract how who did that how did that come about so this contract um we we don't know specifically who deployed it it was someone through tornado cache deployed it for us and at first some people were kind of concerned about that myself included but the byte code on the contract is exactly what it needs to be exactly what we expected um it's it's the first instance of it being deployed there's really no risk in using this so we just said you know reach out to all the client developers and all the key figures in in e2 space and say are you on board with this and everyone unanimously said yeah let's do it so um that's how this became the deposit contract so what's crazy is we don't really know who pushed the button but it almost doesn't matter because this is all social consensus in action it's a very interesting experiment in decentralized governance i think we want to peel back the layers on what that means but before we do i want to make it very clear for listeners what what actually happened what what was just announced let's be let's get really concrete on on the details phase one or phase zero this is not phase zero this is an announcement of phase zero right so what are the specifics with what specifically got announced uh today so we got announced today was um the deposit contract address so where deposits will be sent um the minimum genesis date so a refresh is to start eth2 we need 16 864 deposits or something like that but we also need uh we have set this minimum genesis time so that if we got all those deposits today um it would still we would still wait until december 1st at 12 p.m utc time for the change of lunch so that's that's so we have enough time to prepare everyone has enough time to get their clients online uh et cetera uh additionally if if we don't get the sixteen thousand validators before december first uh we still have a a baked in one week delay seven days delay um so the important thing is now we know i have a really great idea when the chain is going to start and then the uh the version one of the spec is now officially complete those were the last two things that were missing were you know the contract address and the minimum genesis time so that's what we're looking at here right preston so this is the eth launch pad that you were mentioning earlier and there's this cool graph it almost reminds me of like the like the the battle and biden v trump to get to 270 um electoral college seats here we're trying to get to five thousand uh or 524 000 some odd eth in here and so this bar is increasing looks like we've got a four point you know 4600 or so and 45 eth right now what's happening so that that youth is being deposited but validators aren't starting yet correct yeah that's right so you have validators who've sent their their deposit with their the metadata and the 32 eth so they're at their they're registered in that like initial genesis set um but clients aren't going to do anything with this data until i mean it's being monitored but until this bar reaches the end um you don't need to have your client on at all you don't have to do anything once your deposit just kind of wait for this to happen and like i said we'll have at least seven days of lead time so when the bar becomes full uh we're going to start seven days later or december 1st at 12 pm whichever comes later very cool so i want to go back to the conversation of like the deposit contract and how it got deployed to that particular address uh that particular address has a bunch of zeros at the start of it which is a hard thing to to find i think like in order to find an address like that you actually quote unquote have to mine for it as in you have to to run a lot of intensive uh computation to try and find an address with a bunch of zeros it's a little bit like proof of work so there seems to be some sort of force in planning that went into getting an address that has a bunch of zeros in it that's really easy to identify because it's really hard to find an address with a bunch of zeros and you mentioned that somebody put in some ether into tornado cache to withdraw it to a clean address which spun up this contract and it you said that uh the byte code matches and what that what that what i think that means is that there's a there is a canonical some probably somewhere on github i'm assuming a of a what a deposit contract is and the byte code uh that is deployed by this contract uh matches that and so that's how we have assurances that this is actually the real thing and this isn't like some like you know rogue rug pull contract that you know somebody just randomly deployed and then it seems to be that the ethereum.org website which ryan just had up which has you know 4000 something ether deposited into it that is what at least the ethereum.org website is pointing to as what we are assuming to be the canonical version of the deposit contract so this is all kind of like this experiment in like decentralized coordination it's not technically official but it's only official because that's what everyone seems to be calling official that's absolutely right and and good point about the the mining the address someone put a lot of thought into that to get that many zeros uh takes several days of hashing probably uh we did the same thing for i think for our topaz test net we pre we mined a contract address with enough zeros in front of it so that it became easily recognizable and then now we can count the zeros and we know it's two one nine a b five i mean those are it's not that hard to to remember and we know that with that you have some probabilistic security it gets harder to mine an address the more the more uh character prefix characters you're looking at additional value is that um zeros are less storage on e2 so you might say actually save some gas with having so many prefixed zeros so that's that's a kind of cool benefit yeah wow that is one of the best pieces of ethereum trivia i've ever heard of it in a while okay so between now and december 1st we expect ether to get deposited into the the deposit contract if we hit that threshold before december 1st great that's fantastic that means that ethereum to the phase 0 could launch on december 1st what happens if and you said like if we don't get to that point we have a seven day period um that will uh and in that seven day period if we once we hit that threshold we will start then what happens if we don't get that ether threshold inside that seven day period so the the seven day period starts when we hit the threshold so let's imagine that we hit the threshold on on november 30th well then we're not gonna start until december uh seventh because we have to have at least the seven days lead time um but if we like if we were to get all of our deposits in today well we have a lead time until december 1st so it's at least seven days uh so so the if you want to put into simple terms we'll start on december first or seven days after that sixteen thousand three hundred and eighty fourth deposit whichever comes later okay that's the decision there's no actual deadline we have years and years and years to get this much ether if we ever needed it for whatever reason and that i think that's it that's an important point you make david because uh we were we're talking about december 1st being the launch date right that assumes that we hit this threshold here of course uh if we don't we don't really know the launch date it could be beyond december 1st so i guess the big question like everyone's going to be you know checking this refreshing this multiple times a day i'm sure preston i guess the big question is are we gonna hit it like how much of um ether supply is that it's like about half a percent or so half a percent so what what's your take press and you think we'll have any trouble hitting that i think this brings a kind of an interesting chicken and egg problem because there's no incentive for me to deposit early except maybe i want a specific you know validator index but if i deposit now and the chain doesn't start till december 1st i have opportunity loss i could have been doing something else for that eve but i also want to be in the genesis state because i don't want to be then be in the queue i want to start right away so um i think what we're going to see is it it'll get it'll slowly move towards the end and then it's going to rapidly move towards the end uh this green bar that is is there is there any like chance of being able to incentivize people with uh po-op tokens or maybe being able to like nft a very low number of validator slots is that something that is possible yeah definitely yeah and i'm sure the po guys have something in mind uh i don't know what exactly but definitely having an nft to to your account that represents that you were part of the validator genesis set um would be really cool to have especially because it's such a you know finite set of people uh it's something to be proud of i think if you're one of those early adopters who wants to show off that you are part of e2's genesis i think that's really cool that would be a really cool poet yeah david i often talk about ethereum as a digital nation this is kind of your patriotic duty you know to you can be part of the birth of this entire initial bond offering on ethereum this is like a i mean this doesn't happen this is like maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity if ethereum becomes what we all think it might be so you want to be in there there's like this social kind of pressure right just be a good citizen all the way guys are going to do it all the cool kids are going to do it you want to say you were there you want to tell your grandkids i mean who knows what this ethereum network could be so there's that but there's also can we talk about like why economically i might want to put my funds in there post launch um the launch pad has this great section on staking rewards which i think makes it makes it pretty simple but there's a downward slope sloping curve here which basically shows the amount of annual return you receive denominated in eth based on how much total eath is contributed to the the the staking the validator contract how many you know how much ethan staked so um how would you kind of describe or characterize i guess this this curve preston you see this this curve um obviously is diminishing as the number of validators joining the active set as you can see this is designed to incentivize those early doctors and keep people in there early a great part about this is you kind of have an expected guarantee that you're going to be earning this apr for some time because e2 has a rate limiting function where only so many validators can join per day and initially that value is going to be 900 validators per day so you're going to see this slide move slightly to the right by 29 000 ether per day which is you know relatively slow that would take a pretty long time to get uh increased by one million or so uh so you like to get all the way to this five percent apr that's going to take us a super long time wow okay so that i did not know so two things there so um first for people who are listing this on the podcast um you can check out offline launchpad.ethereum.org see the chart we're talking about but at the very start if there's only 500 k or so half a million eth in the deposit contract annual returns are like 21 21.6 and that drops if denominated of course which is better right that's what that's what we want is money maybe all right and then but if there's uh two million eth then you're making less it's eleven percent ap uh apr youth denominated ethan's money if you are if there it gets up to five uh million then it's seven percent kind of drops in that fashion all the way to you know this kind of stops at 10 million each deposited and you're five percent but one thing that preston just said there that i not sure i picked up on fully first time around is that you want to be first because after launch it sounds like what you're saying is there basically the contract only lets in a specific number of validators a day like 30k worth of eat per day so it's not going to get to that 2 million 5 million 10 million overnight it's going to take a long time which basically means if you're early you're guaranteed to have the higher side of this curve from from a return perspective did i understand that correctly yeah that's right so it the the rate at which we a lot the system allows validators in uh changes depending on the number of validators but until we get i think around half a million validators in the system we're only letting in four validators per epoch uh and so that's 900 per day or 29 000 eats per day so the slider on the sliding graph will move pretty slowly at least at first okay so we deposit eth into the deposit contract then what we're starting to see it funnel in right now but so what happens right and let's be clear when we talk about these returns this is not a yield farm this is not a pr a d5 protocol on ethereum this is ethereum itself and so when preston when when we send like 32 ether to the deposit contract what what else are we committing to doing when we do this so yeah that's right this is this isn't free money or or you know you have to you actually have to do work um you have to run your validator you have to keep it online and you know that in itself is not very expensive but it's it's not like a set and forget kind of thing you do have to monitor it and keep it keep it going uh because you're only rewarded for the time that you're online and participating um so if if that's new to you definitely check out one of the test nets so you can get a taste of it without having to to put up real money um but yeah you do have to to to do some some kind of work i mean running your validator is pretty simple and right now if you send your deposit now there's nothing you have to do until the change starts and like we've been saying you'll have at least seven days notice of when the chain is going to start okay so we send 32 ether to the deposit contract and we're ready to run our validator how do we connect the fact that we sent 32 ether on ethereum one to our ethereum to validator how do those things get bridged so when you send your deposit through the launch pad you will get back some you'll get your private keys for your validating client you'll get like you'll get a backup mnemonic phrase so if you're familiar with any kind of accounts on it there you have this like 24 words that make up um a recovery key basically and then you'll get your deposit data which is some metadata you have to send with your deposit that tells e2 system associate this 32 each deposit with this specific validator public key and its parameters on where they're going to allow withdrawals to happen um but the key part is you have to send that metadata and you have to send 32e or your deposit will be rejected basically from from the deposit contract okay so so you is it bad or incorrect to just like send 32 ether to the deposit contract address or does it have to get funneled through the right route to in order to have it be like registered with ethereum 2.0 you can well i would recommend highly recommend that everyone use the launch pad that's the easiest way to do it but if you come up with valid deposit data any other way whatever other tooling that's that's fine you just have to send the metadata the deposit data with your deposit to the deposit contract i was looking at the contract earlier today i've already seen a few people send 32 eth with no data so that got rejected and you know the funds refunded back to that person the transaction was failed so um you can't just send money there it has to come with the metadata you have you should use this process especially with the launch pad that's what it's there for um and with this kind of thing you want to make sure you're doing it right because if you like in all things crypto if you make a mistake is a high chance you're not going to be able to undo that mistake all right don't be it don't be a cowboy follow the directions right exactly yeah there is uh you were mentioning earlier uh preston you know a way to do this if you're unsure is to actually try this in testnet first right like so me net it's real money you don't want to mess up with it and then the dosha testnet is going it's live we actually put together a guide on bank list that consensus the folks behind the launch pad helped write for us with with the ef a guide to becoming a validator um that's a good guide to go through just to understand the steps and we're actually going to be updating this for mainnet too so you understand that and like going through the the launch pad is is definitely the the best way to go but even before that i mean folks need to figure out how exactly they're going to stake right so we talked about in this guide what sort of hardware you might want to use if you're going the hardware route and i think people can like understand that but there are there are other routes that they can go through too right preston what are some of the main i guess staking routes you do it yourself you bring your own hardware what are their cloud-based solutions are there other alternatives for staking right now uh so right now yeah most people i think are preferring a hardware approach this this kind of takes the decentralized part um to heart so you're running on your own bare metal in your home or or office or whatever and that's great it's it it works really well if you know what you're doing it may not be for everyone i mean you have to make sure your your internet's going to be online all the time and then your power doesn't go out things like that um because you want to earn the maximum you want to be on online all the time to be earning rewards all the time but you you can use the cloud deployment that's totally totally fine the risk with the cloud deployment is now if we see a lot of uh validators running in in digital ocean for example you you could see a outage on digital ocean which takes off a large number of validators and when a large number of validators goes offline that can affect finality and when finality is not happening penalties start to increase exponentially and it kind of snowballs into this this like kind of bad state that we don't want to be in and if you look at madosha how it's been operating for the last three weeks that's basically what happened i mean it wasn't a cloud outage but we had a large group of people basically abandon or turn off their nodes and then the network got stuck in the state it's not finalizing it gets worse and harder to process and so on um so keep that in mind if you're using a cloud provider make sure you either run on like a smaller one that's a virtual machine or you're running your own hardware or you could consider running with a some kind of speaking pool there are a number of them out there who are are planning to have staking services either when phase 0 launches or shortly after and that may be something for you just make sure you do your due diligence there i can't advocate for any of them in particular but i i do know that um the protocol itself is designed so there's no delegating of your stake there's not like delegated proof of stake so you may be giving it maybe a custodial solution that you're going with so just make sure you you understand what you're getting into if you're choosing a staking service rather than running it yourself i think bankless at some point we'll put together a guide to help people even evaluate staking services but but if we stick with the the hardware approach right um first that might be the way to kind of get started let's say i've got a spare macbook pro i've got like cable internet that kind of thing and i've got samith how many validators can i run on one spare macbook pro with my you know the consumer grade and i've got like a home internet connection can i run a bunch of validators on one machine or is there some limit 20 2018 2019 macbook pro with you know a typical hard drive and cpu yes yeah and that's that's a great option um first of all because it has a battery so if if your power went out momentarily you your computer is not going to restart or anything so that's great in terms of the number of values you can run we think that from a software perspective there's not there's not really a limit we've run as many as 300 000 on one laptop um which is like an insane amount in in the real world so in terms of like hardware is it going to be able to keep up with that many that's totally totally fine for us as much as you can imagine uh your your validating process can operate on multiple keys i think lighthouse supports it other clients support it of course prism supports that um so that should be no problem at all no factor at all so the only thing you're considering now is like oh you have all your eggs in one basket so your your laptop could be you know everything's on that one laptop so maybe you want to distribute it if you're running like hundreds maybe you want to on different machines but for a technical perspective it's totally fine so what you gave got one power supply of course like one heart set of hardware components one internet connection just a quick question then i want to ask you about slashing because that's part of the risk the the risk but so let's say um you know let's say i guess i am i am running this setup um how am i securing my private keys right so by the way all of this is so cool because it feels like um the old days of like mining gpu from your home you know like we could do it again we're minting money in magic internet money again back in the old like bitcoin days back in the old ethereum days when it launched there's like something so pure about running your own hardware and getting started that way something so exciting about it but but anyway um so where am i where could i store my private keys can i have a different i guess withdrawal type address like i could keep that on a ledger nano or something some sort of hardware wallet so if it's if my machine is in my office or something like i could keep my private keys totally separate from it where is there a component that needs to be like always plugged in and like a private key live validating the entire time so with these two you have two sets of keys you have this hotkey which is what you're using to sign all the work you're doing as a validator then you have this cold key which is where when you do a withdrawal your funds will go to this withdrawal account which is this other you know separate account from your validating key and when you go through the launch pad you'll get back that mnemonic phrase the 24 uh word phrase and then you're validating private key which is you know derived from that recovery phrase but also your withdrawal your withdrawal account is also derived from that mnemonic phrase so once you get that mnemonic phrase you want to put that into some kind of cold storage if that's writing it down on a piece of paper with a pen or printing it or or encrypting it and filing it away somewhere that's the one you want to really keep safe because if if your keys were to be compromised i mean what an attacker could do is limited with your hotkey um but if they were to get access to the cold key they could then transfer the fonts eventually right um transfers aren't available in zero but that's that's super cool if somebody comes in and snatches my laptop with my validator on it i'm not losing my my private withdrawal keys i'm not losing that storage cold storage piece because i'm doing it though i lost my laptop yeah and your hotkeys your hotkeys are always encrypted at rest so you have to every time you start this process you either type in your password or load your password in somehow but if if they were to snatch your laptop they close it um when they if they were able to get extract the files off the disk somehow they're still encrypted at rest so they would then again have to know what your password is to specifically for those uh hotkeys person the thing that i think is the the biggest not the biggest risk but the most generalizable risk is slashing risk right um and that's just something that everyone is going to be exposed to uh so um we'll talk talk about the the the parameters around slashing risk like how does one get slashed and then how bad is that is it if they were to get slashed right slashing is a mechanism in eth2 to discourage a certain type of behavior which could confuse or delay finality uh in e2 so for example if one of the roles you have as a validator is you're attesting to the state of the world you say it this is my view of the blockchain what i think the head of the blockchain is i'm going to sign it and send it out to broadcast that to everyone that gets included in the chain we use that to determine finality what's the what's the head of the chain the canonical chain what should we be building on now if if it's your turn to attest and now you start saying two different things say oh i think block b is is the head of chain but also block d which is on a fork now you're going to be confusing um the system trying to mess it up that's that's typically a behavior you're doing on purpose malicious behavior yes exactly that's called a double sign sometimes right that's a double sign there's also double proposals if you create two different blocks for the same slot if you're you know assigned to be a proposer that could that's an issue and so how do you avoid this right like we just said it's something you do on purpose but it can actually happen on accident if you're running those keys those validators in two separate processes the beacon node may determine that the head of the chain is block b on this process but on another process block d so you actually might accidentally be producing that scenario so the the key thing you want to keep in mind is that your hotkey should only be active on one machine at a time running one process at a time if you're thinking about automated failover don't think about that thing about something else just just have your monitoring in place and when your internet goes out or whatever do some manual interaction to fix it don't try to do something clever because you're probably going to mess it up and that's how you're probably going to get slashed if if anyone's getting squashed you need to that's probably what's going to happen um so yeah i mean it's really easy not to flash just to have this do the clients provide some sort of double sign protection just a little bit to help with that yeah we do yeah most clients do but it's not bulletproof so don't rely on that entirely you could think like oh if these two for example these two machines are running on opposite sides of the earth i mean they may not receive each other's message by the time they already broadcasted theirs and by then it's too late so yeah really just keep your machine with the keys running just the one key one machine you know keep it safe that way and what we're really talking about when we're talking about running two machines with the same hotkey is we're talking about something relatively sophisticated when it comes to maintaining up time with our validators right and this probably is not really applicable to like the average amateur validator this is really for people that they have a system a redundant system where if one computer goes down in one household under one internet connection then they have the system that spins up another computer that it has claims on a similar amount of validators that start signing in in a different location different internet and that maintains uptime but uh from what i understand about to slashing in the event of inactivity just being absent you're actually not punished all that much at least in the short term can you kind of go into the economics behind slashing as a result of downtime which might happen to you know almost perhaps everyone depending on how long we're talking about so we we think of that as a aliveness penalty it's a little bit different than flashing um but it it is essentially equal to the amount of you would have earned if you were online so um if you think about if i was offline for 24 hours i lost 24 hours worth of opportunity loss there but i also lost you know 24 hours uh value of each so if i'm making let's just say point one each per day that's not the amount but if i'm earning 0.1 each per day i and i had 32 each at the start of the day i would have 31.98 at the end and so it will just take me two days to get back to basically or another 24 hours of being online to get back to 32 and then i'm whole again and it's fine so if you're thinking oh i'm gonna go on a three-day vacation and i'm worried about my laptop dying or internet goes out you're going to be fine like it's not it's not going to be the end of the world so don't stress about too much that's just like opportunity cost right it's not going to happen 2x opportunity cost yeah well it's opportunity cost and you do your balance does diminish uh you do realize a lot in addition to the opportunity loss that's kind of like a double double loss there but um it's not that big of a deal um so if you're worried about going on like away from your computer for extended period of time you'll be fine um i wouldn't worry about it too much yeah so think about it this way say like the average individual you know amateur staker is live for 99 out of 100 days uh that means like maybe on average three days out of the year maybe four days out of the year they are receiving this offline penalty and so their rewards go backwards uh by four days when it could have gone forward by four days and so like by the end of one year they maybe have like you know out of 365 days in a year there may be behind by eight days of rewards which in the grand scheme of things not that big of a deal like congrats you were able to go on a four-day vacation without having to stress about it yep yeah the only yeah the only thing to i guess worry about or or consider is being offline in an event where there's no finality happening because then those those liveness penalties we're talking about start to increase uh exponentially so if if it's been two weeks since finality the penalties for being offline are so much more than they than they were if you the system was healthy and finalizing so if a different scenario right that's like it's not just one guy going on vacation it's like everyone parks their hardware in some data center and the data center goes dark or like everyone's on the east coast in the u.s and east coast gets knocked out by something yeah this is an anti-centralization uh mechanism right and right finality it only happens when two-thirds of validators can't agree on the head of the chain basically so you have to see about one-third of valdeos stop participating for this event to happen and we expect that to uh never happen in in unless some like extraordinary event occurs like a whole data center or a whole nation going offline or something like that okay so those those slashing fees if you're you're off the internet not too bad i almost think about it it's like there's like misdemeanors and felonies right so like you get slashed because you're offline that's a mystery ticket yeah parking ticket slap on the wrist right but if you double sign that's a big penalty isn't it that's a bad one that's a similar inclination and you get thrown in like it's the harshest the harshest penalties the nation can devise all right um okay so one thing while we're talking about the risk so the risk we outlined for kind of slashing and going offline we're right we're there but there's another risk in just even venturing into this new territory and i i want i i think we want to make this clear for for bankless uh readers like our bagless listeners we're all on this journey west we always say it and of every every episode you could lose what you put in this is this is crypto it's dangerous stuff if you're deciding to stake your eth right in this new eth 2.0 it's one direction there's no coming back you are effectively burning your eth on the ether main chain and you're you're cashing that burned each into each 2.0 so you're effectively taking a bet there's a one-way bridge and there's a land over here that you're in and that nice city you enjoy because you're you know a theory member of the city ethereum and then what we're talking about is oh we're going to go build a better city across this bridge and you are literally taking your stuff and crossing the bridge and it's you can't ever come back it's just one way right i think that's what you're getting at with with your tweet preston because you said depositing ethan to eth2 deposit contract is effectively a burn and you just wanted to remind folks of that can you dig into the risk there right so yeah it is a essentially a one-way transfer of eth from from eth1.x to e2 and you you really won't be able to do much with that eve uh until each one and these two merge together so you are kind of locking yourself into this um into the future time period where you're on youtube and you you're not going to be able to transfer it back and you're not going to move it you're kind of signing up it's kind of a long term commitment i think that phase 1 1.1.5 or or or even phase one when transfers might be enabled it should be coming towards the end of next year i mean it's not that far out some people have said two years which is you know still a possibility but i am kind of on the optimistic side uh going forward is that you know it's about a one-year commitment but you have to be prepared that if you want to be one of these early adopters that there is no bounded limit there's no hard date when you're going to be able to move that ease so yeah it is an adventure and it is kind of you know going into the wild west here and and it it it has some uncertainty so you have to be prepared for that listen the the next conversation comes about the the mechanisms of uh producing a an alternative to this uh in an off-chain environment and a lot of people have brought up the topic of beacon eath or beeth or beth as like well because of this one-way bridge we can actually like centralize services like um you know i don't know coinbase or you know binance can offer you you have to purchase your beef and you know we have a off-chain like trading market for a for this beacon chain ether and you know there's some some people from the ethereum side who think this is not really that big of a deal not really going to happen and other people from the uh from yeah i don't know generalized crypto twitter that think that this is actually you know totally going to happen and it's going to generate you know two separate ether prices two separate assets is is is a separate beacon chain ether asset with like a separate ticker symbol on centralized exchanges is that a big deal should we be worried about this um i think it's good to have some some healthy skepticism of that you know these are two blockchains running in parallel right it's not a fork it's not east one with some new features is a completely different blockchain running in parallel so whether or not it's um another asset i i i don't know i i feel like it's not because you know for one in phase zero there are no transfers right so you're not gonna be able to give up ownership of this eth to some want to anybody to sell it uh in phase zero right so i don't know what exchange is going to i mean unless the exchange is like kind of issuing ious and they're holding the the ethon e2 themselves uh that's a little different it's kind of like a derivative i suppose um but yeah i don't see it as that big issue ultimately because these two blockchains running in parallel will be merging soon and then there's again only one each so yeah i don't really see that as too big of a concern but definitely a good topic to talk about and keep talking about in the community and yeah it's also the case that it's it's still one eth like it's not like there's a total separate supply schedule here right we're talking the same ethereum the same sort of issuance policy right i mean effectively what you're doing is you're you're putting it almost in like a bonding mechanism it's just you don't know the end duration date right if you put your us dollars in a bond and that bond is maybe two to three years does it become something other than like like us dollars in a bond i mean it's just staked it staked us dollars this is just staked eath so yeah i right i don't know i guess people are are are thinking about it uh in maybe different ways and i wouldn't be surprised to see different asset with a different kind of price point but at the end of the day i i don't know why you would call it a different asset when it's got the same issuance uh schedule it's like the same thing essentially it's just living in a different place right it's like when i move my eth to coinbase it doesn't become coinbase eth it's just i've just moved it to a different network right i don't know right and does does rap east trade differently than eve i i don't think so like it's the same you know exactly all right preston uh this has been absolutely fantastic i really appreciate you hopping on the the call with us and getting us informed about eth2 this is exciting times and sir you have been at the spearhead of this effort so on behalf of the bankless nation thank you for help building out this new this new entire city for us to move to of course thanks for thanks for thinking to me and you know what it's an absolute privilege to work on this stuff so uh really excited for for maintenance to come this quarter uh just excited for the future and thanks for having me guys we're excited to stake you preston was one of the guys who was uh decided to build on ethereum building youth tube while everyone was saying it would never ship and i think they're still saying that so what happened at google google for a theater super cool man it takes believers like that to make the stream a reality super cool take care preston all right thanks a lot guys if you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto you need to go to

i'm just so excited to get the ball rolling on here we are about to enter the golden age of ethereum it feels like dude preston van loon is such a trooper he's been grinding since day one so tip of the hat to him and you know there's a so many people have put so many hours of labor into ethereum 2.0 so i think we want to talk about like what does that actually turn into and you know some some people make may consider this a controversial uh statement but like when you when a bunch of very very smart dedicated people believe in something and pour an absolute magnitude of man-hours into something i expect that that thing would be valuable right and this is something that i'm going to be looking to the secondary markets to really signal if that if that is a valid take or not and this is why we think ether is undervalued and interestingly ryan is that you know there's a bunch of conflating data here like we're also looking at the crypto markets during the u.s election uh yes the spx the the s p 500 index is also moving bullish bullishly upwards but like we had this on november 3rd election day we had that what we what i was talking about earlier which was the movement of the ens domain deposit contract.eth a lot of people started to figure it out and ether price jumped from 380 to 400 right and bitcoin price jumped from 3 13 700 to 14 000 right then and there uh and that to me like crypto markets have actually been uncorrelated the last two days and so to me that signaled that bitcoin price moved upwards on the uh rumor of of phase zero so you think bitcoin is maybe going to follow eth a little bit and and i showed some signs of that uh yesterday right starting yeah i showed some showed some signs yesterday and then i i got into a debate with nick carter and he was like you know what did he say i i said i said like you know the reason why bitcoin is moving on to 1400 is because of ethereum two deposit contracting goes like why would that impact bitcoin and i i said well i don't really know but like look at the charts they're happening at the same time and then this got repeated again today where we first it was a rumor and then it was the official ethereum.org site and all the people in who are working on ethereum 2.0 like all said like yeah this looks legit and then ether price moon from from 400 from it went back down to 390 and then it moved up to like 410 415 and then bitcoin price blasted through 14 14k it's that 14 200. and again conflating variables spx is also mooning but i think bitcoin's moon and because of ethereum man and it's always done this it's always like the 2017 bitcoin all-time high was the ico mania on ethereum and bitcoin moving past 10k was as a result of defy summer in in ethereum and now bitcoin moving through 14k happened when the ethereum 2.0 staking contract got locked or got announced and so like i'm a fan of conspiracy theories and my conspiracy theory is that bitcoin moves when cool things happen on ethereum oh yeah and i think that's like for me that's like that's not a conspiracy theory that's like what we see empirically and those instances sometimes bitcoin moves lots of times bitcoin moves and then eats follows but sometimes eth moves and then bitcoin follows i think some people are unwilling to accept the the latter or the the eth leading because they feel like it's the tail wagging the dog a little bit right and they're like no bitcoin is the dog right and ether is the tail and you follow me and i'm not sure that they're right about that the evidence for that right i know regardless look bitcoin does well eve does well eef does well bitcoin does well this is true you should buy both that's the final alpha leak right here yeah but you can't stake your bitcoin so you can't that's that's david flipping uh eath bowl again so hey man i've always been an easy excited all right dude so um what do we got next so this is alpha leak what what can folks do now what um kind of resources are we gonna provide for them you wanna start with the the rocket pool resource that we have yeah so rocket pool is something i i that i have close dear to my heart and the reason why i say that is because rocket pool uh of all the other projects on ethereum yield farms defy apps whatever rocket pool's a little different because it's related to the core infrastructure of the ethereum blockchain it doesn't it doesn't actually have any code in the l1 itself it's like not a natively built system but it does operate impacting the actual fundamentals of the ethereum blockchain right and whatever what rocket pools are is are staking pools you know the we have a theory that ether is going to be really valuable one day and that means 32 ether to stake might be like out of reach for a large amount of people and so rocket pool is a staking pool where people with less than 32 eats can come together to stake on a single node and this is really good for for decentralization of ethereum in two different or in two different ways it decentralizes the nodes by incentivizing more total nodes and also decentralizes the set of possible staking individuals so it really is increasing decentralization on two separate fronts in one product there's a fantastic video with uh david rugendyk who did a we were talking about the end at the end of the interview about how efficient we were with the interview there's really good information in there and so if you're looking for more information there's going to be a link somewhere in this youtube video in the corner here where you can click and it'll take you right there uh some some definitely some some it's a juicy info there absolutely uh so if you've heard everything we've talked about so far you're still interested in staking but you don't have 32 eth you want to stick less than 32 you don't want to run your own hardware this is a decentralized way to start staking super cool i'm not sure on the flip side of things however if you are interested in running multiple nodes you can receive your staked ether and then a little bit of a dividend on top of that for allowing other people to stake their ether on your nodes and so you can actually make a little bit more money than just vanilla staking yourself yup pretty cool economics there and they've been doing this for a long time um two other resources that we're coming out with so we've got a uh how to how to become a validator on the e2 test net on bankless we will include a link to that you can look at the test net but we are updating this for mainnet here shortly so we'll have a mainnet version for you as well at some point um subscribe the program you will receive that as well lastly we are putting together a summary of an eth2 economics report that consensus is publishing and we're going to have that for you probably thursday if not early next week hot um yeah it's going to be hot uh we might talk about it on a meet the nation too so anyway lots of resources coming at you on the bankless program that we will be providing david this has been alpha league we've been waiting for this specific alpha leak for years a very long time super exciting man anything else you want to say yeah hey ryan congratulations on making it all the way through the bear market into phase zero right we're finally here like we did it the days you too yeah you too cheers to everyone who went on the journey with us and really stuck it out during those you know kind of dark times well right now it's even still even though we had defy summer it's uh not many tourists in this space it's it's all the people who've been here for the long run and um yeah like tears bear markets are not fun i think we're on the other side of that and uh looking forward to sticking with you guys alongside of you guys all right well risks and disclaimers of course ethan's risky so is eth staking none of this was financial advice guys um you know this is the bankless journey you you know the drill uh you could lose everything that you put in if you're putting it in eath if you're putting it in defy staking so it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the journey this has been our alpha leak eat staking edition
