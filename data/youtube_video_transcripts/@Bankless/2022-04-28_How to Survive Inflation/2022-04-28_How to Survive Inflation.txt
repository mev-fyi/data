let's talk about what we can do individually how to prepare it would be really nice if we had a plan in this conversation and how to fix fed monetary policy but like it's too broken what do we do as individuals to try to save ourselves and those around us if you're frustrated with policies that the fed is doing uh one is you can definitely vote for candidates for elected office that share whatever views you have and so although you can't influence the fed you can influence congress and your governor or your president practical way to do that is to opt out of debasement of paper money and opt into you know hard assets like crypto blockchain a from a financial standpoint allows you to manage your finances better and invest in things that won't be the base but then ultimately obviously collectively governed protocols are way better than the kind of representative government ones that we currently have so
