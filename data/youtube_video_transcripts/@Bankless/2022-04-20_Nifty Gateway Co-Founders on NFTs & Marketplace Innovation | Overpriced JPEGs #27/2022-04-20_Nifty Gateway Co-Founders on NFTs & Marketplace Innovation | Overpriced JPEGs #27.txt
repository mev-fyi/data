[Music] hello everyone gmgm welcome back to another episode of overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and today on the show i have duncan and griffin foster the co-founders of nifty gateway their names are a handful and i asked them about their last name because i had to uh but they are the co-founders of nifty gateway and nifty gateway is one of the first nft marketplaces it was founded three and a half four years ago so duncan and griffin have been in the space for a very long time and have watched the evolution of the space so we talk about nifty gateway's origins we have some of that fun historical talk about what it was like back in the day we break down what's failing about the traditional art market world and how nfts and crypto art are a huge improvement and what we can expect there and then really what i was most excited about was breaking down some of the new features that nifty gateway has launched as a part of their new non-custodial marketplace specifically duncan and griffin have been touting the fact that nifty gateway's new marketplace will have 70 lower gas fees and i really wanted to dive deep with them on how that works down to the smart contract level so this this conversation does get a little bit technical um i'm not a dev i'm not super technical so if you're a technical person you're probably like gonna listen to this and laugh at me but i think if you're on the cusp where you you sort of you understand this technology but you're not a dev you you don't play in smart contracts on a daily basis i think you'll find this really valuable at sort of understanding it at a slightly deeper level so recommend you check this out if you're here it seems like you are and just excited for you to hear this i would love to have these guys back on they uh they've been around the block for a minute or more so uh they're a valuable perspective to have before we dive in we will have a word from our sponsors and please enjoy my conversation with duncan and

going to talk about all the exciting new upcoming things on the docket uh here at nifty but i wanna here at nifty at nifty gateway i'm not here but uh i want to start with sort of the background give give people some context for nifty gateway you guys are super og's in the space so i also just want to like pick your brain generally and extract all sorts of wisdom from it i want to start with this which is my understanding is nifty gateway launched like three and a half years ago is that right yeah that's right okay so cryptokitties had its own marketplace crypto punks had its own marketplace what were you selling on nifty gateway three and a half years ago not a lot of people know this but what nifty gateway started as was just a tool that let people buy nfts with a credit card it was sort of like kind of similar to what moonpay is now actually so sort of a plug and play purchasing solution um it was it was live on the cryptokitties website so there was a button where you saw a cryptokitty you wanted you could hit buy with nifty gateway and then you just plugged in your credit card and yeah it was a really that was the the first thing that we started with just as a simple solution to to onboard people into nfts so was it more of an api in that sense than like its own landing page or it was it you just got like redirected to nifty from like the cryptokitty site it was basically like an affirm tool or like a paypal where when you were on the checkout page there was just a button that said buy with nifty gateway and yeah we actually worked with a lot of of the early prominent nft projects we we partnered with axe infiniti on their land sale which was a which was awesome i mean that's an amazing team that went on to have like a huge amount of success um and then we did a lot of stuff with god's unchained too um so yeah the but definitely the nft space was way different back then and you're right there i mean that's part of the reason that we decided to pivot to a marketplace instead there were only about nine or ten projects that really needed uh you know a credit card purchasing solution so we just didn't think it would be a very big business griffin when did you guys decide to make that move to a to a marketplace so the story of nifty gateway is actually kind of hilarious and it involves a lot of twins because we launched the credit card purchase yeah it's very it's very twin centric as as it as it would turn out um we launched the credit card purchasing product and we got our first seed investment from adam draper we were part of the bruce vc accelerator which was great and we finished the accelerator we got introduced to the winklevoss twins and we all thought it would be pretty great to try working together so they actually acquired the company they acquired nifty gateway about seven months into the history of nifty gateway and after we were acquired by gemini we kind of sat around and asked what is it the nft space is really missing and back then it was very small the nft space was tiny like it was a tiny fraction of what it is today and we thought accessibility was one of the biggest problems remaining to be solved like we really wanted to make it easy for anyone to launch an nft or to to buy an nft and that's kind of how we launched the marketplace that nifty gateway is today it's funny because it feels to me like you've had this weird progression of there was you you had top shot which was later than you guys but early in the in the scheme of this whole thing that both allowed for credit card payments and so you almost had this like super early day thing where people could pay via credit card and then you've had this middle wave where that isn't the case and it's it's a lot more like kind of tech centric hard ux you got to get your meta mask etc do you find that progression funnily funny and that it almost feels like a d aggression you could argue i actually think it makes perfect sense uh for the following reason um it yeah it definitely does appear a little funny but what we've observed is that people get onboarded into nfts with a credit card you know maybe like they hear about nfts and they want to try it but they're too lazy to set up a meta mask and that's sort of like the that's like the beginning of the learning curve but then they progress and they get further along the learning curve and once they're once they're at the end of the learning curve with their own wallet and meta mask then all of a sudden that becomes a honestly a pretty good user experience um you know there's a lot of things that are are great about an all metamask ux for example the fact that sales instantly settle right to your wallet like as soon as you make a sale the eth just gets sent right to your wallet that that's a pretty awesome ux i mean one of the hardest parts of a fiat marketplace is cashing people out and there's almost no fiat marketplace that uh has instant settlements i mean this was something that people people definitely got upset at nifty gateway about it and top shot i think was even worse where you know back in last year it sometimes took up to like six weeks for people to just cash their money out of out of top shot um so i kind of think it makes sense you know yeah it's a it's a tough on-boarding experience at first and it's really important to have that credit card onboarding where people can just get started but then once they learn what they're doing and once they have a wallet there's a lot of parts of the wallet user experience that make a lot of sense so you get bought by gemiini and the winklevoss twins you said seven months into the the company's existence was this would that have been 2019 then or were you still in 2018 2019 it was 2018. the acquisition closed in june of 2018 but it wasn't publicly announced for like six months after that we kind of kept it secret but yes coming up on three years ago and the insight you guys land on is we need this easy on-ramp that's credit cards were you also at that point what did you think the nft market was going to be at that point was it just digital art in your heads or or what was your interpretation of what this industry would be yeah that that's a great question um the i would say the other big insight at the time was uh it was kind of two-fold we really thought that the nft space would go towards a model where more well-known people were creating nfts and that would be how it grows you know you get you get people with large audiences be they artists be their musicians to create nfts and that drives awareness um and so it was about the accessibility but it was also about we we said okay we're gonna make a really strong push to get high quality people making nfts and get people who are well known outside of just you know outside of the crypto scene to create nfts so that was the other thing that we spent a lot of our energy on and yeah i mean we we always thought that uh nfts would go from art to other things at some point but i guess honestly i mean i thought that i didn't we didn't think that the market would cycle as quickly as it has it's kind of mind-bending to to be a builder in the nft space because every six months you look up and the paradigm has totally shifted and you know so so we said okay you know we're going to really focus on art at the beginning um and i think that was a that was the right decision because you know a lot of those art releases really helps nfts break through to the mainstream i still think that people say like christie's was i mean there was a lot that went up to that moment but i feel like that was the moment where everything went totally where the world went totally crazy and from then i feel like we've just it's just been a constant cycle of of you know more attention more users more growth um pretty steadily and people had been releasing art on nifty gateway prior to the the christie's auction is that right yeah that's right was that where he got his start with nfts people so yeah up until that point people uh we'd done two different drops with him um and yeah he was honestly a pretty good example of i think an artist who he was a person where we we really thought it would be super impactful for the space if people made nfts i don't think we quite anticipated that he would become uh you know the huge name that he became um i think even even he was a little surprised at how quickly that happened i mean he works incredibly hard and he earned it but i think it just happened so fast um but yeah the first two drops we did with him were were nuts the second drop i think was actually particularly memorable because the first drop he he sold a few hundred thousand dollars worth which was a big drop at the time but you know other people had had higher sales amount and then the second the second drop uh i think it was a weekend long auction that went for 2.3 million or 2.5 million and that yeah that number really got people to wake up and pay attention and you know that that's a serious life-changing amount of money for the first time people were like hold on i can make that much money selling these nft things i should probably learn what a what an nft is and yeah that that really kicked off just an epic wave of adoption griffin did did y'all approach people did people approach you how did your two parties come together we approached people we actually spent a huge amount of time in the early days reaching out to artists that's most of what we did actually right after we acquired and we brought on tommy kimmelman who's now a legend on crypto twitter and um you know an awesome employee at nifty gateway but originally his job was just to reach out to people artists sports teams who whoever and try to convince them to launch nfts and as a part of that we reached out to a huge number of people and people was one of them and like duncan said when we got him on board we really were really excited and we thought he would do well and he's just kind of one of the stars that um has completely taken off in the crypto movement hearing you talk about all the outreach you were doing in the early days reminds me of a story fuocious actually i think said to me or maybe it was he said it in another podcast that i listened to in preparing to to interview him but that you know he started releasing his work on nifty gateway and and he was just sort of doing it alone and in isolation and then i think it was actually somebody from the nifty gateway team that reached out to him and was like hey you should actually put something up for sale like he was just kind of putting art up but not actually listing it for anything um do you feel like that that hand-to-hand combat that like that hustle there was is that sort of been the key to to y'all succeeding uh the way you have i think that's a major part of it this was another another really big thing that we did that was slightly different early on um back when we first started the the most common way to release art and all the other art platforms were essentially open minting platforms very i mean similar to what they are now they haven't changed their models very much but on super rare for example you got admitted to super air and then you could vent your artwork anytime you wanted and it would just sort of go up as this listing and you would wait for the bids to come in and eventually if you got a bid that you liked enough you would accept it and we we thought about it we we decided to try something different i mean really it was honestly inspired by the the streetwear world you know another like another like very modern aspect of culture how they would release everything all at once in a drop and you know the the drop itself is fantastic marketing you know like you're you're creating this event-based uh event-based hype that that brings a lot of people and brings a lot of eyeballs so we said okay we should we should try doing these um you know we should try releasing nfts as a drop and kind of see where that gets us and it ended up being an extremely popular format uh you know i think drops have gone on to be really really successful but yeah it it really was i mean at the time like no one was really releasing nfts and drops you would just sort of mid them and then yeah the other thing is i mean we still have a we have an awesome creative team now whose job basically it is all they do is work with artists you know so they they hold your hand they help you figure out hey here's how i'm going to approach the nft space here's what i can do to make this drop really really exciting here's how i can do something you know a really interesting mechanism uh we do a lot of custom work around the drops to make them extra special like the last drop we did with ferocious we had a the paint leader board and all these extra mechanisms um and so yeah i think the you know the producers are a critical part of nifty gateway that have been there since the beginning and the they work so closely with artists and you know they have a really strong bond and a really strong relationship i don't i don't think the platform would be even close to what it is without them um so shout out the nifty gateway producer team griffin were you guys like art enthusiasts at all growing up did you have any interest in art or was this something that was born out of your interest in tech and in the blockchain it was born out of our interest in tech and the blockchain right which i think is not that uncommon a lot of entrepreneurs come at problems sideways and i think that new perspective can help a lot you know like elon musk actually wasn't really into rocketry before he started spacex where it was kind of an evolving interest it's the same for us i i think a lot of the the naivete about how art worked and the willingness to question assumptions and build something totally new has helped us in the nft space and i think you've seen that a lot a lot of the most successful nft people didn't have gallery backgrounds or didn't have fine art degrees i mean some of them did but what's really cool about the nft space is how much it's been willing to question the way the fine art world works because the way the fine art world works is i it just it really holds a lot of people back in it it's very legacy driven and everybody assumes things have to be done a certain way just because they've always been done that way and that's what i've liked about nfcs is that people are much more open-minded i want to ask you guys a little bit about how that legacy art world works but i i do want to stay on this thread and say duncan you all have have become our curators and and from the early days have been selecting who goes on your platform how did you guys feel stepping into that role how do you feel qualified to step into that role how are you making determinations about you know who to let on the platform uh well i mean you know honestly as i would say that it wasn't as griffin mentioned we didn't explicitly set out to say like okay we're gonna be art curators we didn't really come from a curational background and i think that has benefits as well as as downsides it does mean you can you can uh question the way things are done i i think it's kind of a it's kind of a weird role to be in i mean we're not personally curating we're not personally hand selecting every artist uh we have a you know a lot of people who work on that at nifty gateway now and actually the head of curation at nifty gateway uh was an artist on the platform before he became the head of curation which i think helps a lot i mean he has a ton of empathy he really understands what it's like to be an artist he you know he takes the role very seriously um but yeah i think it is a little it is a little bit of a funny situation to to find ourselves in um and you know honestly it's it it's amazing it's it's really an honor working with artists is a very a very fun job it's you know like a lot of uh a lot of other industries like are just not nearly as as fun or interesting as working in art is that that's what i found so i i feel very lucky uh are y'all open about what your criteria are for making it onto the platform as an artist and maybe griffin if you want to take this one and go back and forth yeah um there aren't strict criteria for making on the platform as an artist we have a team of curators and it really is a group decision and it's driven by our head of curation haavo who is is really talented and has a lot of empathy and understanding for what makes good art you know we we try and we try and work with a diverse group of people from a lot of different backgrounds one thing we try and do a lot is partner with artists and if they have crazy ideas around custom smart contracts or something like that that's a program we're building more and more where we'll just partner with an artist and we have the smart contract engineers we have the technical expertise to make crazy stuff happen and a lot of artists have crazy ideas but they don't have a team on hand to build it so you know in that sense we work with them i think what we did with poc and the merge drop is a really good example there as well as footages and the paint drop and yeah we we don't have specific criteria it's more of a team-based and consensus-based approach and you know it's definitely not perfect there's a lot of great artists who haven't dropped on nifty gateway and it doesn't mean they're not great artists it really just means that we can't cover the entire ecosystem duncan what are y'all and then crypto art the nfc world in general fixing about the broken traditional art system the physical art world or the fiat art world as i sometimes like to call it it's uh it's actually it's not something i really understood well before nifty gateway and it's something that i've learned a lot about and it really has a lot of nuance and complexity i think the biggest issue with it is that it's kind of uh it's very static it almost feels like molasses and it's really the thing that it's not very good at is it's not very good at helping um artists get discovered and helping their work be distributed widely quickly you know the the model for being a successful physical artist is you move to new york you spend a long time networking until you finally meet the right gallery owners they agree to do a show with you and you're one of the lucky few who's made it in nfts you know it's the model is like you open up social media you tweet out your work uh your collectors find you you know you open up a discord for them so it's really a much more open engaging format and i think you know nfts are still very new but the amount of money that's being paid out to artists and creators via nfts is already in the same ballpark as the amount of money being paid out to artists and in sort of other creative domains i i honestly like to compare it to tick tock versus hollywood where you know the the strategy to being a movie star being a celebrity used to be you go to hollywood and you get a get a role in a tv show and now all you have to do is you know if you're funny enough on youtube if you're funny enough on tick tock that's how you become famous and that's how you you know become a celebrity um it's kind of the same thing for an nft artist versus a physical artist where you know if you're it's a much more open and egalitarian system in my opinion um and then there's a lot of other really i think the the biggest thing that the in my opinion that the physical art world gets wrong is the opacity it's it's so opaque you you can't figure out how much art sold for um just period it's it's so difficult to get that information and i think the the reason that they set it up that way is they in their opinion it actually helps prices rise and it helps the artists like earn more money but i actually think what we've seen with nfts is if you create this really open and transparent system then all of a sudden it becomes a more investable thing because people know what their investment is actually worth they feel more comfortable spending more money on it so if they kind of went the exact opposite direction and went fully transparent i actually think the amount of money that people spend on physical art would go up so i kind of think that's the biggest thing that people miss there's so much there that i want to comment on i think uh totally one of my questions is do you think that this is are we in a renaissance era for art collection you know like i've spent my life thinking about like people who have art as like old people you know and uh you know upper middle class to upper class people who have the kind of disposable income that make them wanna whatever on their art uh do you think that will fundamentally change for the long term uh with our generation i do think so yeah i i think there's like a really there's a really strong possibility that that happens i mean this is this is a really interesting point that someone made to me once um you know basquiat his painting sell for 100 million dollars on the secondary market but you look at has it who's had a bigger cultural impact on the world is it bosque or is it taylor swift like taylor swift is just a much more of a household speaking in my language yeah yeah i mean big t swift girl taylor swift like you know has this legion of devoted fans whereas fine art is still like a it's a pretty niche activity and i think a lot of it a lot of what makes it niche is honestly the opacity the fact that it's financially inaccessible for so many people and then just like the logistical difficulties play a huge role too where you know like storing owning caring for a piece of art um so i think nfts really have the the potential to transform art into this it's a like truly a mainstream cultural a mainstream cultural phenomenon um which it hasn't been for it has been at times in the past you know in the renaissance it was the most like one of the most mainstream but yeah i think nfts have the potential to bring that back i certainly hope so what's also so interesting where my head went as you were talking is part of it too is music is this immersive experience you listen to it you know it invokes a lot there and i recently interviewed danny cole who's the artist behind creature world and he's been pushing boundaries in different ways about how can art itself now become an immersive experience through nfts where the art piece itself changes with your experience or you know you are kind of co-creating the art piece with the original artist and therefore it's becoming more immersive the way music is um and that's just something you can't get in the traditional or physical art world something that blew my mind and it's on this this this point of opacity that you made as i've tried to learn a little bit more about the the traditional art world is um you can't necessarily in all cases just go into an art gallery ask the price of a piece that's for sale and then buy it they will actually vet you as a collector out and even if you have the 300 000 or a million dollars or whatever they're asking for this piece of art they they can refuse to sell it to you griffin is that true do you have any more insight into that or or thoughts on that dynamic it is true yeah yeah i actually have a friend who works at a very high-end art gallery and they wouldn't even tell her the prices she like asked about some of the prices of paintings and she's an employee and they stubbornly refused to give her a price on a single thing that was being sold at art basel it it's absurd i mean to people who work in nfts it's crazy to think about that no i think uh yeah that the other thing i want to mention about that dynamic is in the physical art world you essentially see control of who your work gets sold to to the gallery where they have they have 100 control over that and like that that's where the dynamic comes from um you know the gallery basically becomes the gatekeeper and they have they decide who the who the right collectors are it could just be their friends like you never really know which is such a crazy dynamic in the compared to nfts and and as i said i think i i understand why they went that path it it makes sense but i think it's kind of a they're thinking small about it a little bit and if you make the whole system transparent instead then you open it up to a lot more people and you make it much easier like people are actually willing to invest more money if you have a transparent system versus if you have an opaque one and it's what enables the royalties for the artists so you know you were saying the traditional art market keeps it opaque in in some way to benefit the artist or they can get a higher price for the artist if it's that way but the reality is like all that is slammed through with nfts and the royalty system of course this actually segues us nicely because the royalties right now are are rarely a smart contract feature and primarily a marketplace feature and so it speaks to the importance of marketplaces like y'all you have launched some big changes and made some big announcements recently and i think you may even have some more coming coming up um the big top line here is a migration from a custodial platform to i think a hybrid model where you'll have both the custodial and non-custodial piece did i get that right um duncan do you want to say say your piece on what's happening there yeah that's that's exactly right um up until i mean really this week uh you know the only way that you could buy and sell stuff on nifty gateway was if you deposited it into our into a custody wallet that we controlled um so kind of similar i mean it was really intentionally modeled after the way that uh gemini and coinbase work um and i i think it's very valuable for bringing new people into the space um we we've seen this born out in the data repeatedly where there's a lot of people who want to buy nfts but you know the friction of setting up a wallet is just too much and they end up not buying because of that friction so the custody makes it really really easy for people to get started um but then you know once they're started once they know what they're doing then they open their own wallet and they want to trade stuff directly from wallet to wallet so we're really excited to have both of those things under one platform we think combining the two of them and like being a being a platform that can service every level of the the user journey is really going to open up nfts to a lot more people um and probably and hopefully make the market a lot more liquid as well so yeah it's a it's a big feature we've been working on for a long time nft marketplaces and and i think specifically these non-custodial compatible marketplaces right your your open seas and your uh what looks rare and like get a lot of flack it feels like it's been hard for for folks to to get it just right um what are some of the improvements or features griffin that that y'all are excited about why why can you nail this yeah so the non-custodial nft marketplace that we're launching it's not we didn't just set out to go and imitate the architecture of everything else that was out there we started working on this almost a year ago and we really sat down and said how can we build a next generation marketplace that's you know a step function improvement from what exists currently and how can we build like the next generation marketplace it's this cliche to say that we're still early in nfts and you know it's hilarious i joke but i love it when people say that but we really are very early in the the tech and there's so much room for improvement on the technology of blockchain and it's so i think there will be many more paradigm shifts we go through before it settles into its final state really similar to the internet if you look at the 90s in the early 2000s there were so many paradigm shifts there were so many companies that were enormous and then just got blown out of the water because there was some huge breakthrough in the tech and i i think we're still very early in the days of blockchain so what we set out to build here was the next generation nft marketplace at a high level the the initial benefits of what that means is that it has 70 lower gas fees than other marketplaces which is an enormous breakthrough that it took us months of tinkering to get right it also means you don't have to pay any gas to cancel listings which is an incredible optimization pangas to cancel listings is a terrible ux so often you're trying to cancel a listing and then it gets sniped because you can't call the transaction in time and it also means we can do other really cool things such as marketplace project specific discounts and user specific discounts so we can take a project and we're doing this with a lot of launch partners and they're all getting zero fees for the month of april which is a really cool thing we have that sort of customizability and flexibility and that's really just v1 of what we're launching it's really built on a new technological paradigm so we have a lot of other features that we're planning that we're super excited about one of them for example we're calling it free shipping it's where you'll be able to put an item up for sale but you as the seller offer to pay the gas fees on behalf of the buyer so it would be a zero gas purchase for the buyer which is really really cool and yeah it's just the beginning i think once users use it they'll realize it's much more advanced much smoother much better ux and it really is just meant to be an evolution of what nft marketplaces can be if you're starting on your nft journey you need metamask this is your tool to unlock the world of defy and nfcs without giving up custody over your private keys metamask is both a secure in-browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet so that you can connect to any web3 enabled website you can now trade tokens with any dex or aggregator metamask swap gathers real-time pricing information across the d5 exchange ecosystem allowing you to select your best price while getting all of the metamask benefits of self-custody lower gas costs and increase transaction success rates metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet which i use while i'm out and about and i use it to collect poaps nfts and use it for all my default things while i'm away from home if you haven't downloaded metamask you've got to try it out download metamask for desktop and mobile at metamaths.io or load up your ledger trezor keystone or lattice hardware wallets so that they too can get into web3 wearable is the nft platform that's leading the charge into the multi-chain universe ahead of us available on flow tazos polygon and of course ethereum wearable is the perfect place for nft newcomers profile picture collectors and experienced nft traders wearable has a variety of nft features that set it apart from other nfc marketplaces they have a native messaging function allowing you to dm your friends or haggle with sellers they also have a mobile app on ios and android with a built-in nft portfolio tracker tool so you can easily check the value of your digital art portfolio wearable is built on the wearable protocol a multi-purpose open source and community governed nft protocol that helps build products and services across the nft ecosystem including white label marketplaces tailored to specific nft communities so go to rarable.com and start discovering and trading nfts putting in floorbiz to join pfp communities and dm with some brand new internet friends so i think the uh the top line there the grabby bit is this 70 lower gas fees and i actually want to get technical here um can you walk me through how this has worked previously and and and what you were changing and optimizing for that allows for the 70 lower gas fees uh maybe duncan let's throw it to you definitely um so the key difference as griffin mentioned we've we really have the benefit of hindsight and we've been able to see how all the other marketplaces are built and you know think about what they do well and think about what they do poorly um so uh to to break it down a little bit uh you know making an nft purchase really requires three fundamental steps um first someone has to create an order an aurora is bait an order is a piece of information that says i want to buy an nft or i want to sell in nft so if you list an nft for sale you're making a sell order and then once someone else says i want to complete the order then you have to do a process of order validation which means making sure that the order is correct making sure that you know the buyer has paid the right amount of money etc and then once the order is validated to be correct you have to do the third step which is order settlement which essentially means completing the transaction sending the nft from the seller to the buyer sending the money from the buyer to the seller uh yeah and the way that nft marketplaces have evolved is basically they have the first step off chain so when you when you list something for sale you create an order that gets stored in a database uh and and you know like not nowhere on the blockchain but then they have steps two and three happen on chain um and we looked at that and we basically said okay because because step one is already happening off chain there's not really any extra benefit to having step two happen on chain and in fact there's a pretty high cost users have to pay a lot of of gas for this order validation to happen so we just we made the decision to basically build a marketplace where step two happens off chain as well as step one the only step that happens on chain is the the crucial step the you know the order settlement um and that's essentially what leads to the to the much lower gas fees and it's also what powers all the other innovations that that griffin talked about um yeah i i hope that was a good explanation yeah that's great no no i'm actually i think i don't know if you can say what i'm about to do is going to get more technical but i'm going to i think spell it out even further and you can tell me if i'm right which is what i hear you saying is uh when we talk about on chain and off chain i think that's a familiar concept to many folks at this point though still not to everyone when it comes to art a lot of people i think are aware that there are the image itself is typically stored on ipfs or in a worst case maybe an aws or somewhere else and then within the smart contract itself you have a pointer that says hey look in that location where that ipfs thing is that that's where your art is but we're talking about it in terms of uh like these functions what i hear you describing is uh currently right now that order validation stage it's just an algorithm or like a line of code that does that validation and that line of code right now is in the smart contract itself and it sounds like what you're saying is you're basically taking that that function that gets called is not in the smart contract itself and the information that comes out of it is stored in a decentralized place you know like an ipfs or some sort of database um and now the only thing the only function so to speak that remains in that smart contract and therefore the data is stored in that smart you know stored on chain is that order settlement layer is that like literally if i was reading the code that's what what you're saying would mean exactly yeah honestly you should be the one explaining it because that's great no no the other i mean the other really cool it's the beauty of being stupid and not a dev is if you get it right it's going to be simple because you you can't understand it any other way um the other the other really cool thing about this too is that uh if you're if your orders are validated on chain then you're you're kind of restricted to the the context of the the blockchain where the nfts live um and with our system we can actually create orders that uh work in multiple different contexts um which i think will be really powerful essentially what that means is you know like let's say you have an nft that lives on polygon you could create a listing on nifty gateway and say and say i'll sell this polygon nft for one eth but i'm only going to accept a mainnet eth payment and then someone else could go with their eth wallet and say like i'm gonna buy this nft even though it lives on polygon i'm gonna pay on a different blockchain but the order will settle so so basically like the payment will happen on one blockchain but the order will settle on a different blockchain without having to use a bridge without having to like transition assets between one blockchain to the other and and that's because that second layer that validation that is the validation layer the payment layer did it yeah you could call it that validation layer isn't is chain agnostic because it's not on a chain at all and because it's chain agnostic it's that flexibility wow that's really interesting i i'm still trying to process like practically speaking the and you gave the example but it's just taking my brain a beat to catch up to what that means um if i'm looking at like a polygon nft on nifty gateway i think i i mean here's here's what we hope uh you know like eath is the most liquid currency to trade nfts in by far like most of them are priced in eth um and you know you can you can wrap each and move it to another network and say like hey i want to use wrapped eth on this other network but there's still like there's far less wrapped eth on on polygon than there is eth on main net so we basically think it'll make it'll increase the liquidity for the nft market a lot because everything will be purchasable in eth which is the currency that most people have essentially that on a high level but i should also mention i mean this we're selling the future state here that is not launching this week that will launch like you know uh when it launches we can see what the impact really is so that's crazy though so what you're describing is i could go on to nifty gateway there could be a polygon nft that i could pay for with eth and that but the settlement would live on polygon which of course ultimately whatever that gets into side chain roll-ups whatever but okay that's really really interesting what's really cool to think about is in a future state you could buy solana nfts with ethereum or tasos nfts with ethereum or ethereum nfts with solana like connect your phantom wallet buy with buy pay with solana and then receive an nft to your ethereum wallet once the transaction completes like it's it's a very cool cross chain environment that we're trying to build to and this is the first step to get there it's the foundational infrastructure and the first main advantage is of course 70 lower gas fees and no no fees to cancel listings which we still think are amazing features on their own this is so cool because at a high level i've i've said this to people like obviously we're going to live in a multi-chain world and the end state of all of this is we're all going to interact with the blockchain all the time and we're going to have no idea what blockchain we're interacting with and it's all going gonna be you know very much just under the surface stuff that's happening um and this is like my first like now i'm like living through it you know i'm like oh my god i'm i'm kind of watching that play out and this sort of hypothetical future state feels like it's you know it's coming together which is very cool yeah it's uh we're really excited about it as well and it's it's really cool to build something like that i mean it's honestly one of the really fun parts about building a crypto you know it's like people are we're figuring this out as as we go along two years ago there wasn't really a need for any sort of multi-chain product because there was only you know ethereum was the only blockchain that had any sort of real adoption um but now there is and does this mean you can leverage the low gas fees of other chains while leveraging the liquidity of eth is that is that a way to put the huge advantage here not to harp on this point for too long but yeah i i would say so i mean you yeah that's a pretty good summary you you still have to actions will still have to happen on eth and like depending on how complicated they are like the gas fees might be pretty high but if you're just doing a payment on eth like that's done really pretty cheap you know it's usually only like two dollars in gas fees um right now so let's talk about the other trade-offs here and and griffin maybe i'll throw this to you because okay you're we'll talk more about some of the other features and and the benefits that we've just outlined which are tremendous but obviously there's a cost to everything and you've now taken another another step off chain which you know maxis may be or or uh won't love so griffin can you maybe elucidate like what the the trade-offs on the other end of this are yeah yeah definitely you know with any decision you make there's always going to be trade-offs the way we see it um i mean we eventually want to move towards a fully trustless future where orders are stored on chain they're fully permissionless maybe they're cross-chained in some way i'm not exactly sure what that would look like and that that that certainly i think is the end goal of nifty game and i feel like that's the angle of everyone in crypto the the way we see the downsides here are that as as soon as orders actually moved off chain which happened a few years ago because creating an order fully on chain on ethereum right now would just be really expensive it would you know and you have to pay gas every time you put something up for sale and i don't think people would want to do that you know we've moved away from an environment where everything lives on chain so taking since that first step is already off chain taking the second step off chain as well is basically equivalent in terms of decentralization so the way we see it there's limited drawbacks in that respect however i i do think you know more decentralization is probably a purely good thing and the question is how can we build towards a fully trustless future and that that remains very important and i i don't think this is really a step backwards but it's not a step towards that either so that's just something we think about i don't know is there anything you'd add to that duncan um yeah i know i think that was a pretty good pretty good summary essentially our thesis is you know because because this first step is already happening off chain it doesn't actually make that much of an impact if you move the second step off chain and it actually unlocks a lot of behavior as well um and yeah i also say like we're constantly open to feedback and and revisions um we we think that there are definitely ways that we could uh you know like move this to a essentially where it doesn't happen on ethereum but it does happen on something some other type of blockchain um and like then you can maybe even have a world where like the orders and the validation both happen on chain which we think would have would have some benefits um i mean this is this is v1 of what we're building but there is a bigger picture but that might be possible so let me ask you that i understand that this kind of marginal step of taking the step two off off chain it doesn't feel like a big difference but what are some of the drawbacks to having one and two off chain in the way that we currently have it you know i think we talked about composability at one point um being something gets lost and maybe expand a little bit on that yeah totally i mean um d5 is always an interesting comparison here where uh you know like a lot of d5 doesn't even work off order books and composability is so important in d5 where like you can take out a loan do something with the money and then repay that loan in in the same transaction um if you if if you had a fully on chain order book with nfts i mean the first big advantage would be it's much easier for anyone to scrape and and locate that order book uh i mean you can ask the people who have worked with the openc api and are trying to scrape orders from it it can be really really finicky and really hard to make it work and and you know they're an extremely talented team if all the orders are on chain then looking up the orders just becomes a much simpler technical task where you just have to look at every block and see the orders come in and then yeah there's so so that would really help with stuff like you know uh propagating listing information making it really easy for people to see like what what's being listed right now um and then yeah it would be kind of interesting to to think about like fully composable nft applications where you could buy something for sale list it and then buy it for you know buy it again in the same transaction um i think people really haven't explored what like truly composable nft applications could do and i think uh you know the fact that we moved to this this world where orders are stored off chain for the most part is is a big part of that um so yeah i think honestly my prediction is that we'll see what happens with defy and then people will come up with ideas from d5 and eventually point them over to nfts that's usually how innovation has has gone okay i have two follow-ups to this so the the first is on this this querying order book data you know on the d5 side is is part of this like or it may not even just apply to d5 but i think about like institutions and as institutions um who are starting to get into tried and trading crypto and like settling orders and and the regulatory lift that they have to comply with um and and trying to like match order some like is that part of this where their jobs become more complicated with an absence of step one and two on chain uh that's a that's a good question i that's not really something that i i don't really know about the regulatory requirements for institutions okay no i i asked this again it's so naive i have a friend who works for a um you know who works for uh like a hedge fund basically but it's like a crypto specific hedge fund and she just like all day long is just trying to like reconcile trades according to like regulate and it's like a nightmare because of all the different trades and chains they're trading on and this is not okay we're going to skip that composability i feel like my journey in crypto is just me getting closer to really understanding what the heck composability means and every time i like understand one part of it there like are new facets of what composability actually means that i feel like emerge so starting to grasp it again thinking about like our on-chain art i've had conversations with people about like cyber brokers or avastars and these projects for whom on the on-chain art piece was really important and understood where maybe composability comes in there like you can you can actually change features of the artwork on chain and that's all tracked and that's really interesting whatever can you speak a little bit further about what some of these other composability unlocks might be in more specific terms yeah okay i actually have a great example for this and i feel like i don't know for some reason all my composability examples end up being like hacks or malicious but it does demonstrate the technology well okay so so basically so there's a you know there's fractionalization apps where you can take your nft and split it up into a into a erc20 token and then whoever owns 100 of that erc20 token can redeem it with the smart contract to get the nft and then so so those apps exist and that's that's fully composable and then there is remember when board apes released their ape token a few weeks ago oh yeah was it a month ago yeah okay so there's no way it was was it a month ago i don't remember i time my perception of time is totally distorted yeah okay so so basically what someone did yeah as soon as that token dropped what someone did is they they took out a flash loan they bought up the existing supply of of uh a fractionalized board ape they redeemed the board ape and then they used that redeem ape to claim the ape coin and then they sent the sent the board 8 back so they got the the fractionalization back and then used those fractionalized shares to pay back the flash loan all in a single transaction so essentially they didn't they didn't spend any money um this all happened in one single transaction which is why composability was so key but they were able to claim like a million dollars worth of vape token and they did this on every every single ape that had that was fractionalized they did this on so was it was it essentially like an arbitrage opportunity between the price of the fraction like the fractional prices of the apes and the apecoin well it was an arbitrage opportunity that had nothing to do with the fractional price of the eight but because all these applications are composable you could just take out a loan for as much money as you want use that to buy the fractional shares of the ape redeem the ape coin and then you repay the loan all in the same block and because everything is composable because everything could happen in the same block then that that's what made this work essentially does composable is that it just means like being able to mess with on chain like is that is that a colloquial way to put it i mean yeah that's a that's a pretty good description it really just means like two applications can can talk to each other directly in inside the blockchain like they don't have to go outside contract yeah inside the smart contract like they don't have to go get any information from outside the smart contract yeah what duncan is talking about with composability is very interesting and like it really goes to the power of blockchain itself right like if all the orders were on chain it means that anyone could access every order that existed for a given nft and like we all have the same data we all have perfect data and it's kind of like the way bitcoin being permissionless was so powerful like it meant anyone can access the bitcoin protocol from around the world at any time and the the powerful like the power of permissionlessness is what composability is all about it it means that like once you build something anyone else can build on top of it and no one can stop them from building on top of it and because so many people build on top of what other people have built on top of it just really compounds into something very very powerful and it's a lot of the reason that blockchain has been so powerful i think and when we say build on top of because this is again i think where for some reason my desire is to like understand it at the smart contract level despite not being a dev by build on top of it we mean build something that can directly talk to the smart contract it's building on without human intervention that's basically it can call a function in that smart contract it can do something with the initial smart contract and that's what building on top of means is that right exactly okay yeah you can you can redeem the ape claim the ape coin return the ape all in the same trend like you can talk to them all in that all in one transaction like you you kind of do you click one button and the smart contracts start talking to each other back and forth and doing a thing to execute the whole the whole thing yeah exactly that's really interesting okay okay okay we're getting there okay so uh i want to just just reiterate some of the the the features you spelled out all that that mostly that stem from this key unlock this key technical unlock you all have been working on um so uh you have the the free shipping piece i love the way you say that where uh you know i as a a lister could say hey i'll pay your gas fee do they get any say like can they can they reject it if the gas is really high or it's like you're taking the gamble as the lister i think i mean we would have to build that in because you know like at some point like there's a gas price high enough where like the lister would owe money obviously not okay are you all worried about or do you do you relish the idea that other marketplaces will copy this innovation i think we've been in crypto a while and we've seen a lot of new entrants come in and um you know you really there really no milton crypto so i we don't know what's going to happen we'll see we'll see if anyone tries to imitate it you know there's never a boring day in crypto that's all i'll say rarible is doing like kind of co-branded marketplaces or like white label marketplaces i know they launched with meta angels like a meta angel specific marketplace that's wearable on the back end i'm i'm sure you guys saw that duncan do you have thoughts on that uh do you plan do you would you do anything similar give me your hot market take i mean uh i i always like to compare this to the to like the internet where you it is like it's a really valuable business to be shopify and to to power people's e-commerce stores but um it's it's even more powerful to be an amazon business because everyone goes to amazon.com and you know like while they're there they discover other stuff that they want to buy so i i think that both will happen um it's definitely something that we would explore i mean we really have our hands full like building the stuff that we've already decided that we want to build so we're actively trying to to take on fewer projects instead of more um but yeah i think it's definitely something that we would we would consider in the future um and i honestly i think it would be even more interesting with like a fully on chain order book system you know that lives on some other blockchain besides ethereum because on the theory may be cost prohibitive but there could be a really cool feature that future there where maybe every project has their own marketplace front end but when you list something for sale it automatically gets propagated to every other marketplace i don't know uh no i'm just like thinking of ideas i love it i love people thinking in real time on the show that that actually plays very well let's talk a little bit about the future to close out here uh this is a question for both you but griffin why don't you start with it uh a year from now five years from now where is nifty gateway what is nifty gateway paint me the picture good question well i i will say nifty gateway is less than five years old really our current product is only about two years old so predicting five years into the future feels really really tricky especially having been in crypto for as long as i have and seeing how much everything has changed in such a short period of time but you know i think our hope for nifty gateway i mean our mission has always been to get one billion people collecting enemies and we've done that by partnering with some of the world's best artists we've done that by making it so easy that anyone can get started like including my my parents and my grandma actually has some nfts she bought on nifty gateway and you know now with this new product like we're trying to expand to be the best self-custodial marketplace in the world so yeah i mean i i think we just want to continue to build generation defining products that are immensely useful to people and you know hopefully we can just do that and get closer to our mission of getting 1 billion people collecting nfts because you know that's what we all want and web3 we can all win together i thought that was a great answer yeah i mean uh no honestly we i feel like when we first started out we were way more confident about the future and just spending a little bit of time in crypto it's like like you just you're you get a way less confident about your ability to predict the future because it's totally impossible like no one yeah it's really hard to predict what's going to happen we just try and stay focused on like as griffin said like building stuff that has value and and makes people's lives better you said that to me we spoke before this this interview at one point and you made a similar comment of just like it's impossible to you know i've stopped trying to predict do you have any memorable bad predictions like two years ago we were like oh this is probably what's gonna happen that now would seem funny that you can share i'll duncan i'll throw it back to you since you just someone who said that okay that it's not my prediction but um almost without exception three years ago whenever we would talk to someone and we'd explain to them what we were working on and what nfts were like the most common comment we got overwhelmingly was people would be like okay i don't really understand this whole like owning a digital item thing but like what if we used nfts to to like um communicate ownership of a physical item instead of a digital item and we were just like okay i mean it was a really frustrating comment because i feel like at that point like you know there had already been a few people who tried it like there's obviously all these issues with nfts and like people just didn't believe that digital ownership was really a thing um and so like yeah that wasn't my prediction but that was everyone else okay actually it sounds like possession is nine tenths of the law or what you know what i mean like what do you mean prove you own the physical item is it in your home okay i actually do have a terrible prediction i made oh good good yeah which was the this so this was the project i was working on before nifty gateway it was just a side project i never actually worked on it full time but it was an nft platform where the nft essentially was like the the token gated solution that would let you view the artwork that you were buying so the whole idea was like you couldn't view the artwork or download it unless you bought the nft um and it was a terrible idea because because like i don't know in some ways like i was responding to the common criticism that people heard which is like i can just right click and save it but uh what i mean what we really quickly quickly figured out is you know people who collect nfts like they they know the difference like right people who right click and save are just like not really very relevant and then it's also impossible to stop people from downloading image files like you really just can't do it so that was it also like half if not more than half the reason people buy nfts is to socially signal so if you're the only one who can see it but i can see how in the really early days that makes sense it also even has the utility component that of course is so in vogue now we're like being a part of a club component that so you know i see where you were on to but yeah that was it that was glad you went with the direction you've gone yeah it's gotten better we abandoned that idea pretty quickly um yeah griffin what what do you think about and i i know this whole topic is we can't predict anything so i'm sorry but um the nft use cases that we're all excited about when it comes to like my mortgage will be an nft or you know i think of these some of these non-art examples of using smart contracts uh bullish bearish uh bullish definitely bullish you know i think again you saw this happen a lot with the internet all the companies that were fun in the late 90s were like web van and pets.com and you know web van was like we'll deliver anything to you and you can order it over the web and obviously that was a spectacular blow up but now we have instacart and doordash which is the exact same thing and we have chewie so all those ideas i think it was pretty clear to everybody in the early days of the internet what the internet would do like if you read the literature from that time most people were pretty much on the same page about what the internet would change and they've basically been right it just what was really hard to predict was the timeline where that would actually happen and like how it would actually happen and which company would get the product that managed to get it just right and also get the strategic positioning to really dominate those categories so yeah with crypto i think i think it's the same thing like everybody who hears about nfts they have the same ideas they're like let's tokenize every financial asset let's tokenize every mortgage healthcare data all that and those ideas are no-brainers and i think they will happen it's just a question of when like who and how i think within 20 years it'll happen i i also and i've probably said this on the show before what i feel like i've started encountering is like the legal obstacles to it i feel like it's a no-brainer that the tech will get there it's like we have to get to a point where a judge accepts a smart contract in their courtroom you know like and that that feels like a different kind of a an obstacle to overcome and it actually strikes me as the harder one than even the the business or technical case um okay last question which we can cut if uh if we're feeling like we need to but it's 4 20. so i have this very silly question which is your guys's last name is cockfoster is that that's right like how was middle school with that i mean yeah it's a it's a pretty funny last name and people people like always think it's hilarious and made fun of us for it i i can always tell that okay a lot of people the funny part about this last name is like a lot of people think that we're making it up and that we're just they think that we're making some funny joke about it you guys are like trolls yeah exactly and so like a lot of people have that impression when they first meet us which is like yeah it's kind of a funny experience and then a lot of other people laugh but like don't quite know what to say um some people just like straight up refused to say it and like some middle school teachers and stuff they would be like they're just refused to pronounce our last name it i don't know okay but it's actually great it's very memorable right like there's no there's not many other fosters in the world it's also funny because the name is actually it used to be a very common last name like way back in the day like in the 16th century was like one of the most common last names in england and then it became slang for something else and now like most people who had that name have changed it a little bit like you know the koch brothers are these famous industrialists but like that is someone who had the last name at one point and then just moved to germany where they go like talks or something and like there's all these like variations and that like you can see it's a history and like art we just like come from the people who stubbornly stuck with the name the entire time and it's funny because the name is from our dad's side the name's foster is from our mom's side and they just pushed them together they like combined them into a double last name which is like people also don't understand that because it makes no sense like i don't know so that was literally the my initial full question was like is it really that one parent is one parent is foster and and the parent didn't just say like i'll take your last name um anyway okay well thank you for indulging me in this uh of course i was curious and also you know it feels like an appropriate 420 conversation if we weren't going to be high for this this convo or at least i'm not we at least had to had to address this no it's great i'm just thinking about all the podcast hosts who are too scared to ask that question so i'm really happy you asked it come to overpriced jpegs where we'll get you the real scoop we'll have the hard-hitting questions that other journalists are afraid to ask okay awesome anything we missed final things we need to discuss here whether it's about products just general thoughts you have about the the space in general and i'll let you guys go uh general thoughts i mean it's always been a lot more up and down than people know when we first started in nfts for a while like a while a lot of the other companies around us just quit and gave up and people were like oh this nft thing is not gonna happen um so i don't know i mean the nft market feels pretty bumpy right now definitely a lot of volatility uh and yeah i guess i would just say like that's that's to be expected that's that's just how it goes and it's always been like that um so stick with it takes people stubborn enough to keep the last name to make it for the last five years that is uh oh truly thank you guys both so much for joining yeah i think i i can't top that so i'm going to leave it there um but i will we'll have to have you back on i would love to track the the ebbs and flows of this market with you guys you can talk more nifty gateway but also just talk broadly about the space you guys obviously just just know a lot having been in it for as long as you have and really appreciate both coming on yeah thank you so much for having us yeah thanks so much
