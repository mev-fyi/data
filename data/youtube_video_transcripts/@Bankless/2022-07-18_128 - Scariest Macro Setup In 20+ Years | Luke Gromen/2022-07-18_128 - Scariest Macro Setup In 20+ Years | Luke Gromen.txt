societal collapse starvation violent overthrows of governments i mean it is that's what happens when people don't have enough energy or food and so if mismanaged that's where this sort of could all go and that's what you know this all filters into why i think it's you know one of the scariest environments we've seen in in 27 years welcome to bankless where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance this is how to get started how to get better how to front run the opportunity this is ryan sean adams and i'm here with david hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys amazing podcast episode i hope you've been enjoying our macro episodes because here is yet another as we're trying to understand the landscape in front of us right now luke roman is our podcast guest today he calls where we are now the scariest macro setup he's ever seen in his career that's where we start a few things to take away from this episode number one why is this the scariest macro environment luke groman has ever seen in his career number two what a bursting sovereign debt bubble does to the world what it does to individuals why the choice for america is between bailing out the middle class or bailing out the treasury the asset class number four the future of all of the asset classes that are investable including what he thinks about bonds and gold and equities and crypto and energy and finally number five how we get ready what is the ultimate portfolio to weather this storm david this was another fantastic episode i'm just taking notes because i feel like i'm getting schooled in macro today with all of the content coming our way in bankless uh over the last few episodes yeah this is definitely one of the perks of being a podcaster is that like it's not like i know the answers but it's my job to go and discover them and so when i'm in these podcasts with people like lynn alden and luke i'm just receiving just the best information possible to answer my own questions uh the way that you phrase this this the start of this i hope you're enjoying these very dark podcasts about this future um but also at the same time like luke definitely presented a one of the more optimistic outcomes uh not not guaranteed but definitely positive outcomes uh you said um there's a choice between bailing out the american middle class versus treasuries and that was one of my big takeaways i'm going to go back and listen to this podcast to go through that again the american middle class versus treasury holders those two entities are in a tug of war and well you know there's certainly a way where both we can split the difference one of these two sides like definitely is going to win versus the other uh and obviously uh you will understand as a listener that we want the american middle class side to win because the other side of things turns us into the top-down high-controlled nation-state nation-state surveillance state that we don't really want in this world uh and so that was what really stuck out to me uh where like if we can figure out a path out of this extremely chaotic extremely volatile macro environment that involves increasing asset wage or excuse me increasing wages for the united states middle class that actually can be really bullish for america as a whole um i don't know how likely that is but the fact that luke sees a path towards that is a light in this very dark time david uh you and i have got to talk more about that during the debrief and of course a reminder uh we do a debrief episode after the episode for every single podcast and you can catch the debrief where david and i go over the podcast content inject our thoughts and inject our our comments on it after the episode by

bankless nation we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest luke groman is a macro analyst he's the founder of force for the trees which is a research company that helps investors find a signal right now and boy do we need some signal in the midst of all of this mind he has a big macro brain in the vein of uh some episodes we've done recently lynn alden raul paul jim bianco that sort of individual and i think bankless listener you can tell we are really on a quest to figure out what in the world is going on with macro because this is the key to understanding what's going to happen next with crypto so luke thank you so much for helping us out with that agenda welcome to bank list my friend thank you from rhian ryan it's great to be here so luke we're going to go through uh this you know as simply as we can high-level questions this is a definitely a investor engaged macro engaged but but primarily crypto audience so we're going to ask questions here like and some of these might be dumb you know noob type questions um but we want to go through what's going on in macro right now first of all how bad actually is it because it seems really bad right now then we want to touch on what's going to happen next maybe go through this asset by asset and then is all of this fixable and finally ending with what do we do you game for that sure that's let's do it all right let's talk about this uh how bad is it you called this the scariest macro setup in 20 plus years tell us about this why did you say that it is it's it's we've written a numerous times and have been really writing a lot of warnings all year basically uh uh culminating with that view that this i think is the scariest macro setup that i've seen in my 27 years in finance and the reason i wrote that is really a confluence of factors that have either individually either if they haven't been seen in a very long time or they've never been seen and when you put them all together we've never seen something like this before certainly in the scale at which it's happening and so to break each of those down the first is that this is the first global sovereign debt bubble that we have had in uh a hundred years really i think since the aftermath of world war one particularly because it is centered in the developing or excuse me the developed markets the advanced economies not in the emerging markets so a lot of what we're seeing in u.s japan europe has been seen from a sovereign debt perspective in emerging markets since 1980 but not in developed markets for much longer than that and the reason for that is we had a stock bubble in 2000 policy makers decided rather than letting that play out in a austerity slash deflation uh type out outcome they kicked the problem upstairs to the banking system via uh the creation of a housing bubble that burst they kicked that problem upstairs to the sovereign level by virtue of effectively backstopping the banking system bailing out pretty much everything which is an oversimplification but uh that created a sovereign debt bubble and the problem is once it's at the problems at the sovereign debt level uh there's nowhere else to kick that problem upstairs to i mean unless you can find martians willing to come down and sort of you can kick the problem to mars the the release valve has to be the currency they're going to have to print money at some point so you've got this bursting global sovereign debt bubble i think for the first time in 100 years when you then overlay that with the i think the second big issue is a you have a resource problem uh we've been writing about peak cheap energy for uh quite some time and that's not to say p we're running out of energy the issue is is that the marginal barrel of oil keeps getting more expensive to find and you when you if we didn't have all the debt we had particularly sovereign debt we had this would be economically problematic but it would not be economically catastrophic the energy is ultimately the true discount rate nature's true discount rate of economic activity and a simplified way to think about that is is there implied in the value of every asset on the board uh every asset with the exception of i think really two gold physical gold and bitcoin uh there is implied a growing supply of cheap and affordable energy and what i mean by that think about it as you have a house in the suburbs your house in the suburbs is worth four hundred thousand dollars the valuation of that four hundred thousand dollars is based on gasoline being two dollars three dollars four dollars a gallon if gasoline goes to ten or ten or twenty dollars a gallon the four hundred thousand dollar value of that house gets haircut significantly and that's you can do that to every asset some move up some move down but the price of of all bonds stocks real estate all of it implied within it with the exception of gold and bitcoin is a cheap and growing supply of of energy uh or a growing supply of cheap energy and supplies aren't really growing that much and uh they're certainly not getting cheaper they're getting more expensive to to basically stay in one place for for energy to not grow enough is taking more and more expensive energy uh and that then brings you to sort of the third leg of this which is given peak cheap energy and some of these resource scarcity cheap resource scarcity issues they are now leading to geopolitical tensions when overlaid with the debt and we've seen that obviously in spades since february of this year and and that then also makes it very scary for macro because you can see the russians weaponizing energy weaponizing commodities you can see the americans weaponizing the dollar uh and everybody else in between is getting caught between that rock and hard place particularly foreign creditors of the u.s that are short energies so that's eu japan china india these major economies they're short dollars and they're short energy and if they're short dollars the financial system collapses uh if they're short energy they have hundreds of millions of citizens starved to death and probably riot before they do and we started to see symptoms of that in some smaller places around the world it's likely gonna get a lot worse over the next three to six months on that front so when you overlay what's happening the first global bursting global sovereign debt bubble in 100 years when you overlay what's happening with peak cheap resources when you overlay the geopolitical tensions that are i think amongst major powers at their highest in uh probably at least 30 years and probably closer to 40 or 50 years and then you layer in some other factors such as the western policy makers u.s in particular have they've allowed this system to evolve in a way that the u.s absolutely needs asset prices to rise to keep the wheels on the cart so you've created this pro cyclical asset price inflation driven economy and now you overlay these three factors global sovereign debt bubble bursting geopolitical and peak cheap energy that are are making that difficult for that to happen so when you blend all these together that's why i say we haven't really seen any of these in on their own either in a very long time or ever when you blend them all together it's this it is it's the scariest macro environment i've seen in my 27 years in finance wow um we recently just uh did a podcast with uh lynn alden and we titled this this podcast is this the end uh and what you said where there is no place to kick this can down the road for where we're at the end of the road to kick this can down the road kind of sounds uh pretty similar but as we go into the global markets contagion with energy prices commodity and resources and all of this fallout i really want to just emphasize the the source of all of this uh uh contagion this this these issues which in my mind is the us dollar and perhaps like why we are at the end and why this is such a big thing to discuss is that the u.s dollar connects absolutely everything and that is this seems to be the focal point of this whole story and so i'm wondering luke why can you just help ground us as to what it means when there is nothing there's no further road to kick the can down the road towards and and what is the current state of like the u.s economy the uh the federal reserve and the dollar it's like why is this seemingly like the end of this story of the dollar in its current current phase can you just really just ground us here yeah so for me you know i'm always i i don't think anything's ever ending i think it's always a case of um you know what's normal for the spider is chaos for the fly right so um when i agree that we are quickly getting to the end of the of the road in terms of where to kick this to you can either you're really left with a very binary choice which is you let the system as it is structured collapse into a deflationary um in into deflationary chaos and that is going to be widespread sovereign defaults that's going to be commodity price collapse that's going to be the united states i mean that when i say sovereign debt collapse uh yeah others will go first like weeks first uh and you know europe defaults on sovereign debt and people think there's going to be some big lag oh well europe will go and then all the capital will flow to america and stock no the capital there is no capital if it defaults there you're in the contagion will be measured in weeks if not days uh and that in that deflationary spiral if the fed and policymakers continue to stand aside would be up to and including uh the united states government defaulting on its entitlement promises to baby boomers hey mom and dad i know you were collecting you know a couple grand a month in social security it's now 200 a month and oops you don't have enough to make ends meet you don't have to buy groceries you don't have you can't you can't make your your house payment um sorry um and it would possibly include once tax receipts fell enough which wouldn't take very long uh it's already happening uh the us government defaulting on on treasury bonds uh sorry treasury bond holders um we're gonna miss this this uh this quarter's coupon payment we're not making it and now that's very down the line i do not think that is going to happen right now we are on that path uh it is a non-linear path and if the fed just continues to stand aside and do nothing that is where this will go um that is a very very bad outcome uh the dollar goes to the moon in that in that scenario but it would be of somewhere between here in the moon for the dollar something very weird would start to happen which is already starting to happen if you pay attention which is dollar is 200 on the dxy index but there's no gasoline at the gasoline you know at gas stations why am i having to you know why are u.s gas stations running out of gas why are grocery stores running out of food when the dollar is strong well it'll be strong against other uh other currencies other paper currencies but the reality is is the amount of economic dislocation that would take place would be a catastrophic breakdown of global supply chains and widespread shortages around the world would it be worse it would be worse elsewhere absolutely but you would have this strong dollar and widespread global shortages of stuff uh so your physical commodities i think would be the dollar would be weakening dramatically uh against physical commodities uh even in that strong dollar scenario so that is leg one of what where where do we go from here the leg two is something that's very familiar to anyone that's lived in an emerging market has invested for long enough in emerging markets which is the sovereign balance sheet uh of the west uh is so bad that ultimately in a fiat currency system policy makers they talk tough they're going to raise rates they're going to let the dollar go all of this sort of uh where where i think the mind of the market really is at this point uh maybe not quite fully there but but getting there uh and then policymakers ultimately have to step back in and grow the balance sheet again to prevent and this is i think the biggest thing that people are missing now versus when they talk about the 70s or the 40s or any other time there has been no other time in hundreds of years where the sovereign solvency of the reserve currency issuer is at risk and so basically leg two is as the fed comes in and begins growing their balance sheet again aggressively to prevent the sovereign insolvency of the united states of the united states as allies and in particular the eu and japan and i think we're getting very close to that moment i think we're probably months away from the fed having to either having to print money to either buy you know renew qe domestically or potentially uh print dollars and buying euro debt buying japanese debt uh as a as a way of fighting deflation so we are when you say we're coming to the end of the road in terms of where we can kick the can to i think there is an element of truth to that from the standpoint of sort of this linear path that people have gotten used to seeing i think the from here things get very nonlinear and and the question then is do they get non-linear inflationary or do they get non-linear uh deflationary and ultimately really it comes down if if you're if you're a month-to-month trader um and this applies to crypto this applies to bitcoin this is not a good out you know between now and when they have to print the money to keep sovereign's solvent which i think they ultimately will do they will be probably the if not one if not the only uh sovereign in history one of the only sovereigns in history of the fiat currency that didn't print the money to keep the sovereign solvent by choice they just they never choose that policy makers that is so it's it's a i think a very high odds shot that the money gets printed to keep western sovereigns solvent and in particular the sponsor of the system the center of the system the the us and the us dollar the question is from here to there this is where all the money is going to be made i think in the second half of this year is how long is from here to there and um i've been surprised year to date that the fed has um i think they made a policy mistake last year i think they're they're i think they're uh well let me back up i don't think they made a policy mistake last year i think they did the right thing by inflating i think they made a policy mistake mistake by ending the inflation too soon and so i think we are getting closer and closer to them having to revert back to inflating but again that's where all the money is going to be made the longer they delay it's not a good environment for basically anything except the dollar i just want to get a clarifying question why are we in this pinch in the first place uh we've talked about like you know the contagion that's at risk and the the paths forward but i just really want to ground the listeners like how did we get here in the first place like what are what are the factors that have created this a very very unfavorable environment uh human nature and optimism uh these these cycles repeat over and over so you go back um the the um when you create a debt back system um right so you go off the gold standard in 71 uh you create effectively a debt backed system and the problem is um with a death back system you need you you can't go through any extended period of deflation without creating a system a systemic risk because if the debt starts to default uh the debt is what backs demand for your currency so basically if you let the debt defaults go too long at first it's good for your currency and then it turns bad for your currency right there's there's demand for your currency because the debt's there but if they default on the debt then there's no more demand for the currency currency collapses right so you have this debt back system that requires uh it's like the old metaphor a shark has to keep swimming or it drowns same thing they have to keep inflating the money supply or the system collapses so that number one is is i think sort of the overlay of the whole thing but when i say human nature look fdr came out in the middle of depression and promised social security uh to everybody um and when you looked at it back then i'm gonna get the ages wrong but basically it was it's like hey you can collect social security at 62 when the average lifespan was 55 right so if you were lucky enough to live seven years past the average lifespan in 1938 or whatever then the government paid you for a few years before you died and they've modified it a bit but in the meantime the average lifespan has gone from 55 to whatever it is 75 for men 82 for women something like that at any rate um they've only modified it a bit the baby boom generation the retired generation were so you were the promises that uh were made that were going you know 70 million baby boomers were born from 46 to 6 to 64. it stood to reason that 70 million were born 70 million are going to turn 65 someday you had 40 50 60 years uh where politicians any any sort of you know sixth grader with a calculator could say hey we owe this much money when they get that age we know this bolus of of people are going to reach that age in these years we should probably restructure these obligations at some point but politics and why i say human nature politics or politics it was so entitlements are called a third rail for a reason you can't touch them so hey it'll happen on somebody else's watch well that watch is here uh then again tied back to this debt back system uh you keep bailing out mistakes rather than then uh than than letting them work themselves out in a deflationary manner so you know it was sort of it was sort of now we look back the the the threats of long-term capital russia default back in 98 needing to bail that system out the the or bail those players out those are threats to the system but they were almost adorably cute in terms of how small they were and now it's just you keep getting bigger bigger bigger bailouts and now it is because it's been kicked upstairs to the sovereign debt level there's nowhere else to kick it up to so it really becomes a case of this it really is human nature where you set set up the system it makes a lot of sense up front but there's very little planning very little political incentive amongst either the political class or the voters that elect them to change anything until there's a crisis and so that's when i say human nature i think it's really just the human nature of of everybody wants something for nothing and something for nothing is great until the bill shows up and the bill only shows up every three or four generations uh with some of the stuff and unfortunately uh here we are we're we're in that part of it whether you want to call that part of the fourth turning or whatever uh that's effectively what we're dealing with well what a time to be alive we are definitely living in historic times here luke and uh you know i i guess the the answer to the question of how did we get here is is kind of like what you're saying is well just one step at a time it's like one step at a time is the way we've got here um i want to go back to sort of your framework of you know how how bad is it and why it's bad and you said three things bursting sovereign uh debt bubble that's one big reason our world is also based on cheap energy all of our assumptions are based on that and that's a bad assumption it turns out in this in this new world that we've entered and then we've got geopolitical tensions all of these things are related but but let me go back to the the bursting sovereign debt bubble because i'm curious with the the language in the terms you used you said bursting and earlier you talked about default and it's not clear to me i i think what you're saying is like no actually default is a possibility but they probably won't default um but you did use this term bursting repeatedly and uh when we were talking to lynn alden and keep in mind luke we are simple crypto people trying to understand the macro economy and like doing our best but um lynn alden kind of compared this this current era that we've entered to a an era that we've had previously the 1940s and that was an era of um you know obviously increased government spending fiscal spending in lots of big ways and you know the way that decade kind of resolved was we had uh uh interest rates at like zero percent but then we had inflation that averaged about six percent some years it went as high as 19 so real returns on treasuries and bonds were negative like very high in the negative territory and it seemed like the 1940s and world governments at that time at least the us did used inflation as kind of a pressure release valve on all of this rather than defaulting rather than becoming insolvent at the nation-state level you use inflation as the release valve and you let the air out of this balloon um you know slowly rather than having it pop but you were using the term bursting which implies that the balloon is actually going to pop can you talk about that do you do you agree with lin's take or do you think inflation will be like will there be a slow unwind and an uninflating of this bubble or do you actually think we're headed for a burst here and what does that look like so to me i mean this goes back to my point what's what's normal for the spiders chaos for the fly right if you are a treasury holder and you you lose half of your money on a real basis over a three or four year span because inflation is allowed to run 600 to 2000 basis points above interest rates uh that's a burst in my view that is a that's a crash you're going to lose half your money in the safest asset uh on the board in theory um in the span of a few years um so i i think what lin's talking about is is part and parcel to a bursting now do i agree with her i think there are elements of the 70s of the 40s uh in the us the 40s i think are are helpful directionally in terms of it's the last time the united states had debt the gdp above 100 it's the uh uh the last time foreigners were not buying enough treasuries uh because at that time basically the world was destroyed uh after world war ii um this though then so there are some similarities and i think that lends itself to the you're going to need an extended period of time time of significantly negative real rates and i that's when i said earlier why i thought the fed was making this mistake by tightening prematurely as it looked like they were doing that playbook again last year of hey let's inflate away the debt so that's what you meant by that's what i meant by mistake ending inflation too soon they really have to keep inflation up to deflate the balloon we we needed right from a we we did a calculation april of 21 that said they needed nominal gdp they the u.s policy makers needed nominal gdp to run between 15 and 21 for five years to get us debt to gdp down to a level from which they could tighten policy without blowing up the system and so we said look that's what it's going to be if they tighten too soon they're going to blow things up you're going to have a really bad year in the market that they try to tighten halfway through the year they're trying to tighten they are tightening we have the worst decline in stocks and bonds in 50 to 70 years we've got emerging markets under pressure we have the dollar skyrocketing we have home price you know u.s housing sector looks like it's rolling over uh broadly so they tighten too soon um they think they're dealing with a dial it's much more like a switch the challenge in all of this in using hey it's the 40s framework and and really it's it ties back my point why it's the scariest macro environment in 27 years in in my experience that is there's no really one good metaphor um there are elements of it that are like the set like the 40s but the challenge is in the 40s the us was the only country left standing we had all the factories we had all the men we had all the gold we were the world's biggest oil producer um everybody needed us there were really you know emerging geopolitical tensions with the soviet union of course that got much worse over the next ensuing 30 years but it was a very different standpoint from that versus now where you know u.s could just could run the factories full out because they needed to rebuild the world i mean u.s factories and labor rebuilt the world from 46 to call it 65 maybe 60. that's not true there's too much capacity everywhere um maybe with the exception of the u.s so that that element is not true you've also got a very big difference in terms of supply chains right so after world war ii the u.s made everything we were the biggest supplier of everything that mattered to the world now the united states can't fight a war without china which is really hard when they're being told that china might be who we fight the next war against um you know we're we're seeing these supply chain problems that's very different um and so i think that's the other thing that makes this a really challenging period of time where i mean quite frankly there's elements of the 40s but there's elements of the 80s in latin america and the 90s in latin america and 2000s in latin america that look very similar to the us because in the us in the 40s 50s 60s we if you look at the wealth discrepancy in the us for example it was the lowest it had been you had a very healthy middle and working classes very low wealth uh in inequality uh in the u.s and now you have a latin american wealth inequality you have de-industrialized uh the u.s uh in a major way um by trade policy um you've racked up the debt and so there's actually a city what we have is a situation where the reserve currency issuer of the world uh looks much more like latin america from a financial from a fiscal from a sovereign debt perspective then it looks like um america in the 40s and the 70s right 70s us that the gdp was very low you had this this growing uh middle class boomers were young productive growing their families and we were still very much not financialized now the u.s looks like sort of a a highly indebted latin american republic with record wealth inequality and highly finance it almost looks like a tax haven like very financialized economy uh with a really big military a big and great military um de-industrialized uh manufacturing sector and that's when i sort of put all that together it's it sort of runs together but it's it runs together because it i think the running together of it is a manifestation of how you can't just say hey it's it's like the 40s or like in the wall street journal today the fed is talking about well it's like the 70s again the balance sheet and the the the industrial the financialization of the us economy are so different than the 70s that if they're running that playbook and they appear to be they're making a galactically stupid mistake a galactical i mean they're golak they are going it's like like well we want to fly to l.a okay we'll uh fly east southeast around australia to get to l.a like well no you can just you could just go west and be there in five hours no no we're gonna go 28 hours around the planet to get to la and we don't have enough gasoline to even make it the frigging africa that's that's the the that's that's the game plan the feds effectively running so you know good luck to them that's why i say i think look we have this period of time where they think they can do this they can't that they think they can and they're trying to convince markets and markets are still somewhat convinced they can't sometime in the next two to three to four months markets and go oh  they can't do it the plane's out of gas we're halfway over the atlantic we're not even africa let alone the extra 25 hours of flying we have to do to get to africa or to get to l.a around the world and now what and that's when they're going to call the fed and the fed's going to be there you know sort of to continue the metaphor the the in in air tank or the inflate tanker refuel the jet and then they can make it well that's gonna be fed balance sheet expansion but between here and there being a passenger on that jet is going to be pretty scary look in a different show you talked about how the fed only pays attention to certain kind of metrics and it ignores other kinds of data other kinds of metrics like it's a it's a backwards-looking institution it doesn't really look too uh forwards very much i'd love it if you could expand on on the data that the fed is interpreting and how that data is impacting its decision making and and then also the data that the fed is ignoring or just leaving on the table that that we can take a look at and inform us for what the future of the us economy might might turn into i a mistake i have consistently made has given the fed more credit than they deserve uh and that is not to say they are stupid i don't think they're stupid people individually but i think they are a political institution i think they're a political institution in a normal time and when i say normal time non-wartime so i think they are a um i'll put it in practical terms the playbook is very clear the imf wrote about it um you when you get that the gdp as high as you as that the gdp was after cove but you need to inflate for years that's it you need to run significantly negative real interest rates for five to ten years that's what they did in the 40s they went from 110 to 50 over five years by negative real rates of 600 to 2000 basis points like we talked about earlier that's a playbook that's it that's what they need to do the problem is that they are and if they were an independent institution that's what they would have done that's absolutely what they would have done that's what they had to do but they're not an independent institution that's one of the great myths that still held by some um because you could see it inflation began applying political pressure to the administration nobody cared about all this stuff hey they were provide they were they were they were um they were they were all in for the stimulus early on you're growing money supply how did you possibly think growing the money supply 25 30 40 over a couple years wasn't going to lead to inflation they're not they're not stupid so i i think they went into this saying we're hoping we can we can sort of inflate this away and no one will notice and the problem is as people started to notice the republicans cynically made a big deal about it for the biden administration it became a political problem for the biden administration and all of a sudden they care about inflation so now they need to fight inflation but it's the wrong playbook um and so i think the fed is do you think they're pretending to fight inflation and not actually doing it like back to maybe maybe they're actually like a lot smarter than we think i think they would love to do that i think that's what this whole transitory ruse was i think that i think that was a period of time where they were doing that now if you look at what's happening credit markets if you look at what's happening in housing if you look what's happening stocks you learn you to me bitcoin what's happened to bitcoin is telling you they're no longer just they're no longer just pretending it's happening you know you take bitcoin from 70 000 to 20 000 to me that's just the advance that's the last functioning smoke detector saying uh guys liquidity is gone uh and people say ah you know there's on finn twit right oh look bitcoins down 70 to 20. you suckers and without fail the last several years every time that's happened like it's like wait for it three two one oh god stock's down oh god bonds are down oh save us fed save us right so there's i think we are when you look at what's happening in credit markets um you know when you look at what's happening the treasury market in the i mean it's it's incredible what the treasury market has done year to date even allowing for the inflation we had earlier on how bad the treasury market has performed given that we're heading into a recession we're heading toward a recession um you know are we in when are we not we're gonna have two quarters of negative real gdp growth there's some argument whether we think we're in one or not we're heading toward one and yet treasuries are down worst treasury performance in 50 60 70 years it's really incredible now they've bounced recently but but well why is that incredible uh get give the dumb crypto people some context oh it's incred it's incredible because historically the first thing you do in you know as the us gdp starts to go negative is you buy long dated treasuries because they're the safety assets and i get a fleet of safety the safety asset they're the safety asset and so yes there's been inflation but there's this balance of payments dynamic where foreigners own so many treasuries now um they're not buying enough of them in fact the stronger the dollar gets the more treasuries they will sell to get dollars to try to keep their heads above water um and then just this dynamic of um the the structural size of u.s deficits right of you know the fed is in theory starting to sell treasuries um foreigners with the dollar word is or selling treasuries treasury is selling treasuries who's the buyer it's got to be mom and pop well mama pop don't have the balance sheet the banks have been big buyers they don't really have the balance sheet some of that's regulatory um but there's there's a supply demand imbalance that is that is fundamental there there are some cyclical moves within that like we've seen in the last call two three weeks where long dated treasuries have been bid they probably stay bid for a bit longer but if the fed stands aside the supply side of the treasury market will get so much bigger as the u.s heads into a a full-fledged everyone agrees we're in a recession or a financial crisis then you're going to see treasury yields rise in my view in a recession in a crash and that's that's something we haven't seen in the u.s in a long long time i i don't know when the last time we saw that but you see it all the time in places like turkey and argentina and mexico in the 80s and 90s and and and you know southeast asia in the 90s it's a balance of payments problem so luke we're gonna um take this asset by asset in just a second but before we do while we're on like the subject of how bad is it right can you just fast forward us to how you think the end game will play out here so you've indicated that this is has elements of the 1940s as elements of the 1970s also has elements of latin america in the 1980s so i think you're making the case that the 2020s are going to be their own thing you also said that you expect inflation for years once the fed maybe all of the other institutions you know come to grips with reality what we're going to have to do is inflate maybe for five to ten years is what you said can you just fast forward us to kind of the end game here what is the end game so like what does this decade look like the highest level macro perspective fast forward it and play it out yeah so the end game is a fed balance sheet that is exponentially bigger than it is today and it's filled with not just u.s treasuries and mortgage backs but it's also going to be filled with in my view foreign sovereign debt probably a lot of europe european debt japanese debt because they're the sponsor of the system if they want to prevent their allies from collapsing uh they're going to have to do that um i think we're going to go through a span of significantly negative real interest rates and there's some flexibility around that maybe the way to think about that is we can have a 10-year period of negative six percent real rates and that would probably work maybe but again the debt is so much higher than it was the finance the us economy is so much more financialized than it was the problem with that playbook is you've got to convince somebody to be the sucker at the card table somebody be the idiot holding treasuries for ten straight years of negative six percent real rates and we had six months of negative six percent real rates and you started to see problems political problems with inflation treasuries sell off because you the problem for the fed is you can't the debt is so high they can't sustain a rise of interest rates in response to that inflation they have to keep real rates significantly negative so to me the negative six percent for 10-year real rate playbook that was a baseline base case i think pre-covered maybe in the immediate aftermath of covet that is now a hail mary i don't think that that's more likely i think where we're quickly going to get to is particularly given this fed policy mistake of not continuing to just inflate because they're trying to to deflate for a bit that makes it much more likely that what we instead see is a u.s version of israel in the early 80s and this is not a well-known playbook or a episode i've found in macro israeli right israel is a very developed highly educated nation um lots of lots of high-tech products etc they had 100 to 400 percent inflation for three three four years in the early 80s and the sovereign debt problem was gone like that after three four years central bank raises rates up to whatever they raise up to they stop inflating they cut deficits boom and you move on and i think increasingly the odds of a 40 scenario where hey we're just going to keep real rates negative 600 to negative 2 000 basis points for six years i think that was still on the i think that was still on the um on on the on the menu of palatable or plausible economically mathematically possible options as of mid to late last year the second the feds started tightening the dollar started rising i think those are now off the table i think what we're now gonna the end game is going to be a whoosh down in risk assets for a few weeks um you know we've sort of had the bleed down year-to-date but i think we'll get a whoosh down and then the fed coming back and then we're gonna go through this period of time where i think you're gonna have extremely high inflation in the u.s for two three years and at the end of that two three year period of time of extremely high inflation and when i say extremely high inflation i think you could probably see it 30 to 100 inflation at the cpi level in the u.s for two three years and uh i think the fed will be saying oh it's only 10 to 12 and we're working on it um but at the end of it u.s debt to gdp will be 60 70 percent the fed can take rates back to 10 they can cut fiscal deficits because tax receipts will be high enough um and then they normalize policy and we move on and you know treasury holders thank you for your donation to uh restoring u.s fiscal solvency after covet we appreciate it you got paid every time you were owed but you went from buying steak with it to buying you know crickets with it so you know congratulations this is this is quite the picture uh you're painting and of course one difference between israel and the 1980s and and the us now is israel did not have the global reserve currency at the time and that's that's exactly right that's part of why i say it's so scary is there's there is it it's the u.s is a way bigger economy it's not the global reserve currency issuer so it touches to your point it touches everything and so that whoosh down that's dxy to the moon that is everything else down including treasuries probably i mean like like i said you probably get a little bit of a treasury bid for an intervening period of time but i think we're going to see a period like we saw in march 2020 where treasuries are big treasures bid and all of a sudden it got bad enough and treasures are sold this is interesting though luke so the other piece here is like you're talking about finding the sucker to buy treasuries right and so when the u.s realizes that that will be the new problem i wonder how jealous it gets and you start to recall kind of fdr's um you know executive orders from the 1930s banning u.s citizens from purchasing gold right and that is a a similar kind of energy of like hey we need you to buy bonds and we need you to buy treasuries to support your national economy you can't have these these other store value assets do you think is that part of your endgame scenario that you're modeling out that um the us gets kind of desperate and maybe some of these what we would now think of as you know authoritarian totalitarian measures come down the pike well that's the incredible thing about it is is if there's this phrase and i wish i knew who quoted it but it's wisdom is seeing things for what they are right so wisdom is seeing things for what they are in 2014 the sec passed a rule for money market funds it offered it provided for money market funds to be gated in times of crisis uh which means you can't get your money right if there's a crisis and they're gonna break the buck you can't get your money uh but it exempted uh government something called government money market funds so basically by regulation the u.s government began shifting uh dollars that were in the money market fund sector which are enormous they're measured in the trillions out of private uh dollar assets which finance corporations and it finances uh foreign government i mean anyone that was that was issuing a commercial paper in the money market sector saw their interest rates rise libor rose and instead you saw this shift of funds out of private dollar assets into u.s treasury t-bill money market funds government money market funds and that's so that is a fdr like when i say wisdom is seeing things for what they are that was a regulatory measure designed to shift uh uh demand away from private dollar assets to u.s government dollar assets that is a a polite version of what fdr did it's a it's it's very similar to what argentina did the early 2000s they were incenting um they were incenting um the private uh pensions and banks to buy government debt because they had a problem similarly 2014 high quality liquid asset regulations for the u.s banking sector incented them to hold greater amounts of u.s treasury bonds as regulatory capital gave them a break same dynamic this is sort of a classic emerging market balance of payments problem it's a version of what fdr did bcv gold which was a monetary asset at the time it's private property now um if it gets so my point is is that this has been happening in slow motion if if you watch uh the draconian version of this i think is less seizing gold i mean i think you certainly could see uh you you've seen some regulatory threats i think on on bitcoin um i mean could it be something like so regulatory threat on bitcoin luke so could it be something like you can't actually hold bitcoin in your own self-custody wallet you have to hold it on an exchange if you want bitcoin and that that way they like is it do you think it would go this far i think they would do more the pipes i think they would do more the on and off ramps right is just say hey we want to you know we we can see the on and off ramps out of you know from your bank to coinbase uh and we know what you have and we're going to take whatever we're going to tax it at 40 50 and put it in treasuries or something like that or there's some good ways it could happen too right if they actually mandate hey any funds you know stable coins all have to own 100 ust bills that's another way you could do it um but there's you know it's like when they asked willie sutton why do you rob banks that's where the money is right he said that's where the money is so um the same thing you could do is look there's whatever 30 trillion dollars in u.s retirement assets why confiscate gold or bitcoin which in aggregate or what in the us a trillion 2 trillion you could literally get 3 trillion right off the bat by saying every single in order to maintain the tax deferred status of u.s retirement accounts it must own 20 u.s treasury bonds there's six trillion dollars right there boom and that's where i think you could see that go but here's here's the catch they're probably thinking in these terms already the problem is remember what i said before they need stocks to rise just to make the ends meet on the fiscal situation right so alan greenspan said in 2015 that capital gains tax is this widely what's that capital gains it's not just capital gains it's it's so net capital gains plus taxable ira distributions alone are 200 percent of the annual growth in personal consumption expenditures of the united states which pce is about two-thirds of gdp so that's basically u.s consumer spending mathematically cannot grow unless stocks are rising and if consumer spending is not growing at two-thirds to 70 percent of gdp gdp is not really growing so the problem with diverting money out of stocks into treasuries and these retirement accounts to try to you know is you're going to take 6 trillion out of stocks put it in treasuries well great now you're gonna have mandated selling in stocks as stocks come down you thought you needed six trillion the deficits are going to rise as stocks fall you can see that clear as day that correlation in the government data because the u.s economy is going to head into recession deficits always rise in recessions on the counter cyclical payments so you can try to force americans to pay more for their own stuff to pay more for their own deficits but if you do it by getting them to sell stocks whatever deficit level you thought you needed to fund it's going to be an order to magnitude higher deficit because the economy weakens so you saw this play out in real time with obamacare right so obamacare it's funny is is um in 2014 the wall street journal said part of this what they're doing obamacare for is to raise health care costs to force americans to pay more for their own care to lower u.s deficits and then that was like the only time it was ever about a deficit issue this was right at the same time that that we talked about the money market fund uh example we talked about the bank example of hey u.s money funds or money funds banks they need to buy more treasuries to help deficit well u.s consumers contribution to that deficit reduction exercise was obamacare hey your obamacare premiums go up huge um wall street journal says it's partly about deficit reduction and it worked 1415 you saw deficits come down problem is as u.s consumer spending came down too and that led to a because all of a sudden they're paying more for their care right something they were getting for free they now had to pay for and that consumer dollar that was going to a car or a boat or plastic crap at target or walmart wasn't getting bought and what ended up happening in 2016 is u.s deficits as a percent of gdp in response to these deficit reduction and financing exercises actually started going up because that was uh that was what you meant when yeah one of my goals in this conversation was to ask you what you meant by the us stock market effectively is the us economy you tweeted that out recently the stock market is the economic economy that's what you that's what i mean and critically like that net capital gain plus taxable ira being 200 of the annual growth in pce that's just net cap gain and taxable ira distributions that does not include any of the stock comp right so you go out to the west coast and everyone's buying all these big houses because they're either selling options and and buying the house or they're using it as collateral um like stock comp executive stock comp is taxed as ordinary income and it's not broken out really anywhere cleanly how big a deal that is but you can play bigger than a bread basket of how big a deal it is when you look at the percentage of taxes paid by individual by tax bracket so if you say the top five percent irs data shows that top five percent of u.s taxpayers pay sixty six zero percent of the individual income taxes that's thirty percent of total u.s income taxes now top five percent of taxpayers in the u.s are making i want to say i don't know what the it's it's a couple hundred thousand dollars a year uh and particularly the higher up you go the top one percent these are people that are they're not working hourly it's not like these are people that are making twenty thousand dollars an hour expressly in wages they are they're making their you know a couple hundred grand in cash comp and then the rest of it is coming as incentive comp and all that incentive comp is subject to the stock market and the stock market year over year and their marginal consumption is a function in part of that wealth effect the wealth effect probably declines as you get further out there you're worth you know two billion dollars it's not like you care if you're only worth a billion and a half but you're worth 10 million dollars and you're only worth uh you know 700 you know one one and three quarters or one and a half that's that might change your excuse me your uh five to seven seven million that might start to change some of the marginal consumption uh patterns and on down so there's that's when i say hey the stock market is the economy it's not about when you look at it in the absolute no it's it's a relatively small percent but so many economists analysts writers make this mistake it's all about what happens on the margin when you are highly indebted right it's not it's it's if we were running an equity-based low-debt system like we had in the 70s so what stocks go down so what but because the leverage is so high on the margin stocks go down consumption goes down consumption goes down when you're as levered as the entire system is system unwinds fast and non-linearly and that's why i say the stock market is the economy it's the economy on the margin and on the margin is

worker 40 000 to 100 000 yearly income we're gonna have a period of you've already said like five to ten years of sustained inflation that seems crazy to me i'm sure crazy to most people i don't know no one's in the united states has lived through that uh and then also when we have this depressed stock market which we just talked about which is a part of so much of people's consumption well if that's depressed that's also going to impact the economy so but what do you how would you illustrate the the next five to ten years for just like the average worker uh with like their grocery bills their rent prices their their ability to produce an income like can you paint that picture for us i increasingly think it's one of two outcomes depending on which faction in washington and and more broadly globally wins um the happy ending is basically we go through this span of high inflation there is a recognition of the extreme national security vulnerability of the united states as it relates to producing our own stuff uh vis-a-vis china in particular but others as well and we go through a massive period of reinvestment in u.s industrial infrastructure or re-shoring broadly basically the united states says okay we're going to implement a version of chinese industrial policy with u.s characteristics and in that case inflation goes crazy real rates are massively negative uh the working and middle classes win huge uh because wages you just basically wagers are going to go up and up and up until you find until you find basically you know the the offer side right so until you start having you know wall street salesmen saying i'm hanging it up because i can make more money you know being a plumber um that's that's that's what happens there the u.s comes out way ahead uh because of the natural endowment that we have and that's a really good outcome that's a very weak dollar really bad for bonds that's really good for risk assets broadly home prices gold bitcoin it's very inflationary that's the happy ending the unhappy ending is sort of the uh i'm gonna be try to be diplomatic here um okay you can kind of tell which side i'm rooting for i guess um sort of the um the the the those that think hey we need a strong dollar and the treasury market must be preserved in real terms at all costs that is a really good outcome for you know basically hey we we must crash the us economy to make sure treasury holders are kept whole on a real basis to preserve the dollar's role in the global financial system to preserve the treasury's role as primary reserve asset and you can see this from people like william dudley and his op-eds at the new york fed from larry summers some of these series of actors that have been in washington for the last 40 50 years um sort of the reuben robert rubin clinton type financial people um in that world um the us washington wins huge the u.s military-industrial complex probably does okay china ultimately quickly and surpasses the united states in economic importance um and geopolitical power europe probably comes unhinged japan probably comes unhinged the u.s middle and working classes probably suffer greatly and end up with some version of a permanent version of universal basic income which starts to veer into you know issues of control hey if you don't you know if you don't do this or do that then we'll haircut your ubi payment uh for you that month um and that's just not a great you know as a father that's not a great sort of outcome that's not something i get excited a world i get excited about for my kids to live in as opposed to the former so i think those are your two sort of it's basically really again to your point ryan earlier the dollar connecting to everything what do we want to be the first scenario we go back to um we go back to being america basically in the second scenario we go back to sort of america with the asterisk which is we're going to be we're going to be in the business of exporting dollars and exporting treasuries and then you know we're basically going to be sort of a giant tax you know tax haven um i'll uh you know panama uh with a lot more you know corn and soybeans and a bigger military and i just you know i think i'd rather be america than america asterisk but i think those are your two i think those are your two sort of options or most those are the two you know polar ends of where this goes i wouldn't say that there's only one or the other i think that you can probably blend shades of the two but i think that's sort of your range of outcomes uh based again on what what do we want to do do we want to preserve american exceptionalism american power by investing in america or do we just want to we just want to keep the dollar treasury system as is or try to i don't know that'll work in the long run but i think those are sort of where we're going after talking with linaldon and also you thus far in this conversation it was surprising to hear that there's actually like a positive outcome for like the u.s middle class that involves a de-financialization of a very over-financialized economy that's us that's that's us uh and allowing for strong wage growth in like real terms to to be a possible future uh so that that's cool if that if if that is on the table it seems to be like it's the united states middle class versus treasury holders like that that seems to be the correct tug of war is that a good way to put this it's abs it's absolutely the right tug of war the white rate of frame and it's something we wrote about a couple years ago now where i said for basically from from 80 80 basically as soon as paul volcker got into office when he did what he did he began subjugating the u.s middle and working classes uh in deference to the the u.s treasury holders and that was great for wall street it was great for washington it was not great for the u.s middle and working classes when you look at trade deals like nafta when you look at trade deals like the wto those were basically just extensions of what volcker did in terms of subjugating the u.s middle and working classes in deference to u.s treasury holders and for the u.s to really win it needs to do the opposite it needs to subjugate treasury holders in real terms to the u.s middle and working classes and i i think ultimately you know in real terms for u.s wages you know i think wages will probably not quite keep up with inflation in in over time in that period when you look at the history's inflations right first wages exceed it and then they you know then they don't uh the evening out that people typically leave out is you've got a whole lot of fixed rate debt right the average american worker has a lot of fixed rate debt and that's why i say i think ultimately this is going to be very inflationary quickly is is no one's going to want to hold a mortgage paper no one's going to hold mortgage paper yielding four if inflation's 15 to 20. that's terrible for the mortgage holder it's it's great for the mortgage owner right if your wages you know if your food bill's going up 20 and your wages are going up 12 to 15 it sort of stinks except if you've got a four percent mortgage um you're picking up 800 basis points a year right if if your wages are up 12 and your mortgage is a four percent coupon you're picking up 800 basis points in real terms against your mortgage every year even as you're losing 300 to 800 basis points against your food bill and your gasoline bill um and so i think to the extent that again you it allows a de-levering sovereign and household balance sheets there's this fixed debt component that people tend to leave out because they don't think about it in terms of you know again they always go back to the 70s if you're in the united states and oh it just killed us in inflation well us that the gdp was 25 30 people didn't you know the average mortgage in the 70s was was way lower than it was now so there's this i think when you think about real wage gains for a middle and working class under that scenario yes it probably is maybe a little bit of a gain early on a push and then eventually they're behind but there's this cushion in terms of the fixed rate debt that i think tends to not be considered now it goes back to our question who's the sucker at the card table holding that debt as you're inflating it away and the answer is going to be the fed's balance sheet and that's why i say i think where this goes where this end game is the fed's balance sheet is an order of magnitude larger than where it sits today and the question is what's the path between here and there uh to keep going on this whole tug of war the american middle class versus treasury holders you you stated like two possible outcomes you know we revitalize america or it's america with an asterisk uh my mind when you said that went to well that sounds like china where you have this like behavior-dependent ubi that it comes from like a like a highly surveilled state uh where there's a lot of top down control and like less freedoms in forcing funneling you know the capital of the united states into these treasuries so that so that the treasury side can can come out okay versus uh you know reinvigorating like the american dream strong middle class like high production high manufacturing uh and obviously like now when you when you said like i uh i that obviously it's obvious which one you're rooting for i'm also like i'm also rooting for the same one i'm pretty damn sure uh who how strong are the political forces to have the america with the asterisk like how how strong is that side of side of the fight that's the status quo so it's pretty strong um now with that said it was a lot stronger pre-covet and the reason i say that is i've been talking about these issues for a long time and pre-coveted i sort of got a lot of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh particularly from people tied to washington right or even people on wall street yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but then when new york and when washington couldn't get supplies when when when the response to covet is we need a bunch of masks and china said hey yeah hold on we'll get to your masks after we have ours all taken care of that i think hit washington in particular in a way where even the most dogmatic politician hey strong dollar good strong dollar good what's good for the dollar is good for america you know in the same way that what's good for gm is good for america was once true and what's good for u.s steel is good for america was once true uh there was this huge contingent in washington hey what's good for the dollar is good for america well you can have masks or you can have a strong dollar what do you want and i think post covid that pushed uh uh um a notable contingent of people that had not really thought that hard about it beyond what's good for the dollars good for america toward a little bit of a more nuanced position of understanding how vulnerable u.s supply chains had become by virtue of this status quo system so there is a the the status quo system is still very powerful very well entrenched they tend to be older though versus i think this growing recognition of hey we we're vulnerable from a national security perspective i mean the defense department is very much on board with with this and have been for years of listen borrowing money from china to build weapons to face down china is not a good idea it's not a sustainable strategy so i think there's a lot in the defense and intelligence establishments in the united states that get this and i think there's a lot of sort of your middle ground politicians uh be either became aware of the issue after covet or switched over to sort of that dod and intelligent side uh in the aftermath of covet but there's still a lot of um institutional dogma um etc uh around this um and so it is still very much a toss-up and so luke we we talked about kind of the how how bad is it in the the end game scenarios and and the possibilities of fixing this and also we talked about like what what happens next i want to zoom down into some some assets and kind of burn through these real quick uh like so talk about like currencies talk about a little bit more about bonds and equities and and energy as well even though we've touched on some of these but let's drill down and give this an asset lens here so in either of those two paths maybe in the treasury's path that um the dollar retains its global reserve um supremacy but what what do you think in these two paths these two scenarios what happens to the dollar in this environment and then also just take us through really quickly other currencies euro yen juan ruble what what happens to all of these currencies in the future we're headed towards i think it depends on on on which choi how quickly the fed you know basically until the fed relents and starts putting the world on its balance sheet you're going to have dollar up against i think everything except the ruble uh over time uh and and you may see the euro collapse you may see the yen collapse in which case the dollar goes towards infinity uh theoretically because of basically the dxy index is basically the dollar against the euro and the un right so you know it's sort of ironic hey the dollar's up it's so strong this is so good for america well is the dxy just a stupid index to look at right now um it's getting it's getting it's getting less stupid it's getting less stupid because you are finally seeing the energy shortages impact emerging markets as well uh for you know february march into april it was a bit of a stupid index because it's basically hey your allies in europe and japan are collapsing yay we're winning well not not really you know you're putting a bullet in your two most important allies you know that's not good for america uh but i think you know because you could see it right the brazilian real was rising against the dollar the ruble rising against a dollar it was a little silly then i don't think it's a silly now now you're seeing weakness it's much more broad-based weakness so i think it is giving us an idea but i think i think it's the right direction increasingly now as it continues to strengthen the challenge is is that it's basically indicating an energy crisis right it's it's enter it's indicating what was really a global energy crisis um europe is now in a twin deficit position japan's in a twin deficit position all else equal those currencies and those nations will collapse unless they either uh unless either the fed comes in and starts buying their debt for them weakening the dollar strengthening the the others the other pairs or they say i'm sorry usa we're short energy we we can't we have to take care of our people people are going to starve people are going to die pick up the phone yeah hey vladimir yeah we sorry we need gas will you sell us gas in yen if you're japan that's where this is going and so when you think about this okay two pass as long as the fence stands aside dollar's gonna win um and everything else is going to lose i think the dollar will continue to fall against ruble though because ruble is effectively gas based at a gas backed at this point and the dollar is going to fall against gas in my view uh if the dollar is going to fall um against oil in my view um that's that's um that's the easy answer the flip and then the flip side i think is also true when the fed is forced to finally sort of uh come in come back to the markets i think dollar loses against virtually everything i think there's probably and we may be starting to be in it now an intervening period of weeks maybe a month or two where the dollar also rises anne's oil and gas and against the ruble and other commodities i think maybe in that period right now but ultimately it can't last long because once oil gets low enough biggest marginal producer of oil in the world is the u.s and it's high cost oil and you get oil too low and the u.s is going to start shutting down shale wells because they're very much on off depending on on breakevens and then you're just going to be seeding seeding leverage right back to putin so it really is a very binary outlook as it relates to commodities it's you know as long as the fed is not buying enough treasuries to finance a sufficient amount of u.s deficits the dollar is going to go up against virtually everything except for oil and gas and by virtue of that i think by against the ruble and vice versa when they are then i think the dollar weakens against virtually everything and we saw this play out in you know in the lead up to 2020 the immediate lead up dollar was up everything else basically down once the fed started buying enough us treasuries uh from april 20 through may 21 the dollar fell against virtually everything and then once the fed started tightening again uh the dollar has risen against virtually everything so i think it's a very binary this ties into my point of hey defense it's not a dial it's a switch usa economy on usa economy off when usa economy is off there's a dollar shortage dollar's gonna go up and when the u.s economy's on then uh hey party on wayne party on garth okay so all of these currencies are now getting kind of replaced re-priced for this this new reality uh we already talked about what happens to bonds in this world and your predictions they absolutely die right not gonna do so well over the next um you know in like lose shift i mean yeah and we'll come back to equities in a minute but um you've been talking a lot about energy uh commodities and it seems like even for the ruble is basically like the ruble's being priced as if it's gassive as as if it's an energy commodity what happens to uh energy commodities oil natural gas uh in the in this uh this environment i think energy is in a secular uptrend again because of this peak cheap energy you need higher energy prices to get the supplies the incremental supplies to continue to maintain the debt that is out there right i mean you need to expend energy to generate economic activity to support the debt that exists and if you don't have that energy the debt is going to default you're not going to generate the economic surplus needed to pay you know just to keep floating the debt and so you're in this weird period of time where whether you look at it when you look at it geologically you need higher energy prices if you don't get higher energy prices uh you're gonna have very big economic problems um and so for me it speaks to two things depending on your view um if you're just sort of cash buy and hold investor i think energy's gonna be fine if you're a trader i think we're talking about a continuation of just mind-boggling volatility in energy markets and we're starting to see that right when you see when you see down 10 days in crude oil i mean crude oil is a 2 trillion 3 trillion a year commodity down 10 in a day it's it's just mind-boggling volatility but that's that's what you're gonna get in this combination of high debt um peak cheap energy world where once you start over tightening uh in terms of policy you're going to be okay oh god i have to sell my oil once you sell it too far now you're gonna have oil shortages very quickly because again u.s shale world's biggest marginal producer us the the legacy wells uh decline in the u.s four in the four biggest basins in the us the legacy wells declined five percent per month so if you just stop producing in the u.s u.s oil production the four big uh basins is gonna fall at least thirty forty percent in a year so you're gonna take thirty forty 40 of the biggest margin producer out of the market and maybe more if you just if you get prices too low so there's this the energy market like i said for the for the cash investor i think remains very fundamentally driven i think volatility is going to be very very high uh in the intervening time based on on on those dynamics luke you uh gave a quote that i really really resonated with uh and that was energy is the interest is nature's interest rate and i'm wondering if you could explain what that means and connect that to all of the developing markets emerging markets that are out there in the world and kind of something that i'm a little bit fearful of is that a lot of all this demand for energy especially especially as europe goes into a winter gets sucked out of the market and leaves a lot of emerging markets hanging not able to afford energy can you just explain these dynamics that you see ahead of us yeah i mean you could there are there are pictures it could be very catastrophic for emerging markets um very catastrophic it could be very catastrophic for europe we've been writing for last three four months that the playbook europe is running is basically the same playbook germany ran after weimar after world war one uh in weimar germany which was the french came in and seized rural valley coal stores as a part of the war reparations and the germans said oops we don't have energy let's just print money and you look at what's happening now the europeans are blindly saying hell yeah you know bad putin will do without his gas uh or putin's now saying okay fine you want to sanction might you want to you want to take my fx reserves great i'm going to make you pay in another currency or you're not going to get the gas and what are they talking about doing they're talking about printing money to keep peripheral spreads close to the center you print money without energy you're going to hyperinflate the currency and that's in europe that's in a developed market that's that's a potentially pleasant outcome you're talking about places like sri lanka at the other far end of the sort of the very weakest of the week emerging markets societal collapse starvation uh um violent overthrows of governments i mean it is that's what happens when people don't have enough energy or food and so um if mismanaged um that's where this sort of could all go um and that's what you know that this all filters into why i think it's you know one of the scariest environments we've seen in in 27 years it's uh everything in this type of environment goes back down on maslow's hierarchy of needs and people are just talking about like you know food shelter and energy right and that's kind of what you need at the base level um let's just finish this up with the asset lens um equities where do they go over this decade i mean they're traditionally risk on assets aren't they um what uh what do you think they'll do in this kind of environment over this decade i think they go way higher because ultimately i think this i think the decade of the 20s is going to be about when you look back it's going to be about western sovereign governments solvency being maintained nominally by their respective central banks in plain english western governments are broke they're pretending for the moment like they're solvent they're not central banks are going to print the money to keep them solvent and that's going to be really good for equities over the course of this decade now anytime they come out like they are over the last six to nine months twelve months and say oh we're gonna tighten it's not gonna be good for equities and we're seeing that but unless central banks in the west unless the u.s fed is willing to stand aside and let you know the the fed the ecb the boj stand aside and let the u.s europe and japan default on their debt which i don't think is going to happen then i think they're going to print the money and as they print that money it's going to be really good for equities from beginning to end of the 20s gold now another different store value commodity let's call it uh this is a tweet you put out recently luke which i liked if gold was a useless pet rock western g7 policy makers wouldn't be putting capital controls on it uh does this is this kind of emperor with no clothes gold is actually a store value asset where does gold go and then lastly we'll get to crypto but first gold gold for me is the the once in future neutral reserve asset it's been moving back into the system as a neutral reserve asset led by the quote unquote rogues gallery of china and russia and and uh you know primarily those two the europeans have always liked gold they continue to like gold so i think ultimately gold has been gaining shares slowly from treasuries as a primary reserve asset i think by the end of the 2020s gold regains a lot of share from treasuries as a primary reserve asset and when you look at the relative sizes of those markets uh it implies gold being multiples higher over the course of this decade so that it can be big enough to serve as a reserve asset again um and so i think you know i think gold is probably a double or triple from here uh over the next 10 years okay so how about crypto now so you could group crypto is that in that store value asset category like gold um others group it and it seems like the market is recently into kind of the risk asset category and you'd expect with all of the the nominal issuance money printing inflation going on you'd expect something like bitcoin to perform better than it has uh recently i'm wondering if you think that could turn around there's also this uh this quote i think many have attributed to you uh luke which i really like is crypto is the last functioning fire alarm and talk about that too if you would what's the story on crypto this this uh decade for me i really focus just on bitcoin and so for for me bitcoin is the last functioning smoke alarm and the reason i like bitcoin so much is that proof of work dynamic versus proof of stake because to me proof of stake is effectively just a fiat system it's it's and and proof of work is much more gold like it is much it's basically um it's a tie to energy right i look at bitcoin and i look at gold as energy proxies uh it takes a lot of energy to mine and store gold it takes a lot of energy to mine uh and warehouse you know uh you know cold store bitcoin right um there's an energy component to that um and so i think ultimately bitcoin will trade more like an energy proxy store of value neutral reserve asset for the people i agree it has not it is not traded as a store of value neutral reserve asset for the people relative to treasury bonds gold stocks etc on the way down here it has i think traded as a neutral reserve asset relative to everything else in crypto on the way down here which has been somewhat typical uh right when in down cycles in in crypto over the last several years goal of bitcoin outperforms on the way down and and has underperformed on the way up uh it'll be interesting this time to see given some of what's happened will it out will it have have there been have there been people converted to bitcoin only from some of these others by this down cycle who knows but to me bitcoin is basically the last functioning smoke detector in terms of liquidity metrics um and and i think will come to be seen as a neutral reserve asset which is ultimately neutral reserve asset is just an energy proxy um you know it ties back we talked about before of negative real interest rates um energy scarcity you need a neutral reserve asset that preserves your purchasing power and energy or else you're screwed um and you're screwed like europe you're screwed like japan you're screwed like sri lanka you need energy and and for a long time dollars equaled energy saw us treasuries equaled energy and that's part of this sovereign debt bubble bursting is this belief that sovereign debt will hold its purchasing power in real terms i think that has begun being that's when i say it's it's bursting the bursting is ultimately this this unwavering belief that that sovereign debt in particular treasuries are good stores of value on a real basis they have been for a long time they can't be anymore if governments are not going to nominally default on the debt so luke how should we position our portfolios going into what seems to be a very thick fog of war very uncertain decade with a lot of volatility keeping in mind that listeners of this podcast are likely 50 or greater of their portfolios or in all in crypto assets uh so what are the general rules of thumb that uh we should consider when we construct our portfolios to finish off this decade so i i think it may be the most instructive chart to answer that question there's a chart that i've highlighted a number of times in our work it was put together by a friend of mine dan oliver at murmican capital and it it's tremendous chart what it shows is the price of gold in german in weimar german marks uh and then the month over month performance of gold in weimar german marks and so from call it 1918 to 1923 literally the currency hyperinflates to zero against gold the gold goals from whatever 20 marks to 20 reichsmarks to a trillion reichsmarks over a five-year span however you know and a lot of people would say oh i want to borrow as much money as i can and own gold the challenge that i think a year ago people didn't appreciate i think today they appreciate a lot more in the crypto world is that chart showed that four or five or six different times in that span of that hyperinflation one of the great ones of all time you lost all of your money if you were levered long gold in rex marks because inexplicably people actually believed the equivalent of of well the reichsmark is going to go to you're going to do qt they're going to sell they're actually going to go into austerity they're going to and people multiple times sold gold to buy reichsmarks as the currency was going to zero so um the um the point is is that i think the key is to be unlevered if you're levered this whole process is so political i can't tell you whether the fed could come out tomorrow and grow the balance sheet something could break fed will be outgrown tomorrow and then it's it's gonna be or they could be weaponizing this against russia there may have been a decision made behind closed doors is we want oil at 40 and we don't care if the dow goes to 10 000. we don't care if the if nasdaq crashes we don't care if bitcoin goes to zero you know goes back to 20 bucks oil has to be 40 anything else that breaks it doesn't matter i don't think they can do that but if they try that and you're levered you're going to lose everything you are going to get carried out on your shield and i think like i said a year ago people like now now i think people see it if you were levered along crypto over the last six to 12 months your is gone and so i think rule number one is stay unlevered uh or very low leverage and then for me i like holding a lot of cash um you know we've been talking about building cash with our clients um if you're a high-risk month-to-month guy we've been talking about being mostly in cash for several you know for several months uh because it's just such a political dynamic so to me my portfolio you know good shot i like to call it the jacob fugger uh portfolio one richest man in history 25 cash 25 gold 25 stocks 25 real estate and then you just adjust based on what moves the cash gives the optionality to me when i think about gold i love bitcoin in there um uh with with gold and and then it's a personal situation hey you want 25 bitcoin great you want you know five percent bitcoin of the of that 25 you want one it depends on your situation your comfort with understanding it and then you adjust based on on what happens but i think being having the cash for optionality but most important is being unlevered because this is such a political process number one and number two the debt is so high the volatility has been high it's going to keep being high in my view i'm reminded of this fund that lost all of their money completely blew up by shorting luna into the ground which is a is a lesson in volatility you can be right over the long term but the volatility will chew you up on leverage in whatever time frame that you're in uh luke one one last perspective i want to get from you the the gist that uh i've gotten is that you know over the 10 plus year time horizon we're super bullish we can be bullish on perhaps equities and and crypto uh and gold uh but it's this next one to three to five years of just like volatility and chop that we need to get through to get to that point would that be a fair assessment yeah i think i think it's a very fair assessment i think it's a lot shorter than two to five years at shop but i but yeah i think we've got chop over the next six to 12 months and then i think it's you know we're gonna know for sure but it's that you've got to live through that chop otherwise you're not gonna you're not gonna have anything to invest on the other side of your two levered cool luke thank you so much for joining us and uh and helping us think through these uh tumultuous times see through the fog of war as david mentioned earlier we earlier we really appreciate it thanks for having me on it's great being here bankless nation a few follow-ups of course go listen to that those thoughts from luke at the end no
