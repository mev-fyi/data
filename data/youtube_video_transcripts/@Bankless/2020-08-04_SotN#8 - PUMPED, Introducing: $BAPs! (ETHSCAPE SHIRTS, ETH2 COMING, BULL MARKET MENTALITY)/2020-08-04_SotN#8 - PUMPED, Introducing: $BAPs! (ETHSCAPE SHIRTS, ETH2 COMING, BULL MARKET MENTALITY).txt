hello everyone welcome to episode 8 of state of the nation david nice shirt you got on today my friend hey likewise lots of colors in there yeah you know what we're going to talk about these shirts in just a minute we're going to talk about the announcements in just a minute as david gives you a tour of what's going on let me give you if this is your first uh state of the nation here's what we do we talk about what's going on in the bankless nation we related to the big picture stuff and we always like to drop some insights and action items this episodes these episodes release every tuesday on youtube so make sure you subscribe to youtube to catch them and they release on wednesday on the bankless podcast so you could check it out there too if audio is more your thing we're going to get into announcements in a little bit but david we should talk about our sponsors first uh we've got we've got a new one why don't you start with uh with our new sponsor we're super excited about yeah yeah this sponsor is absolutely fantastic god's unchained uh for those that are into like alternative like instead of like investing in tokens and all this crazy defy stuff there's also this other world going on where like digital scarcity and digital tokens can be leveraged for like a really awesome purpose and so for those people that have played like hearthstone or magic the gathering this is that same concept that same type of game but layered on to like ethereum and using the ethereum backend to manage your cards and so the cards in god's unchained are tokens like all the other tokens on ethereum except they represent cards in the gauze unchained game and so it's absolutely fantastic i've put in like 50 100 hours into god's unchained and they keep on iterating and making the see the thing like even sexier even smoother the graphics of that game are absolutely fantastic but what i love about it is that like with my cards in my ethereum wallet my little tokens i'm playing against somebody else's tokens on ethereum through the gods unchained game uh and so what's pretty cool about god's unchained is that you have provable scarcity of your cards right so when you open up a legendary card you gave like you have assurances on on the blockchain that there's not only going to be and like any more than like 200 of these cards right and like that's not true for for blizzard's hearthstone that's not true for magic to gather and they can print them endlessly but with gauze and chain you have assurances to how scarce your cards are so if you are into a trading card game and you want to have that experience on ethereum check out gaza unchained download the game you you can you don't have to buy cards to get started uh you start you get started off with like the basic starter pack and then you win games and then you get more cards and it's fantastic so check them out at gauze unchained yup godson chain.com we will include a link in the show notes also longtime sponsor friend of bankless ave want to tell you about ave a little bit they are climbing up the leaderboard i i looked the other day and they were at something like uh number three in terms of total value locked in d5 so they are a really interesting lending and borrowing protocol so you could deposit die into the protocol you can deposit other tokens into the product protocol and start receiving interest on those tokens you can also take out loans um they have ver they have fixed loans fixed rate loans in addition to variable loans and fixed rate loans are pretty unique in d5 they're also like fast movers so they're rolling out a ton of cool things um they're rolling out a credit type system pretty soon and they've just released avonomics which is just wild so this is their liquidity and token incentive model and one of the things they're adding with with avonomics is this the safety feature so a portion of uh funds and eth is actually going to secure the contracts and provide sort of an insurance for holders in the event of catastrophe so check out avonomics check out ave start using it try it out at auve.com that's aave.com david let's get to announcements real quick so we had eric voorhees on the podcast episode came out yeah it was so good guys just go check out that episode um fantastic and then tomorrow we actually have a first i think this is not just a first for bankless um but this is like a first for crypto maybe for podcasting in general uh what's happening tomorrow david yeah tomorrow we're getting andre creator of the yearn and yiffi protocol on the bankless podcast and and why this is so crazy and so unique is not only exactly why yearn and yiffi are so unique in the sense that they launched in like the most fair and equitable way possible but that andre the creator of this project who didn't pre-mine any of the yiffy tokens which have has done the first like you know 10 000 x out of any token ever he didn't pre-mine any for himself and he's letting the tokens the token owners govern whether he goes on to a podcast or not and so as he made this announcement he like he he tweeted out like i've gotten a lot of requests for people for to come on people's podcasts and i'm only going to do it if the token holders say so and so when i heard when i saw that tweet i immediately rushed to the urine finance governance page and submitted a proposal for uh for andre to come on the bankless podcast which passed in like flying colors like 95 voted yes and then andre messages me and says uh so i'm told i'm enslaved to you so let me know when and where to show up for the interview and so that time was tomorrow is tomorrow in the morning and so we're recording with andre creator of the urine protocol tomorrow morning which is well i wonder i wonder if he even wants to like it's like he doesn't have a choice this doesn't matter it doesn't matter he by coin vote he has to show up for the interview tomorrow right um it's pretty uh it's pretty funny how that works and i i do think this is the first like interview podcast episode by coin vote so we'll see how that goes uh we've got a lot of interesting questions for him also releasing tactics on bank list so there's a dydx tactic that you'll find that was released this morning check that out it's about an eth perpetuity that's going to be pretty fun i think in this upcoming bull market that we've been talking about so much last thing i'll say is um do you know what august 27th is david i don't know tell me ryan all right so august 27th is when bankless first started so bankless turns one year old um as a as kind of a newsletter and kind of the genesis and um you know i'm hopeful we can share some stats that days but one of the things you know when i started the newsletter with bank list is i wanted to buy the first birthday get to 10 000 subscribers 10 000 people on the bank list journey as part of the extended bankless nation so we're getting close but um you know maybe we'll reveal some stats on that pretty soon so uh tell your friends about bankless let's see if we can hit those numbers and celebrate bankless's birthday david gotta ask you the question i ask every single episode you've been right on for the past for the past seven episodes it's been it's been scary accurate actually so what is the state of the nation today david hoffman the state of the nation is pumped we are pumped uh in so many different ways ether price has pumped it has just blown past expectations people are pumped for that uh the ethereum phase zero right before that we're recording this uh the test net just went live so people are absolutely pumped for that i'm pumped about these shirts which we're about to talk about after this there's just a lot of pumping going on people are stoked prices are pumping pumping's all around us it's a fantastic time wait wait wait pumping is a bad thing though sometimes like are you saying like pump as in a good thing in this context yeah pumped as in like prices are going up and we're all stoked about it uh yeah so sometimes pumping could be viewed badly but not this time yeah so it feels like to me it's like we've been talking about this for a long time oh honestly we've been talking about this not just for months we've been talking about this for years that at some point the market would actually catch up with what's going on in ethereum and what's going on with defy and a huge portion of this just feels like the market catching up like it's 2016. we haven't even seen 2017 yet still the people coming into bank less the people watching this today are mostly people that already know about crypto we've got a whole new fresh crop of immigrants into the bankless nation to start onboarding they haven't even shown up yet so i do feel like this is just a lot of catch catch-up to all of the things we've been talking about over the past months and years yeah totally so i've been getting text messages from from friends like who are getting back into d5 back into ethereum but they were there with me back in like 2017 2018 these are the friends that i made back in that cycle who like kind of went on and did their own thing yeah but it's easy for them to come back right and they know who to talk to like we're still waiting for that wave of like people that have never touched anything before that hasn't that hasn't happened yet but like as you were saying there is no ever any fair value for ether for for bitcoin no one knows what these things should be and over time i think it's fair to claim that like the price of these things on the secondary market oscillate around what they should be like 2017 bitcoin and ether were priced way too much 2018 and 2019 they were priced way too low and now it seems like we're kind of coming back to that mean to that average yeah and like the theory is like all all previous bull markets like you pass that average where you think it's about fair value but then you just keep on going yeah and that's what like a bull market mania is guys we said this before these are fractals we're like people are like oh there'll be nothing like 2017 again like that was a one time no it's not a one time i mean it happened multiple cycles with bitcoin it'll happen again things will get overextended too but right now we're not there we're just approaching probably more lines along the lines of what the value should be it's just a bit of catch-up over the last two years of everything absolutely david first topic man i know you are burning to talk about this the shirts what's going on what are these things what are we wearing today these shirts have been an idea of mine and that i've always wanted to pull off in a while so i made this graphic forever ago uh not this exact one i kind of tweaked the size of the ethereum logo but it's it debuted this graphic debuted in my article ether the money game ethereum the money game landscape where i talked about like all these applications on ethereum are little games like unit swap is a game compound is a game and largely it's a game about stacking ether right like at the end of the day ethereum is a landscape for humans to compete with other humans as well as computers to compete with other huge computers as well as humans and computers to compete amongst themselves for ether right and so ethereum is like this money game landscape where ethereum ether the asset are the points and so this is that that we have like a little outrun style like graphic uh with like it's a landscape right it's like a grid and there are mountain ranges peaks and valleys and then there's the ether logo in the background and so it's all about the ethereum as a physical landscape of competition for either the points and that's what is resembled in this fantastic shirt dude i just wanna i want to take a minute just to admire this shirt the craftsmanship of the shirt like these things are like like the fit is awesome so i got mine on thursday dave and i opened up the package right and uh you know you hyped it up you said look this is a good shirt but like you didn't tell me too much i opened it i put it on it just felt like it felt perfect like the fit is exceptional what like what material is this it's i have no idea i have no idea it's just like it's not it's obviously it's not cotton right like this is a this is a super high quality shirt where did you first see these types of shirts yeah so the the first uh time i saw these types of shirts where i got this idea came out of the east denver conference where they have very similarly graphic graphic dup shirts right and so i found out who the manufacturer was i reached out to them got the details uh then i they handed over them the graphic and then that was you know it all fell out of that and so we got um 50 of these shirts produced so there's only 50 of them and two of them are already taken because me and ryan got ours um we pre-mined we pre-mined two shirts uh so now there's only 48 left and this is where we get into the concept of bankless seasons bankless apparel seasons oh okay all right so this is and this is season zero this shirt is season zero and so bankless apparel seasons is a like a regular occurring uh release of some really cool piece of clothing right this this shirt being the first one and so this is going to be a reoccurring campaign because what uh what frustrates me is that in the crypto world there's there's not really cool swag like we don't listen we have these fantastic futuristic sci-fi cryptoeconomic like protocols and we don't have any good way to like wear them like like people want to have like wear a totem they want to show their colors they want to express themselves and their interests and like i just went on like a five minute tangent about like the metaphor behind this shirt and i think that the bankless apparel seasons is like a vehicle for expressing these really complex things like in a shirt that you can wear and people can ask you about and say hey what's that shirt and like oh let me tell you about it you shouldn't have asked that question because now i have 20 minutes of things to talk about uh and so oh they're gonna they're definitely gonna ask you about this you're gonna ask like yeah you can't go outside without being asked about this shirt specifically it's a statement it's super unique like the design is awesome um it's definitely like but and you can basically wear your colors what you're talking about where are your culture everything you talk about ethereum and bankless the ability to like take that outside of your house if we ever get outside of our houses again [Laughter] okay so the way that this is gonna work is this is a sale and so we're posting this video up on youtube later today uh we also have a release going out on the bankless newsletter and once all those things are to go out at once and then one hour after that after all these things get released at once we are supplying all remaining 48 bap tokens bap bankless apparel so bap zero for season zero we are going to supply all remaining 48 bap tokens to the uni swap exchange the links will be in the show notes for this video also for the newsletter uh and then you can go to unit swap and purchase a token all right so we should get into this a little bit i'm going to share my screen as you're talking but keep talking yeah so you purchase the token off unit swap and then you burn it you can burn it by sending it to the genesis address of ethereum that's 0x000000 or you can also some wallets don't let you do that so you can just change the last zero for a one and that counts um but once you burn a token that is you redeeming a token for a shirt right these are redeemable tokens this is how you get one of the shirts um and again there's only 48 left because ryan and i already have two um and so you purchase a token burn it you email that transaction hash to apparel at banklesshq.com and then we will coordinate with you about how to deliver your shirt wherever you are in the world uh and so this this is how we're distributing the bat tokens uh so they're again they're on unit swap and this is this is like the redeemable token scarcity mindset we're we're really into this idea of scarce apparel and we're using the tools of ethereum to enable like this scarce apparel project so back to scarce apparel really quick uh we ran a couple bankless posts on this um jacob from zora wrote a post about uh redemption tokens redeemable tokens we'll include in the show notes to give you some context and there there have been these sort of scarce product releases um a few times within within ethereum that have caught some headlines most notably our friend rac right so he did a um he's a friend of the nation he's actually in the nation so he's a bankless member now um here he is repping the bankless uh swag repping the bankless shirt and he released a uh token called tape right and this was a a token specific to a new album that he dropped um and it did really well i think it was really successful um but basically he dropped the token issued it on uniswap um and you can read this post for for kind of uh what happened next in the details but it's it's really similar to to that idea right so you release a scarce uh token um that represents some sort of real world item and then people can purchase it on uniswap they can purchase it with eth and then once they have the token they have the ability to redeem that for the item itself yeah i really think that these scarcity tools on ethereum like erc20 and then also the infrastructure like uniswap balancer et cetera that go also into the ecosystem are really going to enable artists to do cooler things right and so rac was able to kind of produce value for produce value for his his fan base his clientele using ethereum and using non-functional tokens and i think that like and the future of bankless apparel seasons includes like the ability for future artists to contribute designs and they will be rewarded with percentage of the tokens so like i i'm not a designer i have basic photoshop skills this this is actually a relatively easy graphic to make uh some designer who knows photoshop better than me or however you make these graphics can produce even cooler even better designs and then we are going to let the bankless nation decide on which design will be in the next season and then the winning artist who has their designs choked chosen will receive a percentage of the tokens so it's a way for artists to like monetize to receive value from their value that they produce and they don't have to like in the in the case of ric they don't have to get ripped off by a record label or in the case of bankless seasons like all of this stuff is managed for you um i i think it's a really interesting way to return value back to artists with scarcity tools on ethereum yeah absolutely and spread the culture right that's what this is all about i mean we've we talked so much about bankless and crypto being a cultural movement um a lot of people have seen it as a technology in the past um i mean it's a social technology this is a cultural movement this is about um like representing what you're doing and the journey that you're on and if nothing else comes out of this whole experiment that we're doing david we've got this picture which is just let me say it's amazing sir is that you in front of the uh the seattle skyline there yeah that's the seattle sky that's a couple blocks away from my house the i was thinking about perhaps a different word for the state of the nation was proud because we're proud of all how far we've come and i think that picture uh represents that so when you wear your bankless season apparel when you wear your baps euro you should be proud because we're all here together we've built something incredible and we're taking it to the market all right we're here to stack babs this is kind of what you're saying right there we're here to stack maps all right so this is the post i'm actually scrolling through the post that's going to be sent out um this is the you know you'll receive this post by the time we publish uh the video and this includes some more details about the bap zero sale so again all of these things are redeemable tokens so they represent these shirts um and here's some details about the supply maybe david you should say just something about um how we're doing the liquidity because so we're putting 48 of these things in right but um with with those kinds of low numbers unit swap has a pretty steep curve where like it but by the way these these shirts start out like expensive right this is this is scarce apparel this is not regular bankless merch well they cost money to produce in the first place yes they cost money to produce this is not regular bankless merch we'll have a separate merch store for non-scarce apparel with with bankless stuff i know a bunch of people have asked about our bankless teas that we typically wear in these we'll have a separate store for that but what happens when you dep when you deposit things into unit swap in small quantities is the curve gets pretty steep so it gets more and more expensive as more of these bab0 tokens are taken out of the market so what are we doing to kind of dampen that liquidity can you talk about the uh yeah so the first thing that we're doing is we're supplying all tokens to the unit swap market so we're giving the entire supply to the to the market so they're with some like some defy tokens or ico tokens like they only give out 10 to the market and then they have the remaining 90 like non-circulating no they're 100 circulating 100 in the market which is one way to like soften that curve that incline of price go up when somebody buys a token but then we're also committing to selling all of our available baps at a certain level right so when 50 of the baps are purchased roughly 50 23 out of the 48 leaving 25 when 23 are sold they will be roughly selling for five eth uh about and what we're doing at that point is we are going to withdraw liquidity from uniswap in order to sell bap tokens back into uniswap to keep that price suppressed until we have no more like so so david and ryan are going to do our best to like keep that price at five eth per bap or lower until we have no more in our hands anyway we have no more to sell and then at that point bankless won't be making any more money and all the tokens will be in the ecosystem and we will have exited and all tokens will be available for either redemption or selling back into unit swap so we're getting we're getting out of baths early as as early as possible at what we think is a fair rate so that the the remaining maps on the market can price themselves yep and we're not trading these things um and the tokens so the tokens that uh we have the two shirts that we have we actually we've we went through the process right so we took those two tokens what um here's the uh here's the address to make it you know like you can see all this stuff obviously on chain um here's the the bap token that i have in a in a bankless test address here that i received and this is me sending it to that ether dress to burn it so it's burnt it's gone with fire it's gone 48 left 48 just 48 left left so and yours has gone too so it's just 48 and um you know we're just supplying the liquidity we're not going to be trading these things we have redeemed them now what's super interesting is like um people don't have to redeem these things right yeah so they can buy them on uniswap and like at that point it's kind of theirs to do with what they will they have an option to redeem it um in which case we we talked about how they do that but they don't necessarily have to redeem it which is interesting um i have no idea how that's going to play out how do i neither do i that's why markets are fun right that's right this is a yeah this is a fun experience why we're calling it uh season zero not season one yeah exactly so you know another thing though is um when jacob wrote that redeemable tokens post he talked about the um utility of these tokens potentially in virtual worlds right so um for instance i i don't know how how much time have you spent in like a crypto vauxhall the central androids yeah very little so i haven't spent a ton of time either but like like we're both gamers right um so like we know the potential of those types of virtual worlds and what i think is really interesting is with nfts you have the ability essentially to represent a digitally scarce good of course you can redeem it for a physically scarce good the escape tea itself but um you can also like wrap the shirt in crypto voxels or decentraland and i feel very much like these virtual worlds are just a shadow of what they will become it's very possible in the future that like the most value that comes from these sorts of scarce tokens not not these but like maybe these but other sorts of scarce tokens will actually come in virtual worlds in-game experiences where you're doing it for the same reason you're doing it in the physical world right you're uh it's a it's kind of repping your colors it's you know you mentioned the word you know proud right it's something that you've earned and that you've you've purchased and that you want to showcase to the world it's kind of a human um it's in human nature to like put on these sorts of displays and and these sorts of social signals so i think it could be really interesting in virtual worlds as well as that expands yeah totally the virtual world side of ethereum is very much kind of like the l2 world where there's a lot of them and there needs to be some sort of like settling or some sort of convergence upon like which virtual world is going to be the thing that everyone onboards into maybe it's not even the ones that we currently have available to us i wouldn't even say that the virtual worlds on ethereum are even closely to the point that like l2s are yeah but that doesn't actually for what what this means it doesn't actually matter because if you redeem a bap token the the vision of these this system is to create a virtual version of these shirts in the virtual world that emerges right and so we're gonna have to do this after the fact but that's kind of where our heads are at like if you redeem a token you get the actual shirt in real life and then you get the virtual shirt for whatever virtual world comes to ethereum and so if that world does ever indeed come we will be issuing virtual versions of these shirts in the virtual world that comes absolutely so you sort of get the best of both now maybe the last thing to say is when we think about uh additional seasons david and again this is just season one so we're seeing how it goes and we'll use information to iterate on whatever season two is um but we're also thinking about tiers of scarcity right for some of these items right so this first the eatscape shirt is a legendary shirt right because there's only 50 of them there's only 50. so what are the other classes yeah so for those those who are gamers will find themselves very very familiar with this system so it's just like finding loot on the ground or loot in like a chess box or some some random loot box or whatever there's legendary epic rare and commons right and so legendary's got 50 items epic's got 150 items rare has 250 items and then common has 500 items and so as we go through these different seasons each season will have like a different rarity right like one will be a common item and it'll be like a hoodie that's mostly black or something relatively simple and then you know in the future there will be future rare items as well that look as dope as this one right and so there's different tiers of scarcity because there's different like kind qualities of goods that you can produce with different like values in in how the graphic looks um and i think that's pretty cool absolutely yeah so we will we'll see how this experiment goes dave and i are super excited about it um you know maybe only a couple sell on on you swap in which case look dude i'm still excited about this you know we'll see what happens i know when we when we originally talked about you know the curve having one each like equal one shirt um that was at a time when eath was a little uh less expensive than it is today so guys 200 right right right right so so guys one thing the last thing i'll say about this is um this is kind of one of those things that's not for everybody you know in the bankless nation this is sort of you know scarce merch um it's expensive right these shirts are super high quality so it gets you out of kind of the the fast fashion motif of buying cheap shirts from like a gap or like an h m or whatever um so there's that but they're still expensive right so um there's going to be a certain group of people who are really excited about that and drawn into that um and there's others for which we'll we'll launch like a merch store a bankless merch store and you'll have a way to buy other bankless swag and represent the nation that way um but we hope you enjoyed this fun experiment guys like just like have fun with it um that's what i i think my favorite thing about crypto is is there's something new every single day like to do um it feels like one giant video game anyway right like or you're like mario and you're like here and you're leveling up and you're collecting the coins um and uh my parents have no idea what i do like how i spend my time but um but you guys do because because because you're in this space too david anything else you want to say about the bap and about the ethers the escape shirt yeah yeah so you talked a little bit about fast fashion uh i i don't really want to go into that here but there is two two posts going out there is the introductory bankless seasons post which talks about uh fast fashion what it is and how uh scarce apparel can fix that and so i kind of walk through the narrative there and at the end of it it forwards you off to season zero launch which is the second post which is also going out so there's two separate things to read uh one's kind of like the the explainer of the whole um the whole bankless apparel season's campaign and then the other one is specifically season zero and all the details to go in with that so that's in your inboxes so and in the show notes so check them out all right well here we go that was uh topic one david before we get into the other things we want to talk about in state of the nation we should talk about our sponsors first um do you want to start with polymath or poly market poly market yeah so poly market another new sponsor of the state of the nation poly market is a prediction market platform on ethereum and for those that don't know prediction markets are where are markets where you can go to to express an opinion about what you think is the most likely outcome of the future right and so you know sports games presidential elections future crypto prices these are all like viable contenders for being able to express an opinion for what you think will will happen so like there's uh the the market gives you odds based on like will donald trump or joe biden win the presidency and if if you think that the odds that the market is offering you from poly market are off from what is it should be correct you can go and express an opinion and take a bet and then in the future as more and more people do this you can just go to poly dot market and look at the bets just for your own information it's like okay the the poly market is uh gauging that coronavirus will be over in four months and so i can plan my life based on that because the people that are betting have skin in the game they are going to win or lose money based off of whether they're incorrect or not so they have a really elegant ux ui it's pretty simple pretty easy to understand if anyone's gone to a predicted.org it's very much like that so if you are into uh betting on the future events of the world check out the check check them out at paulie.market uh yeah and send an email uh with bank lists in the subject line after you make a bet and they will cover all of your gas costs and so go to polydot market you know check out the very the available markets there tweet out if you make a trade and then again uh email them at hello poly.market uh with the subject line bank list to get your gas costs reimbursed they've also got some pretty cool defy markets in there if i remember correctly but uh david dude you're on a roll man why don't you just take the second sponsor tail take this home let's do it it's your shirt you're on a roll all right so our last sponsor of the state of the nation is ample fourth ample fourth is a base money experiment on ethereum it's a pretty unique token where instead of the price going up and down the supply goes up and down and so it's a variable supply asset on ethereum and it's it's uh they're marketing themselves as a base money currency right an m0 and so i think the the most interesting thing about amplifore is that you can denominate debts in this thing and be comfortable paying it back because the price never goes too far away from a dollar it's not a stable coin but it is a trustless m0 to denominate debts in so you can check them out at amplefourth.org they have a cool dashboard where you can learn more about the economics do your own research i think it's a fantastic experiment um but be careful all right man all right topic two we want to talk about eth2 i think so all right so we're we're in the bulb market now right ethan's is charged it charged past that you know uh 353 price so i got unlocked from jail it charged it charged past some you know pretty um very strong resistances exactly exactly um and it just charged through it it hit almost 400 and um it didn't have 400 it hit it got up to 415 for a hockey hit for that it did yeah 4 15. oh i was supposed to tweet something out at 403 oops i missed that one i missed that one but you know it should sustain past 403 for a while and it didn't talk yeah i didn't do that okay so uh but we haven't even seen eth2 yet um but it's coming let's talk test nets man what's going on there yeah the morning of this recording the medasha test net just went live sounds like it had a small little hiccup out the door where not very many validators found the test net but turns out that solved itself over time wait so it's madasha it's not medalla it's not medal it's spelled medalla it's pronounced madasha wow what language is that uh i think it's spanish uh okay i think uh and i i think there was some game of telephone where we lost the original spelling or original pronunciation i don't know but mario nakanti pronounced it madasha and so i tried oh he's the pro yeah i trust yeah he knows he knows okay and so and so that that is live right now and so what this means is is that if no hiccups happen if no bugs happen between now and three months from now and what is it it's august 4th so august september october november did i do that right november yep so in november if after three months of this test net running if it's still running without any bugs then phase zero goes live uh and so you can also check out on our sponsor polly.market that people are giving a odds two to one odds that no bugs happen currently and wait so they're betting two to one odds that eath will ship this year e36 east phase zero will ship in november yeah in 2020 yeah in 2020 right interesting right and so people people are starting to price in the success of phase zero right and we have the final test net up and running uh and again if everything goes according to plan which the market is giving two to one odds that it will uh phase zero launches this year by the end of this year that's weird i was told eth2 would never ship yeah like never sold that too i sold that every single day for the last five years all right well you know maybe maybe some some people are like let's believe it i'll believe it when i see it so what about folks who've been kind of sleeping on this for a little bit they're just now kind of waking up to d5 theory and probably price got their attention look everyone's lives are busy right so before i was doing crypto full-time right like i mean i had other stuff going on i wasn't constantly monitoring the status of test nets crypto test nets right we should just go a quick recap of the various phases that we're talking about in eth2 and explain what it is really quick so i'm going to show a road map david maybe you could kind of start by explaining what this initial phase is yeah absolutely all right so we're what we're really talking about is not the full eth2 in its final form what we're talking about is phase zero first first i'll show this one this is a more simple road map i think and we'll get to the other okay so yeah we are currently at ethereum one dot x um that's the ethereum 1.x x stands for the fact that we constantly update it we add new things because both ethereum 2.0 is progressing but also ethereum one is also progressing uh separately they both have progress um however for eth2 the first is phase zero the beacon chain that's like the heartbeat of the whole entire system i kind of like to imagine this thing as like an organism that is growing and it grows from the center out and the heartbeat is at the very center right once the heartbeat is stabilized and predictable and and able to be dependent on then the heartbeat turns into more complex things like you know extremities arms legs whatever more organs but first off phase zero is the heartbeat that's where the beacon chain gets the entropy which is really important in the rest of the in the rest of uh the phases because you need entropy to make things ungainable uh and and then this is also where the deposit contract lives right so at some point when if uh if this test net succeeds without bugs for three months this deposit contract opens up so people on the e1 chain send their ether to this deposit contract and it gets redeemed on phase zero beacon chain which makes it east to east right then that's up and running for a while then we introduce shard chains and this is where we start to get scale right and so not just do we have the main beacon chain but we also have the shard chains that are there's gonna be 64 of them and they all connect back to the beacon chain and then they also cross link and so that's where we go from just having one ethereum blockchain to having 64 of them so like increasing throughput by like a theoretical 64 um x and it's i think it's actually even more than that but there's 64 version shards of ethereum running and then the beacon chain coalesces them into one and that's that's great because that's kind of the issue of gas today that's where we solve the gas problems on the l1 but we don't yet have contract execution uh so we can't actually do d5 things on phase one yet because there needs to be a virtual machine and that's where phase two comes in phase two brings in uh the e-wasm virtual machine we currently have the evm the ethereum virtual machine running uh one.x and evm run the evm runs on solidity which is great but it's also limiting and that's where e-wasm comes in so we have a secondary virtual machine which runs on a contracting language that is more common there's more people more developers out there like your google devs your amazon devs e-wasm is probably going to be the virtual machine that brings them in it makes it very easy to build on ethereum which is great because ethereum needs development and ethereum needs developers and we all of a sudden have way more developers available to ethereum and so in that phase that's like the final phase um there's more innovation that goes on but phase two is is basically all of ethereum 2.0 and once that's here we're done yeah absolutely get over it you know um so the delphi digital the delphi folks um they're kind of an analyst group and they they talk primarily to sort of wall street institution types and they put out a fantastic report on ethereum's birthday last week that will include the show notes you should absolutely check out but um there's this there's this image in the report that shows uh exactly what you're saying with those phases david and then also kind of timelines too right so what we've been talking about the test nets uh the the madasa test net that we were just talking about that's kind of a q4 eta and that's that phase zero right and then we're looking at a um you know a shard uh chain in you know the phase one which is probably 20 21 ish uh and then this is really exciting so this wasn't in preston's slide that you just showed but this is a phase 1.5 that's kind of in between phase one and phase two and the reason this is exciting is because what it provides is essentially a migration of the original eth 1.0 chain that david was just talking about into eve 2.0 so it moves eath 1.0 into a shard on ethereum two and what happens there is super important from the perspective of ether the asset because at that point in time we can get rid of proof of work right so proof of work ethereum ether issuance is about four percent per year right now right and that's going to continue that's even going to continue into phase one where we uh institute and start doing proof of proof of stake it'll be some inflation there probably around the one percent range so um ether issuance will increase uh briefly from four percent to about five percent you know potentially somewhere around that that timeline but when we get to phase 1.5 the entire ethereum eco the entire ethereum nation becomes secured just by proof of stake and issuance drops like off a cliff so it drops to about one percent um it's variable based on the amount of people staking and also based on uh what what we've talked about a lot which is eip1559 which could actually burn a portion of the ether based on usage but so all this leads to is at the end of this when you get to one phase 1.5 which could be 2022 or so you've got a very low issuance um ethereum that offers higher security than the original main chain and i think that will enshrine um ether the asset into a store of value right the monetary policy will become there was much more widely known there's no doubt right this has always been the plan and it's finally being executed um you know in fact i think there's somewhere in this report where they talk about or they talk about that uh let me find that in just a minute but what were you gonna say david yeah so uh eth 1.5 the the phase 1.5 is where um the ethereum l1 chain the current chain starts to be secured by ethereum 2.0 so it's where these chains start to get melded and so that's when we we are able to strip away miners and uh maybe there's some small miners left on the chain but the point is is that very quickly does the eth1 chain become verified by the eth2 chain by the proof-of-stake consensus on eth2 which means we don't know we no longer need miners which means we no longer need that extra issuance to pay the miners because security under proof of stake is much more inexpensive and so both chains will simultaneously be verified and validated by the eth2 stakers yeah absolutely and the other thing we get in phase 1.5 of course is a migration of all of d5 all of the apps and then we also get some pretty large scalability benefits not the full scalability of eth2 but in layer two we can actually start sort storing some additional data so um if if folks listening are familiar with all of the the layer two tech that's being built out for um ethereum today you know specifically there's been a slew of new layer two options as reddit kind of put out over quests and said hey eath community can you help us out we're trying to scale on ethereum we want to do tokens for all of our subreddits but we need it to be super fast how can you do that and the ethereum community came back with a ton like like 30 different answers to that um all of them have high numbers good answer yes and those become ultra powerful when we get to phase 1.5 because we can start storing some of that data in the secure eth2 chain itself so super exciting you know what's exciting to me when i saw this report i've honestly never seen a report like this like a report from an analyst who's talking to institutions get it right they didn't they've never gotten it right like they've never understood what ethereum is this is the first report i've i've read which is like cool you got it right and you're actually explaining this in a way that institutions can can understand right so they talked here about youth too proof of stake what does it bring proof of stake is more economically feasible enhanced monetary policy minimum necessary issuance is something we talk about often to describe ethereum's monetary policy it turns ether into a staking asset well that's triple point asset that's what we've been talking about here it burns a long time it burns transaction fees i mean the analyst probably reads bank list i'm going to say right and anyway these sorts of things that we've been talking about in the bankless nation are starting to get translated into language that quite honestly like um i don't like i'm never going to write a 30-page analyst paper like this right it's just it's boring to me but you help sure like right so some of the ideas that we've talked about in the bankless community form the bottom layer of these sorts of analyst papers and these analyst papers are now getting translated into a language that institutions can start understanding and now they can understand ether as an asset and they now they can understand what the hell is going on with ethereum so yeah i'm also excited because of that it took three years of bear market memes to generate those those memes and now they're they're finally being leveraged right like partly when i see the ether price run to 400 i'm like oh great like the world's finally pricing in the memes we've generated over the last two years kind of right and you know people um i think people like i when we talk about memes we take a very high view of what a meme actually is right um it's it's not just a you know a gift somebody puts out on on twitter that sort of goes viral exactly it's it's a shared story that um uh social groups start to believe and it becomes the the forming narrative for what the you know what in this case what the particular asset class is right so um these memes really are the base layer right and this is how those memes get translated into into regular language yeah like like bitcoins meme is a non-sovereign uncapped store value asset and it becomes that if everyone believes that that's what it is right yep and it's it's going to do a great job at doing that if everyone believes that it will do a great job of doing that and that's how it becomes reality right and so it with with like burning ether in eip1559 or as a capital asset or as a store value it will become that because we all think that it will become that right absolutely and it gets tested through the fires like good memes get tested right so um you know it's not enough for a meme to be out there and for a bunch of people to believe it it has to pass through the fires right so an example of bitcoin passing through the fires well it held up relative to other crypto assets in the bear market as sort of a reserve asset so it's sort of like we passed through the fire there was a time where people um thought that bitcoin was going to be peer-to-peer cash right like a money system a payment type player system and that was the mean right i can send you bitcoin no one can stop me uh david peer-to-peer basis or coffee yeah yeah it decentralized paypal um that was a meme back in 2013 right pay for my coffee and starbucks uh it didn't pass through the fire and so the meme actually died so um these memes actually get verified they're based on fundamentals right they're based on fundamentals because they have to pass through those those fires and in the same way that like speculation on something is speculation on its fundamentals you don't get speculation for speculation's sake information is built on something and memes are built on something in the same way absolutely all right dave last topic um this is this is kind of a fun one so um we've switched into full bull mode right so i wrote a post about this on my ecosystem yeah the entire ecosystem the the the switch has been flipped we're in bull mo bull mode now bull market now for crypto uh eric voorhees called it even in our you know podcast monday joey crew called it the week before chris bruninsky hinted at that all the before that before they he was the first one in my mind absolutely so like it's not just us saying this we're kind of reaching consensus and price is kind of showing you breaking through these these walls and showing you bull markets so bull market is on bull market memes on so how do we get into a bull market mentality and like what is that because there's a bear market mentality that you need to have right and under understand and adjust for but there's also like a bull market mentality and i've seen people lose more in the bull market a lot more in a bull market than in a bear market like bull markets can be way more dangerous than bear markets uh can you talk about what the bull market mentality is and how how we should be thinking about this yeah and markets are a reflection of the participants participating in them right and so when we say it's a bull market what we're really saying is that everyone who's participating in price discovery around ether or price discovery around bitcoin has a bull market mentality because it's the mentality that creates the bull market not the other way around right so it's the mentality that comes first and like one of the core characteristics that differentiates a bear market from a bull market is that like in a bull market good news moves the price in a bear market good news doesn't move anything depressed but people are depressed literally the word depression means that like good news doesn't mean anything to you yeah bull market good news doesn't only mean something but it probably means more than what it actually means right in in bull markets good news really moves the price and that's because it's reflected in our mentality and so everyone who's participating in price discovery which means you are buying or selling or trading anything the your mentality is shifted you are no longer a bear market mentality you are now a bull market mentality and you need to account for this because who you are changes in the bull market your personality changes based on the mentality that you have and so there's a couple things that's like it's really important to remember as we go through this bull market because like the biggest thing that is going to cost you is you got too greedy right the biggest thing that is going to cost you is your hubris right you need to be modest you need to be humble and you need to accept that you're not going to win all the game all the gains but you in order to if you and if you were to chase all of the gains and trying to get the maximum amount of gains possible that's how you lose everything right that's how you lose everything and i'm speaking in in general terms but like there's there's a couple lessons that i learned that i want to share and and starting from last cycle right and i feel like i'm coming full circle to like where i started in crypto where i came in and after the first major run-up in 2017. so ether went from like fifty dollars to four hundred dollars back to 170 and then it floated up to 300 that's what brought me in and that was like relatively late into the hype cycle right like ico the ico boom was already in full mania and so you know and so i i buy ether i start investing in tokens all that happens and then my my block folio number goes up and up and up and i think like i'm a genius david when you bought those tokens like how much did you know at that point in time i'm so little so little so little like i couldn't have told you anything about the qualities of ether as an asset that i know today zero things and but also the ecosystem didn't know them but like i'm sure i i had i was i was months old when it comes to the crypto so you're like is going up this thing is hot i don't fully know what it is but like i'm playing the game i'm playing the game i'm in the game i know there's something here and i'm i'm putting my chips on this and i'm risking it right like i'm i'm headed west these are my chips i don't exactly know what i'm doing but i'll figure it out right once i start investing yeah it didn't take me a few months to figure it out it took me like three years and counting like i'm still figuring it out i'm still figuring it out all right so then what happened yeah so i'm watching my block folio go up and up and up and like for a kid that was previously a broke student trying to get into physical therapy school like i made more money than i ever thought that i would at that age right yeah like in hindsight it wasn't it wasn't all that much but at the time like each person has their own number as to what means to them and my mistake was that i started spending more without paying off my credit card right that was my big mistake you saw those numbers going up in block folio and you're like net worth going up that means going i am richer so i can spend more each exactly which is a true statement if you sell you don't get to spend more without selling your profits if you are making profits and then you are going to amazon and buying a boat like you need to sell because that's where you're getting the money to fund your endeavors right and so you don't get to have both you don't get to have number go up and also i buy more things like you need to choose one okay so are you saying like basically you can't treat those block folio numbers as real numbers like they're not real they're not it's just not like ignore your feelings ignore the euphoria you're going to be checking price like 20 times a day maybe but you have to ignore that you're not any wealthier until you sell is that what you're selling yeah you don't get to spend more until that dollar shows that dollar sign shows up in your bank account like that until that moment you didn't have any more money than you did previously it doesn't matter what your block folio says okay so here's another mistake i feel like people make in the in the bull market that's a huge one i'm so glad you said that so another mistake is sometimes they sell too early yeah to be honest yeah right so so people are like oh my god eat just went from 200 to 400 like mount d d flies in a bubble this is like i'm calling the top and they call the top and and then you know a week or two later they're right because heath drops down to you know 300 they're like see i told you and it's on the it's on the upside in the bull market that so many people miss out on right like all of the gains all of the opportunity costs that could have been theirs because they they also sold too early so how do you prevent that so you're saying you know step one is don't live like it's real money just keep your keep your standard of living the same as if it doesn't even exist until until you sell um but but also like how do you prevent not selling before like this whole thing has been realized the full cycle plays out right and and this is this is really really hard right because this partly involves timing the market um there are signals if you are really looking paying attention to them and you're doing your research as to how like market cycles work there are signals that you can tap into but again it's all subjectivity at the end of the day and what also makes this really hard is that every time a token pumps it looks exactly like the last time it just pumped right and so ether goes from 50 to 300 then it goes from 100 to 450 then it goes from like 300 up to 700 then it goes from like 500 where it drops up to like 900 then it goes from 900 to 1400. turns out 1400 was the last time that it pumped but it didn't have been any if you were there it didn't feel like that didn't feel like it like when i saw a fourteen hundred dollar ether i was thinking two thousand dollars ether like the next week right that's how psychology works that's how it works it's how it works and so like you don't know that all pumps look exactly the same and you don't know which one's the last one because this is a game at the end of the day a mania a bull market a bubble is a game of musical chairs right and so at some point the music stops and it looks like all the other times that are pumped but you just don't know right and so this is fun because you get to play musical chairs like you get to and it's a game of chicken it's like a game of how long can you go before you sell and if you sell too late you lose and so at some point in time you have to you don't really want to play the market like don't you like ether goes from like 200 to 400 and then you short it and it goes from 400 down to 320 and then you're like i'm a genius and then it runs up to 600 and you're out and then you're bitter and then you never get back in you lost all your money while there's this bear market or bull market like you don't want to be that guy however you also don't want to be the guy that like sells too late right and so you have to answer to yourself like does the money that i've just made in this bull market meaningfully impact my life if i sell right now how much better is my life do i do i pay off my credit card pay off my mortgage pay off my car whatever like i leave the the weight of debt if you have the option to like remove all debt from your life at the middle of the cycle that might be a good time for you to like and i'm sorry if that cuts off you know 2x 3x 4x gains after that but at the same time you locked in a meaningful life change and you're never going to forget it and you're always going to think yourself that you did that yeah that's it yeah that's a great point so i you know i think there are a couple strategies that that you know people can use so we we talked about dollar cost averaging into crypto right we just take you got a paycheck you take a slice of that paycheck you're like this is allocated to crypto prize um you can also dollar cost average out so you do the same thing except in reverse you could do that in two ways you could do that one on a time horizon you say okay bull market mode every month i'm gonna sell a little bit right percentage out i'm gonna take money off the table um you can also some some people have seen even very sophisticated investors do the same thing it's not a you know it's not a play just for you know retail and you know simpletons sophisticated investors do this where you know uh every time eve doubles i sell a portion every time he doubles i sell 10 percent make that your rule um another rule you can have for yourself going in okay so going into this you need to have your rules you need to have your game plan established like now because as david was saying in the moment you're not gonna like the euphoria is gonna take over and when you see a thousand you're gonna be like ten thousands on the table right right and like you're gonna know that in your heart right um and don't like if you make rules while ether is like going from 5 000 to 10 000 they're going to be different rules than if you had made them at the very genesis when you were  sober yes yes bull drunk i guess is maybe the term um yeah so so that's what you have to do is establish those rules getting in another another rule you can establish is once it hits this amount right i'm gonna sell i'm gonna sell some portion um but i also wanna frame this okay so um we started bank list the entire principle of what this is uh in the bankless movement in the bankless nation is at some point if we're right here's the thing you don't have to sell okay now i want you to park that right so everything that david just said about look if you got credit card debt if you get student loans you make a meaningful amount like and things are going crazy uh you know don't lean in everything that david said is true right but the thesis is also true that like we think the bankless thesis the megalist belief is over time you you want to start thinking about your denomination for what wealth is right right now everyone's denomination for wealth basically this us dollar denominated you know a million dollars right us dollar denominated because we pay for things in u.s dollars but when you start to get into the bankless world your your bottom like denominator starts to change and you're like well is it what if u.s dollars actually isn't the reserve currency in this bankless country but what if what if us dollars uh weakens as a reserve currency for the world and then what you need to find is what are the reserve currencies in this parallel universe that we call crypto right and that's really been the thesis of the bankless program from from day one is you want to find what the crypto monies are and you want to build into what the crypto monies are and the crypto monies in um you know in crypto are very clearly ether and bitcoin at least it's clear to me some people don't believe the first makes a lot of people believe the second they don't believe the first and look it's possible some other contender could rise up the ranks and be a crypto money we're not we're i don't think we're close to that yet so the way i think about these bull markets is not just in um appreciation of u.s dollars right that's just one denominator but that's not the bankless nation denominator the bankless nation denominators ether and bitcoin right is that increasing because that might be long-term wealth over time and when you start thinking about these things in cycles like once you've done a couple cycles like eric voorhees 2011 that's how he cycles oh i'm gonna tell you he thinks like he thinks in decades now right and he's like what do i care about us dollars i'm only taking us dollars out that i need to spend immediately like no i'm not speaking for eric here but i'm pretty sure this is how the majority he thinks wealth yeah i'm going to keep in crypto native reserve currency assets that are going to continue to appreciate yeah over over these cycles so think about your denominators your denominators should be crypto money even if you're doing things with like defy tokens these other things um and doing narrative plays and that sort of thing come back to what's your denominator is it us dollars is also these reserve currencies that's how you start to make long-term bets in this space and last through these cycles yeah sorry there's a helicopter uh so yeah d5 tokens are not going to trade against dollars like uh like snx the synthetics network token yiffi like the iffy token their main trading pair is ether right and so they're going to appreciate or depreciate versus ether not versus us dollar ether and all these things are going to appreciate first or depreciate versus the us dollar but they trade against ether trade like ether is the base currency and so you know um i i don't have too much evidence to support this but like when especially yiffi which 98 of all trading volume is between yiffi and ether or excuse me it's wifey wifey and ether uh when ether goes up wifey will also go up when we why when ether goes down wi-fi will also go down because it's denominated in ether and more and more of these things i think are just going to choose like we saw this in 2017 like say what like bitcoin is maybe this is contentious say what you will but the 2017 ico ico mania the 2017 bull market was because of ethereum because of the ico mania and it and ether the asset went through the roof because everyone had to buy east ether because the icos were denominated in eth d5 tokens are the same thing you know it's a safer link which i think gets the majority of its volume from us dollar like defy tokens the mania that we've seen already mania quote-unquote that's coming out of depression uh is denominated in in ether right and so if you are trading your d5 tokens denominating in dollars might be a mistake like you might need to be uh denominating in the bankless monies which is our ether and bitcoin yeah i've seen a lot of the people who are saying things like um the uh defy good moon without ether have been strangely silent over the past week and a half weird so some of these things look guys some of these things you know you're just making bets right you're thinking through the fundamentals and you're making bets and i anyone could point to any time horizon or data point and say yo david what you said is a lie because here's wifey going up and ether's going down right so what you said is not true right and they're looking at a two week time horizon or something zoom out guys that i think is the last maybe piece of advice we have for the bull market mentality is you have to zoom out and look at the long run and you know a couple weeks a couple months even sometimes depending on the cycle you're in a couple years of data doesn't tell you much you got to zoom out this is a decades-long journey and process lifetime lifetime long and uh think think about it in those terms of time horizons and uh i think you'll do pretty well in this space everybody who has had that long-term outlook um has done really well has done really well right and it's just it's about david was said earlier it's about um staying in the game right marathon not a sprint the thing you don't want to do is do stupid stuff like you know go in debt take margin that sort of thing and face the prospect of like getting totally destroyed if there's a sudden crash because that eliminates you from the staying in the game stay in the game you know stack the reserve currency assets stay in the game maybe stack some bats while you're at it right some bats all right david i think that's uh that's probably it for the show that's it from us yeah yeah that's it for me sir all right so uh action items we will put a link in here to the unit swap exchange and they'll also be a link to the post that explains what we're doing with these etherscape shirts you can pick one up and uh and be wearing it like dave and i are today this has been state of the nation episode 8. thank you so much for hanging with us
