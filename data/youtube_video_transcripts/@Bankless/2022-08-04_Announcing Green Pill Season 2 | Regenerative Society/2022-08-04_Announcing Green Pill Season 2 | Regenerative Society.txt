what's up coordination this is a special episode of the green pill pod in which we're gonna announce season two of the green pill podcast which is gonna be about regenerative society regenerative society is basically what happens when you take decentralized identity and you apply it to blockchain-based systems so you might have heard the phrase that the blockchain is a dark forest i think that using decentralized identity that's the lamp that can light the dark forest once you see who your counterparty is in a digital in a digital economic system then that allows you to play more positive some games over time with that system as you accrue reputation over time and so we're going to be exploring these themes of decentralized identity and positive sum games in season two of the green pill podcast so tl dr regenerative society decentralized identity positive sum games is what we're going gonna be talking about in season two of the pod you can drop now and move on to the next episode which will be the first episode of season one of the green pill pod if that's enough for you and if not you can spend the next 10 or 15 minutes listening to me talk a little bit about my thesis for regenerative society so i'm going to share my screen here and we're going to talk a little bit about regenerative society which i basically think is decentralized society the idea of a network of attestations about digital identity adding coordination layers on top of that and that's how you get regenerative society so basically if you didn't catch the episode about decentralized society with puja and glenn basically what you have in a decentralized society is three entities a a testing identity basically an account that is making an attestation issuing a soul-bound token or a verifiable credential that represents or encodes a part of the account state or history and the attest e so basically who is making the attestation so basically what we're doing over time here is there's a bunch of different attestations that can happen whether it's a token of appreciation a active loan a proof of repayment a active rental a git coin grants contribution a po app a proof of voting there's a bunch of different attestations that we could all be making about each other and if you start to put those into a directed graph in which you have a tester one attesting something to a test e2 who is attesting further to a third person what you're starting to get is this deeply liquid market of people who are attesting to each other and that is really really exciting to me because what it enables is intersectional identity so basically you can see who is a part of what communities what relationships do people have to each other and once you do have those at test stations you can start to make uh use cases and create utility off the back of those attestations if you're a bitcoin grants user you may have already gotten an airdrop from being on git coin grants and that i think is just the tip of the iceberg for what identity can do in these ecosystems when we get a deeply liquid network at scale under collateralized lending civil resistance plural identity that creates cooperation across social distance and lots and lots and lots of other good stuff so basically we can quantify the social proximity of all the different accounts in the ethereum ecosystem create copper cooperation across distance by looking at alice and what attestations have been made about alice and comparing those to the attestations that have been made about bob and the sum of that is is the intersectional identity of the web 3 space so that's decentralized society that's a vision from vitalik and puja and i just want to sprinkle a little bit of git coin on on git coins ethos on top of that to tell you about how git coin i think has been the tip of the spear for me understanding regenerative society and i'm no longer contributing much to get coin dao have since disaffiliated from get coined out but it's just the deepest depth of knowledge that i have about how this ecosystem is going to work is through bitcoin so bitcoin's purpose is to empower communities to build and fund their shared needs and basically what git coin is doing is running quadratic funding that has delivered 65 million dollars worth of funding to communities in the web 3 ecosystem and that creates object level impact for the public good now get coin grants is based off of quadratic funding which is based off of digital identity so i think that we've been sort of front running this idea of a regenerative society and a network of identity by running these experiments for the last three years and that's what sort of informed what how i think about this space is that get cohen's impact so far has been 65 million dollars worth of funding for public goods that's what bitcoin is best known for but if you look at it on its side bitcoin grants is actually dependent on something called civil resistance which is preventing attackers from making up accounts and trying to get too much of the matching pool because they've made up a bunch of accounts and so if you turn it on its side git coin is basically a red team blue team adversarial game that happens every quarter between the get coin dow which is trying to create civil resistance stock public resistance and the red team the bad guys the bad guys and bad girls that are trying to create sock puppets that are trying to steal the matching pool and so since i've had a frontline view of this red team blue team game over the last three years or so of the 65 million worth of funding on public goods and we've been trying to maximize coordination over time i have sort of a vision of how we can meet our shared needs how we can coordinate better and maximize the upside of decentralized society so basically the idea here is if you're looking for the perfect mechanism of how we can all meet our shared needs and coordinate better through these networks of attestations create positive sum games then you're kind of looking at a search space in which you're trying to maximize the amount of coordination and the ability to reach our shared needs that you can do together in a certain fitness landscape so we've been basically discovering mechanisms over the last several years in which we can meet our shared needs and create maximum coordination starting with centralized quadratic funding bitcoin was built centralized in 2017. it's my fault we built it wrong and we've evolved into pairwise quadratic funding over the last three years of running the experiment and basically the idea is that the future is optimizing for plural coordination devices building decentralized pairwise quadratic funding but then what would it look like if git coin poep bright id apollo all of these other digital identity tools ceramic disco id spruce id started creating dids started creating soul bound tokens and bootstrapped all these other beautiful things that decentralized society can create dsoc quadratic funding under collateralized lending ubi experiments i think that there is a global maxima that regenerates humanity and individual communities at scale and i think that that is what we're exploring the design space of in season two of the green pill podcast big opportunity that you'll hear us talk a lot about in season two the green pill podcast is one human one vote dowse so basically moving from one token one vote dow's that are dominated by capital to one human one vote dows that are dominated by people core part of bringing ethereum and web3 to more and more people across the world is giving them use cases that they can actually use 99 of humanity their lives is not their financial lives is not their investments they don't have many much capital on their family balance sheets but they do have their jobs and how they use the internet as as their financial lives what would it mean to create more democratic dials and high resolution democracy that allows them participate in these systems that is a big part of decentralized society you may have seen my talk at ecc get coin just launched bitcoin passport which is a transportable proof of personhood identity system for the web 3 space it aggregates stamps which are basically decentralized society edges and nodes and then through a privacy aware mechanism allows you to build your civil resistant identity across the d web acco across decentralized society and it's all bootstrapped with the data that git coin has been accumulating for the last three years with git coin grants and the knowledge of how civil resistance works at get coin grants so you can imagine that there will be a plurality of building blocks for a better internet being created over the next several years in the next capital flow rotation cycle in the web 3 space as we move from bear to bull and bear to bull and back again we're going to build these building blocks for a better internet they're going to enable more plural cooperation more positive some games because you can see who your counterparty is and more quadratic funding more quadratic voting more genea coefficient measurements more ubi one person one vote dowse data collective civil resistance air drops more utility for the average person and that's what regenerative society is about so i'm going to talk a little bit this season about passport which is kind of like the state machine that getcoin is building in order to ingest all this data and provide utility to everyday users so taking any on-chain or off-chain data web 2 or web 3 etling which is just a computer speak way of saying transferring the data into a did or a verifiable credential that is stored in a privacy preserving way on the ceramic network leveraging lip protocol for privacy and then from there once you've got that network of attestations you can build an aggregator or an aggregate or if you're a meme lord and you can create a personhood score you can create a lending score and what's key about these scores is that they're bottoms up so basically we're not talking about like chinese social credit score types things we're talking about communities creating their according to their own values what scores matter to them for bitcoin it happens to be civil resistance but you could fork this pipeline and you could build it for any sort of thing that you care about within regenerative society and then you can provide more utility to people once they have a personhood score on bitcoin so passport is kind of the tip of the sphere and how git coin is understanding civil resistance but this whole chain could be forked in order to bring other utility to other types of use cases and oh did i mention that the whole thing is privacy aware and built for privacy from the bottoms up so basically when you're using git coin passport you're getting the personhood score of an ethereum address but you are not getting any personally identifiable information about them which i think is key to making this whole regenerative society thing work at a web scale perspective so stamps data sources you can collect in get coin passport today our bright id our proof of humanity and our your twitter account your google account your discord account you can adjust all of that into your git coin passport and you can instantly get utility on get coin grants who will be the first integration partner that also derives from bitcoin civil resistance i don't know we'll see but uh you know there's other tools out there it's not all about bitcoin passport that's just the one that i know the best and so that's what the the sort of intersection of this podcast is going to be with regenerative society and hopefully together with the coalition of the willing in the web 3 space that is working on regenerative society that's working on decentralized society that is trying to create positive some games can bootstrap a network effects of more d apps that are building utility like this which creates more users and i'm just talking about financial users who are building collateralized loans and other d5 stuff i'm talking about everyday people who are collecting stamps creating more personhood scores which creates more d apps that have more utility for civil resistant use cases more d apps building ubi web3 onboarding uh creating poeps for for for users creating data collectives creating more utility forever to use and then we build this flywheel this solves the cold start problem of reputation in the web 3 space and that's why i'm so excited about season two of regen of the greenpeal podcast which again is about regenerative society so decentralized society plus maximum coordination plus this git coin ethos of crazy creating positive some games equals a regenerative society and so i think that the north star of what's being built here is adherent to the cypherpunk ideals advocating for widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change to the solar punk movement which is an art movement that envisions how the future of humanity might look if we succeeded in solving our contemporary challenges with sustainability and with positive some games for everyday people the intersection of that is what is going to be built within regenerative society i think that we will be studying what how the web 3 community might engineer capital rotation away from projects with just the best ponzinomics and towards projects with the most real world impact in order to test this thesis you have to have projects that are having real world impact in order to have real world impact you've got to have positive some games in order to have positive some games you need to have identity oh wait we're back at regenerative society that's why we're looking at regenerative society we're going to be looking at fragility and anti-fragility this season so basically how does the resource allocation of a community over time go from being fragile which basically means if there's a shock event it goes down over time to becoming resilient which is how these systems adapt to shock events to anti-fragile which basically our systems get stronger when shock events are applied to them i don't know about you but this is on my mind after tara luna three arrows capital voyager celsius all these systems that collapsed because they were just so freaking fragile how do we build anti-fragile systems that are bootstrapped on sound first principles mathematics and crypto economics and game theory in order to build regenerative society fragile projects front run their actual maximum sustainable growth by creating this ponzi like curve in which they all go up and there's like this blow off top and then the whole thing goes down over time but what would it look like if we extended our time preference out and looked for the projects that have sustainable growth that don't aim to create this this sort of like blow off top in which they in in which in in which the whole thing collapses but instead adapts and only uh grows in a sustainable way i think that this is how you create a system that provides utility to people is by giving them something that they can sustainably depend upon over time on a short time preference the ponzi schemes will win on a longer time preference things that have sustainable growth and actually create utility for the world and do it in an anti-fragile way are going to be the ones that work been very deeply inspired by buck minister fuller quote his vision of making the world work for 100 of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or disadvantage of anyone i think that's a north star it's a beautiful north star i won't say that the space has figured it out yet but i do think that decentralized society and coordination is a way that it could get there so what i'm saying is season two of the green pill podcast what if we could engineer a capital rotation towards projects with actual object level impact what if we build a civil resistance what if we build a more lunar punk solar punk cipher punk world and build a regenerative society and that is what you'll be hearing over the next 20 episodes or so on the green pill pod season 2 guest list is all decentralized identity and positive some games bright id upolu filecoin green orca brian ford who pioneered a lot of civil resistance stuff pre-crypto human node chase chapman sbf daniel ehrlichman ceramic disco good dollar spruce polygon id more and more episodes with daniel schmucktenberger i'm just name dropping now but i it's it's because i'm so excited about our guest list and how it intersects with what i think is the future of ethereum which is regenerative society decentralized society more positive some games and more coordination so let's build a regenerative society that is going to be the theme of greenfield season two i will see you on the ethernet and i hope you enjoy the season two of the greenfield pass pod podcast got ahead of myself there i'm very excited about this i will see you on the ethernet peace and love coordination [Music] you
