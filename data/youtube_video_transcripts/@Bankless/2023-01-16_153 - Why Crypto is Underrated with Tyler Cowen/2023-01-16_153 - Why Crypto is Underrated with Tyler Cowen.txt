I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless guys special treat today we have Tyler Cowan on the podcast Tyler is an economist he's a columnist he's a polymath he makes the case for why crypto is underrated I feel like we need this case right now as we enter 2023 three things to look for in this episode number one why Tyler thinks Regulators should pause and wait before passing crypto regulation especially in the wake of FDX this would be the absolute worst time to do it uh Tyler makes that case number two we talk about how FTX and Enron are similar in the lessons we should all learn from those two events number three why Tyler thinks crypto is underrated why he calls himself a crypto hopeful even though he thinks balaji's Network stake idea is utterly wrong a complete farce and finally we play Tyler's favorite game near the end overrated underrated we talk about everything that's relevant right now ai inflation America China social media wealth inequality these things overrated or underrated David we had a lot to talk about during the debrief what do you want to focus on I really want to focus on why polymaths seem to understand crypto better than everyone else and that was one of the big questions that we ask Tyler is people that are siled inside of their one and institution be it government or Academia or the banking sector they never really understand crypto they kind of just treat it with resistance but people that operate across these verticals across these sectors do seem to get crypto and that seems to be Tyler and and but just the nature of Tyler's very Punchy concise answers about almost anything that we ever would want to ask he's got an answer for it's this type of persona this person I think is uh worthy of

conversations with Tyler he interviews many thinkers across many walks of life he's had guests from crypto like vitalik buterin he's also had people like Mark Andreessen Ray dalio even had an SPF on I believe at one point uh maybe in the last year or so Tyler how are you doing hello thank you Brian Armstrong yeah can we just start here all right so uh 2023 what do you think of crypto well what what is this crypto thing how do you how do you explain it what is crypto now I think we're at a margin where crypto has become underrated by most intelligent honest Observers so the collapse of FTX has led to a lot of bad publicity whatever you think of that episode I don't feel it matters for the long run prospects of crypto the decline in prices has cleaned out a lot of the fraud there are serious people building things I think we should be genuinely uncertain as to what will succeed but I would say I'm cautiously optimistic Tyler uh there's one's one thing we noticed frequently inside of as representatives of the crypto industries that uh people outside of the crypto industry have a really hard time understanding what crypto is all about uh and but but you seem to be uh you seem to not not exhibit that like people that are inside of one institution whether they're an economist or they're in government or they're in banking they don't really seem to get crypto but the more that people span many walks of life and and are skilled on many different uh areas of knowledge seem to get crypto a little bit more and that's kind of how I place you why do you think crypto's so confusing to people on the outside well I'm not sure anyone gets crypto there are plenty of people on the inside who get some part of it but if you think of crypto as fatalik does as a new kind of computer more fundamentally than being any sort of money or being a new way of programming contracts it's one of the few truly new ideas in in many decades so you could say well Einstein that was like a very new idea that as you approach the speed of light your mass becomes Infinity that's insane right does anyone understand that today so crypto isn't that weird but it's deeply weird it's counter-intuitive it's perhaps misleading to call it cryptocurrency you know it's not necessarily a money and we still don't know which are the use cases that really will succeed you say deeply weird like it's a good thing are things that are deeply weird good some are very good and some are very bad uh I think with crypto for instance is there the potential to take remittances and rather have the fees be often as high as seven percent make those fees one or two percent that quite possibly will happen that will help poor people around the world to a great extent are we convinced it will happen no is there another scenario where simply competition from crypto makes the current suppliers of remittances lower the fees through competition and we never see crypto have a major role there but it's still been very beneficial absolutely but is there potential for danger in crypto that's true as well you said earlier that you think crypto is underrated at the current moment have you uh is that sort of new would you have said that last year have you said that at other points during your observation of crypto that it's underrated or I have Time have there been times where it's been overrated and if so how well one has to be very careful with the exact dates here when you asked last year but if you take whichever date was the highest say bitcoin price at that point in time I believe crypto is overrated not by everyone but by a significant contingent of people who simply thought it was an almost automatic way to riches and it was going to do everything and revolutionize the nation state that was never a majority opinion but you had a large block of people believing those things which I have never believed in I think having crypto be cheaper is healthier for crypto there's a bunch of things you can do with it that will work but the key event here really is SPF and FTX big headlines a celebrity figure everyone can damn and criticize him and crypto Bears a lot of the blunt of that and now crypto to me clearly is underrated but yes it was overrated when Bitcoin hit its peak price but it was what December of 2021 was that November November of 2022 I think was when 22. sorry yeah like all-time highs yeah so you feel like we're uh much more grounded with the reality of what crypto can do let me ask you this though Tyler there are some critics who say that uh this whole crypto thing that you guys talk so much about and they might acknowledge potential future use cases such as repentances of the type that you said they also say this technology uh and you just uh mentioned that you know weird things can have a capacity for good or bad but this particular one increases the surface area for scammers for fraudsters for people like the sbfs of 2022 maybe this starts to get into your regulatory post but let me ask the more general question are you sure it's worth it is crypto worth it when you have greater surface area for the for the frauds and the scammers and anyone can launch their own coin and send it to the Moon with populist uh use of social media what do you think about this argument well I don't think you can send your own coin to the Moon anymore it was a bad State of Affairs when you could on the issue of scammers I view it this way because of the internet plus AI the supply of scams is now infinitely elastic or it will become so rather quickly especially with AI now crypto is a kind of intermediate step in the amazing proliferation of scams and ability to reach people with mobile devices so you can blame crypto for that but with or without crypto it was headed toward infinitely elastic Supply anyway so I don't think crypto will have made a difference in the ongoing trajectory really so crypto scams obviously are bad but I think you're picking out one thing from the universe it would be as if you said well horse races are there scams related to horse races well I'm sure there are but in the final analysis whether those are there or not you know the final scamming equilibrium will be what it is Tyler you recently wrote an article which is actually how we ended up uh recording this podcast with you today and the article was beware the dangers of crypto regulation where you urge cautious caution on over regulation and I want to read a quote from that article that you've put down with systemic risk currently low perhaps it's better to wait and learn more before moving ahead with regulation I am not arguing by the way for zero regulation of crypto I'm merely saying that A hurried bipartisan move against crypto following a highly visible public event with an identifiable villain SPF of course would be a mistake Tyler can I do just to elaborate and unpack that statement uh what's motivating this uh pause for reflection among Regulators in the crypto industry I don't think The Regulators know yet what they're doing and I give them credit for at some level realizing this they actually haven't passed truly systemic crypto regulation I don't know that there is a way to do it without shutting down good crypto now if you focus on exchanges I do think Regulators can regulate exchanges in a more or less sensible way and could do that now if say FTX had been a legitimate institution and you know had done more in the United States but I myself doubt if exchanges are the future of crypto I think coinbase which is already regulated will end up regulated more we won't treat it exactly like a bank but our Regulators are quite good at imposing restrictions on well-identified third-party institutions and coinbase is one of those and a lot of those institutions want regulation so the environment can be predictable but crypto as a whole how we classify it uh again I don't think there's anyone out there who knows what they're doing at all and the fact that we don't currently know the sustainable use cases of crypto is the flip side of that coin right like are we regulating remittances is it you know online identification is it prediction markets is it web 3.0 whatever your opinion might be I don't have the conceit of knowledge to think that I know and I'm quite sure The Regulators don't know yeah and certainly crypto as a concept as an industry is so incredibly broad that a single Global bill that tried to regulate everything about crypto would probably be miss the mark to your point uh I don't I agree with you that I don't really trust Regulators to understand what they're really getting into do you have any sort of like road map or suggestions for how because people do want to regulate crypto and to some degree we also want good and fair regulation from inside of the crypto industry as well do you have um any thoughts or for a potential roadmap for how we go from where we are now with the lack of current regulation to where we need to go which is having some semblance of good regulation but assuming we're talking about the United States here yes I would say simply wait for now and see which use cases are sustainable there's a chance it's none of them I mean it's not it would not be my bet there's some chance crypto just ceases being a thing and you can forget about the whole problem the better guess is some of the use cases will stick see which those are and then see what are the appropriate bodies of law for regulating those use cases so that to me makes perfect sense I just don't see that we're there yet so uh one one take or one reply to you Tyler and this might be say you said um regulars can't regulate crypto without regulating out good use cases a reply might be there are no good use cases Tyler we could just eliminate crypto and nothing of value will have been lost I want to get back to that question but uh read a quote from your article uh where you say yet a primary use case for cryptos to get Capital out of China Russia Venezuela and other financially repressive countries that is one reason for the US to support rather than to undercut the current crypto ecosystem this starts to make a case almost of like a a western liberalism sort of democratic free case for why the U.S should be supportive of crypto um can you talk about that what about the lawmaker who says uh look Tyler there's actually no good coming from crypto when you say good use cases I haven't seen them yet uh what's your reply to that there are tyrannical governments all over the world they tried to control their people's Capital movements and how they deploy their wealth and their money crypto is a partial antidote to that I think if it weakens the governments of Venezuela China Russia you can debate exactly who else belongs on that list that's a good thing another example would be Argentina which is not a tyrannical government but it's not a well-run government and for whatever reason people use crypto in addition to US dollars as a hedge against Argentinian inflation that's also a valuable use so those are proven by the market now they're not USA functions so I understand from the perspective of The Regulators there's a nervousness that the main benefits right now are overseas but you want to keep those benefits they're International Security interest I think it's quite possible there will be more tyrannical places in the world five to ten years from now so the notion that you want to either crush this ecosystem or sever it from the United States when the one for sure use it has is in my opinion a net good I think we should let it rip along those Dimensions Tyler it's not clear to me that the the US actually wants to support anti-tyrannical Technologies can you make the case that they do why why would they want to support these things isn't there an authoritarian bent to the U.S and it's your financial policy as well and uh I can understand why it might not want China to take the lead here but is the U.S coming from a place where it can really say we are you know pro-anti authoritarian technology the US the United States government is a big complex entity different parts of it want different things it often in the aggregate acts in a very clumsy way I don't think it is mainly aimed at you know stamping out all of our liberties but sometimes it does that to the extent crypto is a protection against that so much the better uh but there are legitimate concerns about funding terrorists tax evasion black or gray Market transactions the people worried about those issues aren't crazy but as you know at least as well as I do if you simply in a superficial way quote unquote Crackdown on current crypto that will encourage people to move into truly Anonymous forms of crypto that will be harder to control that may happen anyway so if I thought there were a simple regulatory button I could press that would get rid of the bad sides of crypto I would at least think about doing it uh but I don't know that there is it seems to me it would simply speed uh harmful innovation in the crypto space what's your take Tyler on on privacy on chain privacy for example we have seen some U.S action that has to summon the crypto space seemed uh somewhat repressive in the adding a smart contracts this is the tornado cash privacy mixer which is a smart contract on ethereum to the ofax sanctioned list so effectively U.S citizens cannot use on-chain privacy this this tool um on ethereum do you think that privacy is a uh you know an area that that crypto and kind of U.S foreign policy and domestic policy can coexist or do you think privacy on-chain privacy is completely off the table for the US to sort of accomplish its goals how do we balance these things I don't think you can have a tax system and a complete right to financial privacy uh that said you don't want to ban people from innovating with ethereum and other crypto ecosystems do we have a good way now of writing regulations that I know of that will achieve all of those ends I would say no but I think it's unrealistic to expect that simply citing privacy will turn over all rights to people who want to do anything they want to do with crypto one way or another that will be regulated to make sure people pay their taxes uh do I think we're in an ideal place with that now I would say no but I genuinely don't know what we should do Tyler are you saying that uh as crypto people who frequently use ethereum and other blockchains that uh in order for really uh uh a progress with a relationship between a nation states and crypto that uh the individuals are going to have to compromise on our ability to access privacy Tools in crypto for the nation state to really be accepting of this industry it depends on the country in the United States I certainly think that's true I think we are by and large a legitimate government and some of the governments I mentioned earlier are not so I hope the United States is able to continue collecting its taxes I hope we don't have to go too far to maintain that State of Affairs but again I think the technology is evolving so rapidly it's very hard to get a good sound prediction from someone that's still going to be true two or three years from now but what you don't want is for the United States government to decide it needs to regulate everything about your life and somehow try to look into your wallet and every single thing you do and move to Total surveillance and if we're too lacks with crypto the risk actually is we'll get this much bigger overreaction and that I think would be much worse so the fight for some kind of absolute privacy of all crypto that makes me nervous too are we de facto headed towards that more surveillance State though in this in this digital world is is crypto not kind of in your mind a work against that or a counterbalance against that it seems to me Tyler and I'm not sure if you share this opinion but it seems to me with the digitization of everything we're kind of de facto heading in that direction uh anyway because all of this information is is available and because the government or social media for you know for that matter can peer into your uh wallet at any point in time and they seem to be sort of just claiming that as their territory and is their right and there's there's really no counter balance against that what are your thoughts on that statement well there is a big Ally on the side of individuals you could call it a counterbalance and that's what I would describe as indifference most of the rest of the world maybe all of the rest of the world doesn't care and so there's some abstract sense in which your privacy levels are quite low but de facto no one knows what you're doing and that may be the most comfortable equilibrium we can achieve we not everyone has that now but a lot of people have that now I worry that balance will be disturbed and we'll have to make more of these extreme choices where either it's very hard to collect tax revenue or the government in a very ham-fisted way is just controlling and observing literally observing all of your life so we're in this funny intermediate space right now where most people do in fact have a lot of privacy and the violators of their privacy tend to come in you know small village settings and not on the Internet or it's your best friends or your relatives who gossip about you not that you know meta or the CIA discovers your your big secret and puts it on a billboard we've uh moved forward in this conversation to talk about like the long-term collisions between what crypto promises which is things like privacy and what the nation states wants which is to collect taxes but I want to actually kind of roll back to one of the main points that you're making in your article that you wrote which is to not have this uh gut spinal reflex to regulate crypto as a result of FTX and one of the examples you used was Enron so Tyler could you walk us through some of the similarities you see between FTX and Enron and what lessons can we really pull out between these two events there was a big Enron scandal or roughly 20 years ago the firm collapsed it was based on a certain amount of fraud it was worth zero many people lost a lot of money there was a trial people went to jail it was decided that U.S corporate governance is not regulated tightly enough so we passed something bipartisan the sarbanes-oxley ACT which made it much harder for companies to be publicly traded because the disclosure requirements in the bureaucratic and legal requirements were much tougher and that set off a 20-year period where in essence we have many fewer publicly listed companies Equity markets are thinner and less liquid and if you're you know the proverbial little guy it's harder to get in on the big money in the early years those returns are reaped by Venture capitalists some amount of the rise in income inequality actually stems from the sarbanes-oxley ACT you have Venture Capital firms getting returns that otherwise through public markets might have gone to some degree to ordinary investors so that was just a big mistake it passed by some you know very strong vote both parties everyone rah-rah we got to do this there were villains news stories when America acts in that impulsive bipartisan kind of way I get very nervous and there's a chance we'll do that right now with the new villains being SBF and you know the FTX collapse and so your fear is that we have in the our our lawmakers and Regulators have this just like gut overreaction that does imposes some similar regulation that uh limits the expression of crypto moving forward which uh I really want to drill Point uh drill home it's that would be bad but also that would be critical as it relates to crypto because we need our networks to be decentralized that's we like we love that word in the crypto space and when you tell me that the net effects of this uh sarbanes Oaks oaksley uh regulation was uh the funneling of capital through the hands of VCS and not the public uh to me that represents a failure case for this entire crypto experiment is that is that where do you share these concerns uh yes I just see in American history uh we often blunder and react too quickly before we thought through the secondary consequences of what we're doing there's one big news story We address the problem in that news story so in the case of FTX it's an exchange taking your money and defrauding you that sounds like a perfectly reasonable thing to regulate against and it is but if you do that and you do 20 other things that squash good crypto or crypto innovation in fact you've made a big mistake now we're now in a situation where through the lame duck session of Congress we have divided government it's not even entirely clear where the two parties will fall long term with respect to crypto regulation uh but the chance of something being done immediately seem a bit lower than say even a month ago so Tyler I just want to double click on the comment about sarbanes-oxley right it's because you said some amount of the wealth inequality in America right now is actually due to sarbanes-oxley which was legislation passed to stop the next Enron right it was for all intents and purposes supposed to be a pro-public kind of legislation can you just walk people through the link between that and wealth inequality if I were to try to explain that I might talk a little bit about accredited investor laws uh for instance or I might talk you know I know you mentioned it but the kind of the the the lack of um companies going public until much later in their life cycle in their higher valuations so all of the returns uh going to private investors who are already wealthy multi-millionaires to begin with can you just talk about this in a little detail because I don't know that that is it happened in the 2000s right I don't know it's necessarily clear to folks in crypto what actually happened what you're talking about with respect to wealth inequality and sarbanes-oxley and that that legislation well for much of the last 20 years or part of the last 20 years we had this tremendous run-up in equity values some who some of it was driven by tech companies doing very well some of it was driven by lower real interest rates but if you were holding those companies both in Tech and just more generally you had some pretty phenomenal rates of return during a lot of those years now that was not anticipated when we passed sarbanes-oxley it was simply thought this would reign in fraud but it imposed a lot more accounting requirements on publicly traded companies and the result was you had many fewer of those companies uh the valuation still went up a great deal but most individuals did not have the opportunity to buy into those companies at their earlier stages and so Tyler um this also has to do with kind of a credit investor laws as well because public non-public companies um you know their their Securities laws around purchasing equity in a non-public company and in particular there's a certain kind of threshold of income that an individual or a couple needs to make or a certain amount of assets that they need to hold I think the number is something like one million dollars or something in in net assets that they have to hold in order to invest in these in these private assets and that's why they can't buy them before the assets hit the stock market and go public what do you think of these sorts of accredited investor laws some people have talked about maybe making them education based rather than income based or rather than uh you know net worth based do you think it's a fair system that we have in place in the United States that's all absolutely correct I think those are terrible laws and we shouldn't have them there's plenty of ways you can waste your money do you think lower income or lower education people have no way of wasting their money right now obviously that's untrue I mean one such way is the most dubious of crypto assets what about sports betting what about going to Las Vegas and so on and so on and so on to the notion that oh my goodness we can't let these individuals invest in an early stage tech company that's too dangerous that's one of the better ways they can take risk so I think there should be no such laws Tyler why do we still have these laws in the books like I mean some some people would say it's it's because they're wealthy and they want to stay in power I'm not sure if it's if it's that or something else I think in general conspiracy in our world is overrated and bureaucratic inertia is underrated it's very hard to get rid of laws and regulations on the books there's a lot of steps people have all sorts of misgivings we have divided government often there's some amount of polarization things move slowly in government the people who would benefit don't understand all these mechanisms to add all that up the thing just doesn't happen I don't think it's a conspiracy okay so that answers my question but I'll ask it anyways is between Ryan my co-host and I the conspiracy hat probably if it's a little bit better on my head than his uh so you're saying that the notion that accredited investor laws are uh an uh a secret way to protect the wealthy and and keep the poor poor you're saying that that whole take is overrated well I think that has turned out to be the case but I don't feel there's been a conspiracy to put them in place for that reason okay uh in your in your article uh you wrote a line that I really really liked and I'll read it here it's hard to imagine Satoshi Nakamoto or vitalik buterin at Goldman Sachs and I think that's a pretty easy thing for all the listeners to him to to imagine or not be able to imagine what message do you have to regulators and lawmakers about the risk to reward of crypto regulation as it relates to innovation you don't want to make your crypto firms more like Goldman Sachs and nothing against Goldman you know I'm an admirer of certain things they do I have zero against them they are the financial establishment someone is going to be if it's them well okay but at the same time you need crypto innovators to be nimble low cost willing to think outside the box Dynamic not concerned about cannibalizing their previous Revenue models that worked for them you know probably not regulated by the FED in the FDIC and that's not Goldman so you need something different Goldman is not going to drive this kind of change that's okay not a complaint but in understanding you need part of your sector to be much more Dynamic and freewheeling it's part of a part of that answer we've definitely noticed that the crypto uh movement attracts younger Generations much more so than older generations and it's pretty obvious why that's true uh people that were born with the internet just understand crypto a little bit better and so when you tell me that uh when you say that we don't want our new crypto institutions to look like Goldman uh this seems to be of a similar vein as just a movement an industry that uh resonates with younger people much more than it does older people and I'll be cognizant of the fact that our Regulators tend to be of the older of the older Generations uh and so is this a fair perspective to take that The Regulators probably might be overbearing on crypto because they are of an older generation who doesn't understand it as well as younger Generations I believe that is true if you look at many Innovations take something simple like the automobile in its early years and really for quite a while automobiles were very dangerous airplanes were very dangerous if you had our current regulatory apparatus and applied them to Automobiles and airplanes I'm not sure they ever would have succeeded oh that's it's too risky you know have you passed all of these tests all these regulations and that's insane right at some point you have to wake up pinch yourself and say hey wait in the early stages of change there are in fact a lot of costs a lot of risks you know we do get through it and uh fortunately when Automobiles and airplanes came around we didn't have as much regulation as we do today Tyler do you um part of what I'm curious about on this question is um I mean do you really what's at stake for the US here when you talk about Innovation and uh losing someone like a vitalik buterin um you know and kind of uh the U.S the jurisdiction of the the U.S um is it even possible for regulators and lawmakers to kind of Choke crypto out or at least uh um damage its potential or maybe damage its potential for being located in the United States what is actually the threat here some crypto people would say it doesn't matter what the US says or does about crypto crypto will continue to exist one block at a time they don't have jurisdiction over this decentralized technology what's your take on that I don't think the U.S can choke off crypto globally no matter what it does but look the U.S is the world's Financial Center along with London you know parts of China formerly Hong Kong tiny bit Singapore and you want your world's Financial Center in some way to integrate with what might be a significant innovation so the U.S could defect or drive enough crypto out of the United States so that doesn't happen it's not that it all can be banned but if you make it such that very wealthy individuals feel they're taking a significant risk if only reputationally by dealing with crypto we could eradicate the U.S as a place where crypto Innovation happens and is adopted and integrated into other things that go on that our Regulators could do globally no how did we avoid doing that with the internet Tyler I think I I don't remember I was I was a kid in the 90s but um it seems to me that this is a transformational technology in some ways similar to aspects of the internet and yet the US was very quick to adopt the internet why hasn't that story played out with with uh crypto some of the internet story is that things developed so quickly The Regulators couldn't keep up but some of it was that we had a series of telecommunications deregulations acts that were genuinely wise and well thought out in the 1990s and you know liability of people who put up sites on the Internet is limited in the proper way we just made a bunch of good decisions and right now the EU is making some bad decisions on AI the U.S doesn't show signs of making those bad decisions so we still can get it right uh but there's no guarantee and one reason AI has been lucky so far is there's no like AI demon in the news but now with SBF you have a kind of crypto demon even though a scandal was not at all unique to crypto it was just misallocating funds which can happen in all you know all sorts of different sectors you can do it in a life insurance company so uh that's why we have a bigger risk with crypto right now another thesis is that in the 90s our governments were more competent do you buy that uh some parts of our governments were more competent I wouldn't say they all were but yes people at the same time Regulators might say people are looking for us uh to help them in situations like SBF in fact they're blaming us for the events of SBF and so if you're Council Tyler I'm coming from a regulator's position is that we shouldn't do anything more what about the public who's asking us to do more to protect us from the sbfs what their they want some blood right who who is at fault uh for the FTX Fiasco actually um how do you respond to something like that when the public is the one actually in some cases seeking Regulators to step in and help them well I think you have to blame the governing structure at FTX above all uh public wants all kinds of things right we shouldn't always do with the public wants it's not that I have no sympathy for those who lost money but it's remarkable to me how few SOB stories have come out the widows and the orphans who put their life savings and FTX and now they're in the breadline you haven't seen much of that so you know probably a fair amount of it was pretty wealthy people and if in fact you put a lot of money in a non-us regulated exchange that deliberately located in the Bahamas I don't want to say it's your fault but to me it sounds a bit like saying well you lost a lot of money betting on NBA games like a lot of the time you win a lot of the time you don't win and if you're putting money in a crypto Exchange in the Bahamas even without fraud you should be prepared to lose that money so again if you want to worry about financial victims that's very far from where I would want to start uh you you end the article with this statement it would be nice if there was a simple way to give more regulatory Clarity to the crypto Market as many crypto participants themselves desire but without further Market Evolution there isn't for now the best option is to tie our hands to the Mast and hang on tie our hands to the Mast and hang on that's what I feel like I'm doing every day with crypto uh and Tyler I guess my question to you is um do you actually think this industry can self-regulate is that a pipe dream does that does self-regulation ever actually work I don't know if I would call it an industry uh it's something weirder than that I don't think complete self-regulation uh in the long run is enough but again I think until one knows which are these sustainable use cases you literally don't know what to do so let's let people experiment more and sit tight and wait that is somewhat underrated and it's a psychologically difficult thing to do you know like something must be done this is something therefore it must be done but often it's better to wait and I feel right now we're in that situation do I think we should wait forever no I think there will come a point where the demands of legitimate institutions for regulatory Clarity for what they're doing which is already working will be more important than keeping it completely unregulated but I don't see that we're close to that point today so your basic message is just hands off till we know what this thing is yes uniswap is the largest on-chain Marketplace for self-custody digital assets uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange but you know this because you've been listening to bankless but did you know that the uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat on-ramp now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in defy inside of uniswap not only that but polygon arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate but that's just D5 uniswap is also an nft aggregator letting you find more listings for the best prices across the nft world with uniswap you can sweep floors on multiple nfts and unisop's Universal router will optimize your gas fees for you uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across ethereum and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app.uniswap.org today to buy sell or swap tokens and nfts arbitrim1 is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web 3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on arbitrum 1 producing flourishing D5 and nft ecosystems with a recent addition of arbitrum Nova gaming and social dapps like Reddit are also now calling Arboretum home both arbitrim1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully evm compatible on arbitrum both Builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees with arboretum's recent migration to option Nitro it's also now 10 times faster than before visit arbitrim.io where you can join the community dive into the developer docs Bridge your assets and start building your first app with arbitrum experience web 3 development the way it was meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free we're in this three-way standoff between the crypto industry the cftc and the SEC where the SE PC is going after people that they are have deemed to issue Securities but then the crypto industry raises the flag and being like well you guys haven't even helped us Define where security is and more or less similar relationships are coming between the crypto industry and the cftc where the cftc recently went after uh a Dao to charge them with commodities fraud uh and and then uh in the middle you have the crypto industry and uh what Ryan's saying and the question I have for you is uh like is self-regulation even possible is the concept of self-regulation where we say cftc SEC pause we'll figure this out we got this is self-regulation is that too hopeful of us for uh aspirations for the crypto industry I think it's too hopeful but let's put aside crypto for the moment I know this is a crypto podcast but a number of other Innovations are coming and you can disagree what they'll be you know it may or may not be Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse but there will be all kinds of other new transactions on their way maybe between AIS doesn't have might be with crypto doesn't have to be and we will need over time a whole new set of regulations for things other than crypto it's not just a crypto issue but we don't know what in the metaverse will work or what not or what in virtual reality or like how AIS might trade you know GPU space with each other so I don't think it's even primarily a crypto issue crypto could be a like only modestly sized part of this elephant eventually whether we like it or not it will end up being regulated you want it done in a clear way that's not too terrible I think it's a mistake to hold out hope for all this staying unregulated forever but I don't think it's just about figuring out the one thing crypto it's about figuring out how is the Internet revolutionizing Finance more generally and it will be I think a pretty long and significant story Tyler we are pretty uh laser focused on crypto at times can you update us on like what are Regulators thinking what are some of the issues at play for AI for example I mean in RR systems of of governance at the nation-state level actually able to keep up with the pace of innovation is where you're making the case that they're not able to keep up with the pace of innovation crypto therefore they shouldn't touch it is basically AI going through the same things what are absolutely it Stakes there and that is arguably harder to understand than a lot of crypto and it might move more rapidly especially once it's teaching itself it has in some ways much more Dynamic potential than crypto and the notion you hear like oh we pass a law to make the algorithm transparent for most AI That's absurd it's not even a well-defined concept what it means to make the algorithm transparent or transparent to whom or what are you hoping to accomplish that somehow you get sent a big zip file and you stare at it and then you feel you know how like the boss the man is screwing you over it's just it's incoherent so again I think the problem goes well beyond crypto you're the kind of carrier of the message like oops like there are new pieces of this world that don't fit with the old pieces that's the fundamental thing going on it's easier to see with crypto you see it because you're focused on crypto but again I think it it will be if anything more of an AI issue possibly a metaverse issue though I'm skeptical on the metaverse than crypto Tyler I'm trying to imagine you know how AI would have its SPF moment is this some kind of like Rogue AI creating deep fakes and some technology that the government says Nope you know this is too dangerous for the population to hold like do you have any scenarios here you know possibly that will happen but keep in mind what you need for these moments is an identifiable villain not just bad things happening when there's no villain it gets processed very differently so whatever bad things AI might end up doing which of those will be connected to a villain I don't really have a prediction but I would say until there's a villain the stories will resonate in a bit of a flatter manner with the public that really needs to be a human being is the village it has to be a human being in my opinion well if you have this one evil person who like buys up you know an AI company and he has a Sinister look and some bad thing happens like then you're then you're approaching those moments it has to feel like a movie so we can all relate to it in my opinion yes yeah and the FTX scenario was perfect for that right there's a clearer villain well the movies are already in progress there Tyler we've got documentaries they're having to rewrite the script that's right we definitely see in the crypto industry uh people who are in crypto tend to be futurists we like to explore the frontiers of things be it be it crypto or maybe III so there's a lot of AI chatter around the the crypto communities these days and my mind goes back to Kathy Woods uh fundamental thesis at ARC invest is that the future is actually closer than it would appear uh and really all all her thesis is is like things like AI biochemical engineering blockchain like battery lithium battery technology all of that source of innovation is much more closer and implying that um the future is actually much more closer than it may appear so I want to ask Tyler I want to get your take on that do you think do you think the future is closer than it may appear absolutely another example would be embryo selection if you just told people what was going on and asked them well do we need to regulate this you'd get a lot of knee-jerk yeses like oh people can just pick but when you actually think about how are you going to regulate embryo selection it's a daunting Prospect most Regulators don't understand it uh it's here already and expanding very rapidly I I personally don't know what we should or should not do with embryo selection I think about it a lot I don't have a well-formulated view but I know it's not going to be easy well that sounds like how crypto regulation sounds to crypto people where if you tell me that Congress is going to regulate crypto I would get really scared because I'm because exactly what you said I don't really trust that they fully understand what they're they're what they're getting into if you're telling me that that is also true for embryo selection I'm gonna guess it's also true for AI uh I'm guessing it's gonna be other true for True for other uh technologies that are on the frontier of of progress uh it sounds to me that there's many many different sectors of technology these days that are accelerating far beyond our government leaders to be able to get a wrap on things uh how how is this going to play out if they can't catch up well we need some kind of big regulatory rethink the notion that we take all these new things and others we haven't mentioned and fit them into the current boxes I just don't see how that's going to work oh embryo selection is that a security or like no that's the wrong question you have new stuff in the world and regulation is very slow to change and uh it's the mistake is to just think you can take the categories and institutions you have I don't think that's going to be feasible I think this kind of brings me back to the original question of is human self-regulation even possible like because it sounds like to me we're going to be going into that future where we have to attempt to self-regulate our own Industries because we're the only ones who are actually informed on this matter it will happen no matter what you and I say to each other but you know as outside observers I don't think we should expect at all to go so well again early years of cars people crashed them like crazy died you'd be driving in the road the road there'd be some big pothole no one regulated that either plane deaths in 1950 were scary High you know don't think this is just a walk in the park Tyler and you've called yourself a crypto hopeful and I think uh you've shown that in this episode the very beginning you think crypto is underrated you're also an economist this has puzzled me for a while why do you think Tyler more economists aren't interested in crypto here's what here's what I see something that's a completely open source transparent uh economic system uh much more transparent than you know the central bank or central banks around the world for instance why aren't more economists looking at this stuff I think it reflects an intellectual fouling of my profession that you do well by specializing in known methods that can be readily evaluated by your peers and thereby you get promoted and you work through established channels most of academic Life Works that way and crypto is a new thing like who referees your paper how do we tell if you're right or not it's too real world it's a thing for doers more than theorists There's an actual real world past ultimately even if it's delayed and that doesn't attract academics who by their nature are risk averse or grumpy or over specialized maybe you don't always have a lot of experience so it's sad you know I apologize for my profession at the same time I mean I think that if you paint your profession with a broader brush maybe there are some economists on the frontier I mean some like vitalik who you mentioned earlier is he an economist and at some level he's designing an economic system isn't he in this ethereum project so what is he what are some of the ethereum researchers if not some branch of economist well if it were up to me I would give italic a Nobel Prize on economics oh I don't think he's going to win one at least not anytime soon uh he's written papers on economics that are not crypto per se and they're very very good so I absolutely think of italic as an economist but I don't try to win that war of semantics it seems at this point not worth it can I ask you just a question about vitalik since he's uh he's been on the show many times and he's been on your show it sounds like uh you know you're part of the mutual admiration Club of italic why do you think he's not more widely known I sometimes I'm mystified that um he is kind of just in this Niche within crypto and so few people know about him he's not a household name yet do you have any thoughts on that well first I thought he was more widely known I hear reports that when he walks down the street in different countries he's recognized very frequently how many people are economists for that matter can say that right not many if any but I'll say this when vitalik writes he does not make concessions to his audience he's writing for vitalik which I think is how it should be I give him an A plus for that and most people and I include PhD economists they just can't read it hmm Tyler um one thing that we've seen at play Within crypto in 2022 is this a force of of corruption this corrupting Force called greed uh at play in crypto and I think it's uh shaped a lot of the outcomes in in 2022 is there anything the free market can do to thwart the problem of greed and the corrupting power that it has uh or do we have to always depend on regulators and those with bigger sticks to do this sort of thing I'm not sure I would pinpoint greed as the problem people are self-interested they want to earn more money that encourages both good and bad activities there's plenty markets or for that matter governments can do to educate people about crypto I'd like to see more of that on all fronts I think government of Singapore has in fact done a bit of that we could do much more and that would to some extent lower the quantity of fraud I'm not sure how much it may not be a major Improvement but it would help a bit Tyler I believe you're familiar with this game that we would like to end this podcast with it's called overrated or underrated we got a list of things we want to get your opinion on whether it's overrated or underrated you want to play it's an underrated game so let's go that's great uh all right starting with number one uh AI overrated underrated it's still underrated it's striking to me I was at a Washington DC dinner party last week and most of the people there did not know what chat GPT was one of them had never heard of it a bunch of the others had heard of it but didn't know what it was so I think it's a major development AI is still significantly underrated how about the problem of inflation overrated or underlay underrated well we're doing this Chad I think it's January 9th the last two monthly reports on U.S inflation have come in at very low levels ideally you'd like to see three months of that in a row not just two but my guess is we're going to have a reasonably soft landing and with a huge lag team transitory will turn out to have been correct so the problem of inflation at the moment is maybe a slightly bit overrated interesting interesting all right uh overrated underrated the United States of America oh underrated I mean so many parts of the world feel they have to hate on it Americans themselves have this self-loathing they think we're on the verge of fascism or no democratic government they read all these pieces and periodicals I won't name but they're the famous ones all the bad news gets reported I think our system of government's in pretty good shape and we have incredible Talent and I'm super excited to see the next few decades I think we're going to do amazing things same question for China China overrated or underrated because of pandemic I haven't been there in four years and I feel very out of touch with it and with China you can't just read media to figure out what's going on um I've actually turned a lot more optimistic about China in the last few weeks keeping in mind this is January 9th so the speed at which they dropped zero covet policy has made me more bullish on China a few months ago I would have said China overrated but now I'm inclined to think China underrated social media Twitter Facebook Instagram oh they're great I mean people think they're terrible I don't think they're good for 12 to 14 year old girls that's bad I don't know what to do about that I think we should change social norms so that is less bad but for most people they're fun and incredible for Learning and they spread science and help collaboration and inform people about the world so I think they're way way underrated all of them about classically liberal values of rated or underrated well I'd want you to name the values uh but most values are underrated right why are most values underrated yeah there are a lot of people who are not very moral so those people at the very least are underrating the values the people who are moral presumably are of it you know rating them more or less correctly a net that makes them underrated about a follow-up um our SPF was a friend SPF was a fan of effective altruism and that's taking a hit recently effective altruism overrated or underrated it's become greatly underrated again because there's SPF this demon it's a set of mostly good ideas that try to convince people to give to charity more effectively I'm not like an EA person with the big capital letters but I think it's been a healthy development and it's very impressive how much young Talent it attracted so right now it's significantly underrated podcasts overrated underrated there's still a lot of room to capture mind space from people with podcasts I'm amazed more of it doesn't happen it stuns me how much people like listen to these things and pay attention it's like what's this uh so I'd say way underrated how about the problem of wealth inequality uh we could talk about in America and then talk about in the world well the problem of wealth inequality has diminished radically in the last year and a half a lot of great fortunes Zuckerberg musk they're really worth much much less than they had been so wealth inequality has gone down I don't see that that's helped anyone I think we'd be better off if they still had the many more billions and would give it to charity or do whatever so wealth inequality is way down and I I feel sad about that universities undergraduate education colleges overrated or underrated there's a lot of different stuff in there the U.S system is still the best in the world it's way too bureaucratized it's driving out some Talent it's not Dynamic enough a lot of the old formulas are no longer working I'm not sure that's news though so maybe it's at the moment properly rated um this has been great Tyler thanks so much I um I had a note for something you said earlier in this episode that I wanted to get back on maybe this will be kind of a our close that question but wanted to get your explanation of this in a bit more detail um you said earlier in our conversation that you don't think crypto is going to revolutionize the nation state maybe replace the nation-state so um I don't know if you're familiar with uh Balaji it's a nice idea podcast with him yes I don't agree with any of that okay tell me about this elections are looking much weaker now than when he made them okay so let's let's get into this this idea of the network stake state state the obligian network state do you think that's overrated or underrated and then just extrapolate you know tell us why you completely disagree with uh with uh Balaji it sounds like you think it's overrated Maybe look nation states can get things done they're big they have weapons I look at the borrowing rates on government bonds which for legitimate governments are quite low and I think these are institutions with a future so am I bullish on the EU on France on Canada like of course do I think some weird whatever is going to replace them I mean in some very very long term but basically no I don't I mean those are the institutions that have worked and I think we should all realize that and market prices reflect that Tyler last overrated or underrated and then we'll bring this to a close but this is called Bank list okay this podcast so we gotta ask you Banks overrated or underrated well by whom I think we now take them for granted we've stopped villainizing them which was often the case 2008 2009 uh we should think about them more but at the moment I think they're basically properly rated um Tyler this was great thank you so much for joining us it's a pleasure to hear your your
