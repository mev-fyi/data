hi everyone this is d5 dad i want to walk you through the new argent wallet updates which allow you to use token sets in the application so if you open up your wallet click on the little orange button at the bottom center of the screen that says invest then choose robo sets or social token sets i'm going to choose one of the sets here that i commonly buy which is the eth 20-day moving average crossover set please be aware that not all of the sets have been listed yet there are some yield versions of these missing once you choose that just click the orange button by investment and then you can ultimately decide of course how much ether you want to put into this so i'm going to click the orange button and then i'll just put in one eth and then once you click invest that's it you no longer have to pay any sort of transaction fee this should settle within about 30 seconds or so so if we go back to my wallet where it shows my my eath and my die and any other tokens you'd have if you click on the finances tab this is where we're going to ultimately see my my set so remember i've taken ether i've put it into a token set which uh rebalances between ether and in this case usdc and once that transaction settles here it should show up actually we're going to just check one more time over on the tokens tab and there we go cool so now it's settled and i've got my set and we're good to go so let's go ahead and sell the set back now just to sort of prove how easy this is so i'm gonna click sell and we put one ether into this we received about half of a token set because remember the token set has its own value that's attributed to however much ether or usdc it's accumulated and now that i've done that we should see the set sell out of ether and there we go i am back to ether now so that's it that's as simple as it is and hope you find this helpful
