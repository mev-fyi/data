if you can laugh about this market crash you know you're in like a good spot mentally and you're not overexposed and all that kind of stuff and this current crash i wasn't laughing [Music] hello good morning gmgm welcome back everyone to overpriced jpegs i'm carly riley and it is time for another segment of moment of zenika with zenica33 thank you zenika as always for being here thanks for having me it's it's always good and it's funny i feel like i i've been calling these a segment but if we're being honest we're this is about to just be the episode this is now a moment of zenika episode yeah exactly so i i really did think at the start of this uh endeavor that'd be like oh a segment and then i go on and continue to do the rest of my thing but uh that's not that's not that's nice everyone is talking about the metaverse these days and we're all still trying to figure out what it actually is because everyone is looking for how to get exposure to it that is why a metaverse index fund is so important because in such a young market an index can give you broad exposure to all the various players who are building out all these digital worlds that will ultimately become the metaverse and that's why you should check out the metaverse index from the index co-op the metaverse index gives you simple easy and safe one-click exposure to the emerging open metaverse trend the mvi index contains some of the biggest metaverse projects out there including axia infinity decentraland elluvium and more so join thousands of holders who have already trusted nearly 50 million dollars to the mvi index and if you buy 500 of mvi on the dharma app you can receive 50 worth of eth on the polygon network there's a link in the show notes for you to click so you can get started on your journey into the metaverse axiomfinity is a game universe filled with cute fascinating little creatures called axes that players can collect as pets players aim to battle breed collect raise and build kingdoms for their axes there are and will be many varied gaming experiences for axes many of them having players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with coveted resources others will have them complete quests defeat bosses and unlock in-depth storylines there are countless unique axes that players can collect with varying body parts and experiences the axi universe is a player-owned economy where the players can truly own buy sell and trade the resources they earn in the game through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem it's a digital nation where people come together globally with their axes to play earn and live join the axi revolution at axiinfinity.com bankless so okay let's just start as we as we usually do here would love to get your you know macro update micro updates what's happening in the space what's been going on over the last two weeks projects that are succeeding etc etc yeah i mean i think it's clear that the nft market is still very bullish a lot of projects have been pumping we saw a bit of the brakes went on a little bit when eth really tanked and that's what like spooked everyone i think for a few days that we weren't like people weren't sure all of a sudden their investments that you know in their head priced in in usd or fiat just tanked a bunch and i think a lot of people had like big bags and like watching them evaporate in front of their eyes and like panicking like hey should i sell my nfts and just convert east fear before it drops what if it gets down to like 1k or 500 what if this is a massive bear and there's a bit of panic um but then sort of eth kind of stabilized it's been around the 2400 mark for a few days um and that sort of calmed the market i think people are like happy to continue to go ham on nfts it's it's made it uh i mean a low eath price i mean people always say is there a correlation or is the nft market in the the macro a crypto market like is it correlated or is like decoupled and i think it's still somewhat correlated especially when you look at it from the respect of new entrants new participants because by and large they price things in usd um so if someone's been sitting on the sidelines and looking at whatever nft project that was uh relatively like low end say 0.1 0.28 in the past to get in like it was all right 400 500 thousand dollars all of a sudden now it's like two hundred dollars three hundred dollars like oh okay i can justify and afford that so i think people are getting in to more projects um like that and then there's just more money entering the ecosystem and more east entering the ecosystem and it's really pumping everything like blue chips are really having a great time um i bought a yacht club is almost at 100th floor mutants are almost at 20. um punk's had a resurgence cool cats are at almost 15 world of women is it almost 10 it's just like so many projects are pumping and then we've had some new projects come out that are also doing really well i think um azuki is the number one example of you know it's relatively new maybe 10 days old or something and it had a dutch auction which started and ended at one eighth it sold out very very quickly and the floor is now i think it's like eight or something eight eight point four it's like seven and a half when i last checked but yes eight eight point four all right well and i wanna dive into azuki i wanna ask you not to put you in a position to uh make predictions on on crypto when when you're our nft person but you know where do you think the do you have predictions on where the price of eth goes or you know stable up down no idea does it impact you at all like do you ever start taking profits when the when the price of eat starts going down where do you fall on that yeah it um yeah i mean honestly i have no idea if it's going to drop to 500 or go to 5k soon it's so many factors outside of my knowledge um it does affect me so actually i found an interesting tweet that i wrote maybe like six months ago so like it would have been like june last year when eth really quickly crashed from like 4k down to 1800 or 1600 again and at the time i was like tweeting about laughing i was like hey this is like if you can laugh about this market crash you know you're in like a good spot mentally and you're not overexposed and all that kind of stuff and this current crash i wasn't laughing i was like a little bit panicked and spooked and it made me realize i didn't take enough profits when eath was high um and i should have and so i did take some profits when eath was like 2800 and and 3300 2800 and then again at 2400. just because i realized you know if this is a massive bear in east tanks to 400 or something catastrophic like we see a crash similar to the 2017-2018 crash um i'm just not gonna be feeling very good and um yeah i'd rather do that so it affected me in that sense and it sort of made me realize that i should have taken more profits and i i want to like implement some sort of like regular profit-taking system sort of like dollar-cost averaging but out instead of it every month converts um eth to fiat and um yeah there are like tax reasons that i haven't been doing that so much lately but um i think it's yeah i was probably overexposed in that sense but um yeah well and i i think that the the dca in reverse that's a really interesting idea that i actually haven't heard but it makes sense because i think you made this point i think in your discord but you were like you know because it could have gone the other way like i'm regretting now that i didn't take more profits but if eth had pumped to 10k then i would have felt stupid for taking the profits that i did at 3k like there's nobody's going to play this perfectly we nobody can actually realistically predict what's going to happen and so yeah and yet we still beat ourselves up for that so the dca piece if you if you dca on the way out it also removes that sense of i have to be perfect like yeah i dollar cast average in you know i have weekly buys on on various cryptos and and that's what keeps me from going crazy when there are these price fluctuations because i'm like yeah cool i'm hands-off it doesn't matter exactly i'm gonna keep buying and you know you know i'm bullish in the long term and so you know so whatever um that's interesting i mean it's a more manual process on the way out which i think is what makes it what makes it harder yeah you're manually set to sell off things i guess that's the question i have no idea i i would just be a member like in my calendar yeah every every day so then you have to manually go in and do it yeah yeah and that makes it harder because you're actually having to push that button every every week to be like selling something and if it just dropped 10 that day it doesn't feel good um yeah yeah yeah yeah so uh nft is decoupled from crypto i mean i know i hear what you're saying in terms of there we had a little period there where the market seemed spooked but it does seem to be really interesting this one more than other dips pumps whatever that this period of crypto moving does feel like it has been the most has had the least effect on nft trading of any of them do you agree with that yeah i think so and i think it's a sign that the nfc market is sort of maturing more and it's just sort of attracting new and different participants like there are people who are getting into crypto purely through nfts like you know most of last year a lot of the people into nfts were sort of crypto people who were branching out you know maybe they had e they had bitcoin they had old coins and they were seeing nfts and hey let's get involved there obviously there were new participants too but now we're seeing more and more people uh and i think it's it's sort of the thing that a lot of people have been saying coming true which is nfts are what gonna what are going to make crypto go mainstream like people thought it was going to be defy turns out no one aside from the tech and finance people cared about that which kind of makes sense when you think about it um but nfts have art culture music celebrity everything when freaking paris hilton and jimmy fallon are on on the tonight show talking about their apes it's like a lot of people are going to notice um when eminem gets an eight people are going to notice etc uh gwyneth paltrow the latest intro yeah i actually had a friend text me they actually texted me i was like oh no apes are dead and it was just like a headline being like yeah yeah yeah it's like that's it as well yeah that's the top secret goop is when group's in yeah exactly you know you're doomed yeah i think that makes sense and we're going to talk a little later on about that the line always the line goes up video um one of the i don't know if anybody i'll give a quick context here in case people haven't seen it it's like a two-hour very long clearly i guess call it take down of crypto and nfts and i think there's some really valid criticisms in there there's also a lot that is very biased and and invalid and i think the biggest point that he made in that video that i thought was just really kind of stupid was nfts or just a way to get people to buy crypto that was like a map that was a thesis he kind of put out there like his whole thing seemed to be that everything that happens in this space is all just to try and get people to buy more crypto as part of this ponzi scheme to pump up the price of crypto and i'm like that's ridiculous and and your point of we now have people getting into crypto by way of nfts in and of itself i think undermines that argument not to speak of things like flow or dapper like places where people are buying them in fiat right like so there's a lot that you can do to disprove that but i think your point of we're in a phase of the market that's really interesting because people are actually getting into this broader world because of nfts um i think really disproves that that argument um okay let's talk about azuki which is like the project of the week and do you have one did you buy in what's your what's your origin story with learning about azuki yeah uh it's my origin story i let's say a month ago or something someone tagged me on twitter i think it might have been uh zagabond one of the founders of it and i think he said let's do something together through twitter spaces and then like i had never heard of him or the project prior to that and then i probably had like 50 people in my community and just like say whoa you know izuki's reaching out you should do something collab and i was like all right i feel like i'm you know missing something and then i did research and i looked into it and it was really well thought out fleshed out project um so then we we had a twitter spaces together we ran a giveaway for some uh pre-sale access spots in my community zagabond actually ended up joining my 333 club so then like i formed a pretty close bond with the project from that sense um and yeah i thought it was really cool i i bought one on secondary pre-reveal and i minced one from the the mint list and i still have the two and obviously i'm grateful but also feeling infinite regret at not buying more because you know they started between two and three eighth for maybe a week and now they're at close to ten and it looked awesome to me like the project had all the check marks but i guess my thinking was oh i'll just wait for the next bear market and then i'll buy in similar how doodles comparing every project you can't compare the previous cycles and hope the same thing is going to happen i think the market has matured and legitimate projects are much more quickly running up and having their value realized and um yeah so it's interesting it's interesting to hear you mention like oh i'll wait for it to go down i don't know if that's you know i'm feeling that right now where i'm looking at projects that i'm interested in but i'm like oh it's a bull market like i don't want to buy during a bull market and of course it makes me regret that i didn't buy more during the bear market which you know when we were in this bear phase last year i was so aware of it i was like now is the time to buy but it is so hard to get yourself to buy when prices are just going down like it just feels so bad to buy and buy when things are down even though that i know rationally that's the thing to do and like i'm looking at products and i'm like oh but prices are pumping like yeah i shouldn't by now i should wait and tag this project and wait until the next bear market and then buy in even if it's months from now i have like this ever-growing list of projects that i'm like in the bear market i want to buy bye-bye but you're right during the bear market it's like i think many of us agree that sort of most projects are gonna go to zero so my thinking was that oh okay we're in a bear market maybe this is the end for most projects the blue chips are gonna survive they'll be fine but all these projects that have gone from 0.5 1 8 down to in some cases under point one oh maybe they're just not gonna make it and um yeah missed opportunities everywhere totally exactly and it it's hard for the human brain to like conceptualize a different reality than the one it's living in you know so it's just so easy like this is what's going to last forever like this is the new normal right which is why you want to buy when everything's pumping and doing well and you want to not buy whatever things you're doing poorly and of course it's it's an effective strategy for anybody who i apologize if you're getting background noise here and our editors couldn't fix it there's a protest outside my apartment that's been going on for three hours i can't do anything about it we're just powering through here um so okay you said azuki checked all the boxes i actually would love to hear from you why you were initially drawn to it and and i'll i'll say the reason for that is i was totally late to this project i heard about it once it hit like seven eighth you know like i completely missed this um and and i was looking at it you know and then i started deep diving on it and i'm like look this does look super cool the website's slick but i was like would i have been what i have what i've called this out like what i've recognized this for a really good project if i didn't already know that it was doing well and i don't i i'm trying to work on better honing my sort of recognition skills around that um so i would love to hear from you as somebody who did see it earlier on like what what you were like drawn to why you were like yes this has got the ingredients let's [ __ ] roll yeah i mean obviously the art is immediately appealing it's really really well done and clean and the website is great um i guess two things that drew me to it that made it stand out compared to most other projects is they were very explicit about um yes i just put water on my head to fix my yeah explicit about how they um they were building a brand a brand you know not just a pfp project not just a jpeg not just the vision wasn't to release a community a merch drop a comic a game it was a brand which i think the most successful projects are going to be brands and that sort of level of self-realization and just transparency and upfrontness from them saying hey this is what we're doing and building and we want it to be community-centric built not just with the team but you know with the community that is was an important distinction i haven't seen too many projects explicitly come out and say hey we're building a brand and then the team it's like it's a really legit crew of people who have a lot of um like irl experience or like experience working um you know they have the art designer from overwatch the massive game and like um they have people who've had success running businesses and and things like that um just it's a great team it's a great idea it's got great art and it perhaps something that's also helping it it's like got the anime theme which is sort of appealing to the eastern and western sensibilities perhaps which um i think we spoke about last episode so there's this a lot of money entering the space from the asian markets which may be a new catalyst in this current bull run so all of those things combined and then uh just chatting with and listening to zagabond on spaces um as well as hearing how other people spoke of him and the project i think the the consensus was that a lot of people looked up to him respected him um believed in him and his vision and his ability to carry it out uh all of those factors now that i'm uh speaking them through again is making me regret not buying more but um yeah well there were a couple of things that stood out to me infinite regret man uh so but i want to ask one more question before i mention a couple things that i i felt like stood out zagabond do we know his background that was the thing that didn't stand out was i felt like yeah the overwatch artist was highlighted and then they they said hey you know other team members worked for you know x big tech x this but i'm like i'm just taking your word for it like i couldn't find names so i couldn't link in people like is is zagabond's background sort of public or is he sort of semi and on i don't actually know i think he might be semi or none but i don't want to really speak out of turn i i'm showing my ignorance here but um i know that other team members have more of a like background where you can say that um i'm just looking at the web webpage now one of them's formerly a pm at google and just stuff like that where it's it's they have real world experience that you can you can track but um yeah yeah but that was again i saw that but i'm like i'm i he doesn't have a name i can't fact-check you know what i mean like anybody can put up a website and be like i'm a pm at google so i think this is where there is an element i think to this this space and i mean it all is sort of tying back to this the line goes up video but like where you do kind of have to be on the inside or have you know i i think you you met zagabond you talked to him in a twitter spaces and and yes while in theory anybody could have joined that twitter space and heard from him firsthand i don't know i clearly wasn't on twitter that day or whatever happened you know whatever happened that i kind of missed who that person was and then it becomes very hard to try and i mean i was trying to dig and find these folks and it was like when it's more than 10 minutes you know for me to try and figure out who the team is that that puts me off so again in my trying to think back to had i seen this project in its earlier stages would i recognize it for what it was i would have recognized a very talented web page i thought they have something called um their mind maps instead of doing a road map like mind maps and i think it's visually really well done the way they put that together and i think the concept of here's sort of what we stand for and doing that instead of a road map i really like so there's so much that i responded to but i was like fundamentally that not really being able to fact check some of their stories other than the overwatch guy i'm like i don't know that would have made me nervous in those those earlier days um but i will say on the positive i thought they did something i guess erc721a they were calling it where they basically made it so that they tweaked the smart contract and made some optimizations there that allowed minting many of them to basically be the same cost as minting one that was really interesting to me i hadn't seen that before i don't know if you have any thoughts on that or or um you know kind of took note of that but i i'm always i always like when i see sort of technical nation of that technical innovation of that yeah we've sort of seen over the last few months um a lot of projects come out with like tweaks to the erc721 standard contract to reduce gas costs um i think the most lizard lab that's another one yeah that's a big one um honestly i mean crypto carbons there's so many that did it and did interesting and new things i think all of it was born out of the fact that gas in october just got absolutely insane and like projects couldn't survive and to lose that lizard labs credit they were doing it before that happened um but people uh projects realize hey we need like no one's going to pay 200 in gas to min 100 nft or whatever it might be so yeah innovation sort of spurred out of that and people kept trying new and different things and a lot of tweaks on the same sort of type of thing and azuki sort of seemed to have packaged it all together nicely added a couple of new things on their own and um yeah it's great uh i know crypto covers did something interesting where normally when you want to sell something on openc you have to pay like uh the first like a gas amount to be able to list things and they sort of bake that into the initial contract so you didn't have to pay that open c fee and things like that like innovations that are just good for the end consumer and save us money which don't really cost anything to anyone um it's good to see and i think hopefully the erc721a standard becomes more common more projects use it and and build upon it this is going to tie me back to a point i want to make about this line goes up video i don't know why this video impacted me so much i guess because i spent two hours of my life watching it so i was like well now i literally could have just finished it as well before you recorded this very fresh in mind and yeah yeah i had to watch it in chunks but i think that that's another piece that frustrated me about it is he was very quick to criticize everything about this space and nfts and crypto and it felt like he was treating the way it is now as as if it's the way it's always going to be so if there are flaws to the systems as they are that somehow you know it means it'll never work and i look at what's happening with some of these optimizations and it doesn't mean gas is solved or that this is like suddenly an accessible world if you don't have a lot of disposable income to get into but we're only going to see more of this stuff right like we're only going to see necessity is another invention there's enough money on the line here we're only going to see more innovating to make it more accessible in my opinion l2s are only going to become more accessible and you know function better with mainnet like all of this stuff is only going to get better that's where i do feel like the we are so early point is so valid like we are so early in the ultimate evolution of this and i've sometimes been uh i don't know critical of the we're so early point because i think people use the we're so early to say all these prices are low and that's not necessarily true like right we're not so early that everything is a is a steal you know there's a lot of projects that are actually probably quite overpriced and will go to nothing and so don't conflate you know we're so early with like everything i'm buying is going to go up eventually as more people enter the space but do think of we're so early as the technical imperfections have a lot of time to be ironed out and so as as there are technical critiques levied at this and i think we'll talk i want to mention some of them that he talks about in this video um you know some of which around like a lot of images are stored on ipfs not actually on the blockchain and you could in theory like just create another smart contract that points to that exact same ipfs right storage unit and things like that um who knows all the ways we can work out some of those kinks as time goes on um okay cool well azuki it is i am now fully priced out of it sad to say yeah but perhaps down the line come on bear market fair market baby i know i uh we'll see uh okay i wanted to maybe call out a couple other projects uh woody's i know is a project that that you're sort of interested in and think has some potential and that caught my attention because john rogers who i had on the show a couple weeks ago former disney exec worked with a ton of big franchise intellectual property he also flagged woody's as a project he's really keeping his eye on i know he sees it as having a lot of potential in terms of you know a series a children's story like that he feels like there's a story there that can be built out of that uh those images and and and what they're doing would love to hear you know what caught your attention about woodies what you're why you like them they've had a they've gone up and down a little bit but they had sort of a pop i think actually after john rogers came on the show and then they went down a little bit and then they popped again a little bit recently but they're still at like point three like they're they're a you know somewhat accessible price point for folks so would love to highlight them if if you had thoughts you wanted to share yeah i i saw them at mint actually i think it was kevin rose tweeted about them as they were going live and um i had just come back from a vacation actually it was like one of the first things i minted i was like hey this looks cool let me meet a bunch of the mint pastors and then i was it was still in that stage of the bull market where you can like mint first research later which can only happen in bull markets no one does that in bear markets but i did that and then as i started researching i was like hey this is really cool like there's a lot of substance the people working on it are great the art looks really clean and uh kid-friendly family-friendly whimsical it's got this whole nature forest element which we hadn't really seen in too many projects and and then as times went on what really continued to hook me is sort of the world building the story building the lore that they've put into the project and in the last couple of weeks that's something that's been more and more front of mind to me the importance of world building i guess it all comes back to crypto covens again i talk about this project so much but what they did was so great in that um they have a tagline they say law not floor which i think that they got from the forgotten ruins wizard cult project but it really is you know focused on building out the world the brand the law the story because that's what's gonna you know we're humans we're we like stories you know we that's what what's that that's what's gonna keep people emotionally attached and involved and want to be part of the journey and create this universe that can down the line have all sorts of avenues for adding finding creating value for holders and the wider community and all that kind of stuff but um yeah it sort of flips a script like a lot of projects launch pfps and then price runs up and then they sort of add the law and the story retroactively whereas i think the projects that are building that from the ground up and then like and not like focusing on hype marketing and aggressive promotion and that kind of stuff um in the long run they're going to be the most successful um and then you have projects that are doing both at the same time obviously but then you have like that's like body box club cool cats which obviously they're doing fine and great so lauren story is what really hooked me for woodies yeah i totally agree and i i i feel like i've actually been talking about this for a while i remember thinking this i don't know if i was saying it publicly you know last year probably in like september october time because you did postboard apes just have that huge run of just like i mean we still are seeing it of course it's just like copying that general model and i remember talking to a writing a friend of mine who's a really talented fantasy writer being like you are what we need in nfts right now we have the artists we have people creating incredible art projects all of these projects are now promising that they're going to create even if it's a game that's still a story like all of these projects are promising something that requires a narrative and requires a world and too few of these teams don't have somebody like that on the team right so they're gonna be shopping for that that's what that's the gap and so i think i have said it on the podcast like if you're a writer if you know writers and like it feels like there is such a you know we're trying to have more project start writing and being story first but there's still such a need for writers and creatives in this space outside of just uh visual artists because that's going to be the backbone of building long-term ip and brands is is that world building that story building um very cool uh well i want this actually gets us into the the sort of cco conversation that i really want to have but i wanted to fly through i just wanted to highlight uh timepieces as doing a drop i know you mentioned zenika you have a couple timepieces but i don't know if you've tr uh tracked sorry i have no idea the latest yeah i i um so i i tried to mint a genesis piece and i for folks who maybe weren't a part of that i mean gas went literally bananas i think they ended up selling for like four years it was like point one eat for for one of these timepieces and then i think they all ended up being like fifteen thousand like eleven thousand dollars to buy or something just absolutely bananas because of the weight gas worked and so i did not end up with one uh and was sort of a blessing because they they kind of crashed uh post-reveal for i don't know reasons i've i have thoughts i think the art was not what people were expecting but um but they have done i think a really impressive job of proving that they are here for the long term that they are building a long-term um nft program and they do these town halls on a very regular basis as uh in their discord keith grossman is clearly very engaged in the space he's i think president of time and um and so what they did for folks who didn't end up getting the genesis pieces but who bid on something they airdropped everyone who bid this like i think they're called cat passes i don't know it's a time cover from like 1986 so i basically have a mint pass for a future time drop um and they also did something that i thought was clever which is you so you got that air dropped and then in order to be able to mint a part of a future collection in like the pre-mint phase you would have that plus a po app that you could only get from attending one of their town halls so i you know it totally works for me i've now attended town halls of theirs so i can get the poep after the fact and so now i'm qualified for this this is their second um time collection they did a drop called long neck woman it was this 12 year old artist it got it got some attention at the time but that wasn't one of their signature collection drops i think so i think this is their second signature drop um what they're doing here that is cool and today i should say today's thursday the 27th this is the first day that registration starts for folks who qualify for um for pre-mint in in this drop and it'll run through february 3rd so whenever you're listening to this you you may still have time to go and register um but basically this drop is going to be it's called slices of time and so the the artwork you'll mint is like multiple time covers sliced together essentially in a particular era and then what's extra is they've commissioned all these artists including uh colin or better known as klon the artist for cool cats of course time and cool cats have this sort of ongoing partnership have drawn uh time covers either reimagining a past year or imagining a future year and you mint this initial slices of time nft and then you can choose whether or not you want to keep that or burn it and get a piece of art from one of these artists they've they've commissioned one of these sort of reimagined time covers there's some big name artists who have done these time covers some of their works sell for a lot a lot of money so of course there's a bet you're making like if you get one of the big name artists suddenly you'll have a really you know expensive nft i think they're doing a really good job as far as like major brands go in terms of getting into this space i've been very impressed with how they've just been consistent and and running things and um so i will be minting one of these uh slices of time yeah nfts and and will kind of make a determination at that point whether i want to burn it for for want to to take my chances on one of these other artists nice that's exciting yeah i yeah i tried that gas war as well i failed i was really that's probably like my biggest gas war failure that i was bummed about not just because i missed out but then i also foamed in and bought them at like three or four eighth on secondary and then they tanked so i'm still holding them and like they're like just a battle wound and a bad memory in my wallet but um yeah yeah i'm also like the reason i bought was because i was so bullish on the project i was like time magazine and they're talking about these being lifetime things they're gonna have irl events and like exclusive access and they're gonna be in the space for a long time and you know they're doing stuff with robotos and is it smiles um i think it might be smiles uh maybe not don't quote me on that and um yeah keith grossman is just like in a bunch of communities talking to people and he's very much in the space so um yeah i'm bullish on them and yeah polygon is ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date with millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defy apps the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defy activity transactions on polygon are quick and cheap allowing users the freedom to achieve their default goals all while being economically anchored to ethereum but polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain the polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions including polygon hermes maiden nightfall and xero all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases if you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation and if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defy you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on polygon unstoppable domains is the number one provider of nft domains with domains ending in crypto dot x or dot nft unstoppable domains that lets you replace your long complex wallet address with a human readable address using unstoppable you can verify the ownership over your nfts log into web3 apps and join tens of thousands of people using them as their twitter usernames with unsolvable domains you can have all of your crypto addresses registered to one single domain so it doesn't matter where crypto payments are coming from or where they're going by registering all of your crypto addresses to your unstoppable domain all of that is taken care of in the back end better yet with unsolvable domains you don't have to worry about gas costs or renewal fees because you own it buy your domain and you can show it off as your new twitter username so you can get your name for as low as five dollars at unstoppabledomains.com my only question before we go to cco is was do you have a price prediction for cool cats pets they come out tomorrow by the time people are listening to this it will be happening already probably i think they're coming out oh i missed that yeah they're delighted by two or three days i think 30th or 31st is now when they're coming out yeah so now like probably sunday or monday okay well what's still what's your price prediction yeah uh so mint price is 0.5 i think people were unhappy about that and i made like i think a tweet meaning the sam uh bankman friedman thing like i will buy all your cool cat pets at 0.75 etc etc uh i think yeah two to three eighth is probably what i think that they'll be going for yeah because cool cat's around 15 at the moment that seems about right to me yeah that's that's exactly what my guess was too do you think they're a good buy at two or three eat would you buy them if you if you weren't gonna be able to mint them which i know you will be able to would you buy two or three uh i'll definitely buy two three i'll be a little more reluctant um but yeah it sounds like yeah i mean the other thing to consider is that ten thousand cool cat owners are getting one for free as well so they may be wanting to there'll be a lot of cell pressure i think especially for holders of cool cats who have held from 0.02 or 0.03 or whatever um and not taking any profits now it's all of a sudden like sort of like with um the kennel club for the dogs yeah when that came out um there's a lot of high price went up and then a lot of people were taking profits and they actually dropped below one eighth for a while and obviously now they're doing great so yeah i'll probably buy around the two eighth mark it also depends on the game and like there's so many interesting elements that are coming out with this whole thing which looks really cool and there's a ton of thought put into it i'm very bullish on it so maybe maybe i'll yeah i'll be buying it to maybe three and definitely yeah i would love to join the cool cats ecosystem again it's so hard for me to pull the trigger honestly above and eath but this would be one i would maybe make an exception for just because i i i am pretty bullish on cool cats and and you know would like to be able to get into that that universe um i was i did last week on the podcast i talked about this a little bit and was doing the price comparison of like kennel club i think you know kind of i think they're at like five eth right now or something which if you compare that to the price of a board ape it's like a it's a actually really tiny you know it's like points yeah it's point seven percent or whatever seven percent i guess the kennel club oh they went oh my god they've gone up in a week god this market is crazy it's so crazy yeah it's up like five thousand dollars since last friday um yeah but as a percentage of mutant apes you know it's about a third of a mutant again i guess higher probably now whatever it is but the the pets obviously have this gamified component they have this quest component they have the the sort of almost tamagotchi feel not you're not trying to keep it alive but you're like you're kind of impacting its life cycle so that adds something to that the kennel club obviously doesn't have um okay let's talk about cco i've talked about this a bit on the podcast i know i don't want to put words in your mouth i would say you are somebody who i admire because you also call attention to cco and you definitely call attention to cco projects and you've talked about flip maps and you talk about mfrs and blip maps flip maps being the the sort of derivative approved derivative project of flip maps um so that i think that comes across as quite being quite bullish on cco which i think you are but i don't want to overstate your bullishness i would just love to get your thoughts on yeah why you're bullish what you like about it and maybe go back and forth on that a little bit because i am too but maybe a little bit more reservedly than yeah i think the beauty of it is just sort of i guess for people who don't know cco is a creative commons license basically where there's no rights reserved for the creator of whatever it is so there's basically no copyright um someone creates a piece of art or work and then anyone can go and do whatever they want with it and historically it's been things like romeo and juliet is a piece of artwork on i work a play by shakespeare and it's in the creative commons now because usually copyrights held for like 50 70 100 years can be extended if people are still alive but eventually it goes out in the public domain and anyone can create whatever they want from it um and now we're seeing some nft projects come out and either launch with being cco from the beginning or after a little while can like say hey all that stuff's now cco which opens it up to anyone out there that wants to create a derivative or expand on the universe and and build on the brand and profit off it and create like you know create a derivative that they can monetize uh they can do it and there's no recourse for the creators no one can sue them there's no if like open c is not going to take him down there's no sketchy areas and i think that that adds so much freedom and unlocks creativity and really um harnesses the true composability nature of the blockchain where it's like you take previous things and build upon it and to me a it's great for creators who want to use the work to create whatever they want and b generally speaking it's going to add value to the originals so i think it's sort of a win there as well if if you create if you have the original let's say if there's an nft of the excalibur sword if you own that there's now been millions of derivatives created and like an entire world and lore and there's movies about it it's a valuable thing because of all these derivatives uh and i think that is sort of an extreme example but let's say we go down the line in a few years a lot of these cco projects i think are going to be very valuable because there's been an entire universe story built upon it and because creators have felt the freedom to be able to build upon this world in a way that they may like no one's building um on top of crypto punks obviously because i mean they have some of the worst copyright restrictions but even bought apes there aren't people who aren't bored ape owners or in the board ecosystem who are really adding value and building on top of it because there's little incentive there sure they can go to an ape owner and ask if they can use their ape and do all that kind of stuff but i think if if it was cco and public domain there would be more stuff built now obviously the trade-off is that when it comes to building a brand uh a lot of the times you want to have more focus and like structure around building it in a certain direction i think cool cats is the example i always give they're very concentrated and concerned about being family friendly child friendly playful cute etc i mean there was a project i was advising on who wanted to collab with cool cats and they reached out and started talking and then cool cats noticed that one of the traits in their project was a gun and they said you know we're not going to associate with any project that has a gun trait the littles is another project which they actually had to change their name to the littles because the original name wasn't something that cool cats wanted to be associated with i don't actually know what the original name was but that's sort of like the extent to which cool cats is protecting their brand and they couldn't do that if if cool cats were cco and public domain because then anyone could create anything and they couldn't say hey no we don't want that that's not in line with our vision so i think there's an argument we made against cco and public domain but to me i think the end goal of everything being public domain is ideal and i can see a situation where um like the best solution for a lot of project is to begin with having rights reserved but then say in five years we're gonna you know we've put the wheels in motion we've laid out what our vision is we have a strong community we've created a body of work and then now we'll release it into the public domain and the community can do whatever they want okay i want to give my devil's advocate push against that not because i disagree with a whole bunch of that i think cco and having these cco projects is fantastic and something we actually absolutely want in the ecosystem but i think beyond even just in some cases wanting to protect a brand against you know if you're cool cats and a gun and other that there's also an extent of sometimes you you want to trust a single or particular team to build out the story world so i'll give you know v friends as an example right like i i bought into that project because i have a tremendous amount of belief in gary vaynerchuk and i think he's sort of a very rare talent and he's been very open about the fact that he's building an animation studio and he's going to create storylines around these characters that are going to make them relevant in his vision on par with disney and mickey mouse and all these characters and i think were that a cco project and anybody could come along and create some alternative story it it it dilutes and it now competes with him creating a very specific set of stories the other example i think i've given before because it came up in the conversation with deadheads which is a project that is is not cco but i think it's doing a really interesting in-between version of rights is um they're like you know what if you owned the next the future r2d2 or you say that with the excalibur sword or these things right well if star wars had been cco from the very beginning and like 800 different storylines had emerged and there was no kind of cohesive you know like and it was up to the community for somebody to create the star wars vision well r2d2 might not matter because it it didn't have that central george lucas unbelievable visionary to make it something absolutely incredible for it to then be relevant and my concern with this is and and board apes isn't cco but you know you could board apes does give you a lot of rights over your individual ape like one ape is in in the future and you know as an astronaut and the other ape is you know under the sea i mean that might all be compatible if it's explorer apes but my point being there could be very incompatible story lines that sort of degrade the the cohesion of like a massive star wars-esque brand and so what i've been talking about and folks who have listened to this show really religiously or you know follow me really religiously i guess are probably sick of hearing me talk about this but is i think it's about being really aware of what you're buying into with any given project right like and what the bet you're making is so like i do think that you'll have things like a blit maps or others where they're big enough they're well known enough they're kind of renowned enough that um you'll have these amazing creatives who will latch onto that project and build something incredible out of it but i think of every project with cco there's a there's kind of a limited amount of like you know completely brilliant gonna create the next star wars people out there and so i don't know i i think that's where having a blend and when we talk about like having a diversified portfolio part of that to me is having a diversified set of sort of rights projects like maybe you want some cco so you're making bets there you're making bets on certain specific teams like a gary vaynerchuk that's that's my perspective on it is that there are also benefits to teams who have a really specific vision you're mentioning that with cool cats going and taking it to its full potential um so there's even a chance for the r2d2 to really emerge i don't know thoughts on that yeah i mean i agree with a lot of that i i think though that with cco you can sort of still have your cake and eat it too like blitmaps i'm not a huge fan of it because it's cco i'm a huge fan of it because it's founded and directed basically by dom hoffman he's a genius he's creating this universe he has a vision for it i'm buying into that and i think he's gonna like just because of cco he it's not like he's saying all right it's easier done now community go do your thing he still has a very strong vision for the brand but if a community member wants to create some offshoot derivative flip maps which i think is brilliant great they have that power and ability and freedom to do so so i think um yeah projects that a cco and just launch and say hey we put some out there now community do your stuff yeah i'm not a huge fan of them they're unlikely to go on and become amazing things the projects that have a strong team vision and a building a brand and universe and story and saying you know if you want to go out and do add to it and it can be whatever you want like you can be you know split maps under the water and in space whatever it's like you know people create fan art for you know fan stories fan fiction for every universe out there um like you can already go and read stories about whatever star wars in the 1960s like whatever cowboy star wars i'm sure there's anything you can imagine people have ideas for and want to create and add to the universe and i think it does just add to that universe and i think if it's sort of uh condoned supported by the team and the the people who first had the idea the end result is just a more expansive fleshed out universe where there is still sort of like this central theme and story that the team who created the project founded it has a vision is building most people are going to rally behind that and say that's you can call it the official storyline or the main storyline and then there's all these arcs that people continue to build off but i mean i i think the blitmap universe is going to be huge enormous this sci-fi fantasy brilliant story because of the team and like it's cco doesn't mean it's not going to have all these elements as well all right i hear that i hear that it is it's a it's and i guess this gets to like you know provenance on the blockchain or whatever right like you can still have that element of like here's the official team's sort of work right and and because to your point there is fan fiction with all of these major franchises right it's just a matter of you know maybe legally persecuted or not essentially right um all right well we'll be very curious tweet at us let us know your thoughts you know i think this is an ongoing debate that's going to be had in this space for a while i i still like the idea of having a variety and i think there's also a an element here which is something i i've been meaning to dive deeper into which is the sort of distinction between copyright and trademark right which is and this is something deadheads is doing i don't know this may be true for blip maps for example where it's like you can go and take this art or take but that doesn't mean you can use the name right for deadheads you can go and take those characters and do what you want with them but you can't call it deadheads you can't say it's still a part so you can still have distinctions like that i think with cco that protects sort of the name of your particular story and lore yeah that's how this works yeah okay that's that makes sense then um okay treasure dow uh you wanna say a couple your impression or thoughts on treasure dao yeah i mean i'm fascinated by it i think it is magical to i mean the native token is called magic it's it's a really cool interesting project uh it was sort of inspired by derived off of loot again another dom speaking of dom hoffman yeah where so it's basically a an ecosystem on the layer 2 arbitrarium um network where they're creating a marketplace and and now this whole d5 universe where yeah it's very gamified d5 plus adding an nft like decentralized marketplace into the mix on a layer two it's got a lot of moving parts and elements and i have not taken the time and i'm probably not smart enough to really understand all of it like it's it's really intricate the white paper is in-depth and detailed 43 pages long i was like i'm going to read it before the episode and then woke up this morning and was like yeah everything i've read about it seems great and all the smartest people i know love it and that's sort of like something that you know i i if i don't have the time to research something but my smart friends say it's it's worth researching and other smart people say it's worth researching and looking into i sometimes just use go on like a take a leap of faith and yeah so i bought into a bunch of it it seems cool um they launched their their game or their their bridge world world a few days ago yeah um and when you bought in did you buy in just to magic the currency or did you buy like there's legions and i forget some of the other there's like there are four nfts did you buy into those as well i did both actually i was in the um the chain runners discord another cco project shout out to them and i was trying to figure it out and i asked them what should i get and someone said that the chad starter pack is two small brains two small bodies land a seed of life and legion genesis and that so that's what i got and i was like all right cool because i was like i can't i didn't have the time to figure it out i was like someone tell me what to buy what do i need what do i need to do yeah and that was it yeah when was this when did you buy in so relatively late i'd say like three weeks ago so yeah i'd been hearing about it for months and i i own loot and you could have staked the loot to get the the magic tokens and again just too many projects not staying on top of them so i missed that but um yeah i got in about three weeks ago the bullish case that i've been hearing or like this vision that i've heard that i i thought was compelling i guess people have been comparing it to like nintendo they're like this is going to be the web through nintendo and and the the argument there is that what nintendo has is obviously massive distribution so other gaming platforms or other games i should say want to launch on nintendo even though nintendo will take you know a 30 cut of anything you you know your game does because nintendo has the distribution and that i guess the argument here is if bridge world sort of fulfills its greatest potential and they and they have this really amazing game and and an ecosystem that is drawing a lot of people in magic then you you will have other games that will pitch treasure dow treasure dow runs this bridge world game right um we'll pitch treasure down al qaeda we'll say okay great you can come sort of be a part of our ecosystem magic has to now be the native currency for your game as well and and the you know but by by treasured out having the distribution because there's enough people within their network it's going to draw other awesome games to it so this sort of like layer zero metaverse where like there's this sort of interoperable gaming world where other games want to come and be on treasure now so that's a very compelling vision i'm like so you know again i'm late late on this but um but it you know eric connor mentioned it in a panel we were both a part of earlier this week and you know for weeks i have been hearing about it and um so interesting i mean magic's not like four dollars which is i think you know high obviously for just a currency but also still accessible if you think this is going to be like web3 nintendo it dipped to i think 97 cents like two or three days ago so what they have what happened was um a lot of people had a ton of magic staked and locked up like vested basically from really early on and it all unlocked i think on the 24th and yeah like people were like is it just gonna get are they gonna dump and is it just gonna like crash the market but it got eaten up really real quick yeah i think there were a lot of people aware that that unlock was happening and so we're holding off buying it until to see what happened with the unlock and then when the price tank all these people who had been waiting to get in yeah yeah yeah pounced i was one of those people and then i just got lazy and didn't actually buy in so oh god infinite regret okay uh five minutes let's just mention oh wait let me i want to say this i want to show your youtube channel launched today it's thursday so if you're listening to this on friday it will be two days old i'm really excited about this and i love as always with your marketing it's like like it's like anti-marketing like when you launched an academy project you were like don't but like like look no exact i don't i'm not promising anything we're gonna have a discord channel and i'll advise you on your projects like that's what this is don't and i love that and it's such a mark of your you know testament to you and your power that like you know we all just still buy your stuff and by the way i'm in your discord and it's great and it's totally worth i think the point to eat that you're you're uh the past now is but but your youtube channel is the same thing you're like there's going to be no like sexy like you know titles or like i'm not going to tell you how to get rich quick or 100x your value it's just like me sitting there talking to project founders yeah so i mean the whole concept is these long-form interviews with project founders and i think because that's something that i have access to and i spend most of my days talking to project founders and i hear about so many interesting projects and in so much more detail than anyone gets looking at them on twitter or even reading their website or white paper so i thought hey you just would be great youtube content and yeah it's going to start there i might do some more general things like guides how to use like gas wars and all that kind of stuff because people always ask me for questions about that but yeah it's very low production value it's me like this with a white wall behind me and them on webcam and just having a conversation basically i'm excited i have not watched the first episode yet but i saw it you know it's doing well lots of great positive youtube comments i opened the tab today so i can remember to watch later but uh you know welcome to the to the youtube game i know you've been in the podcast game for a little while now but uh now you're in the youtube it's exciting okay line goes up i'll set the stage here quickly and then when i get your thoughts i know you did a long tweet thread about this i don't know if this has been really making the rounds a ton in nft circles but i have a lot of normie friends and i feel like every i feel like a ton of them sent this to me so i was sort of very aware of it and i think it's something that among kind of the nft skeptic crowd people who are very aware of nfts but maybe like love to hate them this video was getting a lot of traction um and it basically is two hours and it starts with uh you know hey here's how the 2008 financial crisis worked which is basically we financialized uh mortgage-backed securities by bundling them together and then making them assets that we would sell and that created a bubble and by we i mean wall street people probably know how that worked and then it goes it goes it starts there and then it goes through sort of crypto and nfts and you know kind of circles back around by saying by financializing everything in the economy which is what crypto and nfts are aiming to do in his in his view you're just going to create further and further like bubbles a la what we did with mortgages and it's just going to crash and he's just cynical about every aspect of this and i thought it i thought there were a lot of good points and and because there were a lot of good points that's why i think it's worth engaging honestly with some of the fair criticisms but also rebutting it a little bit uh setting the stage zenica why don't you give your thoughts and reactions to the video yeah so i literally just finished watching it i think um it's very it's if someone who is skeptical about nfts watches it it'll like reaffirm everything that they already thought and basically convince them that they were right i think anyone who's into the nft space is not really going to be convinced by anything of it so i don't really think that the outcome is too it's going to change too much i think he makes good points in the sense that he really does a great job of highlighting all the scams all the fraud all the like the rug pulls and the shady tactics um that happens in the space which is fair there's a lot of that that happens there are a lot of crappy projects 95 99 are going to go to zero and people are going to lose a lot of money and people should be aware of that and understand that it's a high risk environment there's a lot of gambling that takes place and speculation and um it's worth highlighting um but he just neglects to mention anything remotely positive and sort of groups the entire nft space in with all these scams and frauds and ignores the the hard work and the building and creating that people are doing and the the life-changing um careers that many artists have had i sort of in my tweet thread i um so something in the video he does is he goes he joins discord and then he gets a bunch of like scam spam dms we all get them and he starts joining all the discords and like he goes through like a montage saying these are the projects these are the scams and i made an analogy like if you were joining email in the 90s you got so much scam and spam emails if you clicked on every single one you could make an equally compelling oh look email is bad montage doesn't mean email is bad doesn't mean the internet was bad doesn't mean nft is bad i think there are bad actors it's the wild west it's unregulated it is dangerous it is high risk people should be aware and most people should not participate and speculate at the moment um and it is expensive gas yeah here are some of the the big picture uh points that i wanted to to maybe get your reaction to because i think there's some legitimacy to them and i don't really know how it's serving me at all to raise them because i feel like it's i don't i feel like it's only going to make people mad at me but i think it's worth maybe calling out some of this which is i felt like him talking about how the tech is still deeply imperfect i think is fair i think maybe not enough people really understand what's going on under the surface i i mentioned earlier he calls out the fact that a lot of art actually isn't even on chain right it's on ipfs or on aws and so you know it's it's a little bit and this is something that jim mcneil has talked about a lot it's why he loves avastar's for what it is ava stars is fully on chain like there's something there's things about the tech that people don't really fully understand also most artists are not going to make a lot of money there's a lot of artists who maybe see the gold rush here or think there's a gold rush here join quickly you know spend a lot of money on gas to mint this or that and then nothing sells and i think i wish we talked about that more for artists like hey this is not just just because you get in this space suddenly you're going to make a bunch of money on your art you know i wish that were the case but it's it's like any other industry there's networking you know that has to be done and and that gets me to my the final piece which i wanted to get just quick get your reaction to i know you have to go so i appreciate you being successful which are in some ways this is an industry of just new gatekeepers and i think there is this high-minded version of web 3 which you know it's about decentralization it's about community ownership and i think there are there are moments where you see a lot of that but there are also there's a lot of gatekeeping that happens here and it is you know people who got in early to certain big projects end up being in the discord chats that tell them about the new project that's cool to get into and get them on the whitelist spots for that like it is a lot of work i actually think to to fully break into this for for the average person and i think it's worth kind of acknowledging that as people are trying to get themselves into this space and and maybe feel like they're failing or there's something wrong with them because they're not getting rich quick like it's actually not you see a lot of people who are making a lot of money on twitter or on this nap but like a lot of people aren't and it's you know i'm struggling like i look at these projects and i'm overwhelmed by the volume and deciding which one's going to do well or not and i'm in this every day and happen for months and so there's still kind of a gatekeeper element what we're doing and i don't think that goes away like humans create hierarchies that's what we do the problem isn't web 2 technology the problem is sort of like how humans work yeah yeah and i'll say i saw this on a scott galloway is somebody i like and he's sort of skeptical of web3 stuff and he he he had a stat that i i'm sure is a little bit off but i think probably makes sense which is that nine percent of of accounts own eighty percent of nfts and something like two percent of accounts own eighty-five percent of bitcoin like this is still a very concentrated industry and i think it's i love being here like i think it's beautiful i want more people in here i think there's a tremendous amount of wealth transfer that is happening which is why i want women here all people of color here because there's more wealth being transferred in this space or created in this space than in so many other industries so if you're here the odds that you do do well are much higher than if you're another industry but that doesn't mean that there aren't still some of the same flaws and i don't think i don't want people to to feel down or bad when they feel like they're not succeeding immediately so that some of that stuff that i think he called out i'm like that's really valid i think there was a lot that was really good about that yeah um i'm reminded of uh i'm gonna paraphrase a winston churchill quote and say that web three blockchain nfts and crypto it's like the worst system except for every other system yeah barring every other system the capitalism argument capitalism is the worst system you know borrowing all else i think that's where i fall to and i think that's um that was sort of my fundamental takeaway i love your email scam comparison was like every new technology brings with it a whole bunch of [ __ ] right and he calls out the the uh you know environmental impact of nfts and all the stuff and i'm like we should never have had cars and trains then like everything you've done you do as human beings is gonna have drawbacks new technology are gonna have drawbacks i've said this to friends who have maybe been like displeased with oh great web3 just introduces another way to socially signal i already hate being on social media whatever like okay but if you were given a magic wand would you eliminate social media would you say it never been invented like it's really easy to call out all its flaws and there's so many of them but fundamentally do you wish it didn't exist like yeah you know there's always going to be problems this stuff is going to issue you know usher in but but that doesn't mean that we don't keep striving for progress so my takeaway i actually do recommend people i don't know if you have two hours to check it out personally i think yeah it's worth watching at least to understand how others are going to perceive the nft space in crypto space totally totally know thy enemy yeah yeah i don't know that friends keep your enemies close although we shouldn't think of them as enemies
