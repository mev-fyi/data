foreign [Music] ation on the Pod today we got Alan from incointer we are going to be talking about local community currencies on the podcasting pointer has two pilots one going on in Zurich and another one going on in Rwanda in which they're doing community currencies on the order of 200 members in the Zurich pilot and there's a lot of interesting things happening here a actual data about how this stuff is being used uh on civil resistance on the economics on user experience and uh we dive in and pull all of those threads on this episode so I think that I'm really bullish on community currencies I think there's a really a beautiful opportunity for Community currencies to create little pockets of value that are oriented around local values instead of global values that come from Global commodified currencies like the USD or the Euro or Bitcoin um I think that with global currencies you kind of get this race to the bottom of the brain stem of things that everyone in the world likes things like pizza and beer and not everyone in the world likes these things but you they're an example of like a globally commodified thing and so what if we could create local community currencies around local values whatever your local Town values or maybe whatever your local internet Community Values if you index on locality of the meme space instead of physical space so local community currencies I think is a theme that you'll see on the green pill podcast over the next couple quarters and encounter is doing it so uh really really fun episode with with Alan and I think you're going to enjoy it as well without further Ado I give you the encounter team the glow dollar is a news table coin with a very special property as the market cap of glow goes up extreme poverty Goes Down Glow is a dollar backed non-profit stable coin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty glow is basically the same business model as usdc with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stable coin on ethereum on the other but instead of being a for-profit company glow is a non-profit that donates 100 of all yields from the globe Reserve to give directly these basic income program give directly is a charity that gives people money no strings attached to people living in poverty and is a charity that vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past with glow you can reduce poverty just by holding a stable coin glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist at glodollar.org greenpill that's Gro dollar dot org slash green

Opus what's up Alan let's dive into uh in cointer so tell us about uh though the why what how of of how it works yeah so I'm going to is about lowering inequality in the world so big big vision of it um and the way it does this is by issuing a basic income in local community currencies so it's in a way it's kind of a culmination of what I observed in in crypto what was happening that made me think about oh money works and why it tends to accumulate capital on very few people um and how we could do it differently all right so let's dig a little bit deeper um how how does it how does it work and and how does that it change that problem so um if we if we wanna issue a basic income we we want to make sure that two things the the basic income needs to have value real value that people can use um but also we we need to be um sure that each person only gets that income once so that's decible resistance that we that we need and I think the key the key contribution of of encounter is how it solves disciple back and that's by physical concurrent uh key signing meetups so if you if you want that basic income um you need to join a community and it's a local community so I will maybe we can talk later about why it is important that these are local so you need to be at a certain place at a certain time every 10 days currently um in your neighborhood so you never have to go really far but you need to meet a random bunch of people and then you just attest each other's personhood you attest each other's attendance of that key signing Meetup and because all the meetups happen at the same time you cannot attend two meetups so that's that's really leveraging the the physics of each person can only be in one per in one place at one time and that's how we solve disable it got it yeah I know that uh civil attacks are a big topic on this podcast just because one human one vote systems are way more democratic than when Coke and one vote systems and I think that we learned in our Brian Ford episode that there's four ways of creating civil resistance there's uh kyc nation state government uh IDs there's biometric there's web of trust and there's presence based so it seems like you at least have some element of presence based in baby web of trust in there uh web of trust does play a minor role but really it is it is a presence-based protocol why why is it uh also why does it have to do with web of trust as well um so if if you want to join the the community um we always need to make sure that the majority is honest that's just the basic Assumption of our of our protocol the majority can always um bend the rules so we rely on majority is honest and that means we we somehow need to limit how many people can join a new community per cycle of um proof of personhood so per ceremony and that's where we use web of trust or kind of the social graph because we let people invite other people to to join the protocol right it's kind of three step of of a proof of personhood or of cyber resistance yeah other others need that as well yeah so I mean about how many people have been onboarded so far so um so far we have two communities uh one in Zurich one in Kigali Rwanda and in Zurich we have a well right now we have 200 reputables that means 200 people who have attended at least once during the last five Cycles and that's that's kind of the the the constant population that we have now that may seem little um but it's it's just one City and we started in May and as as it can only grow by by one third per per cycle it's just it can really only grow organically because of our trust assumptions exponential over time but yeah well days yeah I mean I think you want to prove it out on a small scale first and only then kind of blow it up to web scale so I'm curious if you could if you could talk about the proof points that you have so far and how are the first ex how's the first population doing um so the the population in Zurich is our Pioneer community and I think it has evolved pretty decently so we had it's especially also in terms of who we could onboard and how people are using it so um we I I would say our our population is not dominated by uh crypto fans so a lot a lot of the people that that participate don't care about crypto at all um but they care about the local identity they care about basic income um and and about the whole story so as I said we started in March and we had a First Acceptance point so what what we issue the basic income we haven't talked about this so far is a currency called Loy um which in Zurich is at par with the Swiss franc but that's just kind of a social agreement with the acceptance points so we started with one acceptance Point that's a popular Cafe close to my office and they they were really fond of the of the vision and they said hey you know what we will accept Lloyd from day one and that's how we started so people got a basic income and then they could go over to the coffee and spend it on coffee so we started with 22 Loi which is 22 Swiss Francs in in buying power this would buy you five coffees or something like that um and then we went on from there so we we had we started with 10 people we called them the bootstrappers doing kind of a uh secure setup a trusted setup of the community and then we onboarded more people uh more and more like one one-third additional uh participants each each time and we had a few technical hiccups in the in the beginning of course um but overall it worked really smoothly paying process was was nice at the cafe pretty soon we had a little uh grocery store with local products that accepted Glory as well now we also have a little pop-up store we have a uh someone who sells his uh honey um uh in in Lloyd we have an artist who sells um his his stuff and I I think one one of the bigger events was was an open air happening in uh Zurich where you could buy drinks boy and where we also distributed vouchers kind of Welcome vouchers to start to start using got it and I mean yeah talking about communities I'm I'm really proud to say we have now a second um Community which started in Kigali they started with a slightly different concept a little bit less formal so they they start with person to person um trades first it only had half kind of constant uh acceptance points but this it is an important milestone for me because I mean bringing more money to Zurich is is kind of not the point of encounter right so it's it's not our vision I mean if if we can you know uh further local um consumption of local Goods in Zurich that's a good thing it's a good thing for the environment as well um but our vision is really to to kind of bring equal opportunity in terms of like yeah Financial inclusion in terms of yeah pure buying power in in the in the communities so having having now a pilot in Kigali is really it's really uh rewarding for us and we're really curious we'll use it there yeah what the impact will be yeah I wonder if you can say more about the pilot like any just any anecdotes that you've heard from the people who are in the pilot you know what are the conditions on the ground and how have they changed just uh just really pinching and zooming on that pilot is really interesting to me because if you do bring this to web scale that's what more people are going to experience yeah yeah absolutely absolutely so yeah I mean we have I I think the interesting insights I mean of course the technical bumps uh can can be fun to tell as well but I think it's it's more interesting to talk about how people perceive it and um you know the first people who got a basic income and went to the coffee and drank their coffee they told me you know somehow I feel bad about drinking this coffee because I feel like that this this Cafe uh just gave me this coffee for free and I told him well it's not for free at all you know they they get money for it and if if we establish a circular economy um that's that's just how they make their turnover and you just have a right in our Community for a basic income that's that's your right as part of that community and but but it's really it's bending people's minds the idea of basic income and that's that's what I really like here uh that we can experiment with basic income without a political process because political processes are so slow I I just don't have the patience for that um right so I I mean it seems like it sort of gives a replicable model that kind of goes around bureaucracy in these local jurisdictions to these communities yes well it's it's I mean you know there there are a lot of challenges but it's challenges of community building Community growth how can you motivate people to attend regularly um how can you convince store acceptance Point stores to to accept that currency that's a lot of work and that's what doesn't scale just like you know if if we want to take this to global scale um I think the pilot can do a lot of good in just showing that it works and that's why we invest a lot of money and effort now in into this pilot to just show that it basically can work um but then we we really need just more communities and and and we need people on the ground that take the initiative and that's why it it might not be kind of the the protocol which has the the steepest curve of of growth um but I if if I may compare it to other proof of personhood approaches I just think it's the it's a very secure approach to cyber resistance because physical presence is just a lot stronger than an uh web of trust or then kind of AI hard hard challenges to solve and and like Biometrics has its other drawbacks with respect to privacy and Yeah well yeah we don't need to yeah but I I hear you and that's that's a whole other episode which should be taken seriously but given that you're not doing much biometrics not at all I'm not going to go into it so I guess like I'm I'm a big believer in in local currencies because I like the idea that we can create local pockets of values around local um local values and I'm not just talking about like Geographic local but like interest based like you know I could have like a keto dowel that just like really values uh that type of diet we could have a public goods Dow that really values public goods and this allows us to create these little safe havens away from US Dollars and Bitcoin which are like just race to the bottom of the brain stem kind of global commodified currencies you know beer insects and and like pizza are like you know the I think like the ultimate embodiment of capitalism values and and so I guess like I'm really a believer in local currencies because I like the idea that we can have these little local currencies with our own GDP that have real value but I guess like one of the things that when I explain local currencies to people they have a question of is like how can a community currency be issued out of nothing quote-unquote and have real value so I don't know I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about the local currency design space there yeah very interesting um so I mean there have been a lot of local currency uh initiatives before us of course and um they usually are initiatives from a community uh that issues their own money but packs it to the to the National currency so that's really the most common way how people do it um but that also means that the local currencies do nothing to lower inequality because you need you need National currency to buy the local currency and then you can kind of show uh local identity by spending the local um uh currency and that gives yeah gives identity gifts kind of a status in your in your community um and that that that does fine so so the experience from others is really that it can further uh locally economy it can further um uh social capital in in the in in the community um but I think it's really the the basic income aspect of it um which which goes into the direction of really lowering equal inequality but your your your point is absolutely uh crucial if we issue a basic income who pays for that for it or or why does it have value because there is no there is no Central Bank that issues Deloitte here in Zurich um so no one backs this currency with uh with gold or with Swiss Francs um but we do back it by social contracts so the acceptance point that we have so it's it's more like a a you well basically in theory there are I guess two approaches you can you can pack your your uh your um currency to a basket of goods for example the baker could say you can always have a loaf of bread for that amount of that currency and then the I don't know the butcher says you you will always get that amount of meat and and so on um and that would give real value to that local currency because you can go to those stores who make a commitment and get something for it so it does have real value this is a rather complicated approach so we first wanted to try to kind of have the Loy at par with uh with with the national currency because we need to explain less Concepts to the community uh and therefore it is really the acceptance points that that maintain this Peg as long as they accept the peg of one lawyers one Swiss franc when they accept the currency that's the real value that the currency will have got it so it seems like there's kind of this virtuous cycle between the social contract and people actually using the currency it almost feels like Network effects to me where the more people use the currency the more people accept it as legitimate then the more people use the currency and it kind of spins from there I don't know if I'm saying back to you exactly in the words what what you said to me but that's kind of how I interpret it is absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah but I mean we should keep in mind that this only works if we if we can establish a circular economy because if our acceptance Point accepts the currency but the currency will always stay there it will just Stack Up and that that is not in the interest uh of of of of the acceptance point because what what we should mention here is um like other local currencies do uh and pointer has built into its money design a concept called The Mirage so the the local currency loses its face value over time and that is an important concept to understand because if so the example and and the the devaluation also continues when the money is at the acceptance point so if you have money in your pocket that loses value over time you want to spend it as quickly as possible because today you can get more for it than tomorrow and that's exactly why local community currencies work it's because they have a yield a higher money velocity so you can do more turn around with the same amount of money but that also means that the acceptance point doesn't want to keep the the Hot Potato in his hands for very long so they want to get rid of it so they should be able to give to pay their suppliers or or maybe their staff uh in in that currency such that the Cur the currency can circulate the hold and just well if I if I may put that side note um we talked about the the the basic income and why um and and who pays for it actually it is this the Mirage which basically pays for the basic income so because we we burn money exponentially in your wallet we burn the money where it is not used and we distribute it to all the humans in this um community so it's in a way it is the demorage that pays for the basic income and by doing so it also makes sure that the money supply will be in proportion to the to the population so it's not kind of an inflationary design that with each basic income that is issued the money supply Will Will just raise forever but because we have the Mirage there will be an equilibrium which is um proportional to the to the to the population and just for listeners who aren't super familiar with demorage what's the simplest way of explaining that it's um so you if today you have 10 Loy in your wallet um deloy has a halfing time of a year so that means if you just do nothing today in your wallet you see a balance of 10 if you wait for a year you will see a balance of five and it will still be five Swiss Francs buying power most likely where it was 10 Swiss Francs buying power a year ago So that's its exponential decay in your wallet got it okay um yeah I think the analogy that I think that I I learned about demaraj with was like rice or basically like where if you have 100 units of rice and you expect that a certain amount of them are going to spoil uh on a weekly basis then you have 99 uh after if one percent spoil on a weekly basis so that's like my analogy in my head for demaresh that that's that's actually where the word comes from because if if you if you if you are a Trader of fresh goods you need to account for for yeah for all the rotten uh produce that you that you have over time and and I I really like this analogy because money is well one one of the of the only things in in the world that we have in our lives that that doesn't that is not perishable everything else is perishable and and yeah why not money I guess I'm curious um I have in my notes here that you know y'all have launched a Pioneer Community with 200 members in Zurich and there's a launch that just happened in Rwanda in November 10th it's obviously very early we're recording this November 29th it's very early to ask this question but do you see any similarities or differences in these two very different geographies um well it is really early to ask I mean um yeah we well we have talked to the to the to the leader in um Kigali about about how how we approach how how we tell the story and the stories just to know for the listeners Kigali is in Rwanda that's the second pilot there good continue yeah um so well I I think it's it's harder there also because of uh legislation so we shouldn't forget that well if you're in in different jurisdictions um it will be very different how how governments will will receive such uh local community currencies um although I I mean I have to say a crypto ban usually is is um motivated by governments who who don't want Capital to flee the country and you cannot do that with a local currency so I don't really think we yeah we need to be careful in how we compare there um but definitely jurisdiction and and kind of uh talking to the government is really really important for our leader in in Rwanda because I mean he is um he's taking risks uh because because of this legal uncertainty there and that that's that's why the the that Community starts I would say really as a low-key experiment um not not kind of not with waving flags and calling the revolution you know yeah it's not it's not how things will be approached there um in in Zurich we can act differently you know we can we can be more bold on our on our Ambitions and our greatest fear is how how the the the tax uh officials will will act on it and so that's that's just a different level of we we don't need to fear to go to prison you know right um but yeah apart from that really I I cannot tell how how different people will use their local currencies and we want to give as much Freedom as possible um so we support the community as so as the encounter Association uh we have a little bit of means to support um the new communities and we do so as unconditionally as possible because we we think they know best how how they need to allocate the funds and we don't want to um mess too much with how they do it and how the money has to work for them so I think we just Supply the protocol we Supply technical support and and kind of a minimum minimum starting funds and then and then we hope that people just are motivated enough take the initiative and do something which works for them hmm beautiful well I can't wait to have you back in a couple years and just see how the experiments have grown and you'll probably have a lot more data points at that point so um the the tracking is interesting so far and uh is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say yeah well I mean maybe maybe I can just tell about our next next steps towards um our our vision so I think we have two two more big topics apart from adoption and one is democracy so as as we have a a cyber resistance in place uh we want to establish one person one vote subsidiary democracy which means that every decision should be taken at the lowest possible level so our first vote as an example will probably be how high should the basic income be in our community and then we let people vote on that which I think is a pretty interesting question to ask and it's kind of the fear of every Central Banker to to submit this to a democratic process but I think it will be an interesting experiment and we we are concluding the minimum viable product to to really have kind of Unchained democracy doing that um so that's one thing and the other is um privacy so right now we are a substrate based protocol running on polka dot well kusama to be precise um and everything is transparent and um so this is an issue uh because local currencies are used for everyday purchases and you have to register for these Cycles to prove your personhood that means you commit to be in a certain place at a certain time in advance and that's kind of an added risk it's a security risk but also it's kind of it really leaks uh even future Behavior Uh about yourself and that's why we take privacy seriously and we are now working on a on a second layer solution which not only helps us with with um scalability so that kind of each Community can can scale independently of others but also helps with privacy um because these second layers will run with trusted execution environments I don't want to go too deep into into Tech uh here but it's it's just one of the options to provide privacy to transactions got it so that's what's on the roadmap next uh more focuses on democracy and privacy yeah Tech that's especially the the technical roadmap here but I think more more important than Tech is really is really Community work uh and adoption because in the end this will this will decide uh if we get to fly or not yeah well thanks so much for coming on the Pod how can people find you and the project well the best place to start really is uh incointer.org um that's where it can start you you you can download the app um in well for for your mobile phone start playing around we have a test net we have tutorials for people who want to start a local community where they live and please just reach out to us okay we'll put some links in the show notes for that and thanks again for coming on the path thanks for having me [Music]
