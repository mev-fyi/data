Bank of Ascension we got an exciting new episode for you today it's not every day that a brand new network comes into the ethereum fold the Zora Network Zora is getting its own layer 2 built on the op stack and today we have Jacob from Zora to guide us through that conversation Jacob is a very deep thinker about so many of the things that hold up this ecosystem the idea of on-chain communities digital brands minting ideas and so not only do we unpack all this news about the Zora Network the news or layer 2 but we also just unpack deeply what is Zora kazora is it's an nft minting platform there are many of these around but Zora really stands out differently from the others out there and so these are some of the conversations that we get into but first more specifically a layer 2 primarily focused on media and art what does that unlock who is that for how does this set Zora apart from other nft minting platforms what is the Zora Network good for and then of course how and when does the inevitable Zora token fit in here and of course at the end some bonus goodie conversations the conversation around on hyphen chain or on chain which one is right and why does it matter and also Zora frequently uses the line expand ethereum what does that mean so all these conversations are going to be unpacked in this episode with Jacob from Zora but first if you have built or are building a smart contract protocol and you need to make sure that your code is secure using the most modern tools check out ciphon siphon is a smart Contracting auditing firm that we've used at bank list to audit the smart contracts over at bankless Labs with our earnify product so we ourselves have used the siphon product Dawson over at ernifies very happy with them and not only that but if you're also new to web3 and you want to learn more about smart contracts they have 27 hours of video content to get you the developer onboarded into the world of web3 and solidity these videos have over 5 million views and this course will give you the skills that you need to get into the world of smart contract security and D5 protocol development so there is a link in the show notes to get started with cipherit but first before we get into this episode with Jacob from Zora a quick disclaimer Ryan is an investor in Zora he is also out today as you can tell uh he is out having some fantastic vacation time with his family uh and so that is our disclaimer there and there are some themes in this episode that I would like to implant into the listener's Brain before we dive in there there's three things that I'd like to pull out first lowering the barriers to entry of course we all know that layer 2's reduce got gas fees but specifically inside of the context of artists and artistic creation lowering the bench barriers to entry I think there's a deep conversation about what that unlocks and what that can do for the world of on-chain Art and so that's the first theme is lowering the barriers to entry how is that unique in the conversation of digital creation and digital expression not just lowering gas fees but definitely lowering gas freeze but also what else does that do when there's the the barriers to producing art part go down to the absolute minimum so that's the first theme the second theme pushing complexity to the margins this is something that I think uniquely sets Zora apart from any other nft minting platforms the the unopinionated nature of Zora where if you have an idea Zora does not constrain it as a as a platform it is meant to fully enable artists to do crazy weird things without the opinions of Zora saying like hey that's too weird don't do that here Zora is a platform that allows artists to maximally experiment and that just means pushing complexity to the margins that is a theme that I have brought up many many times on Bank list pushing complexity to the margins that's one of the themes of this episode and then the last the last theme is the frontiers of digital expression when you have lowering the barriers to entry when you push complexity to the margins we find a new frontier and since we are talking about the frontier of media and art that Frontier Jacob has a ton of great ideas about and I asked him about the idea of digital expression the frontier of digital expression toward at the very end of this episode so these are the themes that I think should guide you through this conversation and I'm really excited for Bank listening to you to listen to this conversation with Jacob from Zora he has a big brain thinker and has a very articulate vision for what the world of on chain expression can become so let's go ahead and start talking to Jacob from Zora but first a moment to talk about these

an entire ecosystem dedicated to the adoption of decentralized token governed Technologies mantle formerly known as bit doubt is the first dowled web3 ecosystem all built on top of Mantle's first core product the mantle Network a brand new high performance ethereum layer 2 built differently from the other layer twos that you may be familiar with mantle asks the question how would you build a layer 2 if you had a technology of 2023 mantle network is a modular layer 2 built using the op stack but uses eigenlayer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer 1. not only does this reduce mantle networks gas fees by 80 compared to other layer tubes but it also reduces gas fee volatility providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications the mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow-owned treasuries in default which is seating an ecosystem of projects from all around the web 3 space for mantle mantle already has sub communities from around web free onboarded to help the growth of mantle like games 7 for web 3 gaming or edu Dow from the world of DSi and buy bit for TPL and liquidity and on-ramps so if you want to build on the mantle Network mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone-based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle if you want to get started working with the first dowled layer 2 ecosystem check out mantle at mantle.xyz and follow them on Twitter at Xerox mantle if you haven't experienced the superpowers that a smart contract wallet gives you check out ambuyer ambuyer works with all the evm chains that are out there the layer 2 is like arbitrum optimism and polygon but also the non-etherium chains like Avalanche and Phantom because of the power of smart contract wallets and buyer lets you pay for gas in stable claims meaning you'll never have to spend your precious eth again the web app has numerous Fiat on-ramps to make it easy to dump your Fiat for crypto and if you like self-custody but you still want training wheels you can recover a lost ambier wallet using an email and password but without giving the ambier team any control over your funds check it out at amber.com for the a web app experience but also the ambier mobile wallet is coming soon for both IOS and Android and if you want to be a beta tester you can sign up at ambuyer.com app and since you stayed to the very end of this ad read you should know that Amber is airdropping its wallet token to early users for simply just using the wallet so if you want to get started with ambier all the links that you need are in the show notes Bank destination I would love to introduce you to Jacob the co-founder of Zora started in 2020 Zora is a platform for creators and collectors to mingle around a common campfire of digital Creations Zora has all sorts of toolkits for all kinds of digital file formats to start their life as on-chain artworks to be minted on chain and today we are here to learn exactly how Zora is expanding where it's going next and Jacob is hopefully going to guide us along on that Journey Jacob welcome to bankless hey thanks for having me happy to be here I'm really excited for this conversation I really want to open up this conversation of digital expression digital art with this question for you Jacob Jacob is the internet driving itself off a cliff uh is the internet driving itself off a cliff um well I've always had this thing where it's like I don't think we actually ever reached the internet or like we never really escaped intranets like if you think about the internet today it's really like six really really really big platforms and we had like a brief moment where the internet started and then you know kind of like the the 90s with the browser and some you know formative like new platforms coming online but really we've been living in like what I would just call like this Mega internet for the past like 10 years mostly defined by social media um so I actually think we're getting closer to getting back to the original internet um with blockchains and bringing information on chain and making it public and open so yeah that would be my answer to that question I think your answer is like hey there is a true nature of the expression of the internet and for the last 10 years we've accidentally gone down the uh Corp version of Internet side quest and I think you're you're saying that hey it's now with web3 we're getting back on track yeah it's more open put simply it's like I don't think uh there's anything inherently wrong with the technical approach of social media it was like it was invented pretty blockchain but blockchain's kind of help us get to a more open and public system by default so yeah I don't think we're um driving off a cliff from the internet I think we're actually getting closer to the original vision of the internet because of blockchain the original vision of the internet can you just unpack what does that mean to you and what should that mean for us the original vision of the internet yeah to me that means open and free access to information I think in its simplest times and then part of that is like yeah how do we connect and share that information um together yeah and and to for what reasons would you say that it's been missing in the last like five ten years of the current Internet like why why do we not have this um I think the other piece of that puzzle is actually the the value piece so there's this um there's this great Stuart brand quote from the 1980s um kind of when you know a lot of people were like geeking out about the early internet which was like information wants to be free but information also wants to be valuable and that tension will not go away and that was kind of like this big philosophical tension where it's like you know information wants to be widely spread you know the more that everyone knows the kind of like the better the world can get more generally but because of the you know we didn't have blockchains essentially but like the way that we kind of create and capture value of around information has mostly been dependent on trusted platforms so it's like you know we kind of construct a wall garden and that's built out of either advertising or paywalls and there's always this like consistent tension of like well the platform is the one that's like determining determining how a value is captured for the people that are creating that information be it videos or songs or music or IP whatever it might be um and I think what we've seen over the past kind of like 10 years of uh social media is that the platforms are the ones that kind of make it's essentially all of that value that's created on those platforms um so it's like if you happen to be a top point one percent Creator on Spotify or YouTube you can you can make a living for it but everyone else who's kind of creating and sharing that media and that information is not you know seeing any value from that um so you can create and share that media but you're not necessarily able to capture all of the value from it so I'd say that's um that's the piece that's been going wrong or not even wrong it's just a piece that hasn't been there up until now um yeah yeah so when we when you add the puzzle piece of a blockchain the actual expression of value into this component I I think like the what you're illustrating to me is like these wild garden platforms that spotifys the YouTubes the apples the wild garden nature of it was kind of like a necessary evil to produce the value because you know prior to web 2 there was nothing right there's no monetization right uh and then we created these walled Gardens in an attempt to actually create some value for some people as as like you know we have these middlemen creating this structure but I I think what you're saying is like you add in the blockchain puzzle piece and you get the same product you get the same net outbound product which is we have valuable Creations but without the Walled Garden structures that that we've uh come to have dominate the the internet landscape am I typing into something here yeah I think that's right I think I think maybe what I'm saying more explicitly is that I think blockchains and specifically nfts might actually like kind of solve that multi-decade tension of like simultaneously free and valuable there if you think about an nft if Like You Mend an image you meant a song it's now publicly accessible to the entire internet you know including people who want to listen and enjoy to that media but then also the other developers who want to build their own platforms and experiences on top of it and none of that sacrificing value capture for the Creator because you know they're able to sell that in Ft they're able to earn from that nft over time um so yeah maybe that is actually solving that inherent tension of the internet which is information wants to be free but it also wants to be valuable and nfts are kind of like a very neat you know open solution to that problem where it's like you know for the social media era I think it's uh advertising has been the best possible solution to that problem because it's like hey you can like consume this for free and we're going to monetize the platform by like showing you ads every now and then maybe nfts are a better progression where it's like well if you're increasingly minting that content making it free and open to everyone and you're getting that kind of uh value back in the form of the asset of the nft itself and then also whatever the eth has been earned from minting it that might get us one step further than the ad space model and how to be free and valuable at the same time and the reason why I wanted to go down this quick Rabbit Hole of trying to Define what we're actually talking about here is because I've actually had a hard time defining what Zora actually is because like you know people know Zora it's a it's a place to Mint your nfts right it's like super rare but it's not quite like super rare right and it's you know it's an nft uh like browser you can you can check out different open nfts kind of like openc but it's not quite like openc either and so uh the the boundaries around Zora seem to be very fuzzy to me and I I think that's almost intentional and so I'm wondering if I could just Elevate to you uh the higher question of just like what what deeply is Zora what does it want to become um well I guess the way we describe ourselves is like the best place to Mint on ethereum so that's like the very kind of like tactical one sentence description a level above that is like yeah we want to help bring imagination on chain and then the question is like well why do we want to help bring imagination on chain and it's exactly because of what we were just talking about it's like we want to help information be free and valuable on the Internet or essentially reveal the value of everything that we're creating and doing in our daily lives on social media and everything like that and kind of like skew the the value part of the equation way back to the creative side versus the platform side um so yeah I guess like there's a million different dimensions to it and maybe like the story of like how Zora sudden and stuff like that can kind of inform it but the way that's kind of um netted out to Zora today is like yeah we make it we want to make it as easy as possible for creators to meet their work and then similarly make it as easy and enjoyable as possible for collectors who love and enjoy that art and media and content to to collect it and support the support the creator of it um so yeah the result is a platform that looks like Zora that is hey you can show up you can upload your imagination an eth and then on the collector side it's like hey you can start to experience all of this awesome art media and content in a completely free environment and if you happen to like it you can collect it I I think there's two specific Frontiers that are unique here um one is the ease in minting your imagination that you're using the word imagination rather than like your jpeg or your mp3 or your MP MP4 or like pick your file format right and and so that that is a whole entire Frontier of Arctic artistic expression and then you're also saying like the easiest possible place for both both sides of the market right the supply side the creators and then the the demand side the collectors yeah and so Zora is a platform just like Spotify just like YouTube just like super rare just like openc but the emphasis on the easiest possible I think is also worth uh unpacking because when you have any file format AKA your imagination and then you also have the easiest possible like a bunch of new frontier new fertile land like shows up in the in the crosshairs there and so for a brief a brief moment in time in 2021 crypto became very very cool very brief moment like artists flocked to ethereum and other crypto platforms as like a place to experiment with like new modalities of digital expression and then we accidentally turned everything into ponzi's but never mind that part I just kind of want to focus on the experimentation with digital expression here can you like just help articulate and describe what what the frontier is that we've unlocked here what does this world of on-chain expression and experimentation look like to you as we go forward into the future yeah it's a good question maybe it kind of like speaks to the 2021 piece I think like yeah we obviously had a huge kind of mania or Awakening or you know kind of Collective Agreement that's like oh wait like nfts are valuable it doesn't matter if anyone else can right click save as the image we're all inherently kind of agreeing and understanding that nfts as an object that can be bought and sold and traded are inherently valuable and represent ownership in that jpeg or you know the MP3 or whatever the file might be and that's like a huge deal it's like when a new value system shows up yeah obviously you'll see a lot of excitement and experimentation but I think the the overwhelming form factor we saw for 2021 was kind of like the 10K pfp and then kind of in parallel we saw our experimentation around like the one-of-one Art Market which is like hey you can take a singular image Bring It On chain option as a one-on-one and like that can hold that can hold value I think where we are today is there's kind of like two shifts that are happening that we kind of are at the Forefront of and pushing which is one instead of seeing just like this 10K pfp kind of like collectible style Market we increasingly think it makes sense for all forms of media and content to go on chain in exactly the same way so it's like well if you yes you can mint the jpeg of this kind of like profile picture looking collectible but why don't you meant this like you know visual artwork you made shared on Instagram and got hundreds of thousands of likes full like that that is inherently valuable is in something that inherently your community loves like that makes just as much sense on chain and then the other track is that I think the market has been evolving and experimenting you know uh in addition to one of ones which has been the kind of timed Edition um or like the open Edition format that we kind of have been leaning into quite heavily which is hey like instead of just minting it and only allowing one person to to collect it at the time it's kind of absurd when you think about it in the sense of the internet that it's like oh hey like you had 50 people literally throw money at you in an auction you turned 49 of those people away with their money and you only let one person have it it's like well what if there's a model that you could let more than just one person at the time have it when um you know the there's no physical constraint here like it's not like the artist has to you know individually produce each video it's like part of the internet is it can be broadly reproduced so the timed open Edition format is basically like hey anyone who happens to be here at the time can mint and if that's one person great if that's like a hundred thousand people amazing you've got now a hundred thousand collectors of this video or this image or whatever it is at the time so for I think where we are now you know in 2023 a couple years after 2021 is yeah like we're much more focused on the kind of content and media focused form factor which looks very different to open c as a Marketplace like Zora looks and feels a lot more like a a YouTube or even a Tumblr or something like that where it is actually about enjoying the the content and then yeah the the model of which people are kind of like collecting is hey you can show up and you can mention an addition of that piece of media um so yeah and then I guess the third maybe implicit piece um which I think is like you know very not unique to Zora but something that's very a big part of how we build is like we're like very much Unchained maximalists so a lot of our experimentation over the past three years is like how do you bring as much of this on chain as possible as pragmatically as possible and then how can you lead into the unique superpowers of protocols to do that so while Zora is that we do have a platform you know the website zora.co everything is built on essentially these custom built protocols and smart contracts that we've kind of engineered that make it one easy and cost effective to bring things on chain and then two easy and cost effective to distribute them as widely as possible and you know kind of tie the connection between platform and protocol as best we can to to make that simple um so that's that's kind of like the sum total of all of those those three things like focus on content media the timed open Edition model and then like building things on chain is probably a good Venn diagram with like Zora in the middle and gives a good picture of what we do yeah the the ethos so that I think you're expressing is is that Zora is built in a way that doesn't want to get in the way whereas uh it it's meant to me be a means to an end but like with other platforms both web 2 and web3 uh they impart some sort of like you come to us to do this to do this one thing inside of this constrained environment and we are Specialists inside of that constrained environment but it seems to be that zores is trying to be as um uh con constraint free as possible as in is just meant to service service broad needs and and other people the artist can produce constraints but not Zora or the collectors can produce constraints but not Zora and Zora allows for the maximum expression of all of all parties without imparting some sort of like top-down here is what we are for here's what we are do here is why you would come to us this is like the kind of the vibe I'm tapping into maybe you could expand on a little bit a little bit better yeah I think that's right I think it's um maybe the variation on that is like I think we've built a very very specific tool which is you show up you have some creative piece of media or work you meant it and then collectors can you know you bring it on chain and then collectors can mint it that's like a heavily opinionated that's a very simple tool or machine uh and then yeah I guess uh you know Creator shows up and they get their creator and smart contracts and then people can collect but yes we kind of try and make it as open as possible because we want to one give artists the tools to like push the limit of what they can meant so it's like yes you can show up with like a video or a song um or an image but you can also mint you know HTML and websites or if you're like really in the weeds as a as an artist you can actually write your own custom metadata renderer on chain and start doing more like art blocks generative and like very novel on-chain artworks that you can plug into the Zora smart contracts so it's like a very simple tool that kind of has these open ends that let you kind of bring your own creativity in whatever form that is which has been really interesting like uh yeah it is like the HTML editions that we released I guess a couple of weeks ago have been cool to see because it's like I don't know they're like interactive and people are even minting games and stuff like that and then on the custom metadata renderer site it's like oh wow like we're seeing some like further experimentation on the generative side that kind of hawks back to like the early art block stays so yeah specific tool but like generic application is maybe the the way to say it yeah and I've always appreciated this line that um artists live on the frontier as in all artists always live where there is the most unknown they always are experimenting and if we just had like a an Azora alternative that was like uh you can only upload jpegs under four megabytes yeah right highly constraining and heart artists would not be able to experiment very well and I think like one of the ethos that Zora is trying to double down on is that any sort of constraint comes out of the expression of the artist so the a more uh free platform allows artists to do whatever and if you if like some people might have been listening to that and been listening to hear you say like yeah you can mint HTML and a lot of people are like but why and the artists are like what can I do with that and I think that that's like unleashing constraints and and un uh making sure the artists are as enabled as possible is what contributes to the most amount of experimentation and I think that conversation about constraints can actually lead us to where we have an announcement to make Zora has an announcement to make and but maybe we can talk about the constraints of the Zora platform as it has stood up to this point and like what has been needed to to unleash further experimentation so what are the big constraints in web 3 creation and on-chain creation that that Zora is trying to tackle yeah great question so yeah I guess um we've had like a pretty exceptional 2023 so far like I think we're we're close to uh I think probably 850 000 collectors just this year um so like we have people minting like every other block on ethereum um and one of the kind of internal things that we track is you know like obviously mint throughput and then gas price and what we've found is that like uh a huge kind of structural inhibitor to like growth and accessibility of being able to collect on chain is the gas price especially in the timed open Edition format where it's like a lot of these nfts are like free to like twenty dollars you know a 20 gas price to Mint a 20 object or a 20 gas price to Mint a free nft start to actually like get in the way of the collecting experience and puts up a hard barrier and for us where we see like millions of nfts minted it's like oh we actually feel like we're kind of reaching the upper limits of ethereum mainnet as a network and that's actually like a huge structural thing that we've been looking to solve which has kind of pushed us into the L2 World um and I think where we've spent like months essentially kind of exploring all the different options and where we've netted out is that we're going to be launching um the Zora L2 built on the op stack or like the optimism stack um we're also going to be kind of like adding every other network within Zora as well to give creators the choice of their Network for whatever they're trying to do but yeah for us um we've kind of decided to take the leap and launch the the Zora L2 like the Zora Network built on optimism which is like really exciting as a way to kind of structurally solve that um that gas price issue the Zora Layer Two so that the Zora the digital campfire a creation space of collectors and uh creators are getting its own layer to its own home how how would you describe so first off congratulations that's huge that's a huge lift uh how would you describe just the nature of this layer too right because we have the generalized optimistic Roll-Ups of arbitrum and optimism which each have their own flavor right uh arbitrum is uh a defy heavy ecosystem optimism is experimenting and in many different fronts Zora is specifically about unchain creations and but would you call the Zora layer 2 like an app chain like it's a single service roll-up meant to do one thing how would you describe the flavor or what the purpose of the layer 2 is yeah that's a great question um I guess the is it an app chain or not I think we think of it more of an ecosystem or it is like specifically a home for creators like Zora by Nature about kind of protocol approach has like a pretty fruitful ecosystem system of like different platforms and apps built on it so like Zora I don't think well we'll we know we're not going to be the only app built on this network like we kind of on our L2 website have a list of probably like 30 of the top nft tools and Platforms in the space that are going to be moving across and building on Zora as well so I think it's it's much more of a an ecosystem than it is in app chain um and then yeah I think the L2 era we're heading into for ethereum generally is like quite interesting like the way we thought about it is like yes you're right there's like arbitrim and optimism they're kind of these like great generic catch-all l2s and I think bass has been fascinating to see play out because I think it's kind of like opened up kind of the window into the future of where we're heading which is like yes we will see I think an increasing number of l2s and in some sense like l2s are approaching uh like a commodity um if not already like the costs and complexity to deploy one of these to l2s is like going going down like every month so I think we're going to see a lot of these and when you see like kind of a commodity Marketplace like brand distribution and differentiation tend to be kind of like the core things that help you understand how things will play out so it's like there's a reason there's You Know Tiffany Tiffany diamonds all like Nike sneakers or Starbucks coffee like they're each selling commodities but like their unique approach helps them kind of like excel in the market so for Zora yeah like we have I think we have a pretty incredible brand that's like loved by the you know autistic and creative Community as well as like pockets of the ethereum community of course uh distribution has been like growing pretty substantially over the the past year um and then for the differentiation piece I think like we're really excited to start nerding out on the the interesting applications and economics that you can pass up the stack from essentially running a sequencer so it's like um you know if we we will be launching on like optimism mainnet as well but something that we don't have access to on optimism is the gas fees that get earned from the sequencer and by running our own one and we do start earning some of those gas fees from the sequencer we can then use that to then further abstract away the gas costs and transactions for um creators and then collectors too which we think will just continue to kind of like unlock further growth for us and then ecosystem so that was kind of like a big thing for us where it's like yes I think we take the brand and distribution box but on the differentiation side I think a whole new universe of um kind of a gas abstraction and subsidizing and things get unlocked by actually running that sequencer and the network itself so um that that was like the long-term exciting piece for us that we're excited to build around but the net the net result of all of that is like yeah we've kind of created this this home for creators and artists to like put their work on an ethereum ml2 and and kind of like push ahead and keep running with the growth that we're all seeing metamask has something new introducing metamask portfolio metamask portfolio is the

meant to be secure fast cheap and friction free could you uh explain the topology of what Zora becomes after this so you have the Zora Network the Zora layer 2 built on optimism yep on the op stack um but then you also said like well you're also going to introduce and to integrate all the other layer twos as well and I'm assuming you're also keeping the layer one how do all of these things fit together like holistically what does what would the topology of Zora look like after yes layer 2 is up and running I think to um yeah everyday people who are using Zora to Mint like to create and collect not that much changes that you show up to zora.com um we've put a lot of effort into the multi-chain experience uh it's essentially nothing really changes like if you go to like a mint page you'll be able to see what network the nft is being minted on but you don't have to do any complex Network switching and bouncing around it's like Zora as you've always known it so it's going to be multi-chain um and if you want to mention if mainnet you can if you want to mention Zora you can you want to mention optimism you can we've got other chains in the pipeline like they will be there um I think for and I think like we'll have to keep pushing forward the platform for quite a considerable amount of time I think like we have this huge idea of the future where it's like well if we can create a you know kind of a successful enough Network maybe there will be tools that are even better than Zora that get built on it and then Zora our platform is just one of many websites and applications built on it and we can kind of just like focus on the network but I think for the foreseeable future we're probably going to have to keep you know there's so many problems to solve from the user experience standpoint that we think we're in a really strong position to do that so I think in the in the short to medium term it's like we'll kind of lean into some of the superpowers at the platform level that get unlocked from operating and like you know running a network and then over time it's like as the as L2 decentralization becomes more known and like implemented we can then start to expand that outwards and then you know learn what the position of like the Zora platform is over over time but it's kind of like a I put in like the node unknown bucket it's like there's a million different ways that that could pan out or we all we really focus on right now is let's just lower the barrier ensure and create the best ux possible and vertically integrating down to the the network level is an important piece of that puzzle so with the ability to Mint on any Layer Two or or even the ethereum layer one Zora the Zora network is just offering like another place uh for that asset minting to happen and perhaps there's benefits to having a layer two that is specifically for that one purpose of putting digital Creations on chain whereas with optimism you're sharing block space and externalizing gas uh fees towards a different network and if you mention your uh your your iron chain expression on arbitrum you're inside of an ecosystem that's 99 like d5d gems and so I think maybe what you're saying is that like on the Zora Network on the thus or Layer Two it's like 100 a place where almost all on-chain activities are on-chain creations and so there's probably some Network effects of integrating the Zora network if you are a place that is interested in integrating with digital Creations am I tapping into something here yeah I think that's right there's like two Dimension there's the cultural and then there's the technical like optimism and arbitrary have been around for quite some time yet we haven't seen these types of ecosystems like emerge on those networks just yet and it could be because they're more like defy and financial or gaming or whatever it might be like they've just got their own kind of unique cultural phenomenon that they're tapping into that might not necessarily be art and media so I think um yeah artists and I guess the ecosystem generally is like okay cool like this is uh this is a a network kind of by an nft team for nfts It's like got a rich history with artists and creators like it's just kind of intuitively makes sense of like out of all the other like l2s that exist this probably makes the most sense to like mint my my work and then on the technical side it's like because um because we're able to like tightly integrate the the network into the platform it might just be structurally the cheapest place to do that so it's like you can go ment on a different network but because those different networks don't also run their own tools on top purpose built for minting that might always just cost more to do it there so I think on the technical side it's like we really just want to get the gas costs as as low as possible for the creators and and building down into the metal of the network kind of lets you do that so there's the cultural side and then there's the technical side and I think those two things kind of make Zora a really compelling option for people who want to admit their work so the niche of a layer two that's dedicated to like art and media is unclaimed and Zora is saying hey we're claiming it the the see that all that real estate we're planting to absor a flag yeah right right in the middle of this and maybe like in the world like we know that Spotify is working on uh token gated access to uh songs and artists and and just access to some specific corners of Spotify that are not available if you don't have these tokens and it's not it's not a very far stone's throw away from like hey like artists actually minting tokens minting songs right and maybe if you're a Spotify or any other platform like this they are maybe they become convicted as like okay on chain media on web web 3 nfts is the way to go what network do we integrate do we integrate arbitrum okay maybe do we integrate optimism do we integrate the ethereum layer one well the ethereum layer one is really expensive so there's no like shelling point of like what is the chain that you integrate if you are focused on media and art and so maybe this is like the shelling point exactly the Zora network is going after is like hey are you interested in the world of on-chain media and art well therefore you are interested in Zora yeah exactly I think that's exactly right and then in the same way we want to kind of experiment with passing that economics up into creatives and collectors to abstract away that gas we also want to do the same thing for um for developers too um I think there's like some great early implementations of models like this like um CSR and like Kanto I think like there's there's a whole world of possibilities where it's like we could potentially explore bringing that into the op stack too so I think um yes I think you're right like there's the shelling Point aspect where it's like oh there's media here and like this seems to be where this is the best place to put um meteor on chain and then also there's like the technical benefits that can come from the technical and economic benefits that can come from doing that too which um I think would be interesting to play around with so yeah I think um I don't think it's as much like claim that space like we want to kind of put Zora out there and we're going to be supporting all these other networks too in Zora and you know we're kind of we're not just gonna like kind of put everyone into Zora from our website like we can just like let's let's see if this is all correct let's um take a long-term View and see what we can lean into but let's not ignore the fact that like other artists and creators might want to Mentor on other networks and let's give them that ability because we have such a great tool for that so yeah it's going to be going to be cool to see how it plays out just a few more technical questions the data from the files that are minted on chain uh is that a part of this conversation is the Zora chain going to host data or how does like the actual files be stored somewhere or anywhere yeah this is a good question um so for the tools we built we mostly default to ipfs um some people who played around with like their own custom metadata renderers like that they might choose awive or like some people will even just like kind of host it essentially but um yeah the Zora L2 doesn't have any impact on where or how things are stored we'll just keep defaulting to ipfs and then obviously like anyone who knows what they're doing can set and choose where they store their their information they can store wherever they want that we we did we default to ipfs mm-hmm so with a choice of using the op stack the the optimism Collective is like Yay more people using the op stack but then there's another part of that conversation which is the final form of joining the op Collective is actually using the same sequencer so how how do you is there a vision or a strategy with uh the Zora Network's relationship with the optimism super chain yeah yeah we're we're excited to kind of like experiment and participate in the super chain I think it's like it's all very early but I agree with the ideals it's like you should be able to easily put your assets and your nfts between these chains very easily we should get the bridging experience to either not have to exist at all or it does exist it's like very easy and safe um and that if we do see you know essentially uh These Chains forming per use case or per ecosystem or per app or all of the above and there's going to be a lot of these things connecting them in the most open and transparent way possible is going to be important so I think um yeah we're excited to kind of like help contribute however we can for the nft piece of that equation as the super chain or like in the super chain but it's like you know it's it's not particularly built out yet it's early and there's like a lot of work that needs to be done so yeah we're down to do the work but it I would say it is early um but I agree with the vision the last time I talked to the uh the op team that was more or less the same vibe that they that they gave is like hey using the op stack is like the first foot in the door that you need to make to commit to the longer term super chain vision and the longer term super chain vision is a bunch of just like research and development and eventually will get there but merely saying that we are going to use the op stack is like the first step to saying like hey we can be a part of that and in tandem with the rest of the super chain we'll kind of figure it out as it goes exactly yeah like standardization is like very good as we know it's like ESC 721 means it's like well hey if we all these competing platforms can at least agree on a shared standard you get all these amazing use cases because composability is 100 times easier so if like op stack continues to kind of be the developer shelling point or the standard for how you create an L2 then the bridging experience the hosting experience the sequencer like all of the tools required to stand up one of these l2s should get significantly better because the developer doesn't have to do something bespoke every time all they have to do is add a new chain ID and then they know everything's going to work as expected because it's following the shed standard so yeah I would agree like the the standard is like a really crucial important First Step gives a good step towards composability and then you get to like Focus the level up the stack now which is like Okay now what's all the complexity and risks and opportunities that open up if we can agree that this layer is consistent so yeah it's all part of the Natural Evolution of the space I think and I think it's good so Zora has not made it any secret that eventually there will be a token uh now that we have a network is the token relevant here or like what where is the token discussion these days about Zora yeah I think the way we've always thought about a token is like uh well one we one just the principle of community ownership is like one of the huge superpowers of crypto so it's like of course that's an ideal and then two is I think tokens are amazing if they can help meaningfully decentralize um wherever possible and then if there's like obviously Dow components it's like is this actually helping create an organization like I think there's like thousands of tokens out there but there's like very few working on-chain organizations that can like utilize these tokens so I've always like paid attention to like well what are the token models that are kind of pushing us into like a working and meaningfully decentralized organization um on the Dow side and then yeah I guess like the the more Network focused direction is like well trodden like we we know that um tokens are an amazing tool to like decentralize the network so yeah I think for us it's always uh it's always part of the vision and a long-term ideal that like uh similar to like the super chain decentralizing sequences is a really hard on Unsolved problem so there isn't like there isn't like a very straightforward way to like just turn on a token then immediately start decentralizing like that's just not where the technology is at so I think um yeah we're hopeful for that future but I'd say it's probably going to be until those breakthroughs happen it's like we're just going to be heads down building the best possible product and tools we can using everything we have at um at African tips basically so yeah with regards to the timing of the Zora network uh where are we at when does it launch when can users touch it when can developers build on it like what what's the release plan uh great question well live right now uh chain ID is uh seven sevenths um so yeah we we deployed mainnet um with uh optimism last week uh I'll roll out into the the product and tool set is happening as we speak and should be there later today but um yeah I guess uh June 21st so the summer solstice is when we're um where we're kind of announcing and rolling out our Network which I think is very apt heading into Azora summer or I guess L2 summer more generally so um yeah should all be there but yeah chain ID is uh seven sevens um seven seven we will get all of those links and information into the show notes on both the YouTube and Jacob you're saying today we are recording this on the 20th but you mean for a release on the 21st so today the 21st is is when it gets released yeah exactly perfect beautiful awesome and and Jacob since I have you here there's just a few more conversations that I want to unpack with you this idea of on a hyphen Chain versus on chain uh yeah wait the the spelling between these two things what is the answer and why is that answer important uh it's very clearly on chain with no hyphen um that I think as we've seen with all technological words and names like online or email or whatever it might be they might be grammatically correct at the time but I think um as the technology gets more broadly adopted and frankly people stop having the effort of typing a whole extra character every time uh I think like on chain without the hyphen is uh is here to say and I think it's important because it kind of reflects the reality which is like this is a real technology it's like it's getting increasingly usable and able to you know have a real impact on people of like day to day um and it's kind of like I think it's it's at a new level of like maturity um and then yeah I just don't want to type a hyphen every time so uh it just looks clunky yeah it's like I I I'm I'm totally fine with people typing on chain with a hyphen so long as they're logically consistent and also type online or email with a hyphen so I think that's totally fine but you just have to be consistent Jacob if anyone has read your writing from over the years and also just been like paying attention to the Zora brand um I think there's an a subtext of all of that which is that the future is weird uh and I don't think you're someone who can articulate like how weird it's going to be or or at least why it's going to be weird so maybe with like we have these new technological innovations like the optimism super chain the Zora Network inside of that ecosystem we have the ability to like you say mint your imagination and therefore other people can collect imaginations we have New Frontiers of artistic experimentation mixed with on-chain Technologies I'm wondering like if you can just like Fast Forward ourselves in five years the Zora network is maximally successful it's doing everything that you wanted to be doing people are using it in new and weird ways what does that future look like what does that mean for collectors what does that mean for artists for brands for communities okay just explain perhaps how the your imagination for the future as it relates to of these Technologies yeah big big big question uh I think at the highest level we should see society's ability to go from idea to reality meaningfully improve um so I think uh how to like Yeah so basically we should be if like someone has the spark of an idea and puts it out on the internet the ability for people to organize and make that idea a reality maybe gets like 10 times faster in the absolute wild success case I think the the thinking behind that is like I the thing that really got me into crypto like a decade ago was kind of realizing that you could create a cryptocurrency for like any idea that was like my first Spark that really got me into it I there was like um counterparty and colored coins on bitcoin were really cool to me because I was like oh wait like you could create a token for like a film like right now it's like if you wanted to organize around a film like there's maybe Kickstarter on one end and then multi-billion dollar Studio on the other end and the in between is actually quite sparse um and I've always loved crypto as like it is a value system and if we can start to Value things in a different way that's on the internet we should be able to organize around those ideas on the internet too um so like nfts I feel like in their most ideal success case it's like we can immediately start to understand and capture the value and kind of collective energy around an idea and then if you have it in an nft form by nature of being on chain maybe it makes it significantly easier to start to organize around them so instead of having to do a traditional company in whatever jurisdiction you might be which for me at the time was like you know being in Australia it's like well now it's like instead of uh having to create like a traditional company you can organize like a dow or a token around it and maybe you can find the best people on the internet at the time who are really into it to like help get closer to that um so yeah I don't know if that's a five-year thing maybe that's like a 25-year thing if it is that like kind of level of um a breakthrough but yeah that that's the that's the way that I relate to crypto and I think like Zora is like the in the direction it's building in it's like we can create and kind of organize around ideas at their earliest stages and get to them being as real thing as fast as as fast as possible or at least faster than we have been able to up until this point I think that really hooks in very well to the idea that we were talking about earlier which is the idea of Zora as a very unconstrained platform as in like any file type of any size of any type of data yeah mix mixed with the fastest minting experience with the lowest gas fees it's like all of a sudden we are uh unconstraining what it takes to put an idea on chain and you're also unconstraining what it takes to collect said idea yeah and so like the market the marketplace is massively unconstrained here and so many many many types of ideas can become on chain and then many many many types of collectors can agree or disagree with those ideas and so not only can ideas and reality meet faster just like you said but we have more shots on goal for many more types of ideas and all of a sudden that that becomes very very viral and expressive and is something that really gets me going exactly yeah I mean and that's that's how I use Zora like I just kind of mint ideas in these like a lot of things I write I also meant to um but yeah I think it's uh yeah in the same way if we kind of um if we say that like social media disrupts like newspapers in some sense it's like and that you can kind of see how technologically that's accurate but it really misses the bigger picture that same analogy where it's like maybe nfts are disrupting like the patent system in a similar way where it's like well if the way that you can kind of put ideas out into the world create and capture value around it and organize around it yeah maybe we can we can do things together a lot faster and make sure that like everyone who's creating that value is like rightly earning it so you don't have to make that like trade-off this is kind of like the best of Open Source and also like open value which is kind of cool um so yeah I think um that's at least the vision is it possible I think it is it's just you have to make it more accessible and easy to use which is obviously easier said than done so that's what we spend a lot of time on yeah and then another line that I see outside of the coming out of the Zora versus this idea of expand ethereum expand ethereum what does that mean well I think ethereum is like a fundamental breakthrough in as a value system is a way that yeah we can kind of um build infrastructure on the Internet ethereum mainnet is like currently Limited in how far it can go like it's the number of transactions per second the cost to use it so I think like the way that we've always wanted to kind of like for us to help bring ethereum to like a billion people we're going to need some breakthroughs and pieces of infrastructure like layer twos so the way I think why it's expanded ethereum is it's not like Zora is going out into the market and trying to create like a a new L1 or a thing that's trying to like compete with ethereum it's like it's quite the opposite where like building directly on top of ethereum we want to like help expand it to as many people as possible and make it as easy as accessible for people to use ethereum um and then hopefully build like the bridges and pieces that you know if a piece of media or content on the Zora Network gets to a point of value where people actually want to bring it to mainnet they absolutely can um so I think uh yeah I think it's like a it's a pithy way to kind of show that it's like yeah Zora is an L2 is is really just like Zora on ethereum like it always has been um and then yeah I guess I just like a kind of deep belief in ethereum isn't underlying technology and I guess to some extent we are kind of ethereum maximalist so it's like a cool way to kind of Express that um so yeah it kind of like sums up our approach without L2 I guess well Jacob I've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation the idea of being able to Mint an idea and have that idea be permissionlessly enter the marketplace of idea collectors makes me very very excited uh if people want to learn more about Zora or get started with Zora Network or really just go down the Zora Rabbit Hole where should they go uh zora.com and then um yes zoi dot Co and then on Twitter where um our Azora so o u r z o r a um and then yeah David you should mint an idea and then tweet that out and maybe we can all collect one of your first ideas yeah why not yes I need to have an idea Jacob this has been fantastic I've really enjoyed this conversation I really appreciate your time sir yeah likewise thanks David Bank location you know the deal eth is risky crypto is risky D5 is risky minting ideas could also be risky but we should mint them anyways you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we are glad you're with us on the bank this journey thanks a lot foreign [Music]
