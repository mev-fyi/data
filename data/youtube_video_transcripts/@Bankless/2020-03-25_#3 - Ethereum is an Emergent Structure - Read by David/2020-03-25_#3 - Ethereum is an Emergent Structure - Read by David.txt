hello everyone today we are going to read ethereum is an emergent structure this is the third of the three articles that i kind of bundled together in my head uh my plan with the git coin grants is to take some of the bitcoin money from the bitcoin grants and bundle these three articles together into one seamless uh ebook of sorts 45 to hour long read uh get some money for a graphic designer get some money for illustrations and then put this comprehensive ebook together so if you are interested in funding that please go to my git coin so we can do this together it explains a little bit more in depth as to what i'm actually going to do uh which which includes a way for you know future revenue to go back to get coin by selling this book so check it out i'll link it in the show notes uh so this is the third of three of these uh of this the three articles that again i bundled together in my head it's the last one that kind of ties everything together and so here we go ethereum is an emergent structure here's a cool little gif and so we'll go through what this gif means but basically i talk about how like crystals grow on their own uh the minerals kind of auto organize and auto create themselves and over time they they spawn new things and that's kind of how i view ethereum or ethereum's at the bottom and then all of these things are growing on top of it emergence emergence occurs when a system of interconnected parts is observed to have properties that its component parts do not have on their own emergent properties are the result of the interactions of individual parts but also the result of the interactions of the interactions of individual parts emergent properties result from the combinations of interactions from the many components of a composed system the discrete parts of a system create permutations of combinations with all other parts the larger the number of individual components in an interconnected system the more powerful the emergent result is the brain consciousness in the brain is a great example of emergence gestalt psychology refers to the brain as an organized hole that is more than the sum of its parts you can compartmentalize the brain into different areas and label their function the occipital lobe inputs and processes visual stimulus the temporal lobe inputs environmental stimulus and outputs meaning or significance the parietal lobe orients the body in space-time and the pre-frontal cortex produces goal-oriented behavior from the signals from the rest of the brain however you cannot find the brain's consciousness center consciousness is an emergent phenomenon that is created when you combine the separate functioning structures of the brain together consciousness is a byproduct of the combinations of the discrete parts yet it represents the most significant characteristic of the human brain as a whole markets markets are emergent phenomenons no one invented the market rather it emerged as a result of the demand for the exchange of goods producers need an efficient place to exchange in order to access the goods they don't produce and as a result of the need for exchange markets become more useful the more they are used larger markets have a wider selection of goods available for trade and in higher quantities and allow for more overall participants as a market grows larger more goods are available and more possible opportunities are there the market becomes a better place to trade as it grows larger markets are one of the few things in this universe that get better when more people use them this positive feedback loop creates the emergent product of markets which is money money is an emergent phenomenon from markets the need to exchange goods creates the demand for a single good that everyone else uses as a substrate for exchange wheat oil coffee steel these all have desirable properties that make them valuable commodities the equivalent desirable desirable property for money is that it is able to be exchanged for anything of equal value without loss so steel is really good because it's good in construction it's very you know dependable sturdy unbreakable and bendable it's a good structure you know wheat is useful in combine as a useful commodity as well you can turn it into bread you know coffee useful commodity money is a commodity and it is also useful and where coffee strength comes from its or excuse me where steel's strength comes from it's its strength or wheat strength comes from the fact that it's food money's strength is that you can exchange it for something of equal value without loss during exchange with no slippage that's what money as a product is good for money's good is as a substrate and money becomes more useful when more people use it good money has good network effects and the best money has the best network effects the most used of money is the more used a money is the less lossy it becomes during exchange side note money as a an emergent phenomenon illustrates why the competition to be internet money is so strong and why commun crypto communities become so tribal there is only one jurisdiction on the internet and therefore there is only one space for money to compete liquidity begets liquidity and moneyness begets moneyness fiat monies like the euro juan or peso all can co-exist with the us dollar because of the authority of each respective government to enforce the usage of that money in their particular region on the internet however there is only one region there is only one place for internet money to exist and thus the competition for the label of internet money is fierce because there's only one jurisdiction on the internet for these things to compete inside of ethereum is a platform for emergence the intrinsic characteristics of ethereum set up ethereum to be a platform that fosters emergence is a permissionless platform anyone can build it is a turn complete platform anything can be built it is a composable platform anything built can interoperate with anything else these are the ingredients for emergence the rise of the internet follows the same model the internet is an emergent system of interconnected users websites and traffic anyone can build anything on the internet and anyone can access it the rise of the internet was specifically enabled by the lack of obstacles to developing on it no one needed approval to build something on the internet as the internet developed it began to develop faster as it grew in users the incentive for building on it grew while the obstacles shrank as time passed more and more users came to the internet which ultimately forced the hand of every single company into establishing internet presence additionally the tools for building on the internet became more robust and easier to use reducing the cost of building something meaningful and allowing a greater set of people to become builders a positive feedback loop set in the incentives for being on the internet grew larger while the obstacles for building on it grew smaller wikipedia the emergent platform for knowledge the wikipedia versus encyclopedia britannica story is a great example of the success and power of open source and permissionless value creation the ability for any and everyone to write content for wikipedia turned it from being a website that completes with encyclopedia britannica to a database of all recorded human knowledge unlike the coordinated and centralized effort of encyclopedia britannica the chaotic and decentralized content creation of wikipedia ultimately created something far more valuable simultaneously wikipedia created a superior product without paying for labor thousands and thousands of authors contributed endless hours of labor to produce free content for the platform further those that contributed the content are often experts in their field intrinsically driven to share the knowledge they have gathered allowing wikipedia to organically access expert knowledge for every possible domain if an article is inaccurate it tends to be automatically reviewed and corrected by those more knowledgeable as human knowledge progresses wikipedia automatically updates all of this happens organically articles websites apps the internet wikipedia and ethereum all represent open technologies with similar paths anyone can come to the platform and create something valuable when someone builds something valuable it makes the platform itself more valuable the things that are built on the platform exhibit evolutionary qualities they improve iterate or are replaced the things that are built on the platform make all other things more useful and easier to build ethereum is a story of its applications without applications ethereum is nothing ethereum needs applications to be useful ethereum and therefore ether derive utility and value from the applications on top of it all applications are adjacent to each other when you build your application on ethereum you are building it in the same place as all other applications all apps have surface area with other apps this is ethereum's core feature the integration of a virtual machine inside ethereum was a revolutionary improvement in the development of crypto economic systems but the ability for apps to be composed together is perhaps an even greater feature this feature is known as composability and composability fosters emergence surface area in the ethereum ecosystem businesses are apps and when an application is deployed it generates products and services for other people and other applications the creation of a product or service generates surface area an application's surface area is the external facing component of an application that other apps can hook into and build off of composability on ethereum creates surface area when an application is built it creates a product this product represents the surface area of the applications maker dao's surface area die the dsr falls keepers mkr governance mkr auctions these are all the external facing features of the maker dow application it has a lot of surface area applications like compound and unit swap also have large surface areas side note the cool thing about unit swap is that it only has surface area the correct definition for what a dow is is an application that is only surface area there's only code on the inside which is inaccessible to humans and it's only humans on the outside humans aren't allowed in it's code on the inside humans on the outside that's what that's the prime example of the prime definition of a dao each application on ethereum generates surface area for others to latch onto and leverage but when applications build off of each other they create new surface area as well this is how ethereum the ethereum structure grows different components building off of other components money legos this is what we call money legos the collective surface area of every composed app is the outline of the ethereum structure in its entirety applications build on and around each other and the structure grows like barnacles on a turtle's back each app increases the surface area and generates new surface for others unlike barnacles however applications increase the well-being of the apps below it applications that build off of each other are inherently symbiotic each product each provides services customers or value for each other for their adjacent apps where the emergence emerges so here is a diagram of you know a growing number of nodes with every every node having an intersection with every other node and so if you are one node you have a connection with all other nodes in this in this particular diagram and this kind of just shows how emergence works right so like you start with one node and you have zero connections and then you start with two nodes and you have one connection and then three nodes you have three connections and then four nodes you have six connections and it starts to increase the options for intersections between nodes goes up uh logarithmically geometrically and so you know and this is how something turned this is what a cambrian explosion looks like right like and this is what i think is we are at the very beginning stages of defy uh the very early uh applications like maker dow compound uniswap are the very early nodes in this network that allow for more things to happen allow for more service area so many applications on ethereum that are being built today require some of the applications that were built last year and the year previous like pool together couldn't have been built before maker dow or compound um synthetics i mean could have been built before unit swap but now that unisop exists it's a much easier application to use and so this is where this growth comes from each every new application on ethereum generates larger permutations of possibilities than the applications previous in the image above k3 generated two possible connections but k-12 generated 11 possible connections the more applications on ethereum the more potential there is for new applications growing the economic pie imagine ethereum at genesis block the pictured depicted by k1 in the diagram above no contracts no apps the only thing that existed was the native asset ether a single 1d point in an empty universe how do you build something like pull together or defy zap in this early universe you cannot you first need more fundamental primitives to provide foundation and structure for higher level apps rsa tech tree i'm gonna go and look at that real quick yeah so here's ether in order to build all this stuff you got to build all the early stuff it's pretty simple okay lost my spot um okay maker dow is the leader in the eth lock-up leaderboard because of its magnitude of the surface area that it creates the existence of dai the only stable cryptocurrency creates a new wide landscape for ethereum applications to be built the size of maker dao's surface area is illustrated by the never-ending list of dye derivatives chai c dye a dye r dye lsd pl pldi as well as all the vault services like cdp saver and most importantly the list of die marketplaces and applications that use dye like the uidx uniswap oasis fulcrum compound curve good applications create large surface areas the eth locked in d5 leaderboard can be viewed as a measure of each application surface area for other applications compound and uniswap also have large surface areas for other applications to leverage pull together uses die inside of compound plus their own app to produce a no lost lottery this pool together app is built on top the surfaces of maker dial and compound pooled together also produces pl dye which other apps can leverage pl die is pull together surface area for other apps now that pl die exists it can be made easily accessible by unit swap making it easy for other apps to build on pool together so here is an image from the althea team the data analytics of d5 and ethereum team this was in november of 2018 so a year and a half ago and there's four protocols here all the activities in maker maker's like brand new at this point um it's actually almost a year old but d5 is brand new uh because makers like the only thing there uh you know some compound activity some uniswap activity some auger activity but just seven months later in may you know starting to get a lot more robust a lot more transactions between these applications you know each application is starting to leverage the surface area of other ones this is in may 2019 here's august of 2019 so not that much later altheo incorporates more applications uh um nuo network dydx synthetics and an instant app a lot more volume a lot more activity everyone's using everyone else's surface area and then here's today which you know you're starting to actually i know this is a 2d representation but you're starting to be able to see like maybe a 3d representation if you use your imagination where everything is starting to stand on top of maker dow and then all this defy activity is just exploding just robust uh set network effect protocol dydx compound bzx rip veil synthetics unit swap it's so much activity and this is this is just applications using other applications right like this isn't there's people doing these things but it's really just applications leveraging other applications ethereum is an organic structure so i have this uh image here and what i'm about to read will explain it but there's two ways of viewing ethereum right there's like ethereum the the whole landscape the whole thing the whole blockchain and then inside of ethereum there are the ethereum apps and they are inside of ethereum right but there isn't a part of ethereum that isn't actually ethereum that isn't its apps the what ethereum is is its collection of apps it is there's no thing about ethereum that is what ethereum is without talking about what ethereum's apps are as well they're the same thing there's no there's no contract on ethereum that you can point to and say that's ethereum but not its apps they're all the same thing ethereum is is apps ethereum is the collection of all the contracts on it the collection of applications on ethereum compose ethereum applications are not a subset of ethereum they are ethereum there is nothing that is ethereum other than the apps that live inside of it as applications are built deployed and composed the ethereum structure grows i frequently illustrated ethereum as a landscape a physical plane of existence where things are built ethereum is the ground for builders to build structures on each application on ethereum is a structure which which each contribute to the development of the ethereum landscape here's a picture of austin griffith the builder of ethereum austin griffith the builder perhaps this gives new meaning to the term builder when it comes to ethereum devs those who construct and deploy code are building physical structures on ethereum software engineers are called engineers for a reason they are responsible for building stable structures for others to use a composed structure structures on ethereum converge upon each other the eth the east deposited inside an application is a measure of the mass of the app the more each an application has the more mass it has and the greater the gravitational pull it exerts on others eth deposited into an app as a measure of how useful that application is both to users and other apps being useful simply represents how many other users and apps need that product or service being useful is the incentive for others to use your application and represents the strength of the gravitational pull that each app produces everyone needs stability in their economic lives also everyone needs to use the same currency that everyone else uses so therefore it's a thousand times easier to just use die for stability than it is to create your own stable coin since everyone is already using dye why are you trying to solve all the problems that maker dao has already solved just use dye the gravitational pull that maker has on the rex rest of the ecosystem is difficult to escape just give it one stable coin to rule them all the next biggest eth lock-up applications are compound and unit swap and along with maker these represent 75 of all the ether locked in defy consequently the majority of all ethereum apps leverage these platforms because the surface area they've created is so large the gravitational pull that eath holding apps exhibit doesn't only pull on a few apps they pull on all apps the gravity of ether creates the convergence of applications from being many disparate individual structures into one single superstructure the growth of this superstructure is the growth of ethereum ethereum is the sum of its apps this gravitational pull is not just confined to the internal ecosystem of ethereum the rules of money and economics transcend crypto if there are users with economic activity there are there is incentive to join the economy and capture some of that value that is being transacted the gravitational pull generated from the economic activity inside ethereum creates the incentive for legacy finance to migrate there eventually the incentive to either use or be a part of the ethereum structure will pull in everyone the larger the ethereum structure grows the stronger it's the influence it pulls it pulls on the outside world ethereum is a city here's a little gif of las vegas growing since the 80s kind of looks like uh you know a virus looks like a bacteria in a petri dish getting bigger that's what humans are ethereum is a city cities exist because they are epicenters of economic activity living in a city increases one's exposure to the economic activity inside of it cities are places of opportunity and growth ever since the industrial revolution humans have converged upon cities in order to access the opportunities available the economic activity that cities generate creates the same gravitational pull illustrated above cities are efficient structures it's easy to coordinate and distribute resources when everyone is living in the same spot the public and goods distributed distributors can converge on the same spot in order to access the same markets distributing food is easier when everyone can access the same supermarkets distributors have fewer destinations to go and are able to distribute more goods per person faster when lots of people all use public transportation the cost of building and maintaining that transportation is reduced on a per unit basis it would be idiotic to build a subway in north dakota for example indeed the efficiency of cities increase increases with scale bigger cities are always more efficient than smaller ones think about how much how many people per day the united new york subway system moves like it's like 10 million people per day or something crazy like that like there's not even 10 million people in south dakota like you can't move 10 million people in south dakota they're spread out all across the whole state cities if you want something done in a city it's just easier because everyone is more condensed it just costs less energy to get stuff done cities are emergent structures no one coordinates the development of a city they are constructed from the incentives of thousands of different individuals even things like city governments or city councils only have so much control over the direction and evolution of the city the development and growth of cities is through chaotic organization organization through chaos chaotic organization is the description of the resultant product of emergent systems auto organization of separate but composed units the demand to live inside the city generates the demand for both housing and workspace creating the incentive for incentive for developers to build structures to house humans and human labor with the growth of housing and bazaars or markets comes growth in population and increased demand for secondary and tertiary services over time in iteration human meeting places turn into skyscrapers and thousand unit apartments supermarkets and restaurants feed everyone offices coordinate labor bars and music and music venues entertain daycares schools hospitals hotels gyms casinos parks clubs skate parks these all come with density these all come with living in a city what began as a handful of individuals needing to secure a livelihood emerged into a complex and integrated system of efficient resource allocation and exchange ethereum exhibits these same qualities every application on ethereum represents opportunity for others every new application built on ethereum brings opportunity for new users and few further applications when new users and new apps arrive on ethereum future opportunities are created for the next wave of users to come in and take advantage of the structure builds itself illustrated above things like cities and ethereum have positive feedback loops that create self-fulfilling prophecies for their own existence just as markets money and cities become more useful and efficient as more people use them ethereum becomes a better place to build when others are already building there following this same pattern it's easy to see why ethereum as a platform has seen the success that no other platform has large structures have already been been built on ethereum that are offer large surface area for other applications there are already products and services on ethereum to make building your product or service easier everyone already lives in ethereum and on the internet there are no borders preventing migration from rural to urban however ethereum has an additional feature that cities markets and monies do not have when it comes to bootstrapping themselves into existence and that feature is ether apps that leverage ether are adopted at the genesis block ethereum was devoid of life and with ether being the only object in its universe from the point of view inside of the ethereum ecosystem ether is looking for things to do ether is bored and it needs activities applications on ethereum represent attractions and places of interest for ether to go imagine you participated in the ethereum pre-sale and you are the owner of ten thousand ether how does an application like ppith which is decentralized twitter benefit you at the cost of point zero zero zero zero zero one ether per tweet you can tweet a hundred thousand times and still have nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine point nine nine eth left over ppith doesn't solve your problem of how to effectively leverage your ether applications that leverage ether as a valuable asset offer solutions to what you should do with your ether in addition to the large surface area that maker dow creates there is an additional thesis as to why maker dao saw such early success it was one of the first applications the first major one that allowed you to leverage the value of your ether applications that allow ether to be leveraged as a valuable asset are automatically chosen by ether holders to be used because what else are they going to do are there 10 billion tweets on decentralized twitter it's far more likely that ether users are going to put that 10 billion dollars into financial applications that allow users to find ways to leverage the capital inside of their eth for a productive output applications that allow for the productive use of ether are automatically adopted all ethereum users have at least one thing in common they hold ether since eth is required to execute a transaction on ethereum this is basically guaranteed across the entire set of ethereum users they probably hold at least some amount of ether applications that create utility for ether are generating incentives for depositing ether into their app when an application generates this incentive they are generating the incentive to purchase and hold ether in the first place they are providing the utility value to ether when defy is a collection of thousands of different applications that all generate incentives to deposit ether ether becomes a generalized asset that is accepted anywhere on ethereum as the main collateral of choice in other words ether is money for d5 there is 2.8 percent of all of ether locked in d5 and we are just in the early days of ethereum applications being built to offer their services to ether holders yet we have seen a clear pattern of how future applications are going to be built step one you build an application that uses ether as collateral step two ether is deposited into this application providing proving that it is this app is useful to ether holders the growth of the ether deposits proves to vc funds that they have found product market fit for their application step 4 the app receives vc funding step 5 the team uses the funds to improve their product in order to generate more ether deposits at the genesis block ether is bored applications on ethereum automatically receive adoption when they provide services that offer ways to leverage the value of ether pipith quote i made it made up the quote pipith what if uh what if we can make a theory more useful to those that haven't adopted it yet admirable make or doubt what if we can make ether more useful pragmatic twitter users don't care about ppith but ether holders chose maker dow to succeed maker dow gave eth a path to utility maker dow allows ether holders to access a return on their capital the same goes for compound uniswap and every application with ether deposits the eth locked in d5 metric is a measure of the application's usefulness to ether and ether holders simultaneously they generate the mechanism as to how ether becomes valuable in the first place when more application more defy applications leverage ether as money it makes eth into money if ethereum and d5 host the majority of the economic activity of crypto systems then eth is internet money if they host the majority of the economic activity of the entire globe then ether is money for the world this bootstrapping mechanism is how the ethereum superstructure builds itself the incentive to build products and services on ethereum is built into the protocol itself this is why defy as a use case has taken off while other ethereum apps have seen lackluster lackluster adoption defy paves the road for ether to be valuable and eth holders are incentivized to take this path because it's the path that increases the value of their asset that they hold ether will build itself into internet money here's a little video of a train building its own path which is kind of cool the epicenter of ethereum is ether the foundation of ethereum's city is ether the economic activity of ethereum requires a currency and the native currency of ethereum is ether all roads in ethereum lead to ether the gravitational pull of ethereum apps is generated by the ether that is deposited in it the genesis block of ethereum was a one-dimensional structure ether was all that existed the structure being built is being built on top of that single point the collective weight of every application falls upon ether this weight is reflected in the market price of eth the number on the scale that ethereum stands on is the market price of ether if you could put ethereum and it's and it's this d5 structure this composed superstructure if you could put that on a scale on your bathroom scale the number that would show up on it would be the market price of ether the ethereum economy generates demand for ether maker dow requires it uniswap requires it compound dydx auger over ave they all require eath applications like pool together require dye instead but dye requires at least a dollar and a half of ether in maker dow all roads on ethereum lead to ether if ethereum is a nation then ether is its capital the superstructure is an organism organisms are emergent beings you the reader the listener are a system of interconnected components which are themselves comprised of internet interconnecting components down to the trillions of individual cells the superstructure of the human body is an orchestration of the components across different scales the cells the cells are the smallest unit of the organized whole each cell only knows about its adjacent ecosystem and only acts in its self-interest to live long and prosper in the global economic system cells are the individual economic agents individuals who have localized knowledge about the economy in their specific environment in ethereum the cells are the agents that engage with each with each application every market participant is acting in its own self-interest with valence the applications that they are familiar with and understand the organs organs are themselves a structure of the cells that comprise them an organ is something that is created out of the demand from the larger body the need to pump blood the need to filter toxins the need to sense surroundings or all roles of individual organs which are themselves comprised of cells applications are organs they are comprised of individuals that use the application to achieve their own goals and as a result make the application larger and more useful each application on ethereum produces an output for the rest of the structure to leverage maker dao's output is dye compounds output is c tokens etc every organ in ethereum fills a specific role in the greater structure the aggregate output of all the individual agents that engage with an ethereum app are how ethereum apps relate and orient themselves in reference to other applications the liver the organ that is responsible for removing toxins is located next to the digestive digestive tract the place where toxins arrive in the body the heart is located in the center of the body where it can most efficiently distribute nutrients these organs exhibit chaotic organization this is how ethereum apps auto-organize complementary applications will naturally converge upon each other in order to effectively leverage each other's surface area the body is the final product of chaotic organization after millions of recursive iterations by natural selection and evolution the body is a streamlined and efficient system produced by internal fights over scarce resources inside a single ecosystem the body is like a city many individual components that organically orchestrate to produce an emergent result ethereum is a body all the applications on ethereum represent the individual organs that compose the greater whole the outputs of every application are combined and converged by the body to achieve a single prime objective to live long and prosper the emergent goal of the ethereum ecosystem is to grow the ethereum's main goal is to survive and once this goal is achieved it can focus on its secondary goal which is to thrive and that those two goals to survive and to thrive are the same two goals of all organisms in existence we all have these same two goals ethereum's defense which is its survive goal is comes from its consensus algorithm the amount of staked eath this is the wall that must be overcome in order to bring down ethereum these are the scales that protect the ethereum body the more east-staked the denser and harder and stronger the scales here's a little picture of a lion trying to eat a pangolin but it can't because the pangolin scales are so strong ethereum's offense comes from the utility and value that ethereum applications provide which we can measure as etheloctin defy ethereum's applications are the teeth and clause for ethereum the weapons for the hunt these applications are tools for eastholders and are threats to any competitor outside of ethereum the gravity of the superstructure of the ethereum superstructure is the monetary premium of eth all the apps that compose the superstructure have mass that weighs upon ether the weight that ether bears in supporting the superstructure is reflected in the us dollar price the normal force on each the higher the weight of the superstructure the more load it bears on ether this reads like a stressful scenario but i assure you it's actually awesome the collective weight of the ethereum superstructure is a measure for its demand for ether a superstructure that has zero east locked inside of it is weightless and meaningless a superstructure that has 3.2 million ether in its system is a system that pulls 3.2 of ether off the secondary market and drives 3.2 million ether worth of scarcity and demand currently the weight of the ethereum superstructure is 3.2 million each in order to support the weight of the ethereum ether ethereum superstructure the ether price must increase the superstructure represents gravitational pull on the supply of eth the collective incentive for each people to deposit eth inside of it the superstructure is a general structure ether as the native asset of this superstructure is accepted as a currency everywhere inside of this superstructure money is the good that is the most saleable the asset that is accepted everywhere and everywhere anywhere and everywhere for the least amount of slippage is what money is inside this superstructure eth is money because all roads lead to ether there will never be any other asset that is the most saleable and liquid asset in ethereum as the native asset of ethereum it is destined to be money for the ecosystem the weight of the superstructure on the market price of eth is what creates the monetary premium of ether the superstructure is a general structure and the collective weight of ethereum apps generally creates a generalized positive price pressure on ether generalized positive price pressure is basically a synonym for monetary premium summary ethereum is a superstructure of composed financial applications all applications on ethereum create surface area for new applications to build off of which in turn creates further surface area rather than leaching value applications that build together are value generative applications that build on others act as funnels for the applications below them applications that produce large surface areas create their own landscape for other applications to leverage and build off of the larger the surface area the more room there is to use the internal financial ecosystem of ethereum exhibits chaotic organization the gravitational pull generated from each application is the mechanism for how disparate degree components organize any efficient and effective manners and generate a single efficient superstructure each application in the structure has mass and weighs upon the applications below it the lower applications are foundation foundational to the ones above them they bear the load and also receive their share ether is the fundamental particle of the ethereum universe the native asset that produces the mass of ethereum the market cap of ether is the weight of its mass its influence upon the world outside of it the ethan d phi is the measure of the total mass of the ethereum superstructure at the beginning of this article we discussed how money is the emergent product of markets markets are the places of exchange and exchange is the most efficient is most efficient with money markets create the money ethereum is a platform for markets all significant defy applications maker compound uniswap auger dydx are all market applications these market generating applications all need a money to function ether as the native currency of ethereum is the most obvious choice its holders want applications that use it as money so that the holders can use it as money this creates a perpetual energy out of the ongoing incentive to use ether as money this structure can construct the structure constructs itself that is the end of this article the end of the three of three articles that i am stitching together into one big article so again please check out my git coin grant about this subject follow me on twitter at trustless state subscribe to the bankless youtube account subscribe to the bank list podcast give this video a thumbs up do all the things that youtubers say i guess i'm a youtuber now but yeah thanks for listening and thanks for bearing with me
